# Attack Surface Analysis for google/ksp

## Attack Surface: [1. Malicious Processor Execution](./attack_surfaces/1__malicious_processor_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Arbitrary code execution within the build process via a compromised or malicious KSP processor.  This is the most direct and severe threat.
    *   **How KSP Contributes:** KSP's *fundamental purpose* is to execute code (processors) during compilation. This is the direct mechanism of attack.
    *   **Example:** An attacker compromises a KSP processor library on a public repository. Projects using it unknowingly execute the attacker's code during builds.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete compromise of the build environment.
        *   Injection of malicious code into the compiled application.
        *   Exfiltration of secrets, source code, etc.
        *   Lateral movement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Dependency Management:** Use dependency locking (e.g., Gradle's) to ensure only known, verified processor versions are used.
        *   **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities and updates.
        *   **Private Repositories:** Use a private repository with strict access controls for KSP processor dependencies.
        *   **Build Environment Isolation:** Run builds in isolated environments (containers, VMs).
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run build processes with minimal necessary privileges (never as root/admin).
        *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review build configuration and dependency changes, especially new KSP processors.

## Attack Surface: [2. Input-Driven Code Generation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/2__input-driven_code_generation_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the *generated* code resulting from a KSP processor's handling of (potentially malicious) input. This is a direct consequence of KSP's code generation.
    *   **How KSP Contributes:** KSP processors *directly* generate code based on input. Flawed input handling *directly* creates vulnerabilities in the output.
    *   **Example:** A KSP processor generates SQL queries from class names. A malicious class name like `"; DROP TABLE Users; --"` leads to SQL injection in the *generated* code.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Security vulnerabilities in the final application (SQL injection, XSS, command injection, etc.).
        *   Data breaches, data corruption, application compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Processor Author Responsibility:** Processor authors *must* treat all input as untrusted and perform rigorous validation/sanitization.
        *   **Review Generated Code:** Developers *must* review the code generated by KSP processors, treating it as manually written.
        *   **Static Analysis of Generated Code:** Use static analysis tools on the *generated* code.
        *   **Fuzzing of Processors:** Consider fuzzing KSP processors to find vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [3. Logic Errors in Code Generation](./attack_surfaces/3__logic_errors_in_code_generation.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs in a KSP processor's logic lead to the generation of incorrect or subtly vulnerable code.
    *   **How KSP Contributes:** KSP processors are complex pieces of software.  Bugs in their logic can translate directly into bugs in the generated code, which may not be immediately obvious.
    *   **Example:** A processor intended to generate secure password hashing code has a subtle flaw that weakens the hashing algorithm.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Introduction of subtle security vulnerabilities in the application.
        *   Difficult-to-detect bugs that could be exploited later.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thorough Processor Testing:** Processor authors should thoroughly test their processors, including unit tests, integration tests, and security tests.
        *   **Code Review of Generated Code:** Developers *must* review the generated code carefully, looking for potential logic errors.
        *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools on both the processor code and the generated code.
