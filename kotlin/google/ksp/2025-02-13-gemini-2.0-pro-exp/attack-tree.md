## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1: Craft malicious symbol data (Code Injection via Unvalidated Input)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1_craft_malicious_symbol_data__code_injection_via_unvalidated_input_.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker crafts malicious input to the KSP processor in the form of specially constructed symbol data (e.g., class names, annotation values, method names, etc.).  This input is designed to exploit a lack of input validation within the processor's code that handles the `CodeGenerator`. When the processor processes this malicious input, it generates code that includes the attacker's payload.
*   **Example:**
    *   The processor generates a class with a name derived directly from a user-provided annotation value.  The attacker provides an annotation value like: `MyClass"; System.exit(1); //`.  If the processor doesn't sanitize this input, the generated code might become: `class MyClass"; System.exit(1); // { ... }`, causing the build to terminate (or worse, execute arbitrary code).
    *   Another example could involve injecting code into generated logging statements, error messages, or other parts of the generated code that are not intended to be executable.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Hard without thorough code review)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.2: Exploit string formatting vulnerabilities (Code Injection via String Formatting)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_2_exploit_string_formatting_vulnerabilities__code_injection_via_string_formatting_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how the KSP processor uses string formatting functions (like `String.format` in Java/Kotlin) to generate code. If the processor uses user-controlled input (e.g., symbol data) directly within the format string, the attacker can inject malicious code.
*   **Example:**
    *   The processor uses `String.format("val x = %s", userInput)` to generate code, where `userInput` comes from an annotation value.  The attacker provides a value like `0; Runtime.getRuntime().exec("malicious_command"); //`.  This would result in the generated code: `val x = 0; Runtime.getRuntime().exec("malicious_command"); //`, executing the attacker's command.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Static analysis can often detect this)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3.1: Craft malicious symbol data (Path Traversal)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_1_craft_malicious_symbol_data__path_traversal_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts malicious symbol data (e.g., a class name) that, when used to construct the output file path for generated code, results in writing the file outside the intended directory. This could overwrite system files, build scripts, or other critical files.
*   **Example:**
    *   The processor uses the class name directly to create the file path: `generatedSourcesDir + className + ".kt"`.  The attacker provides a class name like `../../../../etc/passwd`.  If the processor doesn't sanitize the class name, it might attempt to write to `/etc/passwd` (on a Unix-like system), potentially overwriting the system's password file.
    *   Another example could involve writing to a directory that is later executed as part of the build process, injecting malicious code into the build pipeline.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Hard without file system monitoring)

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1: Exploit Misconfigured Processor Options](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_1_exploit_misconfigured_processor_options.md)

*   **Description:**  The KSP processor accepts configuration options (e.g., through annotations, environment variables, or build system properties).  The attacker exploits insecure default settings or provides malicious configuration values to enable harmful behavior within the processor.
*   **Example:**
    *   The processor has a configuration option `enableDangerousFeature=false` by default.  The attacker sets this option to `true` through an environment variable, enabling a feature that allows the processor to execute arbitrary system commands.
    *   The processor has a configuration option to specify a template file for code generation. The attacker provides a path to a malicious template file that contains code to exfiltrate data or execute commands.
    *   The processor might have an option to disable certain security checks. The attacker could enable this option to bypass input validation or other safeguards.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires configuration review)
