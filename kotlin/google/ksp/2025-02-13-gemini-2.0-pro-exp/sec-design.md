# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a simplified compiler plugin API for Kotlin, reducing the learning curve and maintenance effort compared to traditional compiler plugins.
*   Improve build performance by minimizing code generation and leveraging incremental compilation.
*   Enable cross-platform development by supporting Kotlin/JVM, Kotlin/JS, and Kotlin/Native.
*   Offer a stable and well-maintained API, ensuring compatibility with future Kotlin compiler versions.
*   Facilitate the development of code analysis, code generation, and other compiler-related tools.

Business Risks:

*   Incompatibility with future Kotlin compiler versions, breaking existing plugins.
*   Performance issues arising from inefficient plugin implementations or API limitations.
*   Security vulnerabilities introduced by malicious or poorly written plugins.
*   Limited adoption due to lack of awareness or perceived complexity.
*   Competition from alternative solutions or built-in compiler features.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: KSP is designed to operate within the secure sandbox of the Kotlin compiler. It does not have direct access to the file system or network, except what's provided by the compiler. (Described in KSP documentation and source code).
*   security control: KSP leverages the Kotlin compiler's existing security mechanisms for parsing and type checking, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities related to input handling. (Described in KSP documentation and source code).
*   security control: Code generated by KSP is subject to the same security checks and compilation processes as regular Kotlin code. (Described in KSP documentation and source code).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: KSP plugins, being user-provided code, can potentially introduce security vulnerabilities if not carefully developed and reviewed.
*   accepted risk: Bugs or limitations in the KSP API could potentially be exploited to compromise the build process or generate malicious code.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a mechanism for signing and verifying KSP plugins to ensure their authenticity and integrity.
*   security control: Provide guidelines and tools for developers to perform security reviews of their KSP plugins.
*   security control: Consider sandboxing the execution of KSP plugins further, limiting their access to compiler internals and resources.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable to KSP itself, as it operates within the context of the build system. However, any external services or resources accessed by KSP plugins should implement appropriate authentication mechanisms.
*   Authorization: KSP plugins should operate with the least privilege necessary to perform their tasks. The API should restrict access to sensitive compiler features and data.
*   Input Validation: KSP should validate the input it receives from the compiler and from user-provided configurations to prevent injection attacks or other vulnerabilities.
*   Cryptography: If KSP plugins handle sensitive data, they should use appropriate cryptographic techniques for storage and transmission. KSP itself does not inherently require cryptography, but plugins might.

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer writes code in an IDE and commits it to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
2.  The commit triggers a CI system (e.g., GitHub Actions).
3.  The CI system runs a build script.
4.  The build process fetches dependencies from a dependency repository (e.g., Maven Central).
5.  The build process compiles the code using the Kotlin compiler.
6.  The Kotlin compiler invokes KSP.
7.  KSP runs the configured KSP plugins.
8.  KSP plugins generate code.
9.  The build process runs SAST tools and linters to check for security vulnerabilities and code quality issues.
10. The build process packages the compiled code and generated code into build artifacts (e.g., JAR, KSP Plugin).
11. The build artifacts are published to an artifact repository (e.g., Maven Central).

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   Dependency Verification: The build system should verify the integrity of dependencies using checksums or signatures.
*   SAST (Static Application Security Testing): SAST tools should be integrated into the build process to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
*   Linters: Linters should be used to enforce coding standards and identify potential code quality issues.
*   Secure Build Environment: The CI system should run in a secure environment with limited access and permissions.
*   Artifact Signing: Build artifacts should be signed to ensure their authenticity and integrity.
*   Supply Chain Security: Measures should be taken to secure the entire software supply chain, from code commit to artifact deployment.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Compilation of Kotlin code: KSP is deeply integrated with the Kotlin compilation process. Any failure or vulnerability in KSP can directly impact the ability to build Kotlin applications.
*   Code Generation: KSP is used for code generation, which is a critical part of many development workflows. Incorrect or malicious code generation can lead to application defects or security vulnerabilities.
*   Plugin Ecosystem: KSP enables a plugin ecosystem. The security and reliability of these plugins are crucial for the overall health of the KSP ecosystem.

Data Sensitivity:

*   Source Code: KSP processes Kotlin source code, which may contain sensitive business logic, intellectual property, or security-related information. The sensitivity level depends on the specific project.
*   Generated Code: The code generated by KSP may also contain sensitive information, depending on the nature of the plugin and the input code.
*   Compiler Symbols: KSP has access to compiler symbols, which represent the structure and types of the code. While not directly user data, this information could potentially be used to infer sensitive details about the application.
*   Build Artifacts: KSP plugins and the resulting build artifacts (JARs, etc.) are not typically considered to contain *user* data. However, they could contain proprietary code or be targets for supply chain attacks.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific types of Kotlin projects will be using KSP (e.g., Android, backend, multiplatform)? This will influence the deployment and security considerations.
*   What is the expected level of expertise of developers writing KSP plugins? This will impact the need for security guidelines and training.
*   Are there any specific regulatory or compliance requirements that need to be considered?
*   What is the process for reviewing and approving KSP plugins before they are used in production builds?
*   What mechanisms are in place to monitor the performance and security of KSP plugins during runtime?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a stable and efficient API for Kotlin compiler plugins, prioritizing developer productivity and build performance.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The Kotlin compiler and build system provide a baseline level of security. KSP plugins are assumed to be potentially untrusted and require careful review.
*   DESIGN: The Gradle plugin is the primary deployment mechanism. The build process includes standard security checks like SAST and linters. The CI system is assumed to be securely configured.
