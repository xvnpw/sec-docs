Okay, let's perform a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path (1.1.3.1: Craft malicious symbol data (Path Traversal)) related to the Google KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing) library.

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.3.1: Craft Malicious Symbol Data (Path Traversal)

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the vulnerabilities associated with crafting malicious symbol data in KSP, specifically focusing on path traversal attacks.  We aim to identify:

*   How this vulnerability can be exploited.
*   The potential impact of a successful exploit.
*   Specific mitigation strategies and best practices to prevent this attack.
*   Detection methods to identify attempts or successful exploits.
*   Areas in KSP's design or common usage patterns that might be particularly susceptible.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on the attack vector described as "Craft malicious symbol data (Path Traversal)" within the context of KSP.  We will consider:

*   KSP's API for handling symbol data (class names, file names, etc.).
*   Common patterns in KSP processor implementations that might be vulnerable.
*   The interaction between KSP and the Kotlin compiler.
*   The file system access performed by KSP processors.
*   The build environment in which KSP operates (e.g., Gradle, Maven).

We will *not* cover other potential attack vectors against KSP, such as denial-of-service attacks or vulnerabilities in the Kotlin compiler itself, except where they directly relate to this specific path traversal vulnerability.

**Methodology:**

We will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will examine the KSP source code (available on GitHub) to understand how it handles symbol data and file paths.  We'll look for areas where user-provided input (symbol names) is used to construct file paths without proper sanitization.
2.  **Vulnerability Research:** We will search for existing reports of similar vulnerabilities in other code generation tools or annotation processors.  This will help us understand common pitfalls and attack patterns.
3.  **Hypothetical Exploit Development:** We will construct hypothetical exploit scenarios to demonstrate how this vulnerability could be exploited in practice.  This will involve creating a simple, vulnerable KSP processor and crafting malicious input to trigger the path traversal.
4.  **Mitigation Analysis:** We will analyze potential mitigation strategies, including input validation, output path sanitization, and secure coding practices.  We will evaluate the effectiveness and practicality of each mitigation.
5.  **Detection Strategy Development:** We will explore methods for detecting attempts to exploit this vulnerability, including static analysis, dynamic analysis, and file system monitoring.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

**2.1. Vulnerability Mechanism:**

The core vulnerability lies in the potential for a KSP processor to use unsanitized symbol data (primarily class names, but potentially also package names, function names, or other identifiers) directly in the construction of output file paths.  If a processor uses a pattern like:

```kotlin
val outputFilePath = File(generatedSourcesDir, className + ".kt")
outputFilePath.writeText(generatedCode)
```

without any validation or sanitization of `className`, an attacker can inject path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\`) into the `className`.

**2.2. Exploitation Scenarios:**

*   **Overwriting System Files:** As described in the original attack tree, an attacker could provide a class name like `../../../../etc/passwd` (on a Unix-like system) or `..\..\..\Windows\System32\config\SAM` (on Windows) to attempt to overwrite critical system files.  This could lead to system instability, denial of service, or even privilege escalation.

*   **Overwriting Build Scripts:** An attacker could target build scripts (e.g., `build.gradle.kts`, `pom.xml`) to inject malicious code that would be executed during subsequent builds.  This could allow the attacker to compromise the entire build pipeline and potentially gain control of the build server.

*   **Writing to Arbitrary Locations:**  Even if the attacker doesn't overwrite a critical file, they could write to arbitrary locations within the file system.  This could be used to:
    *   Create hidden files or directories.
    *   Exfiltrate data by writing it to a publicly accessible location.
    *   Disrupt the build process by writing to unexpected locations.
    *   Write to a location that is later executed, such as a `.jar` file in a classpath.

*   **Bypassing Security Restrictions:** If the KSP processor is running with elevated privileges (e.g., as part of a CI/CD pipeline), the attacker could potentially bypass security restrictions that would normally prevent access to certain files or directories.

**2.3. KSP-Specific Considerations:**

*   **`CodeGenerator` API:** KSP's `CodeGenerator` interface is the primary mechanism for creating new files.  We need to examine how `CodeGenerator.createNewFile()` handles file paths and whether it performs any sanitization.  Specifically, the `dependencies` parameter and how it interacts with the `packageName` and `fileName` is crucial.
*   **`Resolver` API:** The `Resolver` provides access to symbol information.  We need to understand how the `Resolver` obtains this information and whether it performs any validation.  For example, does it check for invalid characters in class names?
*   **Common Processor Patterns:** Many KSP processors follow a pattern of generating code based on annotations.  We need to identify common patterns in how processors extract information from annotations and use it to construct file paths.
* **Incremental Processing:** KSP supports incremental processing. We need to check if incremental processing can be abused to overwrite files that were created in previous compilation rounds.

**2.4. Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Input Validation:**
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Characters:**  The most robust approach is to strictly whitelist the characters allowed in class names and other symbol data used in file path construction.  This should typically be limited to alphanumeric characters, underscores, and possibly dots (for package separators).
    *   **Reject Path Traversal Sequences:**  Explicitly reject any input containing `../`, `..\`, or other path traversal sequences.  This should be done *before* any other processing.
    *   **Normalize Paths:** Use a library function (e.g., `java.nio.file.Paths.get(path).normalize()`) to normalize the file path *before* creating the file.  This will resolve any relative path components and prevent traversal.

*   **Output Path Sanitization:**
    *   **Confine Output to a Dedicated Directory:**  Ensure that all generated files are written to a dedicated, sandboxed directory.  This directory should have restricted permissions to prevent unauthorized access.
    *   **Use a Fixed Base Path:**  Always construct output file paths relative to a fixed, trusted base path.  Never allow the base path to be influenced by user input.
    *   **Canonicalize Paths:** Before writing to a file, obtain the canonical path (e.g., using `File.getCanonicalPath()`) and verify that it starts with the expected base path. This is a final check after normalization.

*   **Secure Coding Practices:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run the KSP processor with the minimum necessary privileges.  Avoid running it as root or with administrator privileges.
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Conduct thorough code reviews of KSP processor implementations, paying close attention to file path handling.
    *   **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools to automatically detect potential path traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   **Fuzzing:** Consider fuzzing the KSP processor with a variety of malicious inputs to identify potential vulnerabilities.

* **KSP API Usage:**
    * Use `CodeGenerator.createNewFileByPath` with `Dependencies(false, ...)` and provide a fully resolved `Path` object. This gives the processor full control over the output path and avoids relying on KSP's internal path handling.

**2.5. Detection Strategies:**

*   **Static Analysis:**
    *   **CodeQL:** Use CodeQL or similar tools to create queries that identify code patterns where symbol data is used to construct file paths without proper sanitization.
    *   **Custom Static Analysis Rules:** Develop custom static analysis rules for your IDE or build system to flag potentially vulnerable code.

*   **Dynamic Analysis:**
    *   **File System Monitoring:** Monitor file system activity during the build process to detect attempts to write to unexpected locations. Tools like `inotify` (Linux), `FSEvents` (macOS), or `ReadDirectoryChangesW` (Windows) can be used for this purpose.
    *   **Security Auditing Tools:** Use security auditing tools to monitor file system access and identify potential anomalies.

*   **Build System Integration:**
    *   **Gradle/Maven Plugins:** Develop Gradle or Maven plugins that automatically scan KSP processor code for vulnerabilities.
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline Integration:** Integrate vulnerability detection into your CI/CD pipeline to prevent vulnerable code from being deployed.

* **Runtime Monitoring (Less Practical):** While less practical in a build-time tool, if KSP were used in a runtime context, sandboxing and system call monitoring could be used.

**2.6. Hypothetical Exploit (Illustrative):**

Let's imagine a simplified, vulnerable KSP processor:

```kotlin
class VulnerableProcessor : SymbolProcessor {
    override fun process(resolver: Resolver): List<KSAnnotated> {
        val annotatedClasses = resolver.getSymbolsWithAnnotation("com.example.GenerateFile")
        annotatedClasses.filterIsInstance<KSClassDeclaration>().forEach { classDeclaration ->
            val className = classDeclaration.simpleName.asString()
            val generatedCode = "// Some generated code"
            val outputFile = File("generated", "$className.kt") // VULNERABLE!
            outputFile.writeText(generatedCode)
        }
        return emptyList()
    }
}
```

An attacker could create a class like this:

```kotlin
@com.example.GenerateFile
class "../../../../../tmp/evil" { }
```

This would cause the processor to attempt to write to `/tmp/evil.kt`, potentially succeeding if the build process has write permissions to that directory. A more sophisticated attack would target a more sensitive location.

### 3. Conclusion

The "Craft malicious symbol data (Path Traversal)" attack vector in KSP is a serious vulnerability that can have a very high impact.  By understanding the vulnerability mechanism, exploitation scenarios, and mitigation strategies, developers can write secure KSP processors and prevent this type of attack.  A combination of input validation, output path sanitization, secure coding practices, and detection strategies is essential to ensure the security of KSP-based applications.  The most effective mitigation is to use `CodeGenerator.createNewFileByPath` with a fully resolved `Path` object, giving the processor complete control over the output location and preventing any reliance on KSP's internal (and potentially less secure) path handling.
