## Mitigation Strategy: [Strictly Control KSP Processor Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/strictly_control_ksp_processor_dependencies.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Strictly Control KSP Processor Dependencies

Here are mitigation strategies that directly involve Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP), focusing on threats introduced by KSP itself.

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Create a centralized list of approved KSP processors. This list should be maintained and accessible to all developers.
    *   Step 2: Define a process for requesting and approving new KSP processors. This process should involve security review and justification for the new dependency *specifically focusing on the processor's code and potential actions during annotation processing*.
    *   Step 3: Integrate the approved list into the build system. Configure dependency management tools (like Gradle) to only allow dependencies from the approved list *when resolving KSP processor dependencies*.
    *   Step 4: Regularly review and update the approved list, removing outdated or insecure processors and adding new vetted ones as needed, *re-evaluating processors in the context of KSP specific risks*.
    *   Step 5: Educate developers about the importance of using only approved processors and the process for requesting new ones, *emphasizing the unique security considerations of KSP processors*.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Processor Injection:** - Severity: **High**.  An attacker could introduce a malicious KSP processor as a dependency to inject malicious code into the application *during KSP annotation processing and code generation*.
    *   **Vulnerable Processor Dependency:** - Severity: **Medium**. Using an outdated or vulnerable KSP processor dependency can introduce vulnerabilities into the build process or generated code *specifically through flaws in the processor's logic or generated output*.
    *   **Supply Chain Attack via Processor:** - Severity: **High**. Compromised or malicious upstream processor repositories could be used to distribute malicious processors *that execute during KSP processing*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Malicious Processor Injection: **High Reduction**. Significantly reduces the risk by preventing the introduction of unvetted processors *into the KSP processing pipeline*.
    *   Vulnerable Processor Dependency: **Medium Reduction**. Reduces risk by focusing on approved and presumably more secure processors, but regular auditing is still needed *to catch vulnerabilities in even approved processors*.
    *   Supply Chain Attack via Processor: **Medium Reduction**. Reduces risk by limiting the sources of processors and implementing a review process, but doesn't eliminate the risk entirely if approved sources are compromised *at the processor level*.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have a general dependency review process, but it's not specifically tailored for KSP processors and doesn't have a formal "approved list" *for KSP processors specifically*. Dependency management is handled by Gradle.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Formal "approved list" of KSP processors, specific security review process for KSP processors *focusing on processor code and actions*, integration of the approved list into the build system to enforce its use *for KSP processor dependencies*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Conduct Security Code Reviews of Custom KSP Processors](./mitigation_strategies/conduct_security_code_reviews_of_custom_ksp_processors.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Conduct Security Code Reviews of Custom KSP Processors

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Establish a mandatory security code review process for all custom KSP processors developed in-house.
    *   Step 2: Train developers on secure coding practices for KSP processors, focusing on common vulnerabilities like code injection *in generated code*, insecure data handling *within the processor*, and resource exhaustion *during processing*.
    *   Step 3: Assign security-conscious developers or security experts to conduct code reviews of custom processors.
    *   Step 4: During code reviews, specifically look for potential security vulnerabilities in the processor logic, code generation, and data handling *within the KSP processor itself*.
    *   Step 5: Use code review checklists or guidelines tailored for KSP processor security.
    *   Step 6: Document the code review process and findings, and ensure that identified security issues are addressed before the processor is deployed *and used in builds*.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Custom Processor Logic:** - Severity: **High**.  Custom processors might contain vulnerabilities in their logic that could be exploited *during KSP processing* or in the generated code.
    *   **Insecure Code Generation:** - Severity: **High**. Custom processors might generate insecure code if not carefully designed and implemented *in their code generation logic*.
    *   **Data Handling Vulnerabilities in Processors:** - Severity: **Medium**. Processors might mishandle sensitive data during processing, leading to information leaks or other vulnerabilities *within the processor's execution context*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Vulnerabilities in Custom Processor Logic: **High Reduction**.  Significantly reduces the risk by proactively identifying and fixing vulnerabilities in processor code *before it's used in builds*.
    *   Insecure Code Generation: **High Reduction**.  Helps ensure that generated code is secure by reviewing the generation logic *within the processor*.
    *   Data Handling Vulnerabilities in Processors: **Medium Reduction**. Improves data handling security within processors, but depends on the thoroughness of the review *of the processor code*.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have general code review practices, but not specifically focused on security aspects of custom KSP processors, and no dedicated security expertise is consistently involved in processor reviews *specifically for KSP processors*.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Mandatory security code reviews for custom KSP processors, security-focused training for processor developers *on KSP specific security concerns*, security code review checklists for KSP processors, dedicated security expertise in processor reviews *for KSP processors*.

### Mitigation Strategy: Static Analysis of KSP Processor Code

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Select and integrate a static analysis tool that can analyze Kotlin code, including KSP processors. Tools like SonarQube, Detekt, or specialized security-focused static analyzers can be used *to scan processor code*.
    *   Step 2: Configure the static analysis tool to scan custom KSP processor code for potential security vulnerabilities and coding best practices violations *within the processor implementation*.
    *   Step 3: Integrate the static analysis tool into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan processor code during builds *or processor development phase*.
    *   Step 4: Set up alerts and notifications for detected security issues *in processor code*.
    *   Step 5: Establish a process for reviewing and addressing static analysis findings *related to processors*.
    *   Step 6: Regularly update the static analysis tool and its rules to ensure it remains effective against new vulnerabilities *in processor code*.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**

    *   **Coding Best Practices Violations:** - Severity: **Low**.  Static analysis can enforce coding standards and best practices *in processor code*, indirectly improving security.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Vulnerabilities in Custom Processor Logic: **Medium Reduction**. Reduces the risk by automatically detecting many common vulnerabilities *in processor code*, but might not catch all types of security flaws.
    *   Insecure Code Generation Patterns: **Medium Reduction**. Helps identify and prevent insecure code generation patterns *in processors*, but might require custom rules for KSP-specific issues.
    *   Coding Best Practices Violations: **Low Reduction**.  Indirectly improves security by promoting better code quality *in processors*.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We use SonarQube for general static analysis, but it might not be specifically configured or optimized for KSP processor code and security vulnerabilities *within processors*.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Specific configuration of static analysis tools for KSP processor security, integration of static analysis results into the build failure criteria *for processor code issues*, process for reviewing and addressing static analysis findings for processors.

    *   Step 2: Establish baseline execution times for KSP processors under normal conditions.
    *   Step 3: Set up alerts or notifications if processor execution times significantly deviate from the baseline or exceed predefined thresholds *for KSP processor tasks*.
    *   Step 4: Investigate any alerts related to unusually long processor execution times to determine the cause (e.g., malicious processor, performance issue, configuration problem *related to KSP processing*).
    *   Step 5: Regularly review and adjust baseline execution times and thresholds as the project evolves and processor usage changes *for KSP processors*.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Processor Activity Detection:** - Severity: **Medium**.  Malicious processors might exhibit unusual behavior, including significantly longer execution times compared to legitimate processors *during KSP processing*.

### Mitigation Strategy: Implement Timeouts for KSP Processor Tasks

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Configure timeouts for KSP processor tasks within the build system. This might involve setting timeouts in Gradle build scripts or CI/CD pipeline configurations *specifically for KSP processor execution*.
    *   Step 2: Set reasonable timeout values based on the expected execution time of KSP processors in the project, allowing sufficient time for normal processing but preventing indefinite hangs *of KSP processor tasks*.
    *   Step 3: Ensure that build processes are configured to automatically terminate KSP processor tasks that exceed the defined timeouts.
    *   Step 4: Implement logging and error handling to capture timeout events and provide informative error messages to developers *when KSP processor tasks timeout*.
    *   Step 5: Regularly review and adjust timeout values as needed based on project changes and processor performance *of KSP processors*.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Malicious Processor:** - Severity: **Medium**. A malicious processor could be designed to hang indefinitely, causing the build process to stall and leading to a denial of service *due to a stuck KSP processor*.
    *   **Build Process Hangs due to Processor Errors:** - Severity: **Low**.  Non-malicious but buggy processors could also cause build processes to hang indefinitely due to errors or infinite loops *within KSP processor code*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) via Malicious Processor: **Medium Reduction**. Prevents complete build process stalls caused by malicious processors by enforcing timeouts *on KSP processor tasks*.
    *   Build Process Hangs due to Processor Errors: **Medium Reduction**. Improves build stability and reliability by preventing hangs caused by buggy processors *during KSP processing*.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have general build timeouts in our CI/CD pipeline, but not specifically configured for individual KSP processor tasks.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Specific timeout configurations for KSP processor tasks, logging and error handling for processor timeouts *of KSP tasks*, review and adjustment of timeout values *for KSP processors*.
