# Threat Model Analysis for google/ksp

## Threat: [Malicious KSP Processor Injection](./threats/malicious_ksp_processor_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker, acting as a rogue developer or through a compromised developer account, creates and introduces a KSP processor specifically designed to inject malicious code into the application during the compilation process. This malicious processor could modify generated code to include backdoors, exfiltrate data, or introduce vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** **Critical**. Complete compromise of the application. Successful injection grants the attacker full control, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, and severe reputational damage.

**KSP Component Affected:** KSP Processor (specifically the processor's `process` function and code generation logic).

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strict Code Review:** Implement mandatory and in-depth code reviews for all KSP processors, with a strong focus on security implications and the logic of code generation.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Restrict developer access to KSP processor development and deployment, granting only necessary permissions.
*   **Static Analysis:** Employ static analysis tools to automatically scan KSP processor code for potential vulnerabilities, malicious patterns, and deviations from secure coding practices.
*   **Input Validation in Processor:** If the KSP processor accepts external input that influences code generation, rigorously validate and sanitize this input within the processor to prevent injection attacks during code generation.
*   **Trusted Development Environment:** Ensure a secure and hardened development environment to prevent unauthorized modification or substitution of KSP processors.

## Threat: [Vulnerable KSP Processor Logic](./threats/vulnerable_ksp_processor_logic.md)

**Description:** Due to coding errors, oversights, or insufficient security awareness, a KSP processor is developed with flawed logic that inadvertently generates vulnerable application code. This could manifest as incorrect data handling, logic flaws in generated business logic, or failure to sanitize data, leading to injection points in the final application.

**Impact:** **High**. Introduction of significant vulnerabilities into the application. Depending on the nature of the vulnerability (e.g., logic flaws, data corruption, injection vulnerabilities), attackers could exploit these to gain unauthorized access, manipulate critical data, or cause substantial service disruption.

**KSP Component Affected:** KSP Processor (specifically the processor's `process` function and code generation logic).

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Rigorous Testing:** Implement comprehensive testing strategies for KSP processors, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Focus on verifying the correctness and security of the generated code across a wide range of scenarios and edge cases.
*   **Fuzzing:** Utilize fuzzing techniques to test KSP processors with unexpected, malformed, or boundary-case inputs. This helps uncover potential logic errors and vulnerabilities in the code generation process that might not be apparent through standard testing.
*   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews of KSP processors by multiple experienced developers, specifically looking for potential logic flaws, security vulnerabilities, and deviations from secure coding guidelines.
*   **Clear Documentation:** Maintain clear, comprehensive, and up-to-date documentation of the KSP processor's logic, input expectations, and the behavior of the generated code. This facilitates understanding, testing, and future maintenance.

## Threat: [Malicious KSP Plugin Injection via Compromised Build Environment](./threats/malicious_ksp_plugin_injection_via_compromised_build_environment.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control of the development or build environment and leverages this access to inject a malicious KSP plugin into the project's build configuration. This malicious plugin, when executed as part of the compilation process, can inject arbitrary malicious code directly into the application being built.

**Impact:** **Critical**. Complete compromise of the application. Similar to malicious processor injection, this threat allows attackers to gain full control over the build process and inject any code they desire, leading to severe security breaches.

**KSP Component Affected:** Build System (build scripts, plugin management). KSP Plugin mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure Build Environments:** Implement robust security measures to harden development and build environments. This includes strong access controls, multi-factor authentication, regular security patching, and intrusion detection systems.
*   **Environment Monitoring:** Continuously monitor build environments for suspicious activities, unauthorized modifications to build configurations, and unexpected processes.
*   **Immutable Infrastructure:** Consider adopting immutable infrastructure principles for build environments to minimize the attack surface and prevent persistent compromises. Rebuild environments from a known secure state regularly.
*   **Code Signing for Plugins:** Implement code signing for KSP plugins to ensure their integrity and verify their origin. Only allow execution of plugins with valid signatures from trusted sources.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion/Substitution for KSP Plugins](./threats/dependency_confusionsubstitution_for_ksp_plugins.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits dependency confusion vulnerabilities by uploading a malicious KSP plugin to a public repository using the same name as a legitimate, internally used plugin. If the build system is not properly configured to prioritize internal repositories or lacks sufficient dependency verification, it might mistakenly download and utilize the attacker's malicious plugin instead of the intended legitimate one.

**Impact:** **High**. Execution of malicious code during compilation. Successful substitution allows attackers to inject malicious code into the application through a seemingly legitimate plugin, compromising the build process and the final application.

**KSP Component Affected:** Build System (dependency resolution, plugin management). KSP Plugin mechanism. Dependency Repositories.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Private Repositories:** Prioritize the use of private or highly trusted repositories for KSP plugins. Implement strict access controls and ensure the integrity of plugins stored in these repositories.
*   **Dependency Verification:** Implement robust dependency verification mechanisms within the build system. This includes verifying checksums, signatures, and ensuring plugins are downloaded from explicitly trusted sources.
*   **Explicit Plugin Configuration:** Configure build systems to explicitly specify plugin repositories and versions in build configurations. This reduces ambiguity and minimizes the risk of accidentally pulling plugins from unintended sources.
*   **Repository Priority Configuration:** Configure build systems to prioritize private or trusted repositories over public ones in dependency resolution order.

## Threat: [Injection Vulnerabilities in Generated Code (Indirectly through Processor)](./threats/injection_vulnerabilities_in_generated_code__indirectly_through_processor_.md)

**Description:** A KSP processor, due to insufficient attention to security during development, generates code that is vulnerable to injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, path traversal). This occurs when the processor fails to properly sanitize or validate inputs that are incorporated into the generated code. Attackers can then exploit these injection points by providing malicious input to the application at runtime.

**Impact:** **High**. Introduction of injection vulnerabilities into the application. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server, access or modify sensitive data, or gain unauthorized control over application functionality.

**KSP Component Affected:** Generated Code (vulnerable code indirectly created by KSP Processor). KSP Processor (input handling and code generation logic responsible for the vulnerability).

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure Code Generation Practices:** Mandate and enforce secure code generation practices within KSP processor development. This includes always using parameterized queries, proper output encoding, and robust input validation in the generated code.
*   **Input Sanitization in Processor:** If the KSP processor takes external input that influences code generation, rigorously sanitize and validate this input *within the processor itself* before using it to generate code. This prevents the processor from inadvertently generating vulnerable code based on malicious input.
*   **Static Analysis of Generated Code:** Apply static analysis tools specifically designed to detect injection vulnerabilities to the *generated code*. Treat generated code with the same level of security scrutiny as manually written code.
*   **Security Testing of Generated Code:** Include comprehensive security testing (e.g., penetration testing, vulnerability scanning) of the application, with a particular focus on areas where code is generated by KSP processors.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on KSP Processor Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_ksp_processor_dependencies.md)

**Description:** The dependencies used by KSP processors are vulnerable to supply chain attacks. An attacker compromises a dependency used by a KSP processor by injecting malicious code into it. This compromised dependency is then included in the KSP processor and subsequently propagates to the generated application code, potentially leading to widespread application compromise.

**Impact:** **Critical**. Potential for severe and widespread compromise of the application and potentially other applications using the same KSP processor or dependencies. Attackers can inject malicious code deep within the application's codebase through compromised dependencies, making detection and remediation extremely challenging.

**KSP Component Affected:** KSP Processor (dependencies). Build System (dependency management). Dependency Repositories.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Dependency Verification:** Implement robust dependency verification mechanisms to ensure the integrity and authenticity of all KSP processor dependencies. Utilize checksums, digital signatures, and other cryptographic methods to verify dependencies before use.
*   **Trusted Dependency Sources:** Rely on trusted and reputable dependency repositories. Consider using private mirrors or vendoring dependencies to reduce reliance on public repositories and gain greater control over the supply chain.
*   **Dependency Monitoring:** Continuously monitor dependency sources and repositories for any signs of suspicious activity, compromised packages, or security vulnerabilities. Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to used dependencies.
*   **Supply Chain Security Tools:** Integrate specialized supply chain security tools and practices into the development and build pipeline. These tools can help automate dependency scanning, vulnerability detection, and supply chain risk assessment.
