## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via KSP Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_ksp_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the root goal and represents the ultimate objective of the attacker. Success here means the attacker has achieved control or significant impact on the application through exploiting KSP.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit KSP Processor Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ksp_processor_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   This is a critical node because KSP processors are custom code and a direct point of interaction with the application's build process. Vulnerabilities here can lead to code injection, DoS, or information disclosure.
*   **High-Risk Path Justification:** Processors are often developed with less security scrutiny than core libraries, making them a potentially weaker link.

## Attack Tree Path: [Input Validation Flaws in Processor Logic [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/input_validation_flaws_in_processor_logic__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Processors might not properly validate inputs like annotation values or code structures.
*   **Malicious Input Data Injection [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Inject Malicious Data via Annotations [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers craft annotations with malicious payloads that are processed without proper sanitization, leading to code injection or other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Inject Malicious Data via Code Structure [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers structure Kotlin code in a way that exploits weaknesses in the processor's parsing or processing logic, leading to unintended and potentially malicious code generation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Logic Errors Leading to Code Injection [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/logic_errors_leading_to_code_injection__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Flaws in the processor's code generation logic itself can be exploited to manipulate the output code in a malicious way. This is a more subtle form of code injection where the vulnerability is in the processor's algorithm.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Processor Dependencies [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_processor_dependencies__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Critical Node Justification:** Processors rely on external libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies are common and can be easily exploited through the processor.
*   **High-Risk Path Justification:**  Dependency vulnerabilities are a well-known and frequently exploited attack vector in software development.
*   **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Processor Dependencies [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in libraries used by the KSP processor.
    *   **Identify Vulnerable Dependencies used by Processor [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers first identify vulnerable dependencies by analyzing the processor's dependencies.
    *   **Trigger Vulnerability in Dependency via Processor Execution [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers craft inputs or trigger processor actions that specifically invoke the vulnerable code paths within the identified dependency.
*   **Dependency Confusion Attack [HIGH RISK PATH]::**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers upload a malicious package to a public repository with the same name as a private dependency used by the processor, hoping the build system will mistakenly download the malicious package.
    *   **Introduce Malicious Dependency with Same Name as Processor Dependency [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers successfully introduce a malicious dependency into the build process through dependency confusion.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Build Environment to Influence KSP Execution [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_build_environment_to_influence_ksp_execution__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Critical Node Justification:** The build environment is the foundation upon which the application is built. Compromising it grants broad control.
*   **High-Risk Path Justification:**  Build environments are often complex and can have security weaknesses if not properly hardened.
*   **Compromise Build Server/Developer Machine [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the build server or a developer's machine, allowing them to manipulate the build process directly.
    *   **Gain Access to Build Server [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Build Server Infrastructure [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the build server's operating system, network services, or build tools to gain access.
    *   **Gain Access to Developer Machine [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Developer's System [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in a developer's operating system, applications, or through social engineering to gain access to their machine.
*   **Manipulate Build Scripts [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers modify build scripts (like `build.gradle.kts`) to inject malicious code or alter the build process to their advantage.
    *   **Modify Gradle Build Scripts [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Inject Malicious Code into build.gradle.kts files [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers directly modify the Gradle build scripts to include malicious tasks, dependencies, or code that will be executed during the build process, potentially compromising the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attack on KSP Plugin [CRITICAL NODE] (Less Likely for Google-Owned, but Consider Third-Party Plugins):](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attack_on_ksp_plugin__critical_node___less_likely_for_google-owned__but_consider_third-_c080babd.md)

*   **Critical Node Justification:** If using third-party plugins, a supply chain attack on a plugin can have widespread impact on all users of that plugin.
*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers compromise the repository or update mechanism of a KSP plugin to distribute a malicious version of the plugin. This is more relevant if using third-party KSP plugins, as Google-owned KSP is less likely to be targeted in this way.
