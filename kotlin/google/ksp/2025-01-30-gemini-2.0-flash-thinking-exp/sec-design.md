# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP), aims to provide a simplified API for Kotlin compiler plugins. It focuses on improving the developer experience by offering a more efficient and easier-to-use alternative to Kotlin Annotation Processing (KAPT). The primary business goal is to enhance the Kotlin ecosystem, making it more attractive for developers by enabling faster compilation, cleaner code generation, and better code analysis tools.

Business priorities:
- Improve Kotlin compilation speed and efficiency.
- Simplify the development of Kotlin compiler plugins.
- Enhance the Kotlin developer experience.
- Foster a vibrant ecosystem of Kotlin compiler plugins.

Business risks:
- Risk of adoption failure if KSP does not provide significant advantages over existing solutions like KAPT.
- Risk of performance issues if KSP introduces bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
- Risk of security vulnerabilities in KSP itself, potentially affecting all projects using it.
- Risk of compatibility issues with different Kotlin versions or build environments.
- Risk of community fragmentation if KSP and KAPT ecosystems diverge significantly.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Github repository with access control for contributors. Implemented in Github repository settings.
- security control: Version control using Git. Implemented in Github repository.
- security control: Publicly accessible repository for transparency and community contributions. Implemented in Github repository settings.
- accepted risk: Reliance on open-source community for security contributions and vulnerability reporting.
- accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to be introduced by community contributions.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by KSP.
- security control: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) tools into the build pipeline to detect potential code-level vulnerabilities.
- security control: Establish a clear process for security vulnerability reporting and response.
- security control: Perform regular security code reviews, especially for critical components and contributions from external sources.
- security control: Implement build process hardening to ensure the integrity of build artifacts.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to KSP itself as a library. Authentication is relevant for contributors to the KSP project (handled by Github).
- Authorization: Access control to the KSP Github repository and related resources. Implemented by Github repository permissions.
- Input validation: KSP processors should perform input validation on data they receive from the Kotlin compiler to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities in generated code.
- Cryptography: Not directly applicable to the core functionality of KSP. Cryptographic considerations might be relevant for specific KSP processors if they handle sensitive data, but this is outside the scope of KSP itself.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process:
- Development and distribution of Kotlin compiler plugins. KSP aims to simplify and improve this process, making it more efficient and secure. Disruption to KSP development or distribution would impact the Kotlin plugin ecosystem.
- Kotlin project builds relying on KSP. If KSP artifacts are compromised or unavailable, builds might fail, impacting developer productivity and project timelines.

Data we are trying to protect:
- KSP Source code: Publicly available, but integrity is crucial to prevent malicious modifications. Sensitivity: Public, Integrity: High.
- KSP Build artifacts (JARs, POMs): Publicly distributed, but integrity and authenticity are paramount to prevent supply chain attacks. Sensitivity: Public, Integrity: Critical, Authenticity: Critical.
- KSP Signing keys: Private keys used to sign artifacts. Confidentiality and integrity are critical to maintain trust in KSP artifacts. Sensitivity: Confidential, Integrity: Critical.
