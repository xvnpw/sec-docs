# Attack Surface Analysis for google/ksp

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Processor Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_processor_code_injection.md)

**Description:** Injection of malicious KSP processor code into the build process, leading to arbitrary code execution during compilation.

**KSP Contribution:** KSP's fundamental design involves executing external processor code, making it a direct vector if processor sources are compromised.

**Example:** A compromised dependency repository serves a malicious KSP processor instead of a legitimate one. During build, this malicious processor executes, exfiltrating secrets or injecting backdoors into the application.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of application and potentially build environment. Data breaches, supply chain attacks, backdoors, and denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict dependency verification using checksums for KSP processor dependencies.
*   Utilize private and trusted dependency repositories with robust access controls for KSP processors.
*   Harden build environments and restrict access to prevent unauthorized modification of build configurations or processor dependencies.
*   Conduct thorough security audits of the entire KSP processor supply chain.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Processors](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_processors.md)

**Description:** Security vulnerabilities introduced within developer-written custom KSP processors due to coding errors or insecure practices.

**KSP Contribution:** KSP enables custom processor development, and the security of these processors directly impacts the application's build process and potentially runtime behavior if code generation is flawed.

**Example:** A custom processor reads file paths from a configuration file without sanitization, leading to a path traversal vulnerability during compilation, allowing unauthorized file access. Another example is a processor with a deserialization vulnerability processing annotation arguments.

**Impact:** File system access vulnerabilities during compilation, information disclosure, denial of service during compilation, and potentially vulnerabilities in generated application code.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce secure coding practices for all custom KSP processor development, including input validation and output sanitization.
*   Mandatory code reviews and static analysis of custom KSP processors focusing on security vulnerabilities.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege to custom processors, limiting their access to file system and other resources.
*   Implement robust error handling and logging within custom processors to aid in debugging and security monitoring.

## Attack Surface: [Input Data Manipulation Exploiting Processor Logic](./attack_surfaces/input_data_manipulation_exploiting_processor_logic.md)

**Description:** Crafting malicious Kotlin code or annotations to exploit vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior in the logic of KSP processors.

**KSP Contribution:** KSP processors operate on user-provided Kotlin code and annotations.  Vulnerabilities in how processors handle complex or malicious input can be directly exploited through KSP's processing pipeline.

**Example:**  A processor might be vulnerable to resource exhaustion when processing excessively complex annotations. An attacker could provide Kotlin code with such annotations, causing a denial of service during compilation. Another example is manipulating annotations to bypass security checks within a processor, leading to unintended code generation.

**Impact:** Denial of service during compilation, unexpected or insecure code generation, potentially leading to runtime vulnerabilities in the application.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within KSP processors to handle unexpected or malicious Kotlin code and annotations.
*   Design processors defensively, avoiding assumptions about input structure and content, and implementing resource limits to prevent DoS.
*   Conduct fuzzing and security testing of KSP processors with a wide range of inputs, including potentially malicious ones, to identify vulnerabilities in input handling logic.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Confusion/Substitution of KSP Processors](./attack_surfaces/dependency_confusionsubstitution_of_ksp_processors.md)

**Description:** Exploiting dependency resolution weaknesses to substitute legitimate KSP processor dependencies with attacker-controlled malicious processors.

**KSP Contribution:**  If KSP processors are managed as external dependencies, they are susceptible to dependency confusion attacks, directly impacting the security of the KSP processing stage.

**Example:** An attacker publishes a malicious KSP processor with the same name as an internal, legitimate processor on a public repository.  If build configurations are not strictly controlled, the build system might download and use the malicious processor from the public repository.

**Impact:** Execution of malicious processor code, leading to data exfiltration, backdoors, and build system compromise, similar to direct malicious processor injection.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Prioritize private, internally controlled repositories for KSP processor dependencies.
*   Configure build systems to strictly resolve KSP processor dependencies from trusted sources only.
*   Utilize dependency pinning and checksum verification to ensure the integrity and authenticity of KSP processor dependencies and prevent automatic updates to potentially malicious versions.
