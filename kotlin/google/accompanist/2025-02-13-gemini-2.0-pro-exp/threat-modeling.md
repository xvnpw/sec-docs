# Threat Model Analysis for google/accompanist

## Threat: [Unintentional Over-Permissioning](./threats/unintentional_over-permissioning.md)

*   **Description:** The application, due to incorrect usage of Accompanist's permission APIs, requests more permissions than it actually needs. This could be due to misunderstanding the API, copying examples without careful consideration, or failing to handle permission denials correctly.
    *   **Impact:** The application gains access to sensitive user data or device capabilities it shouldn't have, leading to potential data breaches, privacy violations, or unauthorized actions.
    *   **Affected Component:** `accompanist-permissions` (specifically, `rememberPermissionState`, `rememberMultiplePermissionsState`, and related functions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Request only the *absolute minimum* permissions required for each feature.  Thoroughly analyze the needs of each Accompanist component used.
        *   **Code Review:** Carefully review all permission requests and their justifications.  Have a second developer review the permission-related code.
        *   **Testing:** Thoroughly test *all* permission flows, including scenarios where permissions are granted, denied, and revoked.  Test on different Android versions and device configurations.
        *   **User Education:** Provide clear and concise explanations to the user about *why* each permission is needed, directly within the permission request flow.
        *   **Runtime Checks:** Implement runtime checks to ensure permissions are *still* granted before accessing sensitive resources, even after initial approval.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Periodically review and update permission requests to ensure they remain minimal and necessary.

## Threat: [Permission Request Spoofing (Mitigated by OS, but listed for completeness)](./threats/permission_request_spoofing__mitigated_by_os__but_listed_for_completeness_.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious app could attempt to intercept or manipulate the permission request dialogs presented by Accompanist.  However, Accompanist relies on the standard Android permission system, making this attack difficult.
    *   **Impact:** The malicious app could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive user data or device capabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** `accompanist-permissions` (the entire permission handling mechanism).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (but largely mitigated by the Android OS's security model).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **System-Level Protections:** Rely primarily on the Android OS's built-in permission model and dialogs.  Accompanist uses these, providing inherent protection.
        *   **Code Signing:** Ensure the application is properly code-signed with a strong key to prevent tampering and ensure authenticity.
        *   **User Awareness:** Educate users to be cautious about granting permissions and to carefully verify the requesting application's identity in the permission dialog.
        *   **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:** (More applicable to enterprise environments) Implement monitoring to detect unusual permission requests or grants, potentially indicating a spoofing attempt.

## Threat: [System UI Manipulation for Phishing](./threats/system_ui_manipulation_for_phishing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could leverage the System UI Controller to alter the appearance of the status bar or navigation bar.  The goal would be to mimic a trusted application or a system component, thereby deceiving the user into entering sensitive information (credentials, financial data, etc.).
    *   **Impact:** Users could be tricked into providing sensitive data to a malicious actor, leading to account compromise, financial loss, or identity theft.
    *   **Affected Component:** `accompanist-systemuicontroller` (specifically, functions like `setStatusBarColor`, `setNavigationBarColor`, `setSystemBarsColor`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Limited Use:** Use System UI Controller features *very sparingly* and only when absolutely essential for the application's core functionality and user experience.  Avoid unnecessary modifications.
        *   **User Communication:** Clearly and explicitly inform the user about *any* changes made to the system UI, explaining the reason for the change.
        *   **Avoid Mimicry:** Do *not* attempt to mimic the appearance of other applications or system components.  Maintain a distinct visual identity.
        *   **Contextual Awareness:** Provide strong visual cues *within the application's own UI* to reinforce its identity and clearly distinguish it from the system UI elements.
        *   **Testing:** Extensively test on a wide variety of devices and Android versions to ensure consistent, predictable, and non-deceptive behavior.  Test with different user settings and accessibility options.
