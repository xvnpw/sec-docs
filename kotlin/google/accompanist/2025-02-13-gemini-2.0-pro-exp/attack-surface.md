# Attack Surface Analysis for google/accompanist

## Attack Surface: [Permission Handling Issues](./attack_surfaces/permission_handling_issues.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities related to requesting, granting, and revoking Android permissions, specifically stemming from the misuse or exploitation of the `accompanist-permissions` library.
    *   **Accompanist Contribution:** The `accompanist-permissions` library provides utilities for managing permissions within Compose.  Incorrect implementation or unexpected interactions with this library can lead directly to security issues.
    *   **Example:** An app uses `rememberPermissionState` but fails to properly handle the `PermissionStatus.Denied` (and permanently denied) state.  The app continues to attempt to use the permission-requiring functionality, leading to crashes or, worse, silently failing to protect user data if the permission was previously granted and then revoked.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive user data (contacts, location, camera, microphone, etc.), potentially leading to privacy violations or further exploitation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Thoroughly test *all* permission request/response flows, including denial, revocation (via system settings), and "Don't ask again" scenarios.  This is crucial.
            *   Strictly adhere to the principle of least privilege: request only the *absolutely necessary* permissions at the time they are *actually* needed.
            *   Use the latest version of `accompanist-permissions` to benefit from bug fixes and security improvements.
            *   Handle permission revocation *gracefully*.  The app must function correctly (even in a degraded state) *without* the permission.  Provide clear user feedback.
            *   Provide clear and concise explanations to the user about *why* each permission is needed, *before* requesting it.
            *   Consider using a more robust permission library if complex, multi-step, or conditional permission handling is required.  Accompanist's library is a convenience, not a complete solution for all scenarios.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Review app permissions regularly in system settings and revoke any unnecessary or suspicious permissions.
            *   Be cautious about granting permissions to apps, especially those from unknown or untrusted sources.  Pay attention to the permissions requested.

## Attack Surface: [WebView Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/webview_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities inherent in Android's WebView, directly exposed and made accessible through the `accompanist-webview` component. This is a *major* attack vector.
    *   **Accompanist Contribution:** `accompanist-webview` provides a Compose wrapper around Android's WebView.  While it simplifies integration, it *directly inherits all of WebView's security risks*.  This is a direct contribution to the attack surface.
    *   **Example:** An app uses `accompanist-webview` to display content from a third-party URL.  The third-party site is compromised, and an attacker injects malicious JavaScript.  This JavaScript can then:
        *   Steal cookies and session tokens from the app.
        *   Redirect the user to a phishing site designed to steal credentials.
        *   Potentially execute arbitrary code within the app's context (depending on WebView settings and Android version), leading to a complete device compromise.
    *   **Impact:**  A wide range of severe impacts, from data theft and session hijacking to *remote code execution (RCE)* in the worst-case scenarios.  This can lead to complete loss of control over the user's data and potentially the device.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **This is the most critical area to secure when using `accompanist-webview`.**
            *   *Disable JavaScript unless absolutely, undeniably necessary*.  If JavaScript *must* be enabled, use extreme caution and consider sandboxing techniques (which are complex to implement correctly).
            *   **Always** set `WebSettings.setAllowFileAccess(false)`, `WebSettings.setAllowContentAccess(false)`, `WebSettings.setAllowFileAccessFromFileURLs(false)`, and `WebSettings.setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs(false)`.  These settings restrict access to the local file system and content providers, significantly reducing the attack surface.
            *   Implement a *robust* `WebViewClient` and `WebChromeClient`.  These classes are crucial for controlling navigation, handling errors, and intercepting potentially malicious requests.  Override methods like `shouldOverrideUrlLoading`, `onReceivedError`, and `onJsAlert` to implement security checks.
            *   *Sanitize and validate all data loaded into the WebView*, regardless of the source.  Assume *all* external content is potentially malicious.  Use HTML sanitization libraries and consider Content Security Policy (CSP).
            *   Use HTTPS for *all* external resources loaded into the WebView.  Enforce HTTPS strictly.
            *   Consider using a custom URL scheme and intercepting requests to prevent the loading of unexpected or untrusted URLs.
            *   Regularly update the WebView component (and the underlying Android System WebView) to the latest version to benefit from security patches.  This is crucial for mitigating known WebView vulnerabilities.
            *   ***Strongly consider alternatives to WebView if at all possible, especially for displaying untrusted content.*** Native Compose UI elements are inherently much safer.  If you *must* display web content, consider rendering only a very limited, trusted subset of HTML.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Keep your device's Android System WebView updated through the Google Play Store.  This is the primary defense against WebView vulnerabilities.
            *   Be *extremely* cautious about clicking links or interacting with web content within apps, especially if the app's source is unknown or untrusted.  If an app displays web content unexpectedly, consider uninstalling it.
