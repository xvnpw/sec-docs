# Threat Model Analysis for google/accompanist

## Threat: [Malicious Permission Grant via Accompanist Permissions API](./threats/malicious_permission_grant_via_accompanist_permissions_api.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might find a way to manipulate the permission request flow facilitated by Accompanist's permission utilities. This could involve exploiting a bug in how Accompanist handles permission results or interacts with the Android permission system, leading to the application being granted permissions it shouldn't have.
    *   **Impact:** If successful, the attacker could gain access to sensitive user data (location, contacts, camera, etc.) or perform actions on the user's behalf without their explicit consent.
    *   **Affected Accompanist Component:** `permissions` module, specifically functions related to requesting and checking permissions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly test the application's permission handling logic, especially when using Accompanist's utilities.
        *   Avoid making assumptions about permission states based solely on Accompanist's API; always verify the actual permission status with the Android system.
        *   Review Accompanist's permission handling code for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Accompanist WebView Integration](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_accompanist_webview_integration.md)

*   **Description:** If using Accompanist's utilities for integrating WebViews in Compose, an attacker could inject malicious scripts into the WebView if Accompanist doesn't properly handle or sanitize data passed to or from the WebView. This could occur if Accompanist's API allows embedding untrusted web content without proper security measures.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the WebView, potentially stealing user credentials, session tokens, or performing actions on the user's behalf on the target website.
    *   **Affected Accompanist Component:** `webview` module, specifically functions related to configuring and interacting with WebViews.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully sanitize and validate any data that is passed from the native application code to the WebView.
        *   Enforce strict Content Security Policy (CSP) within the WebView.
        *   Avoid loading untrusted or dynamically generated HTML content directly into the WebView if possible.
        *   Review Accompanist's WebView integration code for potential XSS vulnerabilities.
