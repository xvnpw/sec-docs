## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Internal Permission State](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_internal_permission_state.md)

* Attack Vector: Manipulate Internal Permission State -> Intercept and Modify Permission Request/Grant Flow
        * Description: An attacker attempts to bypass Android's permission system by directly manipulating the internal state of how Accompanist (or the underlying application) handles permissions. This could involve intercepting and altering the flow of permission requests or grants, tricking the system into granting access to protected resources without proper authorization.
        * Critical Node: Manipulate Internal Permission State
        * Likelihood: Low
        * Impact: High (Access to sensitive data, device features, etc.)
        * Mitigation: Rely strictly on Android's standard permission mechanisms. Avoid custom permission logic within Accompanist integrations. Implement robust integrity checks to prevent tampering with permission-related data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Create Deceptive Overlays](./attack_tree_paths/create_deceptive_overlays.md)

* Attack Vector: Manipulate System Bar Appearance -> Display False Information or UI Elements
        * Description: An attacker exploits Accompanist's ability to interact with the system UI to create deceptive overlays, particularly targeting the system bar. By displaying false information or UI elements, the attacker can trick users into divulging sensitive information or performing unintended actions, mimicking legitimate system prompts or application interfaces.
        * Critical Node: Create Deceptive Overlays
        * Likelihood: Low (Android's security measures provide some protection)
        * Impact: High (Credentials theft, financial loss, malware installation)
        * Mitigation: Be extremely cautious when using Accompanist's System UI Controller. Implement checks to ensure the application's UI is not being obscured or manipulated in a deceptive way. Educate users about potential phishing attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

* Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Scripts via Accompanist Web Integration
        * Description: If the application uses Accompanist's `Web` module to integrate with `WebView`, an attacker might inject malicious JavaScript code into the web content being displayed. This could happen if Accompanist or the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate web content, allowing the execution of arbitrary scripts within the context of the `WebView`.
        * Critical Node: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
        * Likelihood: Medium (If WebView configuration is not secure)
        * Impact: High (Stealing cookies, session hijacking, redirecting users, accessing device resources through JavaScript bridges if enabled)
        * Mitigation: Follow strict WebView security best practices. Sanitize all untrusted web content before displaying it. Disable unnecessary WebView features like JavaScript bridges if not required. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Attack Tree Path: [Improper URL Handling](./attack_tree_paths/improper_url_handling.md)

* Attack Vector: Manipulate URLs Loaded in WebView -> Redirect to malicious sites or load unintended content.
        * Description: An attacker could manipulate the URLs being loaded within a `WebView` managed by Accompanist. This could involve intercepting URL loading requests or exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application handles URLs, leading to the user being redirected to malicious websites for phishing attacks or to download malware.
        * Critical Node: Improper URL Handling
        * Likelihood: Medium (If URL validation is weak)
        * Impact: High (Credentials theft, malware infection, financial loss)
        * Mitigation: Implement robust URL validation and sanitization before loading any URL in the `WebView`. Use HTTPS for all web content. Consider using `WebViewAssetLoader` for local content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigurations or Improper Usage](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurations_or_improper_usage.md)

* Attack Vector: Incorrect Implementation of Accompanist Features -> Using Accompanist in ways not intended or without proper understanding.
        * Description: Developers might misuse or misunderstand Accompanist's features, leading to unintended security vulnerabilities. This could range from improper state management to insecure handling of user input or UI elements. The specific vulnerability depends on the feature being misused.
        * Critical Node: Exploit Misconfigurations or Improper Usage
        * Likelihood: Medium (Dependent on developer experience and code review practices)
        * Impact: Varies (Can range from low to high depending on the vulnerability introduced)
        * Mitigation: Thoroughly understand Accompanist's documentation and best practices. Conduct comprehensive code reviews, especially for code involving Accompanist. Utilize static analysis tools to identify potential misconfigurations. Provide adequate training for developers on secure coding practices and the proper use of UI libraries.
