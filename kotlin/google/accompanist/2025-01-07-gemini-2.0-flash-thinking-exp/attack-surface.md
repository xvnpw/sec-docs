# Attack Surface Analysis for google/accompanist

## Attack Surface: [Accompanist Permissions - Logic Errors in Handling](./attack_surfaces/accompanist_permissions_-_logic_errors_in_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in the internal logic of Accompanist's permission handling APIs could lead to incorrect permission states or bypasses.
    *   **How Accompanist Contributes:** Introduces a layer of abstraction for permission management. If this abstraction has vulnerabilities, applications relying on it will be affected.
    *   **Example:** An application uses `rememberMultiplePermissionsState` and Accompanist has a bug where a denied permission is incorrectly reported as granted under specific circumstances.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to device resources or sensitive user data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly test permission-related functionality beyond basic usage.
        *   Implement redundant permission checks at critical points in the application.
        *   Stay updated with Accompanist releases and bug fixes.
        *   Consider using standard Android permission APIs alongside Accompanist for critical permissions as a fallback.

## Attack Surface: [Accompanist WebView (if used) - Insecure Defaults or Configurations](./attack_surfaces/accompanist_webview__if_used__-_insecure_defaults_or_configurations.md)

*   **Description:** If the application utilizes Accompanist's `WebView` integration, insecure default settings or configurations provided by Accompanist could introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Accompanist Contributes:** May provide wrappers or utilities for configuring `WebView`. If these defaults are not secure, developers might unknowingly introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** Accompanist's `WebView` integration might have disabled certain security features by default (e.g., JavaScript disabled, insecure content allowed), making the application vulnerable to XSS attacks if loading untrusted web content.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), arbitrary code execution within the `WebView` context, data leakage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review the default configurations provided by Accompanist for `WebView`.
        *   Explicitly configure `WebView` with secure settings, following Android best practices.
        *   Avoid loading untrusted web content in the `WebView`.
        *   Implement robust input validation and output encoding for any data exchanged with the `WebView`.
