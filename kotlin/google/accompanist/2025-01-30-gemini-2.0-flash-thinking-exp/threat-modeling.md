# Threat Model Analysis for google/accompanist

## Threat: [Incorrect Permission Handling Logic](./threats/incorrect_permission_handling_logic.md)

**Description:** Developers relying solely on Accompanist's permission handling without robust backend authorization can be vulnerable. Attackers bypassing client-side permission prompts (e.g., rooted devices) gain unauthorized access to sensitive device resources (camera, microphone, location, storage) managed by Accompanist Permissions. This is a direct consequence of how developers *use* Accompanist Permissions for security without proper backend validation.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive user data and device functionalities, potentially leading to privacy violations, data theft, or misuse of device resources.
*   **Affected Accompanist Component:** Accompanist Permissions module, `rememberPermissionState`, `rememberMultiplePermissionsState` functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Backend Authorization:** Implement mandatory server-side authorization checks to validate access requests, independent of client-side permission status managed by Accompanist.
    *   **Permissions as UX Enhancement:** Treat Accompanist Permissions primarily as a user experience tool for permission requests, not as a primary security control.
    *   **Security Audits:** Regularly audit permission handling logic, ensuring backend validation complements Accompanist's client-side mechanisms.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Accompanist Permission Library](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_accompanist_permission_library.md)

**Description:** Undiscovered security vulnerabilities within the Accompanist Permissions library itself could be exploited. This could directly compromise permission checks managed by Accompanist, leading to unauthorized access to protected resources or unexpected application behavior. This threat is inherent to the Accompanist library's code.
*   **Impact:** Widespread impact across applications using the vulnerable Accompanist version, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionalities.
*   **Affected Accompanist Component:** Accompanist Permissions module, core permission handling logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly Update Accompanist:**  Maintain Accompanist library at the latest stable version to receive critical security patches and bug fixes.
    *   **Security Advisories Monitoring:** Actively monitor security advisories and release notes specifically for Accompanist to promptly address any reported vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Employ dependency scanning tools to proactively identify known vulnerabilities within Accompanist and its dependencies.

## Threat: [WebView Vulnerabilities (Accompanist WebView)](./threats/webview_vulnerabilities__accompanist_webview_.md)

**Description:** While not *introduced* by Accompanist, using Accompanist WebView *exposes* applications to vulnerabilities in the underlying Android System WebView. Attackers exploiting these WebView vulnerabilities can achieve remote code execution, cross-site scripting (XSS), or other security breaches within the WebView context *used via Accompanist*. The risk is amplified by the ease of integration provided by Accompanist, potentially leading to wider WebView usage.
*   **Impact:** Potential for remote code execution on user devices, data theft, cross-site scripting attacks, and compromise of the application's WebView context facilitated by Accompanist.
*   **Affected Accompanist Component:** Accompanist WebView module, `WebView` composable.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **WebView Updates:**  Strongly encourage users to keep Android System WebView updated to receive critical security patches, as Accompanist WebView relies on it.
    *   **Restrict WebView Features:**  Minimize the attack surface by disabling unnecessary WebView features (JavaScript, file access, geolocation) through `WebViewClient` and `WebSettings` when using Accompanist WebView.
    *   **Input Sanitization for WebView:**  Thoroughly sanitize any user-provided input displayed or processed within the Accompanist WebView to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers for web content loaded in Accompanist WebView to mitigate XSS risks, if applicable and content is controlled.
    *   **HTTPS for WebView Communication:** Ensure all communication within Accompanist WebView is over HTTPS to protect data in transit.

## Threat: [Loading Untrusted Content in WebView (Accompanist WebView)](./threats/loading_untrusted_content_in_webview__accompanist_webview_.md)

**Description:** Using Accompanist WebView to load untrusted or user-provided URLs directly introduces high risk. Malicious content from these sources can exploit WebView vulnerabilities or directly attack the user through phishing or malware, facilitated by the ease of loading URLs in Accompanist WebView.
*   **Impact:** Malware infection, data theft, phishing attacks, exposure to malicious websites, and potential compromise of user credentials, all initiated through content loaded via Accompanist WebView.
*   **Affected Accompanist Component:** Accompanist WebView module, `WebView` composable, specifically when used to load external or user-provided URLs.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Untrusted Content in WebView:**  Strictly avoid loading untrusted or user-provided URLs within Accompanist WebView.
    *   **URL Validation and Whitelisting:** If external content is necessary, implement rigorous URL validation and use whitelists of trusted domains to limit loadable sources in Accompanist WebView.
    *   **WebView Sandboxing:** Isolate WebView processes to contain potential damage from malicious content loaded via Accompanist WebView.
    *   **User Warnings for External Links:**  Provide clear warnings to users before navigating to external websites within Accompanist WebView.
    *   **CSP for Loaded Content:** Implement Content Security Policy headers to restrict the capabilities of loaded web content within Accompanist WebView, if applicable.

## Threat: [JavaScript Injection (Accompanist WebView - if JavaScript enabled)](./threats/javascript_injection__accompanist_webview_-_if_javascript_enabled_.md)

**Description:** If JavaScript is enabled in Accompanist WebView, vulnerabilities in application JavaScript code or loaded web content can be exploited for injection. Malicious JavaScript injected into the WebView context (facilitated by Accompanist's WebView integration) can steal data, hijack sessions, or perform other client-side attacks.
*   **Impact:** Client-side attacks, data theft, session hijacking, unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user within the WebView context provided by Accompanist.
*   **Affected Accompanist Component:** Accompanist WebView module, `WebView` composable, specifically when JavaScript is enabled.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable JavaScript in WebView (if feasible):** Disable JavaScript in Accompanist WebView if it's not absolutely essential for the application's functionality.
    *   **Secure JavaScript Coding Practices:**  Adhere to secure coding practices for all JavaScript code within the application and any loaded into Accompanist WebView.
    *   **JavaScript Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize all data passed to JavaScript code from the Android application or external sources to prevent injection vulnerabilities within Accompanist WebView.
    *   **Regular JavaScript Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of JavaScript code and Accompanist WebView configurations to identify and remediate potential injection points.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for JavaScript:** Only enable necessary JavaScript features and avoid granting excessive permissions to JavaScript code running within Accompanist WebView.
