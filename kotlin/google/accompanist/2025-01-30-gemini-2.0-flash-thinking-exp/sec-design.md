# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, known as Accompanist, is a suite of Jetpack Compose libraries. Its primary business goal is to enhance the Android development ecosystem by providing supplementary functionalities and utilities that are not yet natively available in Jetpack Compose. By offering these libraries, the project aims to improve developer productivity, simplify common UI development tasks, and encourage wider adoption of Jetpack Compose.

Business Priorities:
- Enhance Jetpack Compose developer experience.
- Provide reusable and high-quality UI components and utilities for Jetpack Compose.
- Promote the adoption and usage of Jetpack Compose within the Android development community.
- Maintain and expand the library set based on community needs and Jetpack Compose evolution.

Business Risks:
- Risk of reduced developer adoption if the libraries are not perceived as useful, reliable, or well-maintained.
- Risk of security vulnerabilities within the libraries that could impact applications using them, potentially damaging developer trust.
- Risk of feature overlap or conflict with future native Jetpack Compose functionalities, leading to obsolescence or rework.
- Risk of insufficient community contribution or maintenance, potentially leading to stagnation or security issues not being addressed promptly.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Open Source Development - The project is developed openly on GitHub, allowing for community review of code and identification of potential issues. Implemented in: GitHub repository and development process.
- security control: Version Control - Git and GitHub are used for version control, providing history and traceability of changes. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
- security control: Issue Tracking - GitHub Issues are used for bug reports, feature requests, and discussions, allowing for community reporting of potential security concerns. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
- security control: Community Contributions - External contributions are accepted via pull requests, potentially bringing in diverse perspectives and code review. Implemented in: GitHub contribution process.

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on Community Security Review - Security relies partly on the open-source community to identify and report vulnerabilities, which may not be as comprehensive as dedicated security testing.
- accepted risk: Third-Party Dependencies - The libraries may depend on third-party libraries, inheriting their potential vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Open Source Supply Chain Risks - Potential risks associated with the open-source supply chain, although mitigated by being a Google project and hosted on GitHub.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Automated Security Scanning - Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dependency Scanning in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in code and dependencies.
- security control: Regular Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits, potentially by internal Google security teams or external security experts, to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.
- security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Policy - Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy to provide a channel for security researchers to report vulnerabilities responsibly.
- security control: Security Champions - Designate security champions within the development team to promote security awareness and best practices.
- security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA) - Implement SCA tools to continuously monitor and manage open source components, ensuring awareness of known vulnerabilities and license compliance.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
  - Requirement: For contributors, GitHub authentication is required to contribute code.
  - Requirement: For users, no direct authentication is required as it's a library consumed by applications.
- Authorization:
  - Requirement: GitHub's role-based access control manages contributor permissions to the repository (read, write, admin).
  - Requirement: Library usage within applications is governed by Android application permissions, not directly by the library itself.
- Input Validation:
  - Requirement: Libraries should implement robust input validation to prevent common vulnerabilities like injection attacks or denial-of-service when processing data within applications.
  - Requirement: Validate inputs from application developers and potentially external sources if the libraries interact with external data.
- Cryptography:
  - Requirement: If any libraries handle sensitive data or require secure communication, appropriate and well-vetted cryptographic libraries and practices must be used. (Assess if cryptography is needed based on library functionalities).
  - Requirement: Ensure proper key management if cryptographic operations are performed.

Build Process Description:

1. Developer: Developers write code and commit changes to the GitHub repository.
2. Code Changes (GitHub): Code changes are pushed to the GitHub repository, triggering the build process.
3. Build System (GitHub Actions): GitHub Actions workflow is triggered automatically on code changes (e.g., push, pull request).
4. Compilation & Tests: The build system compiles the source code and runs automated unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
5. Security Checks (SAST, SCA): Automated security checks are performed using SAST and SCA tools to scan the code and dependencies for potential vulnerabilities.
6. Security Checks Passed?: The build process checks if security scans have passed without critical or high severity findings.
7. Artifacts (JAR/AAR): If security checks and tests pass, the build system packages the compiled code into JAR/AAR artifacts.
8. Build Failure & Notifications: If security checks or tests fail, the build process fails, and notifications are sent to developers to address the issues.
9. Publish to Maven Central / Google Maven: Upon successful build and security checks, the artifacts are published to Maven Central and/or Google Maven repositories, making them available for developers to use.

Build Security Controls:
- security control: Automated Build Process - GitHub Actions automates the build process, reducing manual errors and ensuring consistent builds.
- security control: Source Code Management - Git and GitHub provide version control and track changes to the codebase, enhancing traceability and accountability.
- security control: Automated Testing - Unit and integration tests are run automatically during the build process to ensure code quality and catch regressions.
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - SAST tools are integrated into the build pipeline to automatically scan the source code for potential security vulnerabilities.
- security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA) - SCA tools are used to analyze project dependencies and identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
- security control: Build Artifact Signing - Build artifacts are signed to ensure authenticity and integrity, preventing tampering after publication.
- security control: Access Control to Build System - Access to modify build configurations and pipelines is restricted to authorized personnel.
- security control: Secrets Management - Sensitive credentials used in the build process (e.g., repository publishing keys) are securely managed using GitHub Secrets or similar mechanisms.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
