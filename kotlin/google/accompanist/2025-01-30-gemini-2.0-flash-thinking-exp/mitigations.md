# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for google/accompanist

## Mitigation Strategy: [Contextual Permission Requests using PermissionsAccompanist](./mitigation_strategies/contextual_permission_requests_using_permissionsaccompanist.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Feature-Permission Mapping:** Clearly map each feature in your application to the specific permissions it requires.
    2.  **Use `rememberPermissionState` or `rememberMultiplePermissionsState`:** In your Compose code, utilize `PermissionsAccompanist` composables like `rememberPermissionState` for single permissions or `rememberMultiplePermissionsState` for multiple permissions. These composables manage the permission state lifecycle within Compose.
    3.  **Request Permission on Feature Interaction:**  Trigger the permission request (using `launchPermissionRequest()` or `launchMultiplePermissionRequest()`) only when the user interacts with a UI element or navigates to a screen that necessitates the permission. This makes the request contextual.
    4.  **Provide Rationale Before Request:** Before launching the permission request, display a clear and user-friendly rationale explaining *why* the permission is needed for the specific feature they are trying to use. This can be done using a dialog or inline UI elements.
    5.  **Handle Permission Result in Compose:**  Use the `permissionState.status` or `multiplePermissionsState.permissions` to react to the permission grant or denial within your Compose UI. Update UI elements or feature availability based on the permission status.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **User Distrust (Low to Medium Severity):**  Upfront or unexplained permission requests can lead to user distrust and app abandonment. Contextual requests, facilitated by Accompanist, improve transparency and user understanding.
        *   **Permission Fatigue (Low Severity):**  Requesting permissions only when needed reduces user annoyance and the likelihood of users blindly granting permissions to dismiss prompts.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **User Distrust:** Low to Medium Risk Reduction
        *   **Permission Fatigue:** Low Risk Reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Unknown. Needs review of permission request implementation in the application, specifically looking for usage of `PermissionsAccompanist` composables for contextual requests.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Potentially missing if permissions are requested upfront at app launch or screen load, instead of being triggered by user interaction with features requiring those permissions, and if `PermissionsAccompanist` composables are not used to manage this contextual flow within Compose.
