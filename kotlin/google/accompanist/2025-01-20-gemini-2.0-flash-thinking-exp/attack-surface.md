# Attack Surface Analysis for google/accompanist

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Permission Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_permission_handling.md)

*   **Description:** The application grants access to sensitive resources or performs privileged actions based on permission states. If Accompanist's permission handling logic is flawed, unauthorized access can occur.
    *   **How Accompanist Contributes:** The `accompanist-permissions` module provides APIs for requesting and checking permissions. Vulnerabilities within Accompanist's permission handling logic could lead to insecure permission management, allowing bypasses or incorrect state reporting.
    *   **Example:** An application uses `accompanist-permissions` to check for camera permission. A bug in Accompanist's permission tracking could allow the application to proceed as if the permission is granted even when it's not, leading to unauthorized camera access.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive user data (camera, microphone, location, contacts, etc.) or the ability to perform privileged actions without user consent.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust permission checks beyond relying solely on Accompanist's APIs.
            *   Validate permission states before performing sensitive operations.
            *   Stay updated with the latest Accompanist version to benefit from potential security fixes.
            *   Thoroughly review and test the application's permission handling logic when using `accompanist-permissions`.

## Attack Surface: [UI Spoofing via System UI Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/ui_spoofing_via_system_ui_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious applications can manipulate the system UI (status bar, navigation bar) to deceive users. If Accompanist's system UI manipulation is vulnerable, it can be exploited for phishing or misleading users.
    *   **How Accompanist Contributes:** The `accompanist-systemuicontroller` module provides ways to control system UI elements. Vulnerabilities in how Accompanist interacts with the system UI could allow for manipulation that facilitates UI spoofing.
    *   **Example:** A malicious application uses `SystemUiController` to make the status bar appear as if a VPN is connected, tricking the user into believing their connection is secure when it's not, potentially leading them to enter sensitive information on a fake login screen.
    *   **Impact:** Users might be tricked into entering credentials, approving malicious actions, or revealing sensitive information due to a misleading UI controlled via Accompanist.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Use `SystemUiController` responsibly and avoid making changes that could be easily mistaken for legitimate system indicators.
            *   Carefully consider the potential for misuse when implementing UI customizations with `SystemUiController`.
            *   Test UI changes on various Android versions to ensure they don't create unexpected or exploitable visual inconsistencies.

## Attack Surface: [WebView Vulnerabilities via `accompanist-web`](./attack_surfaces/webview_vulnerabilities_via__accompanist-web_.md)

*   **Description:** WebViews can be vulnerable to various web-based attacks if not configured and used securely. Accompanist's `accompanist-web` directly integrates with `WebView`, inheriting these risks if not handled properly.
    *   **How Accompanist Contributes:** The `accompanist-web` module simplifies the integration of `WebView` components. If Accompanist's implementation doesn't enforce or recommend secure `WebView` settings, or if vulnerabilities exist within its `WebView` integration logic, it can expose the application to web-based attacks.
    *   **Example:** An application uses `accompanist-web` to display a webpage from an untrusted source. If Accompanist's integration doesn't properly sanitize input or enable necessary security features on the `WebView`, the webpage could execute malicious JavaScript to steal cookies or perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure to web-based attacks, potential data theft, unauthorized actions within the application's context, and even device compromise in severe cases.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerabilities and the sensitivity of the data handled).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Enable secure `WebView` settings when using `accompanist-web` (e.g., disabling JavaScript if not needed, restricting file access).
            *   Validate and sanitize URLs loaded into the `WebView`.
            *   Implement robust input validation and output encoding to prevent XSS within the `WebView` context.
            *   Stay updated with the latest `WebView` version and security patches, and ensure Accompanist's `accompanist-web` is also up-to-date.
            *   Consider using a sandboxed `WebView` environment if possible.
