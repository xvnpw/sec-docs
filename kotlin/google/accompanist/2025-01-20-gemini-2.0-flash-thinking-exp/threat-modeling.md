# Threat Model Analysis for google/accompanist

## Threat: [UI Spoofing via Status/Navigation Bar Manipulation](./threats/ui_spoofing_via_statusnavigation_bar_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities or misuse the Accompanist `SystemBars` functionality to manipulate the appearance of the system status and navigation bars. This could involve displaying fake notifications, hiding critical system indicators (like battery level or network status), or presenting misleading information to trick the user.

**Impact:** Users might be deceived into taking actions they wouldn't normally take, such as entering sensitive information into a fake dialog or ignoring genuine security warnings. This can lead to data breaches, financial loss, or malware installation.

**Affected Accompanist Component:** `accompanist-systemuicontroller` module, specifically functions like `setStatusBarColor`, `setNavigationBarColor`, `isNavigationBarVisible`, `setSystemBarsColor`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully validate the source and integrity of any data used to update the system bar appearance.
*   Avoid relying solely on visual cues in the system bars for security-critical information.
*   Implement proper access controls and input validation for any logic that modifies system bar appearance.
*   Regularly review and audit the code that interacts with the `SystemBars` functionality.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via WebView Integration](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_webview_integration.md)

**Description:** If the application uses Accompanist's `WebView` integration to display untrusted web content, it is vulnerable to standard WebView-related threats, including XSS. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the web content, which could then be executed within the WebView context, potentially accessing application data, cookies, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Impact:** Sensitive user data could be stolen, the application's functionality could be manipulated, or the user's device could be compromised.

**Affected Accompanist Component:** `accompanist-webview` module, specifically the `WebView` composable.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Treat all content loaded in the WebView as potentially untrusted.
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on any data passed to the WebView.
*   Enforce a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the sources from which the WebView can load resources and execute scripts.
*   Disable JavaScript if it is not strictly necessary.
*   Avoid using `loadUrl` with user-provided input without proper sanitization.

## Threat: [Insecure WebView Settings](./threats/insecure_webview_settings.md)

**Description:** Developers might inadvertently enable insecure WebView settings (e.g., allowing file access, JavaScript execution from local files, disabling SSL certificate verification) when using Accompanist's `WebView` integration. An attacker could exploit these insecure settings to gain unauthorized access to local files, execute malicious scripts, or intercept network traffic.

**Impact:** Sensitive data stored on the device could be accessed, the application's functionality could be compromised, or the user's communication could be intercepted.

**Affected Accompanist Component:** `accompanist-webview` module, specifically the configuration of the `WebView` composable through the `state` parameter.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully review and configure WebView settings.
*   Disable unnecessary features and ensure secure defaults are used.
*   Avoid enabling file access unless absolutely necessary and with strict controls.
*   Ensure SSL certificate verification is enabled to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on WebView Traffic](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attacks_on_webview_traffic.md)

**Description:** If the WebView, integrated using Accompanist, loads content over HTTP instead of HTTPS, the communication is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. An attacker could intercept the network traffic, potentially eavesdropping on sensitive information or injecting malicious content into the WebView.

**Impact:** Confidential data transmitted to or from the WebView could be compromised, and the user could be tricked into interacting with malicious content.

**Affected Accompanist Component:** `accompanist-webview` module, specifically the URLs loaded within the `WebView` composable.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure all content loaded in the WebView is served over HTTPS.
*   Implement certificate pinning to further protect against man-in-the-middle attacks by verifying the server's SSL certificate.
*   Educate users about the risks of using applications on untrusted networks.
