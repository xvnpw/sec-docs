# Threat Model Analysis for uber/ribs

## Threat: [Malicious Rib Impersonation](./threats/malicious_rib_impersonation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could create or compromise a Rib that falsely identifies itself as another legitimate Rib. This malicious Rib could then send unauthorized messages or commands intended for the impersonated Rib, potentially triggering unintended actions or state changes within the application due to Ribs' inter-communication mechanisms.

**Impact:**  The application could enter an incorrect state, perform unauthorized actions, or leak sensitive information due to the malicious Rib's influence within the Ribs architecture.

**Affected Ribs Component:** Inter-Rib Communication (Listeners, APIs)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for inter-Rib communication within the Ribs framework.
* Use unique identifiers or tokens to verify the identity of sending Ribs within the Ribs ecosystem.
* Ensure that Ribs only process messages from explicitly trusted sources, leveraging Ribs' communication patterns.
* Consider using a secure communication bus or mediator pattern with built-in authentication within the Ribs architecture.

## Threat: [Eavesdropping on Inter-Rib Communication via Unsecured Channels](./threats/eavesdropping_on_inter-rib_communication_via_unsecured_channels.md)

**Description:** An attacker could intercept communication between Ribs if the communication channels provided by the Ribs framework are not encrypted or secured. This could involve passively listening to network traffic or exploiting vulnerabilities in Ribs' communication mechanism.

**Impact:** Confidential information exchanged between Ribs could be exposed to the attacker, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or further attacks due to the compromised Ribs communication.

**Affected Ribs Component:** Inter-Rib Communication (Listeners, APIs)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement encryption for sensitive data transmitted between Ribs, utilizing secure communication practices within the Ribs framework.
* Utilize secure communication protocols or libraries if available and compatible within the Ribs ecosystem.
* Avoid transmitting sensitive data unnecessarily between Ribs.

## Threat: [Message Injection/Manipulation in Inter-Rib Communication](./threats/message_injectionmanipulation_in_inter-rib_communication.md)

**Description:** An attacker could intercept messages being passed between Ribs using the framework's communication mechanisms and modify their content before they reach the intended recipient. This could lead to the recipient Rib performing actions based on the manipulated data, causing incorrect behavior or security breaches within the Ribs application.

**Impact:** The application's state could be corrupted, unauthorized actions could be performed, or security controls could be bypassed due to the manipulation of Ribs' internal communication.

**Affected Ribs Component:** Inter-Rib Communication (Listeners, APIs)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement integrity checks (e.g., message authentication codes - MACs) for inter-Rib messages to detect tampering within the Ribs communication flow.
* Validate all incoming messages thoroughly before processing within the receiving Rib.
* Use secure serialization/deserialization techniques to prevent manipulation during transit between Ribs.

## Threat: [Parent Rib Privilege Escalation over Child Rib](./threats/parent_rib_privilege_escalation_over_child_rib.md)

**Description:** A compromised parent Rib could exploit vulnerabilities in the Ribs framework's hierarchy management or the application's implementation to gain unauthorized control or access sensitive data within its child Ribs, even if it shouldn't have such privileges according to Ribs' intended structure.

**Impact:**  Child Ribs could be manipulated to perform actions they are not intended to, or their sensitive data could be accessed by the compromised parent, violating the intended isolation within the Ribs hierarchy.

**Affected Ribs Component:** Rib Hierarchy Management, Interactor, Presenter

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce clear boundaries and access control policies between parent and child Ribs within the Ribs framework.
* Minimize the privileges granted to parent Ribs over their children in the Ribs hierarchy.
* Carefully review the communication channels and data sharing mechanisms defined by Ribs between parent and child Ribs.

## Threat: [Insecure Rib Attachment/Detachment Leading to Malicious Injection](./threats/insecure_rib_attachmentdetachment_leading_to_malicious_injection.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in the Ribs framework's mechanism for attaching or detaching Ribs could be exploited to inject malicious Ribs into the application's hierarchy. These malicious Ribs could then perform unauthorized actions or compromise other parts of the application by leveraging Ribs' internal workings.

**Impact:**  The application's structure and behavior could be compromised, leading to various security issues due to the injected malicious Rib within the Ribs framework.

**Affected Ribs Component:** Router, Builder

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the Rib attachment and detachment processes provided by the Ribs framework.
* Implement checks to ensure only authorized Ribs can be added or removed from the hierarchy, utilizing Ribs' intended lifecycle management.
* Validate the source and integrity of Ribs being attached through the Ribs framework's mechanisms.

## Threat: [Malicious Dependency Injection into a Rib](./threats/malicious_dependency_injection_into_a_rib.md)

**Description:** If the dependency injection mechanism used by Ribs is not properly secured, an attacker could potentially inject malicious dependencies into Ribs. These malicious dependencies could then execute arbitrary code or compromise the Rib's functionality, exploiting a core feature of the Ribs framework.

**Impact:**  Complete compromise of the affected Rib and potentially the entire application due to the injected malicious code within the Ribs component.

**Affected Ribs Component:** Component (Dependency Injection)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure that the dependency injection framework used by Ribs is configured securely.
* Validate the sources and integrity of dependencies managed by Ribs' component system.
* Consider using compile-time dependency injection where possible to reduce runtime manipulation risks within the Ribs framework.
