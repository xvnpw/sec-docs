## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data/Commands into Another Component **HIGH RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_datacommands_into_another_component_high_risk_path.md)

**1. Exploit Lack of Input Validation on Inter-Component Messages (CRITICAL NODE) -> Inject Malicious Data/Commands into Another Component (HIGH RISK PATH):**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits the absence of proper input validation on messages exchanged between different Ribs components (e.g., Interactors, Presenters). By crafting malicious messages containing unexpected data, commands, or code, the attacker can inject this payload into a receiving component.
* **Impact:** Successful injection can lead to various outcomes, including:
    * **Code Execution:** The malicious payload could be interpreted as code and executed within the receiving component's context, potentially granting the attacker control over the application's functionality or data.
    * **Data Manipulation:** The injected data could alter the state or behavior of the receiving component, leading to data corruption, unauthorized modifications, or incorrect application logic.
    * **Denial of Service:**  Malicious messages could cause the receiving component to crash or become unresponsive.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Persistent State to Gain Unauthorized Access or Control **HIGH RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/modify_persistent_state_to_gain_unauthorized_access_or_control_high_risk_path.md)

**2. Exploit Insecure State Persistence (if applicable within Ribs components) -> Modify Persistent State to Gain Unauthorized Access or Control (HIGH RISK PATH):**

* **Attack Vector:** If Ribs components persist state data (e.g., using local storage, databases), and this persistence mechanism is insecure (e.g., lack of encryption, weak access controls), an attacker can directly access and modify the stored state.
* **Impact:** Modifying the persistent state can have significant consequences:
    * **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could alter user roles or permissions stored in the state, granting themselves elevated privileges within the application.
    * **Data Manipulation:** Sensitive data stored in the state could be modified, leading to data corruption or unauthorized changes.
    * **Bypassing Security Checks:**  The attacker could manipulate state variables that control access or authorization, effectively bypassing security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Retrieve Sensitive Information **HIGH RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/retrieve_sensitive_information_high_risk_path.md)

**3. Exploit Insecure State Storage (e.g., storing sensitive data in easily accessible memory) (CRITICAL NODE) -> Retrieve Sensitive Information (HIGH RISK PATH):**

* **Attack Vector:**  Sensitive data is stored within the application's state in a way that is easily accessible to an attacker. This could involve storing data in plain text in memory, using weak encryption, or failing to protect state data from unauthorized access.
* **Impact:**  Successful exploitation leads to:
    * **Data Breach:** The attacker gains access to sensitive information, such as user credentials, personal data, financial information, or application secrets.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Functionality or Data Intended for Other Users/Roles **HIGH RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/access_functionality_or_data_intended_for_other_usersroles_high_risk_path.md)

**4. Exploit Lack of Proper Route Guarding/Authorization (CRITICAL NODE) -> Access Functionality or Data Intended for Other Users/Roles (HIGH RISK PATH):**

* **Attack Vector:** The Ribs Router, responsible for navigation between different parts of the application, lacks proper authorization checks or route guarding. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended navigation flow and directly access components or functionalities they are not authorized to use.
* **Impact:** This can result in:
    * **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker can access features, data, or functionalities that should be restricted to specific users or roles.
    * **Data Disclosure:** The attacker can view sensitive information intended for other users.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, accessing unauthorized functionalities could lead to privilege escalation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data into Target Components **HIGH RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_into_target_components_high_risk_path.md)

**5. Exploit Lack of Input Validation on Navigation Parameters (CRITICAL NODE) -> Inject Malicious Data into Target Components (HIGH RISK PATH):**

* **Attack Vector:** When navigating between Ribs components, parameters are often passed to the target component. If these navigation parameters are not properly validated, an attacker can inject malicious data into them.
* **Impact:** Similar to the inter-component message injection, this can lead to:
    * **Code Execution:** The injected data could be interpreted as code in the target component.
    * **Data Manipulation:** The injected data could alter the state or behavior of the target component.
    * **Application Errors:** Malicious parameters could cause the target component to malfunction or crash.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Data Left Behind in Memory **HIGH RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_data_left_behind_in_memory_high_risk_path.md)

**6. Exploit Improper Cleanup of Resources During Component Destruction (CRITICAL NODE) -> Access Sensitive Data Left Behind in Memory (HIGH RISK PATH):**

* **Attack Vector:** When a Ribs component is destroyed, it might not properly clean up sensitive data it was holding in memory. This leaves the data vulnerable to being accessed by an attacker who can examine the application's memory.
* **Impact:**  Successful exploitation leads to:
    * **Data Breach:** The attacker can retrieve sensitive information that was not properly cleared from memory. This is often referred to as a memory leak vulnerability.
