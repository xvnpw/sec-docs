# Attack Surface Analysis for uber/ribs

## Attack Surface: [Deep Linking Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/deep_linking_exploitation.md)

**Description:** Attackers craft malicious URLs to directly navigate to specific states or components within the application, potentially bypassing intended workflows or authorization checks.

**How Ribs Contributes:** Ribs' routing mechanism, which relies on defining specific paths and parameters to navigate between different Ribs, can be targeted if not properly secured. The framework's emphasis on deep linking for navigation makes it a prominent feature to consider.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a URL that directly navigates to a sensitive settings Rib, bypassing the usual authentication flow that should occur before reaching that Rib.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information, bypassing security controls, potential for privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all parameters used in routing logic within Routers.
* Enforce consistent authentication and authorization checks at the Router level before allowing navigation to sensitive Ribs.
* Avoid exposing internal Rib structure directly in URLs where possible. Consider using more abstract routing patterns.
* Regularly review and audit routing configurations for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Interactor Business Logic Bypass](./attack_surfaces/interactor_business_logic_bypass.md)

**Description:** Attackers manipulate inputs or application state to circumvent the intended business logic implemented within Interactors.

**How Ribs Contributes:** Interactors are central to handling business logic and state changes. Vulnerabilities in how Interactors process data or manage state transitions can be exploited. The framework's design encourages encapsulating logic within Interactors, making them a key target.

**Example:** An attacker manipulates data sent to an Interactor responsible for processing payments, causing the Interactor to incorrectly process a payment with a zero amount.

**Impact:** Financial loss, data corruption, violation of business rules, unauthorized actions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement thorough input validation and sanitization within Interactors to prevent unexpected or malicious data from being processed.
* Design Interactors with clear and well-defined state management to prevent inconsistencies or race conditions.
* Apply the principle of least privilege when granting access to data and resources within Interactors.
* Implement unit and integration tests that specifically target business logic within Interactors, including edge cases and potential attack vectors.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Injection Exploitation within Ribs](./attack_surfaces/dependency_injection_exploitation_within_ribs.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the dependency injection mechanism used by Ribs to inject malicious dependencies or manipulate existing ones.

**How Ribs Contributes:** Ribs heavily relies on dependency injection to provide components with necessary dependencies. If the dependency injection setup is not secure, it can become an attack vector.

**Example:** An attacker finds a way to inject a malicious logging dependency that intercepts sensitive data being passed between Ribs.

**Impact:** Data breaches, code execution, denial of service, complete application compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure that the dependency injection framework used with Ribs is configured securely.
* Implement strict control over which dependencies can be injected and where.
* Regularly audit the dependency graph to identify any unexpected or potentially malicious dependencies.
* Use compile-time dependency injection where possible to reduce runtime manipulation risks.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Inter-Rib Communication](./attack_surfaces/insecure_inter-rib_communication.md)

**Description:** Attackers intercept or manipulate communication between different Ribs, potentially altering application behavior or gaining access to sensitive information.

**How Ribs Contributes:** Ribs components communicate through defined interfaces and mechanisms. If these communication channels are not secured, they can be vulnerable.

**Example:** An attacker intercepts an event being passed from a child Rib to its parent, modifying the data in the event to trigger an unintended action in the parent Rib.

**Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized actions, bypassing security controls, unexpected application behavior.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Design communication interfaces between Ribs with security in mind.
* Implement validation and sanitization of data being passed between Ribs.
* Consider using secure communication patterns or encryption for sensitive data exchanged between Ribs.
* Limit the scope and visibility of communication channels between Ribs to only what is necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Debugging or Testing Ribs in Production](./attack_surfaces/exposed_debugging_or_testing_ribs_in_production.md)

**Description:** Debugging or testing Ribs, which may contain privileged access or bypass security checks, are inadvertently left enabled or accessible in a production environment.

**How Ribs Contributes:** The modular nature of Ribs can make it easy to create separate Ribs for testing or debugging purposes. If these are not properly managed and removed before deployment, they can become vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A debugging Rib that allows developers to directly modify application state is left accessible in production, allowing attackers to manipulate the application.

**Impact:** Complete application compromise, data breaches, unauthorized access, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict build processes that ensure debugging and testing Ribs are excluded from production builds.
* Use feature flags or environment variables to control the activation of debugging or testing features, ensuring they are disabled in production.
* Regularly audit the deployed application to identify and remove any unintended debugging or testing components.
