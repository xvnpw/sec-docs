## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Inter-RIB Communication Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_inter-rib_communication_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in how different Ribs components communicate with each other. If this communication is not properly secured, an attacker can intercept, manipulate, or inject malicious messages, leading to various forms of compromise.
*   **Critical Nodes within this path:**
    *   **Intercept Inter-RIB Communication [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker aims to eavesdrop on the communication bus used by Ribs. This could involve techniques like Man-in-the-Middle attacks on the internal communication mechanism or compromising a RIB that has the ability to broadcast or observe messages intended for other components. Successful interception allows the attacker to understand the application's data flow and identify potential vulnerabilities or sensitive information.
    *   **Compromise a RIB with Broadcasting Privileges [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  If an attacker can compromise a specific RIB that has the authority to broadcast messages to other parts of the application, they gain a significant advantage. This compromised RIB can then be used to intercept sensitive information being passed around.
    *   **Spoof Inter-RIB Communication [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** This involves an attacker sending fabricated or modified messages on the inter-RIB communication bus. If the bus lacks proper authentication or authorization, a compromised RIB can inject malicious events or signals that trigger unintended actions in other, legitimate RIBs.
    *   **Exploit Lack of Input Validation in Inter-RIB Communication [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  If RIBs do not rigorously validate the data they receive from other RIBs, an attacker can send specially crafted malicious payloads. These payloads could exploit vulnerabilities in the receiving RIB, leading to unexpected behavior, crashes, or even the execution of arbitrary code within that RIB's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Injection Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_injection_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This critical area focuses on vulnerabilities in how the Ribs framework manages and provides dependencies to its components. If the dependency injection mechanism is flawed, an attacker can inject malicious dependencies or replace legitimate ones, gaining significant control over the application's behavior.
*   **High-Risk Paths within this node:**
    *   **Inject Malicious Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker attempts to introduce malicious implementations of dependencies into the application. This could be achieved by compromising the logic of Builders (the components responsible for creating RIBs and their dependencies) or by exploiting insecure default dependency factories. Successfully injecting malicious dependencies allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code or manipulate the behavior of the RIBs that rely on these compromised dependencies.
    *   **Replace Existing Dependencies with Malicious Ones [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** If the dependency injection system allows for the runtime replacement of dependencies without proper authorization or integrity checks, an attacker who has compromised a privileged RIB can swap out legitimate dependencies with malicious versions. This allows the attacker to hijack the functionality of other RIBs and execute malicious code within their context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit State Management Issues [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_state_management_issues__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path targets vulnerabilities arising from how the application manages and shares state between different Ribs components. If state management is not implemented carefully, attackers can manipulate shared state in unexpected ways, leading to inconsistent application behavior, security breaches, or the leakage of sensitive information. This includes scenarios like race conditions during state updates or inconsistent state across different RIBs leading to exploitable logic flaws. Additionally, if sensitive data is stored in globally accessible state without proper access controls, a compromised RIB can easily exfiltrate this information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Router Logic Flaws [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_router_logic_flaws__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path focuses on vulnerabilities in the routing logic that governs navigation between different Ribs within the application. If the routing mechanism is not properly secured, an attacker can potentially force navigation to unauthorized Ribs, bypassing intended workflows or accessing sensitive parts of the application. This could involve directly manipulating the routing logic or bypassing navigation guards or interceptors designed to restrict access.
