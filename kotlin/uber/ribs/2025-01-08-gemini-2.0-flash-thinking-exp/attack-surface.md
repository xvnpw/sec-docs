## Attack Surface: [Router State Manipulation via Deep Links/External Intents](./attack_surfaces/router_state_manipulation_via_deep_linksexternal_intents.md)

* **Attack Surface: Router State Manipulation via Deep Links/External Intents**
    * **Description:** Attackers can craft malicious deep links or external intents to force the application into unintended states or access restricted parts of the application by manipulating parameters that influence routing decisions.
    * **How Ribs Contributes:** Ribs Routers are responsible for managing the application's navigation and state transitions. If the Router's logic for handling deep links or external intents relies on untrusted input without proper validation, it becomes vulnerable. The modular nature of Ribs, with distinct Routers managing different parts of the application, can create more entry points for such attacks if not secured.
    * **Example:** An e-commerce app uses a deep link like `myapp://product?id=123`. An attacker could try `myapp://admin_panel` if the Router doesn't properly restrict access based on authentication or authorization within the routing logic.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive features, bypassing authentication or authorization checks, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all parameters used in deep links and when handling external intents within the Router.
        * **Authentication and Authorization Checks:** Ensure that all routing decisions leading to sensitive Ribs or functionalities are protected by proper authentication and authorization checks.
        * **Whitelist Known Deep Link Schemes:** If possible, restrict the allowed schemes and paths for deep links to prevent unexpected navigation.
        * **Use Secure Intent Handling Mechanisms:**  Utilize secure mechanisms provided by the underlying platform for handling intents.

## Attack Surface: [Interactor Business Logic Vulnerabilities Exposed by Ribs Structure](./attack_surfaces/interactor_business_logic_vulnerabilities_exposed_by_ribs_structure.md)

* **Attack Surface: Interactor Business Logic Vulnerabilities Exposed by Ribs Structure**
    * **Description:** While business logic flaws aren't inherently a Ribs issue, the framework's structure can sometimes expose or amplify vulnerabilities if the interaction between Interactors and other components isn't carefully designed and secured.
    * **How Ribs Contributes:** The clear separation of concerns in Ribs, with Interactors handling business logic, means that vulnerabilities within this logic are more isolated and potentially easier to identify and exploit if not properly secured. Dependencies injected into the Interactor could also be a source of vulnerabilities if not managed carefully.
    * **Example:** An Interactor responsible for processing payments might have a flaw in its logic that allows bypassing certain security checks if specific conditions are met. This flaw might be more easily exploitable due to the defined interfaces and data flow within the Ribs architecture.
    * **Impact:** Data manipulation, unauthorized actions, financial loss, privilege escalation depending on the nature of the business logic flaw.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Business Logic Design:** Implement secure coding practices and thorough testing of the business logic within Interactors.
        * **Input Validation within Interactors:**  Perform rigorous input validation and sanitization for all data processed by the Interactor.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege for Dependencies:** Ensure that Interactors only have access to the necessary dependencies and that these dependencies are secure.
        * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the Interactor logic and its interactions with other Rib components.

## Attack Surface: [Builder Dependency Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/builder_dependency_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Attack Surface: Builder Dependency Injection Vulnerabilities**
    * **Description:** Ribs relies heavily on dependency injection via Builders. If Builders are not configured securely, they could potentially inject malicious or unintended dependencies into Ribs, leading to unexpected behavior or security flaws.
    * **How Ribs Contributes:** The core mechanism of Ribs component creation involves Builders and dependency injection. A compromised or misconfigured Builder can have a significant impact on the security of the entire Rib.
    * **Example:** A Builder might be configured to inject a logging service that, if compromised, could be used to exfiltrate data. Or, a malicious dependency could be injected that replaces a legitimate service with a compromised one.
    * **Impact:**  Code injection, data exfiltration, unauthorized access, denial of service depending on the nature of the malicious dependency.
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Builder Configuration:** Ensure that Builders are configured to inject only trusted and necessary dependencies.
        * **Dependency Integrity Checks:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of dependencies being injected.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege for Dependencies:** Grant components only the necessary permissions and access through their dependencies.
        * **Regular Dependency Updates:** Keep all dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
