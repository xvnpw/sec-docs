# Threat Model Analysis for uber/ribs

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access via Incorrect Routing](./threats/unauthorized_access_via_incorrect_routing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might manipulate the application's state or craft specific navigation requests to exploit flaws in the Ribs Router's logic. This could allow them to bypass intended navigation flows and access Ribs and associated data they shouldn't have access to. For example, by manipulating parameters or state, they could directly navigate to a restricted "admin" Rib.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, unauthorized modification of data, or execution of privileged actions.
    *   **Affected Ribs Component:** Router (specifically the navigation logic and state management within the Router).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict authorization checks within the Router's `route()` or similar navigation methods, verifying user permissions before allowing navigation.
        *   Ensure that state transitions used for routing are carefully controlled, validated, and resistant to manipulation.
        *   Avoid exposing internal Rib identifiers or navigation paths that could be easily guessed or manipulated.
        *   Thoroughly test all navigation paths, including edge cases and attempts to bypass intended flows.

## Threat: [State Manipulation Leading to Privilege Escalation](./threats/state_manipulation_leading_to_privilege_escalation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could potentially manipulate the application's state, especially if state is shared or passed insecurely between Ribs components. By altering specific state variables managed by Ribs, they might trick the application into granting them higher privileges or performing actions they are not authorized to do. For instance, modifying a state variable that controls user roles within an Interactor.
    *   **Impact:** Gain unauthorized access to features or data, perform actions on behalf of other users, or disrupt critical application functionality.
    *   **Affected Ribs Component:** Interactors (responsible for handling business logic and state updates), potentially Routers (if state is used for routing decisions and those decisions are vulnerable to state manipulation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement immutable state patterns where appropriate to prevent direct modification.
        *   Carefully define the scope and lifecycle of state variables, minimizing shared mutable state.
        *   Employ robust validation and sanitization of state data within Interactors before use.
        *   Avoid directly exposing state management mechanisms or internal state variables that could be targeted for manipulation.
        *   Consider using dedicated state management libraries with built-in security features and access controls.

## Threat: [Dependency Injection Vulnerabilities Leading to Component Compromise](./threats/dependency_injection_vulnerabilities_leading_to_component_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** If the dependency injection mechanism used within the Ribs application is not configured securely, an attacker might be able to inject malicious or compromised dependencies into Ribs components during their creation. This could allow them to completely control the behavior of the affected Rib, access sensitive data managed by it, or perform unauthorized actions within its scope.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of individual Ribs, potentially leading to wider application compromise and data breaches.
    *   **Affected Ribs Component:** Builders (responsible for creating Rib instances and injecting dependencies), potentially the dependency injection framework itself as used by Ribs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully manage dependencies and their sources, ensuring they come from trusted repositories.
        *   Use reputable dependency injection frameworks and strictly adhere to their security best practices, including secure configuration options.
        *   Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of injected dependencies, such as using checksums or digital signatures.
        *   Adopt the principle of least privilege when injecting dependencies, granting them only the necessary permissions.
        *   Regularly audit the dependency graph for unexpected or suspicious dependencies.
