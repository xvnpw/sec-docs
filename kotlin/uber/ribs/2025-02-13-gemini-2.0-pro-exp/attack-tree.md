## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Inter-RIB Communication [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_inter-rib_communication__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most significant attack vector, leveraging the core communication mechanism of RIBs. Attackers aim to intercept, modify, or inject messages to achieve their goals.

*   **Attack Vectors:**

    *   **Intercept RIB Messages [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Gaining access to the messages exchanged between RIBs.
        *   **Sub-Vectors:**
            *   **Hook into Message Passing Mechanism (e.g., using Frida) [CRITICAL]**
                *   **Description:** Using tools like Frida (on Android/iOS) or similar techniques to intercept messages at the application level, bypassing network-level security.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium
                *   **Impact:** High
                *   **Effort:** Medium
                *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
            *   **Exploit Weaknesses in Custom Message Serialization/Deserialization [CRITICAL]**
                *   **Description:** If custom serialization/deserialization is used, exploiting vulnerabilities in this process (e.g., insecure deserialization leading to code execution).
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if custom and poorly implemented)
                *   **Impact:** High (potential for RCE)
                *   **Effort:** High
                *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Modify RIB Messages in Transit (if integrity checks are missing) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Altering the content of messages after interception to manipulate data or application state.  Relies on the absence of integrity checks.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on interception success)
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (easier with integrity checks)
    * **Inject Forged RIB Messages (AND) [HIGH RISK]:**
        * **Description:** Creating and sending fake messages to trigger unintended actions or state changes.
        * **Sub-Vectors:**
            *   **Bypass Message Authentication/Validation (if any) [CRITICAL]**
                *   **Description:** Circumventing any existing security measures that verify the authenticity or validity of messages.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if authentication is weak/missing)
                *   **Impact:** High
                *   **Effort:** Medium
                *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (easier with authentication)
            *   **Craft Valid Message Payloads that Trigger Undesired State Changes [CRITICAL]**
                *   **Description:** Constructing message payloads that, while syntactically valid, cause the application to behave in a way that benefits the attacker.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium
                *   **Impact:** High
                *   **Effort:** Medium
                *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Gain Unauthorized Access to a RIB's Scope [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__gain_unauthorized_access_to_a_rib's_scope__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Accessing data and functionality within a RIB's scope that should be restricted.

*   **Attack Vectors:**

    *   **Bypass Scope Access Controls (if improperly implemented) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting flaws in the implementation of scope access controls to gain access to data or functionality within another RIB's scope.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Directly Modify RIB State [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__directly_modify_rib_state__high_risk_.md)

* **Description:** Bypassing the intended communication and state management mechanisms to directly alter the internal state of a RIB.

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Exploit Weaknesses in State Management Logic (AND):**
        * **Sub-Vectors:**
            *   **Bypass State Validation Checks (if any) [CRITICAL]**
                *   **Description:** Circumventing checks that are in place to ensure the validity of state transitions.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if validation is weak/missing)
                *   **Impact:** High
                *   **Effort:** Medium
