# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for uber/ribs

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Architectural Reviews (RIBs-Focused)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_architectural_reviews__ribs-focused_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **RIB-Specific Review Guidelines:** Create a document *specifically* addressing RIB architecture.  This includes:
        *   **Maximum Nesting Depth:** Define a hard limit on the depth of the RIB tree.
        *   **Complexity Metrics:**  Define metrics like the number of children a RIB can have, the number of interactor/presenter/router methods, and the complexity of data passed between RIBs.  Set thresholds for these metrics.
        *   **Data Flow Analysis (Inter-RIB):**  Mandate tracing the flow of data *between* RIBs, identifying potential data leaks or excessive data sharing.
        *   **Justification of RIB Existence and Placement:**  Require developers to justify *why* a RIB exists and *why* it's placed at a specific level in the hierarchy.  Challenge any unnecessary complexity.
    2.  **Mandatory RIB-Structure Reviews:**  Enforce mandatory code reviews for *any* change that adds, removes, or modifies a RIB, or changes the communication between RIBs.
    3.  **Visualization:**  Use visualization tools (even custom-built ones) to display the RIB tree during reviews, making it easier to understand the relationships and potential attack vectors.
    4.  **Document RIB-Specific Review Findings:**  All review comments and resolutions related to the RIB architecture must be documented.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Deeply Nested RIB Vulnerability Exploitation (Severity: High) - Exploiting a vulnerability in a deeply nested RIB to gain wider access.  This is *specific* to RIBs due to the hierarchical nature.
    *   **Threat:** Unintended Inter-RIB Data Exposure (Severity: Medium) - Complex RIB hierarchies leading to accidental data leakage between RIBs.
    *   **Threat:** Difficult RIB Vulnerability Remediation (Severity: Medium) - Complexity hindering the identification and fixing of vulnerabilities *within the RIB structure*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Deeply Nested RIB Vulnerability Exploitation:** Risk significantly reduced by preventing overly complex hierarchies and enforcing thorough review of inter-RIB data flow.
    *   **Unintended Inter-RIB Data Exposure:** Risk reduced by identifying and correcting unnecessary data sharing during RIB-focused reviews.
    *   **Difficult RIB Vulnerability Remediation:** Risk reduced by making the RIB architecture easier to understand and modify.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical - adapt to your project)
    *   Mandatory code reviews exist, but lack RIB-specific focus.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Hypothetical - adapt to your project)
    *   No specific complexity metrics or thresholds for RIBs.
    *   No dedicated document outlining RIB architecture review criteria.
    *   Visualization tools are not consistently used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Context-Aware Inter-RIB Input Validation](./mitigation_strategies/context-aware_inter-rib_input_validation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Inter-RIB Communication Points:**  For each RIB, identify *all* points where it receives data from other RIBs (listeners, streams, method calls, etc.).
    2.  **Define Strict Inter-RIB Data Contracts:**  Create *explicit* data contracts (interfaces, data classes) for *all* inter-RIB communication.  Avoid generic types.  These contracts define the *exact* data types and expected values.
    3.  **Implement Validation at RIB Boundaries:**  In each RIB's interactor (or the component handling incoming data), implement validation logic that checks *all* data received from *other RIBs* against the defined data contracts.
    4.  **RIB-Contextual Validation:**  Go beyond basic type checking.  Validate data *in the context of the receiving RIB's responsibilities*.  This is crucial:
        *   **Example:** If a RIB expects a user ID from a parent RIB, it should not only check that it's an integer but also that it's a *valid* user ID within the system and that the parent RIB is *authorized* to provide that user ID.
    5.  **Fail Fast at RIB Boundary:**  If validation fails, *immediately* reject the input *before* any further processing within the RIB.  Log the failure securely.
    6. **Regularly review and update validation logic:** As the RIBs architecture and business rules evolve, the validation logic should be reviewed and updated.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Inter-RIB Injection Attacks (Severity: High) - A compromised RIB injects malicious code into another RIB.  This is *specific* to the inter-RIB communication.
    *   **Threat:** Inter-RIB Unauthorized Actions (Severity: High) - A compromised RIB sends invalid data to trigger unauthorized actions in another RIB.
    *   **Threat:** RIB Data Corruption (Severity: Medium) - Invalid data propagates through the RIB tree, leading to inconsistent state.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Inter-RIB Injection Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced by preventing malicious code from crossing RIB boundaries.
    *   **Inter-RIB Unauthorized Actions:** Risk significantly reduced by ensuring that only valid data triggers actions within a RIB.
    *   **RIB Data Corruption:** Risk reduced by preventing invalid data from entering a RIB.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical)
    *   Basic type checking on some inter-RIB communication.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Hypothetical)
    *   Comprehensive, context-aware validation at *all* RIB boundaries.
    *   Strict data contracts for *all* inter-RIB communication.
    *   Consistent "fail fast" strategy.

## Mitigation Strategy: [RIB-Specific Immutable State Management](./mitigation_strategies/rib-specific_immutable_state_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify RIB State:**  For each RIB, clearly identify all variables that constitute the RIB's internal state.
    2.  **Mandate Immutable Data Structures:**  *Require* the use of immutable data structures (e.g., data classes in Kotlin, records in Java, immutable collections) for representing the RIB's state.
    3.  **New State on Change:**  When the RIB's state needs to change, create a *completely new* immutable state object with the updated values.  *Never* modify the existing state object in place.
    4.  **Update References:**  Update any references within the RIB to point to the new immutable state object.
    5.  **Prohibit Mutable State:**  Explicitly forbid the use of mutable data structures for storing RIB state.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** RIB-Specific Race Conditions (Severity: Medium) - Concurrent operations within a RIB (or due to inter-RIB interactions) leading to inconsistent state.  This is exacerbated by the asynchronous nature of RIBs.
    *   **Threat:** Unintended RIB State Side Effects (Severity: Medium) - A change in one part of a RIB (or due to an interaction with another RIB) unexpectedly modifies the RIB's state.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **RIB-Specific Race Conditions:** Risk significantly reduced by eliminating the possibility of concurrent modification of the RIB's state.
    *   **Unintended RIB State Side Effects:** Risk significantly reduced by preventing in-place modification of the RIB's state.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical)
    *   Some RIBs use immutable data structures for some parts of their state.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Hypothetical)
    *   Consistent use of immutable state management across *all* RIBs.
    *   Explicit prohibition of mutable state within RIBs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure RIB Router and Deep Link Handling](./mitigation_strategies/secure_rib_router_and_deep_link_handling.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify RIB Deep Link Entry Points:** Determine all the ways deep links can activate specific RIBs within the application.
    2.  **Define Allowed RIB Deep Link Patterns:** Create a whitelist of allowed deep link patterns, *specifically* mapping patterns to the RIBs they are allowed to activate.
    3.  **Validate at RIB Router Level:**  When a deep link is received, the *RIB Router* (or the component handling deep links) must validate it against the whitelist.  Reject any links that don't match.
    4.  **RIB-Specific Parameter Validation:**  Thoroughly validate *all* parameters extracted from the deep link *before* passing them to the target RIB.  Use the same context-aware validation as for inter-RIB communication.
    5.  **Authentication and Authorization *Before* RIB Activation:**  Ensure that deep links *cannot* bypass authentication or authorization.  If a deep link targets a RIB that requires authentication, the user *must* be authenticated *before* the RIB is activated.  The Router should enforce this.
    6. **Regularly review and update the whitelist and validation logic:** As new RIBs and deep links are added, the whitelist and validation logic should be updated.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Unauthorized RIB Access (Severity: High) - An attacker uses a crafted deep link to directly activate a restricted RIB, bypassing normal navigation and authorization.
    *   **Threat:** RIB Parameter Tampering (Severity: High) - An attacker modifies deep link parameters to cause the target RIB to behave in an unintended way.
    *   **Threat:** Bypassing Authentication to Reach RIB (Severity: High) - An attacker uses a deep link to avoid login and directly access a RIB.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized RIB Access:** Risk significantly reduced by validating deep links against a whitelist and enforcing authorization *before* RIB activation.
    *   **RIB Parameter Tampering:** Risk significantly reduced by thorough parameter validation *before* the RIB receives the data.
    *   **Bypassing Authentication to Reach RIB:** Risk significantly reduced by requiring authentication *before* RIB activation.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical)
    *   Basic validation of deep link structure.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Hypothetical)
    *   No whitelist of allowed deep link patterns mapped to specific RIBs.
    *   Comprehensive parameter validation *before* RIB activation.
    *   Consistent enforcement of authentication and authorization *before* RIB activation.
