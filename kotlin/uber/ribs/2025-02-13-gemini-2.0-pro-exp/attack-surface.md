## Attack Surface: [Unintended RIB Activation/Deactivation](./attack_surfaces/unintended_rib_activationdeactivation.md)

*   **1. Unintended RIB Activation/Deactivation**

    *   **Description:**  Attackers manipulate application state to trigger the attachment or detachment of RIBs in an unintended sequence, leading to unexpected behavior or exposure of sensitive data/functionality.
    *   **How RIBs Contributes:** RIBs' core mechanic is the dynamic attachment and detachment of RIBs based on application logic and user interaction. This dynamic nature, *fundamental to RIBs*, creates opportunities for manipulation.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious deep link that forces the application to detach a currently active "UserProfileRIB" (displaying sensitive user data) and attach a "LoginRIB," potentially bypassing authentication checks if the `LoginRIB` doesn't properly re-validate the user session.  This leverages the RIB lifecycle directly.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data, unauthorized access to functionality, application instability, potential for privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the data/functionality exposed).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   **Strict Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate *all* inputs that influence RIB lifecycle, including deep links, URL parameters, and data passed through streams (RxJava, etc.).  Use whitelisting where possible. This is crucial because RIB attachment/detachment is often driven by these inputs.
            *   **Robust State Management:** Implement strong state validation within each RIB's Interactor to prevent invalid state transitions, even if triggered by unexpected `attach`/`detach` calls.  This directly addresses the statefulness of RIBs.
            *   **Defensive Router Logic:**  Routers (a core RIBs component) should handle unexpected `attach`/`detach` calls gracefully, preventing crashes or unintended state changes.  Consider adding preconditions to `attach`/`detach`.
            *   **Fuzz Testing:** Employ fuzz testing to identify potential race conditions and unexpected RIB lifecycle behavior. This is particularly important for the dynamic nature of RIBs.
            *   **Session Management:** Ensure proper session management that is *independent* of RIB attachment/detachment. RIBs should not be solely responsible for authentication.
        *   **User:** (Limited direct user mitigation, primarily relies on developer-side fixes)
            *   Be cautious about clicking on links from untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Inter-RIB Messaging](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_inter-rib_messaging.md)

*   **2. Unauthorized Inter-RIB Messaging**

    *   **Description:** Attackers intercept, modify, or inject messages between RIBs to gain access to sensitive data or influence application behavior.
    *   **How RIBs Contributes:** RIBs communicate through Listeners, shared services, or streams. This *inter-RIB communication pattern is a defining characteristic of RIBs* and creates potential interception points.
    *   **Example:** If Listeners (a core RIBs concept) are improperly scoped, a malicious RIB could register itself to receive messages intended for another RIB, eavesdropping on sensitive data. This directly exploits the RIBs communication model.
    *   **Impact:** Data leakage, unauthorized access to functionality, application manipulation, potential for privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the data and the level of control gained).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   **Narrowly Scoped Listeners:** Use interfaces with the *minimum* necessary methods for Listeners (a key RIBs component).  Avoid broad interfaces.
            *   **Sender/Receiver Validation:**  Validate the sender and intended receiver of *all* inter-RIB messages.  Ensure they are authorized to communicate.  This is crucial within the RIBs communication framework.
            *   **Secure Shared Services:** If shared services are used *within the RIBs context*, implement strict access controls and consider encryption.
            *   **Dependency Injection Audits:** Regularly review the dependency injection configuration (used extensively in RIBs) to prevent malicious component replacement.
        *   **User:** (Limited direct user mitigation)
            *   Install apps only from trusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Component Injection (via Dependency Injection)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_component_injection__via_dependency_injection_.md)

*   **3. Malicious Component Injection (via Dependency Injection)**

    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious components (Interactors, Presenters, Routers, Listeners) into the RIB tree, hijacking application control.
    *   **How RIBs Contributes:** RIBs *fundamentally relies* on dependency injection for component management. This heavy reliance on DI is a core aspect of the RIBs architecture.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability to replace a legitimate `PaymentInteractor` (a core RIBs component) with a malicious one. This directly targets the RIBs component structure.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete application compromise, data theft, financial loss, reputational damage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   **Secure Dependency Injection Framework:** Use a well-established and secure DI framework (e.g., Dagger 2) and keep it up-to-date. This is essential given RIBs' reliance on DI.
            *   **Static Dependency Definition:** Define dependencies statically whenever possible. Avoid dynamic loading, which is riskier within the RIBs context.
            *   **Code Signing and Integrity Checks:** Prevent loading of unauthorized code. This is crucial for protecting the integrity of RIBs components.
            *   **Secure Build Process:**  Ensure the build process is secure.
            *   **Regular Dependency Audits:**  Regularly review the dependency injection configuration (central to RIBs) to ensure only legitimate components are used.
        *   **User:** (Limited direct user mitigation)
            *   Install apps only from trusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [RIB State Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/rib_state_manipulation.md)

*   **4. RIB State Manipulation**

    *   **Description:** Attackers directly modify a RIB's internal state to cause unexpected behavior, bypass security checks, or gain unauthorized access.
    *   **How RIBs Contributes:** Each RIB *inherently* manages its own state, which is crucial for its operation. This *statefulness is a core property of RIBs*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the `UserProfileInteractor` (a core RIBs component) to directly modify a state variable. This directly targets the internal state management of a RIB.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to functionality, privilege escalation, data corruption, application instability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the privileges gained).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   **Robust State Validation:** Implement comprehensive state validation within the Interactor (a core RIBs component) to prevent invalid state transitions.
            *   **Immutable State:** Use immutable data structures for the RIB's state. This makes direct modification much harder, protecting the RIB's internal state.
            *   **Encapsulation:**  Encapsulate the RIB's state and provide access *only* through well-defined methods (getters and setters) that include validation.  Do *not* expose state variables directly. This is crucial for protecting the integrity of a RIB.
            *   **Input Validation:** Validate *all* inputs that can affect the RIB's state.
        *   **User:** (No direct user mitigation).
