Okay, let's create a design document for Uber's RIBs framework.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

RIBS (Router, Interactor, Builder) is a cross-platform architecture framework developed by Uber for building mobile applications with large teams and complex business logic.  It's designed to promote code reusability, testability, and maintainability across iOS and Android platforms.  The primary business goals driving RIBs are:

*   Developer Productivity: Enable large teams to work concurrently on different parts of the application with minimal conflicts and dependencies.
*   Code Quality and Stability:  Reduce bugs and regressions through a well-defined architecture that promotes testability and isolation.
*   Scalability:  Support the development of large, complex applications that can evolve over time.
*   Maintainability: Make it easier to understand, modify, and extend the codebase.
*   Cross-Platform Consistency:  Ensure a consistent architecture and development approach across iOS and Android.

Business priorities:

*   Rapid feature development and iteration.
*   High app stability and performance.
*   Efficient onboarding of new developers.
*   Reduced long-term maintenance costs.

Most important business risks:

*   Increased development time due to the complexity of the RIBs architecture.
*   Steeper learning curve for new developers unfamiliar with the RIBs pattern.
*   Potential performance overhead if RIBs are not implemented correctly.
*   Difficulty in refactoring existing applications to adopt the RIBs architecture.
*   Over-engineering for smaller, simpler applications.

# SECURITY POSTURE

The RIBs framework itself doesn't directly address security concerns. It's an architectural pattern focused on application structure and workflow. Security is the responsibility of the application built *using* RIBs. However, the structure imposed by RIBs *can* facilitate the implementation of security controls.

Existing Security Controls (as inferred from the framework's design and purpose, not explicitly stated in the repository):

*   security control: Modularity: RIBs promote a modular design, which can help isolate security-sensitive components. (Implemented in the RIBs architecture itself).
*   security control: Testability: The emphasis on testability in RIBs allows for easier implementation of security unit and integration tests. (Described in RIBs documentation and examples).
*   security control: Defined Data Flow: The unidirectional data flow in RIBs can simplify reasoning about data access and control. (Implemented in the RIBs architecture itself).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The framework itself does not provide built-in security mechanisms (e.g., authentication, authorization, encryption). These must be implemented separately within each RIB or shared components.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on developers to correctly implement security best practices within each RIB.
*   accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities if inter-RIB communication is not properly secured.

Recommended Security Controls (High Priority):

*   security control: Secure Inter-RIB Communication: Implement secure mechanisms for communication between RIBs, especially if data is passed between them. This might involve using a shared, secure data store or encrypting data in transit.
*   security control: Input Validation: Enforce strict input validation in each RIB's Interactor to prevent injection attacks and other data-related vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Least Privilege: Design each RIB with the principle of least privilege in mind, granting it only the necessary permissions to access data and perform its functions.
*   security control: Secure Storage: If RIBs handle sensitive data, ensure that this data is stored securely, using platform-specific secure storage mechanisms (e.g., Keychain on iOS, Keystore on Android).

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: RIBs architecture doesn't dictate authentication, but any application built with it likely needs a robust authentication mechanism. This should be handled by a dedicated RIB or a set of RIBs responsible for user login, session management, and token handling.
*   Authorization: Access control should be enforced within each RIB, determining whether the current user (or the RIB itself) has the necessary permissions to perform specific actions or access certain data. This can be implemented using role-based access control (RBAC) or other authorization schemes.
*   Input Validation: All input received by a RIB (from user interactions, network requests, or other RIBs) must be validated to ensure it conforms to expected formats and constraints. This is crucial for preventing injection attacks and other data-related vulnerabilities.
*   Cryptography: If sensitive data is handled, appropriate cryptographic techniques should be used to protect it. This includes encrypting data at rest and in transit, using secure hashing algorithms, and managing cryptographic keys securely.
