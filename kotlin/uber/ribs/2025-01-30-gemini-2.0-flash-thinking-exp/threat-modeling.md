# Threat Model Analysis for uber/ribs

## Threat: [Unauthorized RIB Access](./threats/unauthorized_rib_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker bypasses intended navigation flows or authorization checks in Routers to directly access RIBs and functionalities they are not authorized to use. This could be achieved by manipulating URL parameters, deep links, or exploiting flaws in the Router's path matching or authorization logic.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure if sensitive data is exposed in the unauthorized RIB, unauthorized actions if the RIB allows modifications or operations, privilege escalation if the accessed RIB has higher privileges.
*   **Affected RIBs Component:** Router (Routing logic, authorization checks within Routers)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust authorization checks within Routers before attaching RIBs.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when designing RIB access control.
    *   Regularly review and test routing logic and authorization rules.
    *   Avoid relying solely on client-side routing for security; enforce server-side authorization where necessary.

## Threat: [Business Logic Flaws in Interactors](./threats/business_logic_flaws_in_interactors.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the core business logic implemented within Interactors. This could involve exploiting incorrect input validation, flawed state transitions, race conditions in state updates, or other logical errors to manipulate data, perform unauthorized actions, or cause denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized actions (e.g., unauthorized transactions, data modification), denial of service, exploitation of business logic for financial gain or other malicious purposes.
*   **Affected RIBs Component:** Interactor (Business logic within Interactors, input validation, state management)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization in Interactors.
    *   Design and implement business logic with security in mind, considering potential attack vectors.
    *   Conduct thorough code reviews and security testing of Interactor logic.
    *   Use unit tests and integration tests to verify the correctness and security of business logic.

## Threat: [State Management Issues Leading to Data Exposure](./threats/state_management_issues_leading_to_data_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data managed by Interactors is unintentionally exposed or leaked due to improper state management practices. This could occur through insecure caching, excessive logging, or unintended sharing of state between RIBs. An attacker could gain access to this exposed data through various means, such as accessing logs, exploiting caching vulnerabilities, or intercepting inter-RIB communication.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, privacy violations, potential for unauthorized access to sensitive user data, compliance violations if sensitive data is leaked.
*   **Affected RIBs Component:** Interactor (State management within Interactors, data handling, logging, caching)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement secure state management practices, avoiding storing sensitive data unnecessarily.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
    *   Minimize logging of sensitive data and ensure logs are securely stored and accessed.
    *   Carefully control data sharing between RIBs and enforce the principle of least privilege.
    *   Regularly review state management practices and data handling procedures.

## Threat: [Interactor Dependency Injection Vulnerabilities](./threats/interactor_dependency_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the dependency injection mechanism used by Interactors. If dependencies are not properly validated or secured, a malicious dependency could be injected, replacing a legitimate service with a compromised one. This malicious dependency could then be used to compromise the Interactor's functionality or security, potentially leading to code execution or data manipulation.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, data manipulation, denial of service, complete compromise of the Interactor and potentially the application.
*   **Affected RIBs Component:** Interactor (Dependency injection mechanism, dependency resolution)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use a secure dependency injection framework and ensure it is properly configured.
    *   Validate and sanitize all dependencies before injection.
    *   Implement integrity checks for dependencies to ensure they have not been tampered with.
    *   Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Restrict access to dependency configuration and injection mechanisms.
