*   **Threat:** Interactor Logic Bypass
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates input or application state to bypass critical business logic checks within an Interactor. This could involve sending unexpected data, exploiting race conditions, or triggering unintended state transitions.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions, data manipulation, privilege escalation, or bypassing security controls.
    *   **Affected Component:** Interactor (specific functions handling business logic and state transitions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the Interactor. Use state machines or well-defined state management patterns to prevent invalid state transitions. Thoroughly test Interactor logic with various inputs and edge cases. Apply the principle of least privilege to Interactor actions.

*   **Threat:** Builder Dependency Poisoning
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the dependencies used by the Builder to construct RIB components. This could involve replacing legitimate dependencies with malicious ones, leading to the instantiation of compromised components.
    *   **Impact:** Code injection, arbitrary code execution within the application context, or compromised application state.
    *   **Affected Component:** Builder (dependency injection mechanism and component creation logic).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Secure the dependency injection framework used by RIBs. Implement integrity checks for dependencies. Use dependency pinning and verify checksums. Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Inter-Interactor Communication
    *   **Description:** Communication channels between Interactors are not properly secured, allowing an attacker to intercept, eavesdrop on, or manipulate data exchanged between them. This could involve exploiting shared dependencies or communication patterns.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to information, or manipulation of application state by interfering with inter-Interactor communication.
    *   **Affected Component:** Interactor (communication mechanisms, shared dependencies).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Carefully design inter-Interactor communication channels, minimizing the sharing of sensitive data. Consider using secure communication patterns or encryption for sensitive data exchange. Implement access controls on shared resources.

*   **Threat:** Router Hierarchy Bypass
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the parent-child relationship between Routers to bypass authorization checks or gain access to child RIBs without proper authorization from the parent.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to features or data within child RIBs, bypassing intended security boundaries.
    *   **Affected Component:** Router (parent-child relationship management, authorization logic).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement robust authorization checks at each level of the Router hierarchy. Ensure proper validation of navigation requests within parent Routers before allowing access to child RIBs. Avoid relying solely on the presence of a parent for authorization.
