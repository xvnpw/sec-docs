### Key Attack Surface List (RIBs Architecture - High & Critical)

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Routing Logic
    *   **Description:** Flaws in the Router's logic for determining which child RIB to attach or detach, leading to unintended navigation or access.
    *   **How RIBs Contributes:** The Router component in RIBs is the central point for managing navigation and the lifecycle of child RIBs. Incorrect logic here directly impacts the application's flow.
    *   **Example:** An attacker manipulates a deep link parameter that the Router uses to decide which RIB to display, bypassing authentication checks for a specific feature.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to features, unexpected application states, potential data breaches if the accessed RIB handles sensitive information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation for any data used in routing decisions within the Router.
        *   Thoroughly test routing logic with various inputs and edge cases, including unexpected or malicious values.
        *   Avoid relying solely on client-side parameters for critical routing decisions.
        *   Implement proper authorization checks within the Router before attaching sensitive RIBs.

*   **Attack Surface:** Dependency Injection Vulnerabilities in Builders
    *   **Description:**  Exploiting weaknesses in the Builder's dependency injection mechanism to inject malicious or unintended dependencies into RIBs.
    *   **How RIBs Contributes:** Builders are responsible for creating and configuring RIB instances, including injecting dependencies. A compromised Builder can inject malicious objects.
    *   **Example:** An attacker finds a way to influence the dependencies provided to a Builder, injecting a malicious logger that exfiltrates data or a compromised service that alters application behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the affected RIB, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized actions, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly control the sources of dependencies used by Builders.
        *   Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and trustworthiness of injected dependencies.
        *   Use compile-time dependency injection frameworks where possible to reduce runtime manipulation risks.
        *   Avoid dynamic dependency resolution based on untrusted input.

*   **Attack Surface:** Improper Interactor Input Validation
    *   **Description:** Interactors failing to adequately validate data received from Presenters or external sources, leading to vulnerabilities within the Interactor's domain.
    *   **How RIBs Contributes:** Interactors handle the business logic and data processing within a specific RIB. Lack of validation here directly exposes the RIB to data-related attacks.
    *   **Example:** An Interactor responsible for processing user input for a search function doesn't sanitize the input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code or queries that could impact the underlying data source (though this leans towards general vulnerabilities, the scope is within the RIB).
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unexpected application behavior, potential security breaches if the Interactor interacts with sensitive data or external systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement comprehensive input validation within Interactors for all data received.
        *   Use strong typing and data validation libraries.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when accessing and manipulating data within Interactors.
        *   Sanitize and encode output data appropriately to prevent injection attacks.
