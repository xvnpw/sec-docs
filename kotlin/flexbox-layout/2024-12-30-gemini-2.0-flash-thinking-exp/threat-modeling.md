- **Threat:** Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) due to Excessive Layout Calculations
    - **Description:** An attacker could provide input or manipulate data that, when rendered using `flexbox-layout`, results in an extremely complex layout. This could involve a very large number of nested flex items, intricate sizing constraints, or rapidly changing layout properties. The browser would struggle to calculate and render this complex layout, leading to freezing, unresponsiveness, and high CPU usage on the client's machine.
    - **Impact:** The user experience is severely degraded. The application becomes unusable, potentially leading to frustration and abandonment. In extreme cases, the user's browser might crash.
    - **Affected Component:** Core layout calculation logic of `flexbox-layout` as it interacts with the browser's rendering engine.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent the generation of excessively complex layouts based on user input.
        - Set reasonable limits on the number of dynamically generated flex items or the depth of flexbox nesting.
        - Perform thorough performance testing with various data sets and layout scenarios to identify potential bottlenecks.
        - Consider implementing techniques like virtualization or pagination for displaying large datasets within flex containers.
