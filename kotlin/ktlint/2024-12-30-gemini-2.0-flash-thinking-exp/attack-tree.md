**Threat Model: Compromising Application via ktlint Exploitation (High-Risk Focus)**

**Attacker's Goal:** Execute arbitrary code within the application's environment or introduce malicious code into the application's codebase through ktlint.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

*   *** Influence ktlint's Behavior [CRITICAL] (OR) ***
    *   *** Supply Malicious Kotlin Code (OR) ***
        *   *** Inject Malicious Code Snippets [CRITICAL] ***
    *   *** Manipulate ktlint Configuration [CRITICAL] (OR) ***
        *   *** Inject Malicious Configuration ***
*   Exploit ktlint's Internal Vulnerabilities (OR)
    *   *** Exploit Known ktlint Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL] ***
    *   *** Exploit ktlint's Dependencies [CRITICAL] ***

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **Influence ktlint's Behavior [CRITICAL]:**
    *   This node is critical because successfully influencing ktlint's behavior allows the attacker to manipulate how the application's code is processed, opening doors for introducing vulnerabilities or directly executing malicious code.

*   **Supply Malicious Kotlin Code:**
    *   This path is high-risk as it involves directly feeding ktlint code designed to exploit its processing logic.

    *   **Inject Malicious Code Snippets [CRITICAL]:**
        *   This is a critical node representing the successful injection of malicious code.
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts specific Kotlin code snippets that, when processed by ktlint's parsing or formatting engine, are transformed in a way that introduces security vulnerabilities into the application's codebase. This could involve exploiting edge cases, bugs, or unexpected behaviors in ktlint's code manipulation logic.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection (if the formatted code interacts with databases), remote code execution, or other security flaws depending on the context of the injected code.

*   **Manipulate ktlint Configuration [CRITICAL]:**
    *   This path is high-risk because controlling ktlint's configuration allows the attacker to dictate how ktlint operates, potentially disabling security checks or introducing malicious formatting rules.

    *   **Inject Malicious Configuration:**
        *   This attack vector involves modifying ktlint's configuration files to introduce malicious rules or settings.
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains access to the ktlint configuration files (e.g., `.editorconfig`, `.ktlint`) and modifies them to include custom rules that inject malicious code during the formatting process, disable specific linting rules that would have flagged vulnerabilities, or alter formatting in a way that introduces security flaws.
        *   **Potential Impact:**  Introduction of malicious code into the codebase, disabling of security checks leading to exploitable vulnerabilities, or subtle code changes that introduce security flaws.

*   **Exploit Known ktlint Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**
    *   This is a critical node representing the exploitation of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities within ktlint itself.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages publicly known vulnerabilities in a specific version of ktlint. This could involve providing specially crafted Kotlin code or configuration that triggers the vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution, arbitrary file access, or other forms of compromise within the environment where ktlint is running.
    *   **Potential Impact:**  Remote code execution on the build server or developer machine, access to sensitive files, or other forms of system compromise depending on the nature of the vulnerability.

*   **Exploit ktlint's Dependencies [CRITICAL]:**
    *   This is a critical node as it targets vulnerabilities in libraries that ktlint relies upon.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies a vulnerability in one of ktlint's dependencies. They then craft input (Kotlin code or configuration) that, when processed by ktlint, triggers the vulnerability in the underlying dependency. This could lead to various forms of compromise depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability.
    *   **Potential Impact:**  Remote code execution, denial of service, or other security breaches depending on the vulnerability in the compromised dependency.
