# Threat Model Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx.cli

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Excessive Arguments](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_excessive_arguments.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides an extremely large number of arguments or arguments with excessively long values directly through the command line. This overwhelms `kotlinx.cli`'s argument parsing logic, consuming excessive memory and CPU resources, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition where the application becomes unresponsive or crashes. The attacker leverages the library's functionality to process user input to cause harm.

**Impact:** **High**. The application becomes unavailable to legitimate users, disrupting services and potentially causing data loss or financial damage.

**Affected Component:** `kotlinx.cli`'s argument parsing logic (`ArgParser` and related classes).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Implement limits on the maximum number of allowed arguments within the `kotlinx.cli` configuration or through application-level checks before or during parsing.**
* **Implement size limits for string-based arguments within the `kotlinx.cli` configuration if supported, or by validating the length of parsed string arguments.**
* **Consider setting timeouts for the `kotlinx.cli` argument parsing process.** If parsing takes an unexpectedly long time, terminate the process.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Parsing Vulnerabilities in kotlinx.cli](./threats/denial_of_service_via_parsing_vulnerabilities_in_kotlinx_cli.md)

**Description:** A vulnerability exists within the `kotlinx.cli` library itself. An attacker crafts specific, malformed argument combinations that, when processed by `kotlinx.cli`, trigger errors, infinite loops, or excessive resource consumption within the library's parsing routines. This leads to a denial-of-service, preventing the application from functioning correctly. The vulnerability resides in the library's code responsible for handling user-provided input.

**Impact:** **High**. The application becomes unavailable, disrupting services.

**Affected Component:** Internal components of the `kotlinx.cli` library responsible for parsing and validating arguments.

**Risk Severity:** High (when a known vulnerability exists and is exploitable)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Keep the `kotlinx.cli` library updated to the latest stable version.** This ensures that known parsing vulnerabilities are patched.
* **Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases specifically for reported issues in `kotlinx.cli`.**
* **If feasible, implement input sanitization or validation *before* passing arguments to `kotlinx.cli` to potentially catch known problematic patterns (though this might be difficult without understanding the specifics of a potential vulnerability).**
