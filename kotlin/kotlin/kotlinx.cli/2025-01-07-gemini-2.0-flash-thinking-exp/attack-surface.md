# Attack Surface Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx.cli

## Attack Surface: [Argument Injection](./attack_surfaces/argument_injection.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts command-line arguments that, when processed by the application, lead to the execution of unintended commands or actions on the underlying system.
    * **How kotlinx.cli Contributes:** `kotlinx.cli` parses the command-line arguments provided by the user. If these parsed arguments are directly used to construct shell commands or interact with external processes without proper sanitization, it creates an entry point for injection.
    * **Example:** An application takes a filename as an argument: `--file "important.txt"`. An attacker could provide `--file "; rm -rf /"` which, if not properly handled, could lead to the execution of the `rm` command.
    * **Impact:**  Potentially complete system compromise, data loss, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize all parsed arguments before using them in any system calls or external process interactions. Escape special characters.
        * **Avoid Direct Shell Execution:**  Whenever possible, avoid directly constructing shell commands from user input. Use safer alternatives like dedicated libraries or APIs for interacting with the operating system.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the damage an attacker can cause.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Argument Converters](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_argument_converters.md)

* **Description:** If the application uses custom argument converters to transform input values, vulnerabilities within these converters can introduce security risks.
    * **How kotlinx.cli Contributes:** `kotlinx.cli` allows for custom converters. If these converters are not implemented securely, they can become attack vectors.
    * **Example:** A custom converter that deserializes data from a string without proper validation could be vulnerable to deserialization attacks.
    * **Impact:**  Depends on the vulnerability in the converter, ranging from information disclosure to remote code execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices when implementing custom argument converters.
        * **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate input within custom converters.
        * **Avoid Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** Be extremely cautious when deserializing data from command-line arguments.
