## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Processing Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_processing_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This node represents a broad category of vulnerabilities arising from how the application processes command-line input parsed by kotlinx.cli. Successful exploitation here can lead to severe consequences like code execution or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code/Commands [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_codecommands__high-risk_path_start_.md)

This path focuses on the attacker's ability to inject malicious code or commands into the application through command-line arguments. This is a critical threat due to the potential for complete system compromise or unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via Unsanitized Arguments [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_unsanitized_arguments__critical_node__high-risk_path_continues_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Supply Argument Containing Shell Metacharacters

**Description:** If the application uses parsed command-line arguments to execute system commands without proper sanitization or escaping of shell metacharacters (like `;`, `|`, `&`, `$()`, etc.), an attacker can inject arbitrary commands. The application will then unknowingly execute these attacker-supplied commands on the underlying operating system.

**Actionable Insight:**  Always sanitize or escape command-line arguments before using them in system calls. Use parameterized commands or libraries that handle escaping automatically.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Injection via Custom Converters [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection_via_custom_converters__critical_node__high-risk_path_continues_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Provide Input Exploiting Vulnerability in Custom Converter Logic

**Description:** kotlinx.cli allows defining custom converters for argument types. If a custom converter has vulnerabilities (e.g., fails to validate input, improperly handles exceptions, or uses `eval`-like constructs), an attacker can provide input that exploits these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code within the application's context. This means the attacker can run code with the same privileges as the application.

**Actionable Insight:** Thoroughly test and review custom converters for potential vulnerabilities. Ensure they perform robust input validation and handle errors securely. Avoid using dynamic code execution within converters.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion via Excessive Input [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion_via_excessive_input__high-risk_path_start_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Provide a large number of arguments or repeated options

**Description:** By providing an extremely large number of arguments or repeating options multiple times, an attacker can overwhelm the application's parsing logic and consume excessive resources (CPU, memory). This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.

**Actionable Insight:** Implement limits on the number of arguments and options that can be provided. Consider using techniques like request throttling or rate limiting at the application level.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Subcommand Handling (If Applicable) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_subcommand_handling__if_applicable___critical_node_.md)

This node becomes critical if the application utilizes subcommands provided by kotlinx.cli. It represents a separate attack surface where vulnerabilities in how subcommands are handled can be exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Commands into Subcommand Execution [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_commands_into_subcommand_execution__high-risk_path_start_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Supply malicious arguments that are passed to a vulnerable subcommand handler

**Description:** If the application uses subcommands and passes arguments to the handlers of these subcommands without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands. This is similar to the general command injection vulnerability but is specific to the context of subcommand handling. If a subcommand handler executes system commands based on user-provided input, it's vulnerable.

**Actionable Insight:** Sanitize arguments passed to subcommand handlers, especially if they involve executing system commands. Apply the same principles of secure coding as with general command injection.
