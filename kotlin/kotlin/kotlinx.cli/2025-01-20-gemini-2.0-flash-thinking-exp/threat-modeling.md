# Threat Model Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx.cli

## Threat: [Command Injection via Unsanitized Argument Values](./threats/command_injection_via_unsanitized_argument_values.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses command-line arguments provided by the user to construct and execute system commands, an attacker could inject malicious commands by crafting argument values that include shell metacharacters or commands. While `kotlinx.cli` itself doesn't execute commands, it is the mechanism through which this potentially malicious input is received and passed to the application.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying system with the privileges of the application process, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or further attacks.
*   **Affected kotlinx.cli Component:** `ArgParser` (as the entry point for receiving user input).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never directly use user-provided command-line arguments in system calls without thorough sanitization and validation.**
    *   Use parameterized commands or safer alternatives to system calls whenever possible.
    *   Implement strict input validation on the values parsed by `kotlinx.cli` before using them in any system-level operations.
    *   Consider using libraries specifically designed for safe command execution.

## Threat: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities via File Path Arguments](./threats/path_traversal_vulnerabilities_via_file_path_arguments.md)

*   **Description:** If the application accepts file paths as command-line arguments parsed by `kotlinx.cli` and uses these paths to access files on the system, an attacker could provide specially crafted paths (e.g., using "..") to access files outside the intended directory. `kotlinx.cli` is the component responsible for receiving and parsing these potentially malicious file paths.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could read sensitive files, overwrite critical files, or execute unintended code depending on the application's functionality and permissions.
*   **Affected kotlinx.cli Component:** `ArgParser` (for receiving and parsing file path arguments).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict validation of file path arguments *after* they are parsed by `kotlinx.cli`.
    *   Use canonicalization techniques to resolve symbolic links and relative paths before accessing files.
    *   Restrict file access to specific directories and avoid using user-provided paths directly.
    *   Consider using file access libraries that provide built-in safeguards against path traversal.

## Threat: [Elevation of Privilege through Configuration Manipulation via Arguments](./threats/elevation_of_privilege_through_configuration_manipulation_via_arguments.md)

*   **Description:** If command-line arguments, parsed by `kotlinx.cli`, are used to configure critical application settings or user roles without proper authorization checks, an attacker could potentially elevate their privileges by providing arguments that modify these settings. `kotlinx.cli` is the mechanism through which these configuration-altering arguments are provided.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, perform actions they are not authorized to perform, or compromise the security of the application and its data.
*   **Affected kotlinx.cli Component:** `ArgParser` (for receiving and parsing configuration-related arguments).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust authorization and authentication mechanisms for modifying sensitive application configurations.
    *   Avoid relying solely on command-line arguments parsed by `kotlinx.cli` for critical configuration settings. Consider using configuration files with appropriate access controls or environment variables.
    *   If command-line arguments are used for configuration, implement strict validation and authorization checks *after* `kotlinx.cli` has parsed them, but before applying the changes.
