# Attack Surface Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx.cli

## Attack Surface: [Error Message Information Disclosure](./attack_surfaces/error_message_information_disclosure.md)

* **Error Message Information Disclosure:**
    * **Description:** `kotlinx.cli` generates error messages during argument parsing that might inadvertently reveal sensitive information about the application's internal workings or configuration.
    * **How kotlinx.cli Contributes:** `kotlinx.cli` is responsible for generating and displaying these error messages when it encounters issues parsing the provided command-line arguments (e.g., incorrect data types, missing required arguments). The content of these messages is determined by the library's implementation and how the application configures it.
    * **Example:** An error message like "Could not parse argument 'database-url': Invalid URL format. Expected format: jdbc://<host>:<port>/<database>" reveals information about the expected database URL format, potentially aiding an attacker.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure that could assist attackers in understanding the application's architecture and potentially identifying further vulnerabilities.
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Configure `kotlinx.cli` to provide generic, user-friendly error messages that do not expose internal details. Log detailed error information securely for debugging purposes, but avoid displaying it directly to the user. Consider customizing error message generation if `kotlinx.cli` allows it.

## Attack Surface: [Argument Injection (Indirectly, but initiated via kotlinx.cli)](./attack_surfaces/argument_injection__indirectly__but_initiated_via_kotlinx_cli_.md)

* **Argument Injection (Indirectly, but initiated via kotlinx.cli):**
    * **Description:** While the direct execution of injected commands is an application-level vulnerability, the initial vector for such attacks can be through maliciously crafted command-line arguments parsed by `kotlinx.cli`.
    * **How kotlinx.cli Contributes:** `kotlinx.cli` parses the command-line arguments provided by the user and makes them available to the application. If the application then uses these parsed arguments to construct system commands or interact with external systems *without proper sanitization*, it becomes vulnerable to injection attacks. `kotlinx.cli`'s role is in providing the initial, potentially malicious input.
    * **Example:** An application uses a parsed argument intended for a filename in a system command like `cat $filename`. A malicious user provides an argument like "file.txt ; rm -rf /", which `kotlinx.cli` parses and passes to the application, leading to unintended command execution.
    * **Impact:** Can lead to severe security breaches, including arbitrary code execution, data loss, and system compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** **Never** directly use user-provided input (obtained via `kotlinx.cli` or any other source) to construct shell commands or interact with external systems without thorough sanitization and escaping. Use parameterized queries or safe APIs provided by the operating system or relevant libraries. Employ the principle of least privilege.
        * **Users:** Be extremely cautious about running command-line applications with arguments from untrusted sources. Understand the potential risks of providing arbitrary input.
