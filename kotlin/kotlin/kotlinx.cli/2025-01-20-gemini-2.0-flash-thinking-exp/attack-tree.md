# Attack Tree Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx.cli

Objective: Gain unauthorized control or access to the application or its underlying system by leveraging vulnerabilities in how the application uses the kotlinx.cli library.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
* **Compromise Application via kotlinx.cli** (CRITICAL NODE)
    * OR [Exploit Input Parsing Vulnerabilities] (CRITICAL NODE)
        * AND [Supply Maliciously Crafted Arguments] (CRITICAL NODE)
            * **[Command Injection via Unsanitized Input]** (HIGH-RISK PATH)
            * **[Path Traversal via Unvalidated Paths]** (HIGH-RISK PATH)
    * OR **[Social Engineering or Misconfiguration]** (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)
        * **[Trick User into Running with Malicious Arguments]** (HIGH-RISK PATH)
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via kotlinx.cli (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_kotlinx_cli__critical_node_.md)

* This is the root goal of the attacker. All subsequent nodes and paths contribute to achieving this objective.
* Successful compromise can lead to data breaches, system takeover, denial of service, and other severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Parsing Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_parsing_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* This node represents a category of attacks that target weaknesses in how the application processes command-line arguments.
* Successful exploitation allows attackers to manipulate the application's behavior by providing specially crafted input.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Maliciously Crafted Arguments (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/supply_maliciously_crafted_arguments__critical_node_.md)

* This node is a key step in exploiting input parsing vulnerabilities. Attackers provide arguments designed to trigger unintended actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via Unsanitized Input (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_unsanitized_input__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** If the application uses argument values directly in system calls without proper sanitization, attackers can inject arbitrary commands.
* **Example:** An argument like `--file "important.txt; rm -rf /"` could lead to the execution of `rm -rf /`.
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** High (Full system compromise)
* **Effort:** Low
* **Skill Level:** Medium
* **Detection Difficulty:** Low
* **Mitigation:** Implement robust input sanitization and validation before using argument values in system calls. Avoid direct execution of shell commands with user-provided input.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal via Unvalidated Paths (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_via_unvalidated_paths__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** If arguments specify file paths, attackers can use ".." sequences to access files outside the intended directory.
* **Example:** `--config "../../../etc/passwd"`
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** Medium (Access to sensitive files)
* **Effort:** Low
* **Skill Level:** Low
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
* **Mitigation:** Validate and sanitize file paths provided as arguments. Use canonicalization to resolve symbolic links and prevent traversal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering or Misconfiguration (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_or_misconfiguration__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

* This node represents attack vectors that don't rely on direct code vulnerabilities but rather on manipulating users or exploiting misconfigurations.
* Successful exploitation can have the same impact as technical vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trick User into Running with Malicious Arguments (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/trick_user_into_running_with_malicious_arguments__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers can trick users into running the application with malicious arguments through phishing, social media, or other deceptive techniques.
* **Example:** Sending an email with instructions to run the application with a specific set of malicious arguments.
* **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on user awareness and attacker's social engineering skills)
* **Impact:** High (Can lead to any of the above vulnerabilities being exploited)
* **Effort:** Medium
* **Skill Level:** Low to Medium (depending on the complexity of the social engineering)
* **Detection Difficulty:** High (Difficult to detect the social engineering aspect)
* **Mitigation:** Educate users about the risks of running applications with untrusted arguments. Implement clear warnings and validation messages.
