*   **Threat:** Argument Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious command-line arguments that, when parsed by `kotlinx.cli` and subsequently used by the application in system calls or other sensitive operations, lead to unintended command execution or manipulation. The attacker might inject shell commands or modify program behavior in unexpected ways. This directly involves how `kotlinx.cli` interprets and extracts argument values.
    *   **Impact:**  Can lead to arbitrary code execution on the system running the application, data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected kotlinx.cli Component:**  The core parsing logic within `kotlinx.cli` that interprets and extracts argument values (e.g., the `ArgParser` and individual `Arg` instances).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize all parsed arguments *received from `kotlinx.cli`* before using them in any system calls or external commands. Remove or escape potentially harmful characters.
        *   **Avoid Direct Shell Execution:**  Whenever possible, avoid directly passing parsed arguments *obtained from `kotlinx.cli`* to shell commands. Use safer alternatives like dedicated libraries or APIs for specific tasks.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Argument Bomb
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides an excessively large number of arguments or arguments with extremely long values. This can overwhelm the parsing logic *within `kotlinx.cli`*, consuming excessive CPU and memory resources, leading to the application becoming unresponsive or crashing. This directly involves the resource consumption of the `kotlinx.cli` parsing process.
    *   **Impact:**  Application becomes unavailable to legitimate users, potentially disrupting services or causing financial loss.
    *   **Affected kotlinx.cli Component:** The argument parsing mechanism within `kotlinx.cli`, particularly the parts that handle the collection and processing of multiple arguments.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Argument Limits:** Implement limits on the maximum number of arguments the application will accept *before or during parsing with `kotlinx.cli`*.
        *   **Argument Length Limits:**  Set maximum allowed lengths for individual argument values *before or during parsing with `kotlinx.cli`*.
        *   **Timeouts:** Consider setting timeouts for the argument parsing process *within `kotlinx.cli`* to prevent indefinite resource consumption.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in `kotlinx.cli` Library Itself
    *   **Description:** Like any software library, `kotlinx.cli` itself might contain undiscovered vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities by crafting specific command-line arguments that trigger the flaw in the library's parsing logic. This is a direct issue with the `kotlinx.cli` library.
    *   **Impact:**  Can lead to various security issues depending on the nature of the vulnerability within the library, potentially including arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
    *   **Affected kotlinx.cli Component:** Any part of the `kotlinx.cli` library code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Library Updated:** Regularly update the `kotlinx.cli` library to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories and vulnerability reports related to `kotlinx.cli`.
