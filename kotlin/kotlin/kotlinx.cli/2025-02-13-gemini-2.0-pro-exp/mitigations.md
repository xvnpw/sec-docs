# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx.cli

## Mitigation Strategy: [Leverage `kotlinx.cli`'s Type System and Custom `ArgType`](./mitigation_strategies/leverage__kotlinx_cli_'s_type_system_and_custom__argtype_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Choose Specific `ArgType`:**  Instead of using the generic `ArgType.String`, use the most specific `ArgType` subclass that matches the expected input type (e.g., `ArgType.Int`, `ArgType.Boolean`, `ArgType.Choice`, `ArgType.Enum`). This provides built-in type conversion and basic validation.
2.  **Create Custom `ArgType`:** For arguments with complex validation rules, create a custom subclass of `ArgType`.  Override the `convert` function to perform your specific validation logic.  This allows you to encapsulate validation directly within the argument definition.
    ```kotlin
    object PositiveInt : ArgType<Int>(true) {
        override fun convert(value: String, name: String): Int {
            val intValue = value.toIntOrNull() ?: throw IllegalArgumentException("Argument '$name' must be an integer.")
            if (intValue <= 0) {
                throw IllegalArgumentException("Argument '$name' must be a positive integer.")
            }
            return intValue
        }
        override fun toTypeName(): String = "positive integer"
    }

    // Usage:
    val count by parser.option(PositiveInt, shortName = "c").required()
    ```
3.  **Use `ArgType.Choice`:** For arguments that must be one of a predefined set of string values, use `ArgType.Choice`. This provides built-in validation against the allowed choices.
4.  **Use `ArgType.Enum`:**  For arguments that represent enum values, use `ArgType.Enum`. This automatically handles conversion and validation.
5. **Handle Conversion in `convert`:** Inside the `convert` method of your custom `ArgType`, always handle potential conversion errors (e.g., `NumberFormatException` when converting to an integer). Throw an `IllegalArgumentException` with a clear message to provide informative feedback to the user.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unexpected Behavior Due to Type Coercion:** (Severity: Medium) - Ensures that arguments are of the correct type and conform to basic constraints.
*   **Argument Injection (Indirectly):** (Severity: High) - By enforcing stricter input types and validation *at the parsing stage*, you reduce the likelihood of passing improperly formatted data to later stages of the application, where it could be used for injection.
* **DoS via crafted input:** (Severity: Medium) - By using custom `ArgType` you can prevent parsing of invalid input that can lead to DoS.

**Impact:**
*   **Unexpected Behavior:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
*   **Argument Injection:** Risk reduced indirectly (part of a layered defense).
* **DoS:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Describe where this is implemented (e.g., "Using `ArgType.Int` for numeric arguments.  A custom `ArgType` is used for validating email addresses.").
*   Provide specific file and argument names.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Describe where this is missing (e.g., "The `--path` argument still uses `ArgType.String`.  A custom `ArgType` should be created to validate file paths and prevent path traversal.").
*   Provide specific file and argument names.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe Subcommand Handling with `kotlinx.cli`](./mitigation_strategies/safe_subcommand_handling_with__kotlinx_cli_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Use `Subcommand` Class:** Define subcommands using the `Subcommand` class provided by `kotlinx.cli`. This provides a structured way to organize subcommands and their associated arguments.
2.  **Override `execute`:** Implement the `execute` function within each `Subcommand` subclass. This is where the logic for that specific subcommand should reside.
3.  **Access Arguments within `execute`:** Access parsed argument values *within* the `execute` function of the relevant `Subcommand`. This ensures that you're working with arguments that are specific to that subcommand.
4.  **Register Subcommands:**  Register your `Subcommand` instances with the main `ArgParser` using the `subcommands` function.
5. **Call `ArgParser.parse` once:** Call `parser.parse(args)` only *once* at the top level.  `kotlinx.cli` handles dispatching to the correct `Subcommand`'s `execute` function based on the user's input.
6. **Avoid Global State:** Do not rely on global variables or shared state to determine which subcommand was selected. Use the `kotlinx.cli` provided mechanisms.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Subcommand Spoofing/Hijacking:** (Severity: Medium) - Ensures that the correct subcommand is executed and that arguments are handled in the context of that subcommand.

**Impact:**
*   **Subcommand Spoofing/Hijacking:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Describe where this is implemented (e.g., "Subcommands are defined using the `Subcommand` class, and `execute` is overridden.  Argument access is done within `execute`.").
*   Provide specific file and subcommand names.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Describe where this is missing (e.g., "The `admin` subcommand accesses arguments from a global scope, which is incorrect.  It should access them within its `execute` function.").
*   Provide specific file and subcommand names.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Help Text Output with `kotlinx.cli`](./mitigation_strategies/control_help_text_output_with__kotlinx_cli_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Use `description` Parameter:** Provide clear and concise descriptions for arguments and subcommands using the `description` parameter in `option` and `argument` functions.
2.  **Use `fullName` and `shortName`:** Use meaningful `fullName` and `shortName` for options to improve clarity in help messages.
3.  **Customize Help Formatting:** If the default help output is not suitable, use `kotlinx.cli`'s customization options:
    *   **`ArgParser.helpMessage`:** Override the `helpMessage` property of `ArgParser` to provide a completely custom help message.
    *   **`ArgParser.printHelp`:** Override the `printHelp` function to control how the help message is displayed.
    *   **`useDefaultHelpShortName`:** Set this to `false` to disable the default `-h` short name for help.
4.  **Review Generated Help:** Always run your application with the `--help` option (or your custom help option) to review the generated help text and ensure it is accurate, informative, and doesn't reveal sensitive information.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Disclosure via Help Messages:** (Severity: Low/Medium) - Allows you to control the content and format of help messages to prevent accidental information leakage.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced from Low/Medium to Very Low.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Describe where this is implemented (e.g., "Descriptions are provided for all arguments and subcommands.  The default help formatting is used.").
*   Provide specific file names (if applicable).

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Describe where this is missing (e.g., "The help text for the `--config` option needs to be reviewed to remove a reference to a default configuration file path.").
*   Provide specific file and argument/subcommand names.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Handle Parsing Errors Gracefully](./mitigation_strategies/handle_parsing_errors_gracefully.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Wrap `parse` in `try-catch`:** Wrap the `parser.parse(args)` call in a `try-catch` block to handle potential exceptions that can occur during parsing, such as `IllegalStateException` (for invalid arguments) or exceptions thrown by your custom `ArgType`'s `convert` function.
2.  **Provide Informative Error Messages:**  In the `catch` block, print a user-friendly error message to the console (or standard error).  Include the specific error message from the exception.
3.  **Exit with Error Code:**  After printing the error message, exit the program with a non-zero exit code (e.g., `exitProcess(1)`) to indicate that an error occurred.
4. **Use `parser.parseResult`:** If you need to check the result of parsing without throwing an exception, use `parser.parseResult(args)`. This returns an enum that indicates success or failure, and you can handle the failure case accordingly.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unexpected Behavior Due to Parsing Errors:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents the application from crashing or behaving unpredictably when invalid input is provided.
* **DoS via crafted input:** (Severity: Medium) - By handling parsing errors, you can prevent application crashes caused by crafted input.

**Impact:**
*   **Unexpected Behavior:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
* **DoS:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Describe where this is implemented (e.g., "`parser.parse(args)` is wrapped in a `try-catch` block, and error messages are printed to the console.").
*   Provide specific file names.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Describe where this is missing (e.g., "Error handling is missing for the `upload` subcommand.  Invalid arguments to this subcommand could cause the application to crash.").
*   Provide specific file and subcommand names.
