# Attack Surface Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx.cli

## Attack Surface: [Argument Type Confusion (Leading to Application Vulnerabilities)](./attack_surfaces/argument_type_confusion__leading_to_application_vulnerabilities_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides an argument of an unexpected type. While `kotlinx.cli` performs basic type checking, if the application doesn't *further* validate the coerced value and uses it in a security-sensitive operation, this can lead to a *high* severity vulnerability. This is a direct interaction with how `kotlinx.cli` handles (or doesn't handle) type coercion beyond the basics.
*   **`kotlinx.cli` Contribution:** `kotlinx.cli` performs basic type checking (Int, String, Boolean, etc.) and attempts coercion. It *does not* perform context-aware validation (e.g., checking if a string is a valid file path, SQL injection safe, etc.). It relies on the application to handle potential `IllegalArgumentException` or `IllegalStateException` if coercion fails completely. The *lack* of deeper validation within `kotlinx.cli` is the direct contribution.
*   **Example:**
    *   Argument defined as `Int` for a database ID (`--user-id 123`).
    *   Attacker provides `--user-id "1; DROP TABLE users"`.
    *   `kotlinx.cli` might successfully parse this as a *String* (if the argument type is not strictly enforced as `Int` in the application logic *after* parsing). If the application then uses this string directly in a SQL query without proper sanitization, it leads to SQL injection.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Potential for *severe* security vulnerabilities if the coerced value is used in sensitive operations (SQL injection, command injection, path traversal, etc.). The severity depends entirely on *how* the application uses the value.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on the application's subsequent use of the value).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** *Always* perform thorough validation *after* `kotlinx.cli` parsing.  Do *not* assume the parsed value is safe just because it's the correct basic type.
    *   **Developer:** Use the most specific type possible in `kotlinx.cli` definitions.
    *   **Developer:** Implement robust exception handling to catch any `kotlinx.cli` parsing errors.
    *   **Developer:** For security-critical arguments, consider custom parsing logic *beyond* what `kotlinx.cli` provides, to enforce very specific constraints.

## Attack Surface: [Numeric Overflow/Underflow (Leading to Application Vulnerabilities)](./attack_surfaces/numeric_overflowunderflow__leading_to_application_vulnerabilities_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides extremely large or small numeric values. While technically valid for the declared type (e.g., `Int`), these values can cause issues if the application doesn't handle them correctly *after* parsing. `kotlinx.cli`'s role is in parsing these values without range checks (beyond the basic type limits).
*   **`kotlinx.cli` Contribution:** `kotlinx.cli` parses numeric arguments according to their declared type (Int, Long, Double, etc.) but *does not* perform any application-specific range checking. It accepts any value within the valid range of the *type itself*. This lack of bounds checking is the direct contribution.
*   **Example:**
    *   Argument defined as `Int` representing an array index (`--index 5`).
    *   Attacker provides `--index 2147483647` (maximum `Int` value).
    *   `kotlinx.cli` will parse this successfully. If the application then uses this value directly to access an array without checking its bounds, it will likely result in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` or, worse, potentially exploitable memory corruption (depending on the underlying language/runtime).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Integer overflows/underflows leading to incorrect calculations, potentially exploitable.
    *   Potential denial-of-service (DoS) if very large numbers cause excessive memory allocation or computation time *within the application*.
    *   Potential for memory corruption vulnerabilities if the overflowed value is used in memory operations *within the application*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on how the application uses the value).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** *Always* perform range validation *after* `kotlinx.cli` parsing. Use `coerceIn` or custom logic to enforce application-specific limits.
    *   **Developer:** Consider using `BigInteger` or `BigDecimal` if very large numbers are possible and precise handling is required, and validate those as well.
    *   **Developer:** Be aware of the potential for overflow/underflow in *all* calculations involving user-provided numeric input, even after initial validation.
