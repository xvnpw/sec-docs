# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, `kotlinx.cli`, provides a Kotlin library for parsing command-line arguments in applications.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a user-friendly and efficient way for Kotlin developers to handle command-line arguments.
  - Simplify the development of command-line tools and applications in Kotlin.
  - Offer a robust and reliable library that reduces boilerplate code for argument parsing.
  - Enable developers to create applications with clear and well-defined command-line interfaces.

- Business Risks:
  - Vulnerabilities in the library could lead to security issues in applications that use it. If the argument parsing logic is flawed, it could be exploited to inject malicious commands or cause unexpected application behavior.
  - Poor usability or lack of features could lead to low adoption and failure to meet developer needs.
  - Lack of maintenance and updates could result in the library becoming outdated and insecure over time.
  - Performance issues in argument parsing could negatively impact the performance of applications using the library.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's infrastructure security. Implemented by: GitHub.
  - security control: Open-source project, allowing for community review and scrutiny. Implemented by: Open Source nature of the project.
  - accepted risk: Limited formal security testing or dedicated security team for this specific library. Assumed based on typical open-source library projects.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on user applications to properly handle parsed arguments and implement application-level security. Assumed as library responsibility is limited to parsing.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Conduct regular dependency checks to identify and update vulnerable dependencies.
  - security control: Provide clear documentation and examples on secure usage of the library, especially regarding input validation of parsed arguments in user applications.
  - security control: Consider incorporating fuzz testing to identify edge cases and potential vulnerabilities in argument parsing logic.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a command-line argument parsing library itself. Authentication is the responsibility of the application using this library.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a command-line argument parsing library itself. Authorization is the responsibility of the application using this library, based on the parsed arguments.
  - Input Validation: While the library parses arguments, robust input validation is crucial for applications using this library. The library should be designed to facilitate easy and secure input validation by the application developer. The library itself should handle parsing errors gracefully and prevent injection vulnerabilities during parsing.
  - Cryptography: Not directly required for the core functionality of a command-line argument parsing library. However, applications using this library might use cryptography based on parsed arguments (e.g., to handle encrypted files or network communication). The library should not introduce any cryptographic weaknesses.

## DEPLOYMENT

`kotlinx.cli` is a library, so it is not deployed as a standalone application. It is included as a dependency in user applications. The deployment of `kotlinx.cli` is essentially its publication to a package repository like Maven Central. User applications then depend on this published library and are deployed according to the user application's deployment strategy.

Here we describe the deployment of a *user application* that uses `kotlinx.cli`. We assume a simple deployment scenario to a generic server environment.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - For `kotlinx.cli` itself, the critical business process is providing a reliable and secure library for Kotlin developers.
  - For applications using `kotlinx.cli`, the critical business processes are those implemented by the application, which rely on correctly parsed command-line arguments.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - `kotlinx.cli` library code itself: Sensitivity is moderate. Code integrity and availability are important to maintain developer trust and prevent supply chain attacks.
  - User application data: Sensitivity depends entirely on the application using `kotlinx.cli`. The library itself does not handle user data directly, but vulnerabilities could lead to data breaches in user applications. The sensitivity ranges from low to high depending on the application's purpose and the data it processes.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- BUSINESS POSTURE:
  - Question: What is the target audience for `kotlinx.cli`? Is it primarily for internal use within an organization, or for public consumption by a broad range of developers?
  - Assumption: We assume `kotlinx.cli` is intended for public consumption and aims to be a widely used library in the Kotlin ecosystem.
  - Question: Are there specific performance requirements or scalability goals for `kotlinx.cli`?
  - Assumption: We assume performance and efficiency are important considerations, but not to the extent of sacrificing security or usability.

- SECURITY POSTURE:
  - Question: Are there any existing security guidelines or policies that the `kotlinx` project follows?
  - Assumption: We assume standard open-source security practices are generally followed, but specific formal security processes might be limited for this individual library.
  - Question: Are there any known vulnerabilities or past security incidents related to `kotlinx.cli` or similar Kotlin libraries?
  - Assumption: We assume no major known security incidents, but standard security vigilance is still necessary.
  - Question: What is the expected lifespan and maintenance plan for `kotlinx.cli`?
  - Assumption: We assume long-term maintenance and updates are planned to address bugs and security vulnerabilities.

- DESIGN:
  - Question: Are there any specific complex use cases or edge cases that the design should explicitly address from a security perspective?
  - Assumption: We assume the library should handle a wide range of valid and invalid command-line inputs robustly and securely.
  - Question: Are there any plans for future extensions or features that might have security implications?
  - Assumption: We assume future development will consider security implications and follow secure design principles.
  - Question: What level of input validation is expected to be performed by `kotlinx.cli` versus the user application?
  - Assumption: `kotlinx.cli` should perform basic parsing and format validation, but user applications are responsible for application-specific semantic validation and sanitization of parsed arguments.
