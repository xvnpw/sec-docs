## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Input Validation Flaws in Argument Parsing:](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_input_validation_flaws_in_argument_parsing.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in how the application validates or sanitizes command-line arguments parsed by `kotlinx.cli`. This often leads to injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Focus Areas:**
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Injection Attacks:**
            *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Command Injection [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Attack Description:**  Crafting malicious arguments that are interpreted as shell commands when processed by the application. This is critical if the application uses parsed arguments to execute system commands.
                *   **Example:**  Providing an argument like `; rm -rf / #` if the application naively uses arguments in shell commands.
                *   **Impact:** **Critical** - Full system compromise, attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.
            *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Path Traversal Injection:**
                *   **Attack Description:** Providing arguments that manipulate file paths to access unauthorized files or directories.
                *   **Example:** Using `--file ../../../etc/passwd` to read sensitive system files if the application doesn't properly validate file paths.
                *   **Impact:** Significant - Data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive files.
        *   **Buffer Overflow/Memory Corruption [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Description:** While less likely in Kotlin/JVM, providing excessively long or crafted arguments could theoretically cause buffer overflows if not handled correctly by the application or underlying libraries.
            *   **Example:** Sending extremely long strings as arguments if buffer sizes are not properly managed.
            *   **Impact:** **Critical** - System crash, potential for arbitrary code execution in severe cases.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in kotlinx.cli Library Itself [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_kotlinx_cli_library_itself__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities that might exist within the `kotlinx.cli` library itself.
    *   **Focus Areas:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities in kotlinx.cli (CVEs) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Description:** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the specific version of `kotlinx.cli` used by the application.
            *   **Action:** Regularly check CVE databases and `kotlinx.cli` release notes for known vulnerabilities and update the library.
            *   **Impact:** **Critical** - Depending on the vulnerability, could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), or other severe issues.
        *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in kotlinx.cli [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Description:** Discovering and exploiting previously unknown vulnerabilities (zero-days) in `kotlinx.cli`. This requires significant effort and expertise.
            *   **Impact:** **Critical** - Similar to known vulnerabilities, zero-days can lead to RCE, DoS, and other critical impacts.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Misconfiguration or Misuse of kotlinx.cli in Application [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_misconfiguration_or_misuse_of_kotlinx_cli_in_application__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from how the application is configured to use `kotlinx.cli` or how developers misuse the library.
    *   **Focus Areas:**
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Overly Permissive Argument Parsing Configuration [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Attack Description:** Configuring `kotlinx.cli` to accept overly broad or insufficiently validated arguments, increasing the attack surface.
            *   **Example:** Allowing arbitrary file paths without whitelisting or proper validation in the `kotlinx.cli` argument definition.
            *   **Impact:** Moderate to Significant - Increases the potential for injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Insufficient Sanitization After Parsing [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Description:** Failing to properly sanitize or validate the *parsed* arguments *after* `kotlinx.cli` has processed them, before using them in application logic. This is a very common source of vulnerabilities.
            *   **Example:** Using a parsed file path directly in file system operations without checking for path traversal vulnerabilities.
            *   **Impact:** Moderate to **Critical** - Leads to injection attacks, logic flaws, and data corruption.
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Exposing Sensitive Functionality via Command-Line Arguments [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Description:** Exposing sensitive or privileged functionality through command-line arguments without proper authorization or access control.
            *   **Example:** Making administrative commands or sensitive configuration changes accessible via command-line arguments without authentication.
            *   **Impact:** Significant to **Critical** - Unauthorized access to sensitive functions, privilege escalation, and potential compromise of critical application features.
