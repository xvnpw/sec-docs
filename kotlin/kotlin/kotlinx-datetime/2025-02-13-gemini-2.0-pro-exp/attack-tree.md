## Attack Tree Path: [1. Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/1__denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **1.1. Parsing-Related DoS [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:**  Attackers can cause a denial-of-service by providing specially crafted input to parsing functions, leading to excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory).
    *   **1.1.1. Extremely Long Input String**
        *   **1.1.1.1. Unbounded String Parsing (e.g., `Instant.parse`, `LocalDate.parse`) [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:**  If the application does not limit the length of input strings before passing them to `kotlinx-datetime`'s parsing functions, an attacker can provide an extremely long string, causing the parser to consume excessive resources and potentially crash the application.
            *   **Likelihood:** High (If input validation is missing)
            *   **Impact:** High (DoS)
            *   **Effort:** Very Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Resource exhaustion, slow responses)
            *   **Mitigation:** Implement input validation with maximum length limits *before* parsing. Use a configuration setting to define this limit.
        *   **1.1.1.2. Excessive Time Zone Data Processing (e.g., parsing with complex time zone IDs)**
            *   **Description:**  Parsing date/time strings with complex or malicious time zone IDs can lead to excessive processing time and resource consumption, especially if the library needs to resolve the time zone information.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High (DoS)
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Slow responses, potentially specific error logs)
            *   **Mitigation:** Validate time zone IDs against a known-good list (whitelist) if possible. Limit the complexity of allowed time zone IDs. Consider caching resolved time zone data.
    *   **1.1.2. Resource Exhaustion via Repeated Calculations**
        *   **1.1.2.2. Creating a large number of `DateTimePeriod` or `DatePeriod` objects with extremely large values. [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:** If user input directly controls the values used to create `DateTimePeriod` or `DatePeriod` objects (e.g., years, months, days), an attacker can provide extremely large values, leading to the creation of a large number of objects or objects that consume a significant amount of memory.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (If user input controls period creation)
            *   **Impact:** High (DoS)
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Resource exhaustion)
            *   **Mitigation:** Validate user-provided input used to create periods. Set reasonable upper bounds on the duration components (years, months, days, etc.).

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Arbitrary Code Execution (Less Likely, but Possible)](./attack_tree_paths/2__arbitrary_code_execution__less_likely__but_possible_.md)

*   **2.1. Format String Vulnerabilities (If a custom, user-controlled format string is used)**
    *   **2.1.1. Unvalidated User Input Used in `format()` (Hypothetical - `kotlinx-datetime` doesn't directly support custom format strings like `printf`) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  This is a *hypothetical* vulnerability *if* a developer builds custom formatting functionality on top of `kotlinx-datetime` and uses user input to construct the format string.  If user input is directly incorporated into a format string, it could allow an attacker to inject malicious code.  This is a classic format string vulnerability.
        *   **Likelihood:** Very Low (Hypothetical, requires building custom formatting)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (May require code analysis or dynamic analysis)
        *   **Mitigation:** *Avoid* constructing format strings directly from user input. If absolutely necessary, sanitize the input thoroughly, escaping any special characters. Prefer using pre-defined formatters. This is a general principle, but applies if a custom formatting solution is built *on top of* `kotlinx-datetime`.

*   **2.2. Deserialization Vulnerabilities (If `kotlinx-datetime` objects are deserialized from untrusted sources) [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Deserializing data from untrusted sources is inherently dangerous. If an application deserializes `kotlinx-datetime` objects (or any objects) from an untrusted source, an attacker could craft malicious input that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code.
    *   **2.2.1. Using a Vulnerable Deserialization Library with `kotlinx-datetime` Types [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  If the application uses a deserialization library that is known to be vulnerable, and it deserializes `kotlinx-datetime` objects from untrusted input, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability in the deserialization library to achieve remote code execution.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (Requires using a vulnerable library *and* deserializing untrusted data)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (May require code analysis or dynamic analysis)
        *   **Mitigation:** Avoid deserializing `kotlinx-datetime` objects (or any objects) from untrusted sources. If deserialization is necessary, use a secure deserialization library that supports whitelisting of allowed types and has a strong security track record. Consider using a data format that is less prone to deserialization vulnerabilities (e.g., JSON with strict schema validation).
