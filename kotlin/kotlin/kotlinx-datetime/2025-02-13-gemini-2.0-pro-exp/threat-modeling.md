# Threat Model Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx-datetime

## Threat: [Time Zone Confusion Leading to Authorization Bypass](./threats/time_zone_confusion_leading_to_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Threat:** Time Zone Confusion Leading to Authorization Bypass

    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates their system clock or exploits differences between the application's assumed time zone and the actual time zone of a resource or user to bypass time-based access controls.  The application uses `kotlinx-datetime` to check the current time but doesn't correctly handle the user's or server's time zone, relying on implicit conversions or incorrect assumptions.  For example, an API endpoint is restricted to "business hours," but the application uses `LocalDateTime.now()` without specifying a time zone, leading to incorrect comparisons.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources or functionality, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized actions, or privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Clock.System.now()`, `TimeZone.currentSystemDefault()`, `LocalDateTime.now()`, `Instant.toLocalDateTime()`, and any code that uses these functions without *explicit and correct* time zone handling for comparison or authorization logic.  The core issue is the *incorrect use* of these components, not a flaw in the components themselves.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always explicitly specify the relevant time zone when performing time-based comparisons.  Use `TimeZone.UTC` for internal comparisons and storage whenever possible.
        *   If dealing with user-specific time zones, obtain the user's time zone through a reliable mechanism (e.g., user profile setting, a properly secured browser API) and use it explicitly when converting to `LocalDateTime`.  *Never* assume the user's time zone is the same as the server's.
        *   Avoid using `TimeZone.currentSystemDefault()` unless you are *absolutely certain* it's the correct time zone to use and have documented this decision clearly.
        *   Thoroughly test time-based authorization logic with different time zones and around daylight saving time transitions.

## Threat: [Incorrect Duration Calculation Affecting Session Timeout (or other Time-Sensitive Operations)](./threats/incorrect_duration_calculation_affecting_session_timeout__or_other_time-sensitive_operations_.md)

*   **Threat:** Incorrect Duration Calculation Affecting Session Timeout (or other Time-Sensitive Operations)

    *   **Description:** The application uses `kotlinx-datetime` to calculate the duration of a user session (or another security-critical time interval). Due to incorrect handling of daylight saving time transitions, leap seconds, or incorrect use of `Instant` vs. `LocalDateTime`, the calculated duration is significantly longer than intended. This allows an attacker to maintain a session (or trigger a time-based action) beyond its intended expiry, potentially gaining unauthorized access.  The vulnerability arises from *misusing* the library's features for duration calculation.
    *   **Impact:** Extended session lifetime (or incorrect timing of a security-critical operation), potentially allowing unauthorized access or actions.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Instant.minus()`, `Instant.plus()`, `Clock.System.now()`, and any code that calculates durations between `Instant` values *incorrectly* or uses `LocalDateTime` inappropriately for duration calculations. The key is the *incorrect application* of these components, not an inherent flaw in them.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use `Clock.System.now()` to obtain `Instant` values for session start and end times (or the start/end of the time-sensitive operation). `Instant` represents a point on the timeline and is less susceptible to time zone and DST issues than `LocalDateTime`.
        *   Calculate durations using `Instant.minus()` to get a `DateTimePeriod` or `Duration`.  *Do not* perform arithmetic directly on `LocalDateTime` values for duration calculations, as this can lead to incorrect results due to DST and other time anomalies.
        *   Thoroughly test session timeout logic (and other time-sensitive operations) around DST transitions and other time anomalies, using a variety of test cases.
        *   Consider using a well-vetted, dedicated session management library that handles these complexities securely, rather than rolling your own session management using `kotlinx-datetime` directly. This reduces the risk of misusing the library.
