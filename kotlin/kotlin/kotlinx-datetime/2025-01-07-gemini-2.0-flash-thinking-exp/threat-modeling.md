# Threat Model Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx-datetime

## Threat: [Malformed Input String Parsing Leading to Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/malformed_input_string_parsing_leading_to_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted, excessively long, or syntactically invalid date/time string to a function like `Instant.parse()` or `LocalDateTime.parse()`. This could cause the parsing logic within `kotlinx-datetime` to consume excessive CPU time or memory, potentially leading to a crash or unresponsiveness of the application.

**Impact:** Application becomes unavailable or experiences significant performance degradation, impacting legitimate users.

**Affected Component:** `kotlinx-datetime-core` module, specifically the parsing functions for `Instant`, `LocalDateTime`, `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `DateTimePeriod`, etc.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation on all date/time strings received from external sources *before* passing them to `kotlinx-datetime`.
* Set reasonable limits on the length of input strings *before* parsing.
* Consider using try-catch blocks around parsing operations to gracefully handle exceptions, preventing application crashes.
* Implement rate limiting on endpoints that accept date/time input if exposed to external users to mitigate abuse.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow/Underflow in Date/Time Arithmetic](./threats/integer_overflowunderflow_in_datetime_arithmetic.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides input that causes the application to perform arithmetic operations on date/time values (e.g., adding large durations) that result in integer overflow or underflow *within the `kotlinx-datetime` library's calculations*. This could lead to incorrect date/time calculations, potentially bypassing security checks or causing unexpected behavior.

**Impact:** Incorrect application logic, potential bypass of time-based security measures, or unexpected application state due to faulty calculations within the library.

**Affected Component:** `kotlinx-datetime-core` module, specifically functions for adding or subtracting `DateTimePeriod`, `Duration`, or individual time components to date/time objects.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Be aware of the limitations of the underlying data types used by `kotlinx-datetime` for representing date/time components.
* Implement checks *before* performing arithmetic operations to ensure that the resulting values will remain within valid ranges.
* Thoroughly test date/time arithmetic operations with boundary and extreme values to identify potential overflow/underflow issues.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Complex Time Zone Operations](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_complex_time_zone_operations.md)

**Description:** An attacker could trigger a series of complex or repeated time zone conversions, especially involving historical data or edge cases *within the `kotlinx-datetime` library's time zone handling*, potentially consuming excessive CPU or memory resources and leading to a denial of service.

**Impact:** Application becomes unavailable or experiences significant performance degradation due to resource exhaustion within the `kotlinx-datetime` library.

**Affected Component:** `kotlinx-datetime-tzdb` module (if used for time zone database) and functions within `kotlinx-datetime-core` that perform time zone conversions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting on operations involving time zone conversions if exposed to external users.
* Avoid performing unnecessary or redundant time zone conversions.
* Monitor resource usage related to time zone operations to detect potential abuse.
* Ensure the `kotlinx-datetime` library and its time zone data are up-to-date, as performance improvements and bug fixes may address some resource exhaustion issues.
