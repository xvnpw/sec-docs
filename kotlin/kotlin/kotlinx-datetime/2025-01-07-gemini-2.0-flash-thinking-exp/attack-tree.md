## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via kotlinx-datetime Exploitation **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_kotlinx-datetime_exploitation_critical_node.md)

This represents the attacker's ultimate objective. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved their goal through exploiting vulnerabilities in the `kotlinx-datetime` library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Validation Weaknesses **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_validation_weaknesses_critical_node.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Failing to properly sanitize or validate date/time strings received from external sources (e.g., user input, API calls).
    * **Mechanism:** Attackers can craft malicious strings designed to bypass validation checks or exploit weaknesses in the parsing logic of `kotlinx-datetime`.
    * **Consequences:** Successful exploitation can lead to parsing errors causing DoS, or the creation of incorrect date/time objects leading to further logical errors and data corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Maliciously Crafted Date/Time Strings **HIGH RISK PATH START** **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/provide_maliciously_crafted_datetime_strings_high_risk_path_start_critical_node.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Supplying specially crafted strings to `kotlinx-datetime`'s parsing functions (e.g., `LocalDateTime.parse()`, `Instant.parse()`).
    * **Examples:**
        * Strings with unexpected characters or patterns not handled by the parser.
        * Strings representing dates or times outside the expected or supported range.
        * Strings designed to exploit locale-specific parsing bugs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Incorrect Date/Time Object Creation **HIGH RISK PATH CONTINUES** **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/cause_incorrect_datetime_object_creation_high_risk_path_continues_critical_node.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Successfully providing a crafted input string that, while not necessarily causing a parsing error, results in the creation of a `kotlinx-datetime` object with incorrect date or time values.
    * **Mechanism:** Exploiting ambiguities in date/time formats or subtle variations that are interpreted incorrectly by the parsing logic.
    * **Consequences:**  Incorrect date/time objects can lead to flaws in business logic, incorrect calculations, data corruption, and potentially security vulnerabilities in other parts of the application that rely on this data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Logic Errors in Date/Time Calculations **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_logic_errors_in_datetime_calculations_critical_node.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Providing specific date/time values as input to calculation functions (e.g., `plus()`, `minus()`, `until()`) that trigger logical errors within the library's implementation.
    * **Examples:**
        * Inputs leading to integer overflow or underflow during calculations.
        * Inputs that expose vulnerabilities in time zone handling.
        * Inputs that reveal precision errors in duration or instant calculations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Time Zone Handling Issues **HIGH RISK PATH START** **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_time_zone_handling_issues_high_risk_path_start_critical_node.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Leveraging the inherent complexity and potential for errors in time zone conversions and calculations within `kotlinx-datetime`.
    * **Mechanism:** Providing dates and times, particularly around time zone transition boundaries (e.g., daylight saving time changes), that expose bugs or inconsistencies in the time zone handling logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Incorrect Conversions Leading to Data Corruption **HIGH RISK PATH CONTINUES** **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/cause_incorrect_conversions_leading_to_data_corruption_high_risk_path_continues_critical_node.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Specifically targeting time zone conversions with carefully chosen dates and times.
    * **Mechanism:**  Exploiting edge cases or bugs in how `kotlinx-datetime` handles conversions between different time zones, especially during transitions.
    * **Consequences:**  This can result in date/time values being shifted incorrectly, leading to significant data corruption, especially in applications dealing with scheduling, logging, or time-sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities (If Applicable) **HIGH RISK PATH START** **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities__if_applicable__high_risk_path_start_critical_node.md)

**Attack Vector:**  If the application serializes and deserializes `kotlinx-datetime` objects, attackers can provide maliciously crafted serialized data.
    * **Prerequisite:** The application must be using a serialization mechanism (e.g., kotlinx.serialization, Java serialization) that is potentially vulnerable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Maliciously Crafted Serialized DateTime Objects **HIGH RISK PATH CONTINUES** **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/provide_maliciously_crafted_serialized_datetime_objects_high_risk_path_continues_critical_node.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Crafting serialized representations of `kotlinx-datetime` objects that, when deserialized, trigger unexpected behavior or exploit vulnerabilities in the deserialization process.
    * **Mechanism:** Manipulating the internal state of the serialized object to cause issues during reconstruction.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Code Execution or Application Crash Upon Deserialization (Less Likely, but Possible) **HIGH RISK PATH END**](./attack_tree_paths/cause_code_execution_or_application_crash_upon_deserialization__less_likely__but_possible__high_risk_97cd307a.md)

**Attack Vector:**  The ultimate goal of exploiting deserialization vulnerabilities.
    * **Mechanism:**  If the underlying serialization library or the way `kotlinx-datetime` objects are serialized has vulnerabilities, a malicious serialized object could potentially be crafted to execute arbitrary code on the server or cause the application to crash. While less likely for pure data objects, it's a high-impact scenario that needs consideration, especially if custom serialization logic is involved or if there are dependencies with known deserialization vulnerabilities.
