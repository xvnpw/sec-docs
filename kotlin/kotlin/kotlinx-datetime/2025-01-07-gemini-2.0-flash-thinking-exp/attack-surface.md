# Attack Surface Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx-datetime

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Date/Time String Parsing](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_datetime_string_parsing.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Maliciously Crafted Date/Time String Parsing

    *   **Description:** The application receives a date or time string from an untrusted source and uses `kotlinx-datetime` to parse it. A specially crafted string can exploit vulnerabilities in the parsing logic *within the library itself*.
    *   **How kotlinx-datetime Contributes:**  `kotlinx-datetime`'s parsing functions like `Instant.parse()`, `LocalDateTime.parse()`, `LocalDate.parse()` are directly responsible for interpreting string representations. Vulnerabilities *in these specific functions* can be triggered by unexpected or malformed input.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides the string containing excessively nested or repeated patterns to a `kotlinx-datetime` parsing function, potentially leading to a stack overflow or excessive processing within the library.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (resource exhaustion within the parsing logic), potential for exploitation if the parsing error leads to memory corruption *within the library's memory space* (less likely in Kotlin but a theoretical concern).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement input validation *before* parsing to reject strings that deviate significantly from expected formats, limiting the complexity passed to `kotlinx-datetime`.
        *   **Error Handling:** Use `try-catch` blocks around parsing operations to handle exceptions gracefully.
        *   **Library Updates:** Keep `kotlinx-datetime` updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in the parsing logic.

## Attack Surface: [Integer Overflow in Duration/Period Calculations](./attack_surfaces/integer_overflow_in_durationperiod_calculations.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Integer Overflow in Duration/Period Calculations

    *   **Description:** Performing arithmetic operations with `Duration` or `Period` objects using extremely large values can lead to integer overflow or underflow *within the library's calculations*, resulting in incorrect values.
    *   **How kotlinx-datetime Contributes:** `kotlinx-datetime`'s implementation of arithmetic operations on `Duration` and `Period` might be susceptible to integer overflows if the internal representation cannot handle the resulting values.
    *   **Example:** Adding `Duration.INFINITE` to another large `Duration` might result in an unexpected negative or small positive value due to integer overflow within the `kotlinx-datetime` calculation.
    *   **Impact:** Incorrect application logic based on faulty time calculations, potential for denial of service if these calculations are used in resource management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium (While potentially impactful, direct exploitation leading to critical security breaches might be less common).
