* **Attack Surface:** Bugs and Vulnerabilities within kotlinx-datetime itself
    * **Description:** Like any software library, `kotlinx-datetime` might contain undiscovered bugs or vulnerabilities.
    * **How kotlinx-datetime contributes:** The library's internal logic for date/time calculations, parsing, and formatting could have flaws that could be exploited.
    * **Example:** A hypothetical buffer overflow vulnerability in a parsing function could be triggered by providing an extremely long or specially crafted date/time string.
    * **Impact:**
        * Denial of Service (DoS) if a bug causes the application to crash or become unresponsive.
        * Potential for more severe vulnerabilities like remote code execution if a critical flaw exists.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Stay Updated:** Regularly update `kotlinx-datetime` to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches released by the library maintainers.
        * **Monitor Security Advisories:** Keep an eye on the library's GitHub repository, issue tracker, and any relevant security mailing lists for reported vulnerabilities and security advisories.
