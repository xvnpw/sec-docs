# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, kotlinx-datetime, aims to provide a comprehensive, multiplatform date and time library for Kotlin. The primary business priority is to offer Kotlin developers a reliable and efficient way to handle date and time operations across different platforms (JVM, JS, Native). The goal is to improve developer productivity and code quality by providing a well-designed and easy-to-use API for date and time manipulation, reducing the need to rely on platform-specific or less robust alternatives.

Key business risks associated with this project include:
- Incorrect date and time calculations: If the library contains bugs or logic errors, it could lead to incorrect date and time representations and calculations in applications using it. This can result in business logic errors, data corruption, and incorrect system behavior.
- Performance issues: Inefficient date and time operations can negatively impact the performance of applications, especially those that heavily rely on date and time processing.
- Compatibility problems: Issues with cross-platform compatibility can limit the library's usability and adoption, defeating its purpose of providing a multiplatform solution.
- Security vulnerabilities: Although less likely in a date/time library, vulnerabilities could potentially exist, especially in parsing or formatting routines, which could be exploited if not properly handled.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for the kotlinx-datetime project are primarily those inherent in the open-source development model and GitHub platform:
- security control: Code review process via pull requests on GitHub. Implemented on GitHub.
- security control: Issue tracking and bug reporting via GitHub Issues. Implemented on GitHub.
- security control: Publicly accessible codebase on GitHub, allowing for community scrutiny. Implemented on GitHub.

Accepted risks for the project include:
- accepted risk: Dependency on the Kotlin language and its ecosystem.
- accepted risk: Potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities in the library code.
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions and maintenance.

Recommended security controls to enhance the security posture:
- recommended security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to detect known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used during development or testing.
- recommended security control: Integrate static analysis security testing (SAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan the codebase for potential security weaknesses.
- recommended security control: Consider incorporating fuzz testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in parsing and formatting functions by providing a wide range of invalid or unexpected inputs.

Security requirements for the kotlinx-datetime project:
- Authentication: Not applicable. This is a library and does not handle user authentication.
- Authorization: Not applicable. This is a library and does not handle user authorization.
- Input validation: Input validation is crucial, especially when parsing date and time strings from external sources. The library must robustly handle invalid or malformed input to prevent unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities. Input validation should be implemented in parsing functions to ensure data conforms to expected formats and ranges.
- Cryptography: Not applicable. Cryptography is not a core requirement for a date and time library. However, if the library were to handle sensitive time-related data (which is not the current scope), cryptographic considerations might become relevant.

# DESIGN

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process protected by kotlinx-datetime is the correct handling of date and time in applications. Incorrect date and time calculations can impact various business processes depending on the application domain, such as financial transactions, scheduling systems, logging, data analysis, and more.

Data protected by kotlinx-datetime is primarily date and time information itself. The sensitivity of this data depends entirely on the context of the application using the library. In some applications, date and time might be considered non-sensitive public information. In others, especially those dealing with personal schedules, timestamps of events, or financial records, date and time data can be highly sensitive and require protection to maintain privacy, integrity, and compliance.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What are the specific performance requirements for kotlinx-datetime in different target platforms?
- Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that applications using kotlinx-datetime might need to adhere to, which could influence the library's design or security considerations?
- Is there a plan for regular security audits or penetration testing of kotlinx-datetime?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: Correctness and reliability are the highest priorities for kotlinx-datetime. Ease of use and multiplatform compatibility are also critical business goals.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Standard open-source development security practices are followed. The project benefits from community scrutiny and contributions to identify and address potential issues. Security is primarily focused on preventing bugs and ensuring correct behavior, with less emphasis on traditional application security concerns like authentication or authorization, as it is a library.
- DESIGN: The library is designed to be modular and extensible to support various date and time functionalities and platform-specific requirements. The API is designed for ease of use and clarity, minimizing the potential for developer errors that could lead to security issues or incorrect behavior.
