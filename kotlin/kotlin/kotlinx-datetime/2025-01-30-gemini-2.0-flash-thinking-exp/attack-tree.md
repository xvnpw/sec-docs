## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE]** Compromise Application via kotlinx-datetime](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_application_via_kotlinx-datetime.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker's overarching goal is to negatively impact the application using `kotlinx-datetime` by exploiting weaknesses within the library. This could lead to various negative outcomes, from incorrect application behavior to denial of service.
*   **Why Critical:** This is the root of the attack tree and represents the ultimate objective. All subsequent nodes and paths contribute to achieving this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE]** Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** This critical node focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how `kotlinx-datetime` parses date and time strings.  Improper handling of input strings can lead to exploitable weaknesses.
*   **Why Critical:** Parsing is a common entry point for attacks, especially when dealing with external or user-provided data. Vulnerabilities here can have a wide range of impacts.

    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH]** Input Injection
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   **Description:**  Attackers provide maliciously crafted date/time strings as input to the application, aiming to exploit parsing logic within `kotlinx-datetime`. If the library or application doesn't properly validate or sanitize these inputs, it can lead to unexpected behavior.
            *   **Example Scenarios:**
                *   Manipulating URL parameters or form fields that are parsed as dates.
                *   Injecting specially formatted strings into configuration files or API requests processed by the application and `kotlinx-datetime`.
            *   **Potential Impact:**
                *   Application errors and crashes due to parsing failures.
                *   Unexpected application behavior if the parsed date/time is used in logic.
                *   Potential for logic bypass if date/time values influence access control or business rules.
        *   **Mitigation Actions:**
            *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation of all date/time strings *before* they are passed to `kotlinx-datetime` parsing functions. Define expected formats and reject non-conforming inputs.
            *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling around parsing operations. Catch exceptions and log errors appropriately without revealing sensitive information to users.
            *   **Safe Parsing Functions:** Utilize strict parsing options provided by `kotlinx-datetime` if available, to minimize ambiguity and unexpected interpretations of input strings.

    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH]** Resource Exhaustion (DoS via Parsing)
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   **Description:** Attackers send a large volume of requests containing extremely complex or lengthy date/time strings. Parsing these strings can consume excessive CPU and memory resources, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
            *   **Example Scenarios:**
                *   Flooding the application with requests containing very long or computationally expensive date/time strings in request parameters or body.
                *   Exploiting API endpoints that parse dates from user input without proper resource limits.
            *   **Potential Impact:**
                *   Application unavailability and unresponsiveness due to resource exhaustion.
                *   Denial of service for legitimate users.
        *   **Mitigation Actions:**
            *   **Input Length Limits:** Enforce reasonable limits on the length of date/time input strings to prevent processing of excessively long inputs.
            *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single source within a given timeframe, mitigating DoS attempts.
            *   **Resource Monitoring:** Continuously monitor application resource usage (CPU, memory) to detect potential DoS attacks early and trigger alerts or mitigation measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE]** Exploit Time Zone Handling Issues](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_time_zone_handling_issues.md)

*   **Description:** This critical node focuses on vulnerabilities related to the complexities of time zone handling within `kotlinx-datetime`. Incorrect or ambiguous time zone management can lead to exploitable errors.
*   **Why Critical:** Time zone handling is notoriously error-prone, and mistakes can have significant consequences in applications dealing with time-sensitive data or operations across different geographical locations.

    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH]** Time Zone Confusion/Ambiguity
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   **Description:** Attackers exploit situations where the application is unclear or inconsistent about the time zone context of date/time values. This can occur when time zone information is missing, misinterpreted, or handled inconsistently throughout the application.
            *   **Example Scenarios:**
                *   Exploiting endpoints where dates are stored or processed without explicit time zone information, leading to misinterpretations based on server or user locale.
                *   Manipulating data where time zones are implicitly assumed but not consistently enforced, causing logic errors when data is processed in different time zone contexts.
            *   **Potential Impact:**
                *   Incorrect data processing and storage due to misinterpretation of time zones.
                *   Logic errors in scheduling, time-based access control, or reporting features.
                *   User confusion and incorrect information displayed due to time zone discrepancies.
        *   **Mitigation Actions:**
            *   **Explicit Time Zone Handling:** Always be explicit about time zones when working with dates and times that are time zone sensitive. Utilize time zone aware date/time types provided by `kotlinx-datetime` and avoid relying on implicit time zone assumptions.
            *   **Document Time Zone Assumptions:** Clearly document all time zone assumptions made within the application code, especially when dealing with external data sources or user input.
            *   **Consistent Time Zone Strategy:** Establish and enforce a consistent time zone handling strategy throughout the application. A common best practice is to store all dates and times in UTC and convert to local time zones only for display purposes.
