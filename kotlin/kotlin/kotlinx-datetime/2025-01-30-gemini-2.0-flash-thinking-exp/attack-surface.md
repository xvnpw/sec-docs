# Attack Surface Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx-datetime

## Attack Surface: [String Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/string_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting flaws in `kotlinx-datetime`'s date and time string parsing functions to cause Denial of Service or potentially other unexpected behavior.
*   **kotlinx-datetime Contribution:** Provides functions like `Instant.parse()`, `LocalDateTime.parse()`, etc., which directly handle parsing string inputs, making them the entry point for these vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends extremely long or complex date/time strings to an application endpoint that uses `kotlinx-datetime` to parse them. This can lead to excessive CPU and memory consumption during parsing, resulting in a Denial of Service.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (High Impact), potential for unexpected application behavior if parsing logic is severely flawed (though less likely, still a concern).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation *before* passing strings to `kotlinx-datetime` parsing functions. Limit string length, complexity, and enforce expected formats using regular expressions or other validation techniques.
    *   **Error Handling and Resource Limits:** Implement proper error handling for parsing failures to prevent crashes.  Consider setting resource limits (e.g., timeouts) for parsing operations to mitigate DoS attempts.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** If parsing is exposed through an API, implement rate limiting to restrict the number of parsing requests from a single source within a given timeframe.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data (If Custom Serialization is Used with kotlinx-datetime)](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data__if_custom_serialization_is_used_with_kotlinx-datetime_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from deserializing date/time objects from untrusted sources if the application uses custom serialization mechanisms in conjunction with `kotlinx-datetime` and these mechanisms are flawed.
*   **kotlinx-datetime Contribution:** While `kotlinx-datetime` itself likely relies on standard Kotlin serialization, if developers implement *custom* serialization/deserialization logic for `kotlinx-datetime` objects (or objects containing them), vulnerabilities in this custom logic become a direct attack surface.
*   **Example:** An application uses a custom serialization format to store or transmit `kotlinx-datetime` `Instant` objects. If the deserialization process for this custom format is not secure, an attacker could craft malicious serialized data that, when deserialized, leads to Remote Code Execution or other critical vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (Critical Impact), Denial of Service (High Impact), Arbitrary Code Execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Custom Serialization:**  Prefer using standard, well-vetted serialization mechanisms provided by Kotlin (like `kotlinx.serialization`) for `kotlinx-datetime` objects. These are generally more secure and less prone to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Secure Deserialization Practices (If Custom Serialization is Necessary):** If custom serialization is absolutely required, follow secure deserialization best practices meticulously. This includes:
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate the structure and content of serialized data before deserialization.
        *   **Use Safe Deserialization Libraries:** If possible, leverage existing secure deserialization libraries instead of implementing custom logic from scratch.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure the deserialization process runs with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of custom serialization/deserialization code to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
