# Threat Model Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx-datetime

## Threat: [Malicious Input String Parsing - Denial of Service](./threats/malicious_input_string_parsing_-_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Input String Parsing - Denial of Service (DoS)
*   **Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted, excessively long or complex date/time strings to the application. The `kotlinx-datetime` parsing functions consume excessive CPU and memory resources attempting to parse these strings, leading to application slowdown or complete denial of service. The attacker might exploit public facing endpoints that process user-supplied date/time strings without proper validation, aiming to disrupt service availability.
*   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes, leading to significant service disruption for legitimate users. This can result in substantial financial loss, reputational damage, and inability to provide critical services.
*   **Affected kotlinx-datetime component:** `kotlinx-datetime` parsing functions (e.g., `Instant.parse()`, `LocalDateTime.parse()`, `LocalDate.parse()`, `DateTimePeriod.parse()`, etc.) across all modules.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation on all date/time strings received from external sources. Define allowed formats and maximum string lengths. Reject invalid inputs *before* passing them to `kotlinx-datetime` parsing functions.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement aggressive rate limiting on endpoints that process date/time strings to severely restrict the number of parsing requests from a single source within a given time frame.
    *   **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement robust resource monitoring (CPU, memory) with automated alerting to quickly detect and respond to potential DoS attacks in real-time.
    *   **Parsing Timeouts:** Configure timeouts for parsing operations to prevent indefinite resource consumption if parsing takes an unusually long time.

## Threat: [Malicious Input String Parsing - Critical Data Corruption and Logic Flaws](./threats/malicious_input_string_parsing_-_critical_data_corruption_and_logic_flaws.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Input String Parsing - Critical Data Corruption and Logic Flaws
*   **Description:** An attacker provides subtly crafted, ambiguous, or edge-case date/time strings that are parsed by `kotlinx-datetime` in an unintended way, bypassing basic validation. This leads to critical logical errors in the application's core date/time handling, causing significant data corruption, flawed business logic, or exploitable application states. The attacker might manipulate input fields in critical forms or API requests to inject these strings, targeting sensitive data processing.
*   **Impact:**  Large-scale data corruption affecting critical business data, severe flaws in core application logic leading to incorrect financial transactions or business decisions, potential for security bypasses if date/time logic is used for access control or authorization. This can result in major financial losses, legal repercussions, and severe reputational damage.
*   **Affected kotlinx-datetime component:** `kotlinx-datetime` parsing functions (e.g., `Instant.parse()`, `LocalDateTime.parse()`, `LocalDate.parse()`, `DateTimePeriod.parse()`, etc.) across all modules.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement *deep* input validation and sanitization beyond basic format checks. Use format specifiers during parsing and consider using a dedicated parsing library with stricter validation capabilities if `kotlinx-datetime` parsing alone is insufficient.
    *   **Comprehensive Unit and Integration Testing:** Develop extremely comprehensive unit and integration tests that cover a vast range of valid and *invalid* date/time input strings, including numerous edge cases, ambiguous formats, and potentially malicious inputs. Focus testing on critical business logic that relies on date/time parsing.
    *   **Fuzzing:** Employ fuzzing techniques to automatically generate a wide variety of potentially malicious date/time strings and test the application's parsing and handling robustness.
    *   **Security Code Review:** Conduct thorough security-focused code reviews specifically examining date/time parsing and handling logic, looking for potential vulnerabilities and logical flaws.

## Threat: [Incorrect Time Zone Conversion - Critical Business Logic Errors and Security Bypass](./threats/incorrect_time_zone_conversion_-_critical_business_logic_errors_and_security_bypass.md)

*   **Threat:** Incorrect Time Zone Conversion - Critical Business Logic Errors and Security Bypass
*   **Description:** A developer incorrectly handles time zone conversions using `kotlinx-datetime` in critical parts of the application. This could involve using the wrong time zone in sensitive operations, failing to account for time zone differences in distributed systems, or misunderstanding the nuances of time zone handling functions. This leads to dates and times being associated with incorrect time zones, resulting in critical business logic errors, incorrect financial transactions, or even security bypasses if time-based access control is affected. An attacker might exploit this indirectly by manipulating data or exploiting business logic flaws caused by time zone errors.
*   **Impact:** Critical business logic failures leading to incorrect financial transactions, regulatory compliance violations, or incorrect service delivery. Potential for security bypasses if time-based access control mechanisms are compromised due to time zone errors, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive resources or functionalities. This can result in significant financial losses, legal penalties, and severe security breaches.
*   **Affected kotlinx-datetime component:** Time zone conversion functions and classes (e.g., `TimeZone`, `Instant.toLocalDateTime()`, `LocalDateTime.toInstant()`, `TimeZone.atZone()`, etc.) in the `kotlinx-datetime-core` module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Explicit Time Zone Handling in Critical Code:** Enforce explicit time zone specification in all critical code paths involving date/time operations. Implement code analysis tools or linters to detect and prevent implicit time zone usage in sensitive areas.
    *   **Centralized Time Zone Management:** Implement a centralized time zone management strategy and library within the application to ensure consistent and correct time zone handling across all modules.
    *   **Rigorous Testing of Time Zone Conversions in Critical Paths:** Conduct extremely rigorous testing of time zone conversions specifically in critical business logic paths and security-sensitive functionalities. Test with a wide range of time zones, including edge cases and historical time zone changes.
    *   **Security Audits Focused on Time Zone Handling:** Conduct dedicated security audits specifically focused on reviewing time zone handling logic in critical application components to identify potential vulnerabilities and logical errors.
