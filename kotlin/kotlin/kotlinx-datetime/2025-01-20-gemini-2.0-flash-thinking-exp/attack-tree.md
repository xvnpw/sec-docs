## Attack Tree Path: [Root: Compromise Application Using kotlinx-datetime](./attack_tree_paths/root_compromise_application_using_kotlinx-datetime.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application through vulnerabilities in how it uses `kotlinx-datetime`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

This node represents a critical attack vector because applications often receive date and time information from external sources (users, APIs, etc.). Exploiting vulnerabilities in how this input is handled is a common and effective way to compromise applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Date/Time String Parsing](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_datetime_string_parsing.md)

This node is critical because the process of parsing date and time strings is complex and can be susceptible to various vulnerabilities if not handled carefully. Attackers can craft malicious strings to trigger unexpected behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Logic Errors due to Unexpected Parsing Behavior](./attack_tree_paths/logic_errors_due_to_unexpected_parsing_behavior.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker provides date/time strings that, while potentially valid in some sense, parse into values that the application logic does not anticipate or handle correctly. This can lead to the application making incorrect decisions, bypassing security checks, or accessing unauthorized data.
**High-Risk Path Association:** Root --> Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities --> Malicious Date/Time String Parsing --> Logic Errors due to Unexpected Parsing Behavior

## Attack Tree Path: [Time Zone Confusion Leading to Incorrect Calculations](./attack_tree_paths/time_zone_confusion_leading_to_incorrect_calculations.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker provides date and time information with ambiguous or conflicting time zone information. If the application doesn't handle time zones explicitly and consistently, `kotlinx-datetime` might make assumptions that lead to incorrect calculations. This can affect scheduling, access control based on time, or other time-sensitive logic.
**High-Risk Path Association:** Root --> Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities --> Exploiting Time Zone Handling --> Time Zone Confusion Leading to Incorrect Calculations

## Attack Tree Path: [Integer Overflow/Underflow in Date/Time Arithmetic](./attack_tree_paths/integer_overflowunderflow_in_datetime_arithmetic.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates the application to perform date and time calculations (e.g., adding large durations) that result in integer overflow or underflow. If the application doesn't properly handle these edge cases, it can lead to unexpected and potentially exploitable behavior in the application logic. For example, a calculation might wrap around to a completely different date.
**High-Risk Path Association:** Root --> Exploit Calculation Vulnerabilities --> Integer Overflow/Underflow in Date/Time Arithmetic --> Logic Errors due to Overflow/Underflow

## Attack Tree Path: [Logic Errors due to Overflow/Underflow](./attack_tree_paths/logic_errors_due_to_overflowunderflow.md)

**Attack Vector:** This is the direct consequence of integer overflow or underflow in date/time arithmetic. The unexpected values resulting from the overflow/underflow are then used in application logic, leading to incorrect behavior, potential security breaches, or other flaws.
**High-Risk Path Association:** Root --> Exploit Calculation Vulnerabilities --> Integer Overflow/Underflow in Date/Time Arithmetic --> Logic Errors due to Overflow/Underflow

## Attack Tree Path: [Maliciously Crafted Serialized Date/Time Objects](./attack_tree_paths/maliciously_crafted_serialized_datetime_objects.md)

This node is critical if the application serializes and deserializes `kotlinx-datetime` objects, especially if this data comes from untrusted sources. Attackers can craft malicious serialized data to exploit vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Injection or Deserialization Gadgets (If `kotlinx-datetime` serializes complex objects)](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection_or_deserialization_gadgets__if__kotlinx-datetime__serializes_complex_objects_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If `kotlinx-datetime` serializes more than just basic date/time values and the application deserializes user-controlled data, an attacker can craft malicious serialized data that, when deserialized, leads to code execution on the server or client. This often involves exploiting "deserialization gadgets," which are chains of existing classes that can be manipulated to achieve arbitrary code execution.
**High-Risk Path Association:** Root --> Exploit Serialization/Deserialization Vulnerabilities (If applicable) --> Maliciously Crafted Serialized Date/Time Objects --> Code Injection or Deserialization Gadgets (If `kotlinx-datetime` serializes complex objects)

## Attack Tree Path: [Root --> Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities --> Malicious Date/Time String Parsing --> Logic Errors due to Unexpected Parsing Behavior](./attack_tree_paths/root_--_exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities_--_malicious_datetime_string_parsing_--_logic_errors__a8d3f315.md)

This path represents a common attack vector where malicious input is used to manipulate application logic. The attacker leverages the complexity of date/time parsing to introduce unexpected values.

## Attack Tree Path: [Root --> Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities --> Exploiting Time Zone Handling --> Time Zone Confusion Leading to Incorrect Calculations](./attack_tree_paths/root_--_exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities_--_exploiting_time_zone_handling_--_time_zone_confusi_2a6bccb8.md)

This path highlights the risks associated with improper time zone handling. Attackers can exploit the intricacies of time zones to cause errors in time-sensitive operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Root --> Exploit Calculation Vulnerabilities --> Integer Overflow/Underflow in Date/Time Arithmetic --> Logic Errors due to Overflow/Underflow](./attack_tree_paths/root_--_exploit_calculation_vulnerabilities_--_integer_overflowunderflow_in_datetime_arithmetic_--_l_d5895ed5.md)

This path focuses on the dangers of performing arithmetic operations on date and time values without proper bounds checking. Attackers can trigger overflows or underflows to cause logical errors.

## Attack Tree Path: [Root --> Exploit Serialization/Deserialization Vulnerabilities (If applicable) --> Maliciously Crafted Serialized Date/Time Objects --> Code Injection or Deserialization Gadgets (If `kotlinx-datetime` serializes complex objects)](./attack_tree_paths/root_--_exploit_serializationdeserialization_vulnerabilities__if_applicable__--_maliciously_crafted__74325998.md)

This path, while potentially lower in likelihood, represents a very high-impact scenario where deserialization vulnerabilities can lead to complete system compromise through remote code execution.
