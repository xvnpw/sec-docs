# Threat Model Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx-datetime

## Threat: [Maliciously Crafted Date/Time String Exploitation](./threats/maliciously_crafted_datetime_string_exploitation.md)

**Threat:** Maliciously Crafted Date/Time String Exploitation

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted or excessively long date/time string to a `kotlinx-datetime` parsing function (e.g., `Instant.parse()`, `LocalDateTime.parse()`, `DateTimePeriod.parse()`). This could exploit potential vulnerabilities in the parsing logic, leading to resource exhaustion or unexpected program behavior. The attacker might attempt to cause a denial of service by overloading the parsing mechanism or trigger an unhandled exception leading to application crash.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application instability, potential for arbitrary code execution if a severe parsing vulnerability exists (though less likely in a well-maintained library).

**Affected Component:** `kotlinx-datetime-core` module, specifically the parsing functions within classes like `Instant`, `LocalDateTime`, `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `OffsetDateTime`, `DateTimePeriod`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation before passing any user-provided date/time strings to `kotlinx-datetime` parsing functions.
* Define and enforce expected date/time formats using regular expressions or custom validation logic.
* Set limits on the length of input date/time strings.
* Use try-catch blocks to handle potential `DateTimeFormatException` or other parsing exceptions gracefully, preventing application crashes.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow/Underflow in Date/Time Arithmetic](./threats/integer_overflowunderflow_in_datetime_arithmetic.md)

**Threat:** Integer Overflow/Underflow in Date/Time Arithmetic

**Description:** While `kotlinx-datetime` is designed to handle date/time arithmetic safely, there might be edge cases where performing calculations with extremely large durations or on dates far in the past or future could potentially lead to integer overflow or underflow if not handled perfectly within the library's internal implementation. This could result in incorrect date/time values.

**Impact:** Incorrect date/time values, unexpected application behavior, potential security vulnerabilities if these values are used for critical logic (e.g., expiry dates, timeouts).

**Affected Component:** `kotlinx-datetime-core` module, specifically functions for adding or subtracting durations from date/time instances (e.g., `plus()`, `minus()` on `Instant`, `LocalDateTime`, etc.).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Be mindful of performing arithmetic operations with extremely large durations or on dates far outside the typical application's timeframe.
* While the library should handle this, consider adding checks for excessively large or small date/time values if your application deals with extreme ranges.
* Report any observed overflow/underflow issues to the `kotlinx-datetime` maintainers.
