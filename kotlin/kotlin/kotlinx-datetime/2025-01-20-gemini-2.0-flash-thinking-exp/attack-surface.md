# Attack Surface Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx-datetime

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Date/Time Strings during Parsing](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_datetime_strings_during_parsing.md)

* **Description:** The application parses date and time strings received from untrusted sources (e.g., user input, external APIs).
    * **How kotlinx-datetime Contributes:** `kotlinx-datetime` provides functions like `LocalDateTime.parse()`, `Instant.parse()`, etc., which can be targets for malformed or excessively complex strings.
    * **Example:** An attacker provides the string "9999999999-12-31T23:59:59Z" to a function using `LocalDateTime.parse()`.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (resource exhaustion), unexpected application behavior, potential for underlying parsing library vulnerabilities to be triggered.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict input validation on date/time strings received from untrusted sources.
        * Define expected formats and reject inputs that do not conform.
        * Consider using try-catch blocks around parsing operations to handle potential exceptions gracefully.
        * Sanitize or normalize date/time strings before parsing if possible.
