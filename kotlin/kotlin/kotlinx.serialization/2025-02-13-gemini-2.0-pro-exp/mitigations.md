# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx.serialization

## Mitigation Strategy: [Polymorphic Serialization Controls (Using `SerializersModule`)](./mitigation_strategies/polymorphic_serialization_controls__using__serializersmodule__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Polymorphic Types:** Determine which classes or interfaces require polymorphic serialization (different subclasses deserialized based on input).
    2.  **Create a `SerializersModule`:** Define a `SerializersModule` instance. This is the *core* of controlling polymorphic deserialization.
    3.  **Register Subclasses Explicitly:** Within the `SerializersModule`, use the `polymorphic` builder and `subclass(SubClass::class)` to register *each* allowed subclass for *each* polymorphic base class/interface.
    4.  **Avoid Default Serializers:** *Crucially*, do *not* use the `default` option within the `polymorphic` builder when dealing with untrusted input. This would bypass the restrictions.
    5.  **Configure `Json` Instance:** Create a `Json` instance (or equivalent for other formats) and set its `serializersModule` property to your defined `SerializersModule`.
    6.  **Use the Configured Instance:** Use *only* this configured `Json` instance for all serialization and deserialization involving the controlled polymorphic types.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintended Class Instantiation (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting arbitrary class names, which could lead to the instantiation of malicious classes.
    *   **Type Confusion (High Severity):** Ensures that only registered and expected subclasses are deserialized, maintaining type safety.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unintended Class Instantiation:** Risk significantly reduced (near elimination if all polymorphic types are correctly managed).
    *   **Type Confusion:** Risk significantly reduced (as a direct consequence of controlling class instantiation).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `EventProcessor.kt` uses a `SerializersModule` to control deserialization of different event types.
    *   `PluginManager.kt` uses a `SerializersModule` for different plugin types.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `ReportService.kt` uses polymorphic serialization but relies on the default (open) behavior.  This *must* be refactored to use a `SerializersModule`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Handling of Default Values (with `@Required` and Custom Decoders)](./mitigation_strategies/careful_handling_of_default_values__with__@required__and_custom_decoders_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Existing Defaults:** Examine all data classes used with `kotlinx.serialization` and identify fields with default values.
    2.  **Assess Security:** For *each* default value, consider if it could create an insecure state if an attacker omits the field.
    3.  **Use `@Required`:** For fields that *must* be present, annotate them with `@Required`. This forces `kotlinx.serialization` to throw an exception if the field is missing in the input.
    4.  **(Custom Decoder - Directly Related to `kotlinx.serialization`):** If a field has a default, *and* you need extra validation *even when the default is used*, implement a custom `Decoder`.  Within the decoder's methods (e.g., `decodeString`, `decodeInt`), check the value *after* it's been set (either from input or the default). This is a `kotlinx.serialization`-specific mechanism.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Insecure Default State (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents objects from being created in an insecure state due to omitted fields and potentially unsafe defaults.
    *   **Bypassing Security Checks (Medium to High Severity):** Ensures required fields are present, preventing bypass of validation/authorization.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Insecure Default State:** Risk reduced (effectiveness depends on review and use of `@Required`).
    *   **Bypassing Security Checks:** Risk reduced (effectiveness depends on `@Required` and custom decoder validation).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `UserService.kt` uses `@Required` for `username` and `password`.
    *   `ProductService.kt` uses a custom decoder to validate the `price` field, even with a default.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `SessionData.kt` has a default `expiryTime`. Review and potentially use `@Required` or a custom decoder.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Deserialization Depth (Custom Decoder)](./mitigation_strategies/limit_deserialization_depth__custom_decoder_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Determine Depth Limit:** Establish a reasonable maximum nesting depth for your data structures, based on application needs and resources.
    2.  **Implement Custom `Decoder`:** Create a custom `Decoder` implementation. This is the *only* way to directly control depth within `kotlinx.serialization`.
    3.  **Track Depth:** Inside the custom decoder, maintain a counter to track the current nesting level. Increment it when entering a nested structure (e.g., `beginStructure`) and decrement it when leaving (`endStructure`).
    4.  **Enforce Limit:** In the decoder's methods (e.g., `beginStructure`), check if the depth exceeds the limit. If it does, throw a `SerializationException` (or a custom exception).
    5.  **Use the Custom Decoder:** Use this custom decoder when deserializing data that might be deeply nested.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Stack Overflow (Medium Severity):** Prevents deeply nested objects from causing stack overflow errors during deserialization. This is a direct mitigation within the deserialization process.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS via Stack Overflow:** Risk significantly reduced (effectiveness depends on the chosen depth limit).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   A custom decoder with depth limiting (`DeeplyNestedDataDecoder.kt`) exists but is *not currently used*.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `DeeplyNestedDataDecoder.kt` *must* be integrated into services handling potentially deeply nested data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Custom Deserialization Logic (Custom `Decoder` for Complex Validation)](./mitigation_strategies/custom_deserialization_logic__custom__decoder__for_complex_validation_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Complex Validation Needs:** Determine if you have validation requirements that go beyond simple type checking or schema validation and *must* be performed during the deserialization process itself.
    2.  **Implement Custom `Decoder`:** Create a custom `Decoder` implementation. This gives you fine-grained control over the deserialization process.
    3.  **Override Decoding Methods:** Override the relevant decoding methods (e.g., `decodeString`, `decodeInt`, `decodeBoolean`, `decodeSerializableValue`) in your custom decoder.
    4.  **Perform Validation:** Within the overridden methods, perform your custom validation logic *before* or *after* delegating to the underlying decoder (using `decode...` calls on the delegate).
    5.  **Throw Exceptions:** If validation fails, throw a `SerializationException` (or a custom exception derived from it) to halt deserialization.
    6. **Use the Custom Decoder:** Use your custom decoder when deserializing data that requires this complex validation.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Complex Business Rule Violations (Severity Varies):** Allows enforcement of complex business rules that cannot be expressed through simple schema validation.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Severity Varies):** Ensures that data meets specific criteria beyond basic type and structure checks.
    *   **Injection Attacks (in specific cases) (High Severity):** If the custom validation logic is designed to prevent specific injection patterns, it can mitigate those risks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Complex Business Rule Violations:** Risk reduced (effectiveness depends entirely on the implemented validation logic).
    *   **Data Integrity Issues:** Risk reduced (effectiveness depends entirely on the implemented validation logic).
    *   **Injection Attacks:** Risk reduced *only if* the custom decoder is specifically designed to address those attacks.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `ProductService.kt` uses a custom decoder to validate the `price` field.
    *   `ConfigurationManager.kt` uses a custom decoder for configuration file structure validation.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No other areas currently identified as needing custom decoder-based validation, but this should be re-evaluated as new features are added.
