# Deep Analysis: Deeply Nested Objects Attack on kotlinx.serialization

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly investigate the "Deeply Nested Objects" attack vector against applications utilizing the `kotlinx.serialization` library.  We will examine the specific mechanisms by which this attack can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) via stack overflow, assess the library's inherent vulnerabilities and potential mitigations, and provide concrete recommendations for developers.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following:

*   **Target Library:** `kotlinx.serialization` (all supported formats: JSON, CBOR, Protobuf, etc., will be considered, with a primary focus on JSON due to its prevalence).
*   **Attack Vector:**  Exploitation of deeply nested object structures during deserialization to induce a stack overflow.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) through application crash.  We are *not* considering code execution or data exfiltration in this specific analysis.
*   **Kotlin Versions:**  We will consider the behavior across a range of recent Kotlin and `kotlinx.serialization` library versions, noting any version-specific differences.
* **Platform:** We will consider JVM.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examination of the `kotlinx.serialization` source code (specifically the deserialization logic) to identify potential areas of concern related to recursive processing and stack depth management.
2.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Review of existing CVEs, bug reports, and security advisories related to `kotlinx.serialization` and similar serialization libraries in other languages (e.g., Jackson, Gson in Java) to identify known vulnerabilities and attack patterns.
3.  **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Development:**  Creation of Kotlin code that attempts to trigger a stack overflow by deserializing deeply nested objects using `kotlinx.serialization`.  This will involve crafting malicious input payloads in various formats (JSON, CBOR, etc.).
4.  **Testing and Analysis:**  Execution of the PoC code under controlled conditions (e.g., with limited stack size) to observe the behavior and confirm the vulnerability.  We will measure the nesting depth required to trigger the overflow.
5.  **Mitigation Analysis:**  Evaluation of potential mitigation strategies, including:
    *   Input validation and sanitization.
    *   Configuration options within `kotlinx.serialization` (if any).
    *   Custom deserializers.
    *   External libraries or tools for depth limiting.
    *   Architectural changes to reduce reliance on deeply nested data structures.
6. **Documentation Review:** Review documentation of `kotlinx.serialization` to find any information about this vulnerability.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2.2.1. Deeply Nested Objects

### 4.1. Attack Mechanism

The attack exploits the recursive nature of deserialization.  When `kotlinx.serialization` encounters a nested object in the input (e.g., a JSON object within another JSON object), it typically calls itself recursively to deserialize the inner object.  This process continues until the innermost object is reached.  Each recursive call consumes stack space.  If the nesting depth is sufficiently large, the available stack space can be exhausted, leading to a `StackOverflowError` and application crash.

### 4.2.  `kotlinx.serialization` Specifics

*   **Recursive Deserialization:**  `kotlinx.serialization` relies heavily on recursive descent parsing for deserialization.  The `decodeStructure` and related functions in the deserialization process are inherently recursive.
*   **Format Agnostic (Mostly):**  While the specific parsing logic differs between formats (JSON, CBOR, Protobuf), the fundamental recursive approach is common to all.  JSON is likely the most easily exploitable due to its human-readable and easily crafted nature.
*   **Lack of Built-in Depth Limits:**  As of the current versions (up to 1.6.x), `kotlinx.serialization` *does not* provide a built-in mechanism to limit the maximum nesting depth during deserialization.  This is a crucial point and a significant contributing factor to the vulnerability.
* **Custom Serializers:** It is possible to create custom serializer, that will handle this vulnerability.

### 4.3. Proof-of-Concept (PoC) - JSON Example

```kotlin
import kotlinx.serialization.*
import kotlinx.serialization.json.*

@Serializable
data class Nested(val n: Nested? = null)

fun main() {
    val depth = 5000 // Adjust this value to test different depths
    val jsonString = buildString {
        append("{\"n\":".repeat(depth))
        append("null")
        append("}".repeat(depth))
    }

    try {
        val obj = Json.decodeFromString<Nested>(jsonString)
        println("Deserialization successful (unexpected!)")
    } catch (e: StackOverflowError) {
        println("StackOverflowError caught at depth: $depth")
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        println("Other exception: $e")
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Nested` Data Class:**  Defines a simple data class that can contain a reference to itself (`n: Nested?`), allowing for recursive nesting.
2.  **`buildString`:**  Constructs a JSON string with a specified `depth` of nested objects.  Each level adds `{"n":` at the beginning and `}` at the end.
3.  **`Json.decodeFromString`:**  Attempts to deserialize the generated JSON string into a `Nested` object.
4.  **`try-catch`:**  Catches the expected `StackOverflowError` and prints a message.  The `depth` variable can be adjusted to find the threshold for your specific environment.

### 4.4.  Mitigation Strategies

1.  **Input Validation (Strict and Specific):**
    *   **Schema Validation:**  If possible, use a schema validation library (e.g., a JSON Schema validator) *before* passing the input to `kotlinx.serialization`.  This allows you to define strict limits on the structure and depth of the data.
    *   **Depth Limiting (Custom):**  Implement a custom pre-processing step that parses the input (e.g., as a string or byte stream) and checks for excessive nesting depth *before* deserialization.  This can be done with a simple counter that increments on opening braces/brackets and decrements on closing ones.  Reject the input if the depth exceeds a predefined limit.
    * **Data Structure Validation:** Validate data structure to prevent unexpected types.

2.  **Custom Deserializers (Advanced):**
    *   Write a custom deserializer for the affected data classes.  Within the custom deserializer, you can manually control the recursion and implement depth checks.  This is the most robust but also the most complex solution.  It requires a deep understanding of `kotlinx.serialization`'s internal workings.

3.  **Architectural Changes:**
    *   **Avoid Deep Nesting:**  If feasible, redesign your data structures to minimize or eliminate deep nesting.  Consider using flatter structures or alternative representations (e.g., IDs referencing other objects instead of embedding them directly).
    *   **Limit Data Size:**  Enforce reasonable limits on the overall size of the input data.  This can help mitigate other potential resource exhaustion attacks.

4.  **External Libraries (Less Recommended for Depth Limiting):**
    *   While there are general-purpose JSON parsing libraries that might offer depth limiting, integrating them with `kotlinx.serialization` can be complex and might defeat the purpose of using a dedicated serialization library.  This is generally less preferred than custom pre-processing or custom deserializers.

5. **Fail Fast:**
    *   Implement fail-fast mechanisms to quickly detect and handle potential stack overflow errors. This can involve setting appropriate thread stack sizes and using monitoring tools to detect excessive recursion.

### 4.5.  Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize Input Validation:**  Implement a robust input validation layer *before* using `kotlinx.serialization`.  This is the most critical and effective mitigation.  Use a combination of schema validation (if applicable) and custom depth limiting.
2.  **Set a Conservative Depth Limit:**  Choose a maximum nesting depth that is well below the expected stack overflow threshold.  A value like 10-20 is often a reasonable starting point, but you should test and adjust based on your application's needs and environment.
3.  **Consider Custom Deserializers for Critical Data:**  If you have data classes that are particularly vulnerable (due to their structure or the sensitivity of the data they handle), invest the effort to create custom deserializers with built-in depth checks.
4.  **Monitor and Log:**  Implement monitoring to detect and log any attempts to exceed the defined depth limits.  This can help you identify potential attacks and fine-tune your security measures.
5.  **Stay Updated:**  Keep `kotlinx.serialization` and the Kotlin runtime updated to the latest versions.  While there's no guarantee of a fix for this specific issue, future releases might include improvements or security enhancements.
6. **Advocate for Built-in Limits:** Consider opening an issue or feature request on the `kotlinx.serialization` GitHub repository to advocate for built-in depth limiting during deserialization.  This would be the ideal long-term solution.

## 5. Conclusion

The "Deeply Nested Objects" attack vector is a serious vulnerability for applications using `kotlinx.serialization` due to the library's lack of built-in depth limiting during deserialization.  By implementing robust input validation, setting conservative depth limits, and potentially using custom deserializers, developers can effectively mitigate this risk and prevent denial-of-service attacks.  It is crucial to prioritize proactive security measures and stay informed about potential vulnerabilities in the libraries used in your applications.
