# Deep Analysis: Arbitrary Code Execution via Polymorphic Deserialization in `kotlinx.serialization`

## 1. Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the mechanics of Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) vulnerabilities arising from the misuse of polymorphic deserialization features in the `kotlinx.serialization` library.  We aim to identify specific code patterns, configurations, and external factors that contribute to this vulnerability, and to provide concrete, actionable recommendations for developers to prevent it.  This analysis will go beyond the general description and delve into the library's internals and common usage scenarios.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following:

*   **`kotlinx.serialization` library:**  We will examine the library's features related to polymorphic serialization and deserialization, including `@SerialName`, class discriminators, `SerializersModule`, and custom `DeserializationStrategy` implementations.
*   **JSON format:** While `kotlinx.serialization` supports other formats, we will concentrate on JSON, as it's the most common format used in web applications and APIs, and thus a frequent vector for this attack.
*   **Kotlin language:**  The analysis assumes the application is written in Kotlin.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE):**  We will not cover other deserialization-related vulnerabilities (e.g., denial-of-service) unless they directly contribute to ACE.
* **Server-side context:** We are primarily concerned with server-side applications that receive and deserialize potentially untrusted data.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the `kotlinx.serialization` source code (specifically, parts related to polymorphic handling) to understand the internal mechanisms and potential weaknesses.
2.  **Vulnerability Pattern Identification:**  Identify common coding patterns and configurations that are known to be vulnerable.
3.  **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Development:** Create simplified, but realistic, PoC examples demonstrating the vulnerability and its exploitation.  This will *not* include actual exploits, but rather demonstrate the principle.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Evaluation:**  Assess the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies against the identified vulnerability patterns and PoCs.
5.  **Best Practice Recommendations:**  Develop clear, concise, and actionable recommendations for developers to prevent this vulnerability.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 4.1. Core Vulnerability Mechanism

The core of the vulnerability lies in the combination of these factors:

*   **Polymorphic Deserialization:** `kotlinx.serialization` allows deserializing JSON data into objects of different classes based on a class discriminator field (usually `@SerialName` or a custom discriminator).
*   **Untrusted Input:** The application receives JSON data from an untrusted source (e.g., a network request).
*   **Missing or Inadequate Class Discriminator Validation:** The application *fails* to properly validate the class discriminator against a strict whitelist *before* `kotlinx.serialization` attempts to instantiate the object.
* **Gadget Availability:** The attacker needs a "gadget" class. This is a class that, when instantiated or during its deserialization process, executes attacker-controlled code. This could be:
    *   A class with a malicious constructor.
    *   A class with a `@PostDeserialize` method that executes malicious code.
    *   A class that leverages other vulnerabilities in its initialization logic.

### 4.2. `kotlinx.serialization` Internals (Relevant Aspects)

*   **`decodeSerializableValue`:** This function (and related internal functions) in `AbstractDecoder` is the entry point for deserialization. It's responsible for reading the class discriminator and finding the appropriate serializer.
*   **`SerializersModule`:** This module maps class discriminators to `KSerializer` instances.  If the module contains a serializer for a malicious class, and the discriminator validation is weak, the library will use that serializer.
*   **`PolymorphicSerializer`:** This serializer is used for polymorphic types. It handles the logic of reading the discriminator and delegating to the appropriate serializer based on the `SerializersModule`.
*   **`decodeSerializableElement`:** Used to decode a value of a specific type.

### 4.3. Vulnerability Patterns and Examples

**Pattern 1: No Discriminator Validation**

```kotlin
// Vulnerable Code
interface Shape
@Serializable @SerialName("circle") data class Circle(val radius: Double) : Shape
@Serializable @SerialName("square") data class Square(val side: Double) : Shape

// Malicious class (not part of the intended hierarchy, but implements Shape)
@Serializable @SerialName("exploit")
class Exploit : Shape {
    init {
        // Execute arbitrary code (e.g., run a shell command)
        Runtime.getRuntime().exec("echo 'Vulnerable!' > /tmp/vulnerable.txt")
    }
}

fun deserializeShape(jsonString: String): Shape {
    val format = Json { isLenient = true; ignoreUnknownKeys = true; } // Common, but risky settings
    return format.decodeFromString<Shape>(jsonString) // No validation!
}

// Attacker sends:  {"type":"exploit"}
```

**Explanation:** The `deserializeShape` function directly uses `decodeFromString` without any validation of the class discriminator.  The attacker can provide JSON with `"type":"exploit"`, and `kotlinx.serialization` will instantiate the `Exploit` class, executing the malicious code in its constructor.  `isLenient = true` and `ignoreUnknownKeys = true` make the attack easier, as the attacker doesn't need to provide all fields.

**Pattern 2: Inadequate Whitelist (Regex or Partial Matching)**

```kotlin
// Vulnerable Code - Inadequate Whitelist
fun deserializeShape(jsonString: String): Shape {
    val format = Json
    val json = Json.parseToJsonElement(jsonString).jsonObject
    val type = json["type"]?.jsonPrimitive?.content ?: throw IllegalArgumentException("Type missing")

    // INADEQUATE: Only checks if the type *starts with* "circle" or "square"
    if (!type.startsWith("circle") && !type.startsWith("square")) {
        throw IllegalArgumentException("Invalid shape type")
    }

    return format.decodeFromString<Shape>(jsonString)
}

// Attacker sends: {"type":"circle.Exploit"}  // Bypasses the check
```

**Explanation:** The validation only checks the *beginning* of the discriminator string.  An attacker can craft a discriminator like `"circle.Exploit"` that bypasses the check but still leads to the instantiation of a malicious class (if such a class is registered in the `SerializersModule`, or if the attacker can somehow influence class loading).

**Pattern 3: Overly Broad `SerializersModule`**

```kotlin
// Vulnerable Code - Overly Broad SerializersModule
val myModule = SerializersModule {
    polymorphic(Any::class) { // Registers serializers for *all* subtypes of Any
        subclass(Circle::class)
        subclass(Square::class)
        // ... potentially many other classes, including unintentionally registered ones
    }
}

val format = Json { serializersModule = myModule }

fun deserializeShape(jsonString: String): Shape {
    // ... (Even with some validation, the large module increases the attack surface)
    return format.decodeFromString<Shape>(jsonString)
}
```

**Explanation:** Registering `polymorphic(Any::class)` is extremely dangerous.  It essentially tells `kotlinx.serialization` to try to deserialize *any* class it encounters.  Even with discriminator validation, the attacker has a much larger pool of potential "gadget" classes to choose from.

**Pattern 4:  Using Default Serializers with Untrusted Data**

```kotlin
@Serializable
data class MyData(val data: String)

//Vulnerable
fun processData(input: String) {
    val data = Json.decodeFromString<MyData>(input)
}
```
While not directly related to polymorphism, using the default serializer without any input validation can lead to other issues. If `MyData` had a custom deserializer or used a type that had side effects during deserialization, this could be exploited.
