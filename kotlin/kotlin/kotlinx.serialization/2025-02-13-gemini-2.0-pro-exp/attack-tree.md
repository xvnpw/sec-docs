## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Exploit Polymorphic Deserialization [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__exploit_polymorphic_deserialization__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most dangerous attack vector, aiming for arbitrary code execution.  It leverages the flexibility of polymorphic deserialization, where the actual type being deserialized is determined at runtime.  If an attacker can control the type being deserialized, they can potentially instantiate malicious classes.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.3. Trigger Deserialization of Crafted Input [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_3__trigger_deserialization_of_crafted_input__critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker needs to find a place in the application where user-supplied data is fed into a polymorphic deserializer.  This could be an API endpoint, a form field, or any other input mechanism.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
*   **Impact:** Very High (Arbitrary Code Execution)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2.1. Find Misuse of `Any` or `Object` [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_1__find_misuse_of__any__or__object___critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  If the application uses `Any` or `Object` as the target type for deserialization, it essentially opens the door for the attacker to inject *any* type they want. This bypasses any type safety checks.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High (Arbitrary Code Execution)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3.2 Inject data that will be deserialized as vulnerable subclass [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_2_inject_data_that_will_be_deserialized_as_vulnerable_subclass__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker needs to craft input that will force deserializer to use vulnerable subclass of sealed class.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Exploit Deserialization of Untrusted Data Without Proper Validation](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__exploit_deserialization_of_untrusted_data_without_proper_validation.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.1. Identify Fields with Missing or Weak Validation [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_1__identify_fields_with_missing_or_weak_validation__critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  This is the foundation for many attacks.  The attacker looks for fields in the deserialized objects that are not properly validated *after* deserialization.  This allows them to inject invalid data that can cause various problems.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
*   **Impact:** Low to Medium (Data Corruption, Logic Errors)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2. Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Resource Consumption [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2__denial_of_service__dos__via_excessive_resource_consumption__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack aims to make the application unavailable by consuming excessive resources (CPU, memory, stack space).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.1. Deeply Nested Objects](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_1__deeply_nested_objects.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker sends input with deeply nested objects, forcing the deserializer to recursively process them, potentially leading to a stack overflow.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Application Crash)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.2. Large Collections/Arrays](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_2__large_collectionsarrays.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker sends input with extremely large collections or arrays, consuming a large amount of memory and potentially leading to an out-of-memory error.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Application Crash)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.3. Circular References](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_3__circular_references.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker crafts input with circular references (object A references object B, which references object A).  If not handled correctly, this can lead to infinite loops or excessive memory consumption.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (kotlinx.serialization has built-in protection)
*   **Impact:** High (Application Crash)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.4. Slow Deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_4__slow_deserialization.md)

*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.3. Bypass Security Checks [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_3__bypass_security_checks__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack aims to manipulate security-related data (e.g., roles, permissions, authentication tokens) to gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.3.2. Craft Input to Manipulate Security-Relevant Fields [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_3_2__craft_input_to_manipulate_security-relevant_fields__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts input to set security-related fields to values that bypass security checks.  For example, they might try to set a "role" field to "admin".
*   **Likelihood:** Low (If proper validation and separation of concerns are used)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Unauthorized Access)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
