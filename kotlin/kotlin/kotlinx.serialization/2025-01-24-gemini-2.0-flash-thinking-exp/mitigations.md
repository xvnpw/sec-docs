# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx.serialization

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Schema Validation with Kotlinx.serialization](./mitigation_strategies/strict_schema_validation_with_kotlinx_serialization.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Data Classes with Serialization Annotations:** Create Kotlin data classes that precisely represent the expected structure and data types of your serialized data.  Crucially, use `kotlinx.serialization` annotations like `@SerialName`, `@Required`, `@Optional`, and `@EncodeDefault` *within these data classes* to define the schema directly for `kotlinx.serialization`.
    2.  **Leverage Kotlinx.serialization's Built-in Validation:** Rely on `kotlinx.serialization`'s inherent type checking and annotation enforcement during deserialization. Ensure you are *not* using lenient deserialization modes that might bypass these checks.
    3.  **Implement Custom Serializers/Deserializers Carefully (if needed):** If you create custom serializers or deserializers, ensure they include robust validation logic *within their implementation* to enforce schema constraints at the serialization/deserialization level.
    4.  **Fail-Fast on Deserialization Errors:** Configure `kotlinx.serialization` to throw exceptions immediately when deserialization fails due to schema violations. This ensures that invalid data is not silently processed.
    5.  **Log Kotlinx.serialization Deserialization Errors:**  Log any exceptions thrown by `kotlinx.serialization` during deserialization, capturing details about the invalid input and the specific error reported by the library.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Injection Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting unexpected data types or structures that `kotlinx.serialization` would normally reject based on the defined schema.
    *   **Deserialization of Malicious Payloads (High Severity):**  Reduces the risk of deserializing payloads crafted to exploit vulnerabilities by ensuring `kotlinx.serialization` enforces the expected data format.
    *   **Data Corruption due to Schema Mismatch (Medium Severity):**  Protects against data corruption arising from mismatches between the expected schema and the actual serialized data, as detected by `kotlinx.serialization`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Injection Attacks:** High risk reduction. Directly leveraging `kotlinx.serialization`'s schema enforcement is a strong defense.
    *   **Deserialization of Malicious Payloads:** High risk reduction.  Schema validation by `kotlinx.serialization` is a primary defense against format-based attacks.
    *   **Data Corruption due to Schema Mismatch:** Medium risk reduction.  Catches schema deviations early in the deserialization process.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in API request handling modules where data classes with `kotlinx.serialization` annotations are used for request/response bodies.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Inconsistent use of `kotlinx.serialization` annotations across all data classes used for serialization/deserialization.
    *   Custom serializers/deserializers are used in some places without explicit validation logic within them.
    *   Logging of `kotlinx.serialization` specific deserialization errors is not consistently implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlled Polymorphism with Kotlinx.serialization Annotations](./mitigation_strategies/controlled_polymorphism_with_kotlinx_serialization_annotations.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Explicitly Define Polymorphic Types with `@Polymorphic` and `@SerialName`:** When using polymorphism, *always* use `@Polymorphic` and `@SerialName` annotations provided by `kotlinx.serialization` to explicitly declare the allowed subtypes.
    2.  **Prefer Sealed Classes/Enums for Polymorphism with Kotlinx.serialization:**  Utilize Kotlin sealed classes or enums in conjunction with `@Polymorphic` and `@SerialName` to create a closed and well-defined set of allowed subtypes that `kotlinx.serialization` will recognize.
    3.  **Whitelist Subtypes using `PolymorphicSerializer` (if needed):** If you must use `@Polymorphic` with open classes, explicitly register and whitelist allowed subtypes using `PolymorphicSerializer` within your `kotlinx.serialization` configuration. Avoid default or unconstrained polymorphism.
    4.  **Validate Type Discriminators during Deserialization (if custom):** If you are using custom type discriminators with `@Polymorphic`, ensure that your deserialization logic validates these discriminators against the allowed set *before* `kotlinx.serialization` attempts to deserialize the polymorphic object.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution via Polymorphic Deserialization (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious classes during polymorphic deserialization by restricting the types `kotlinx.serialization` is allowed to instantiate.
    *   **Deserialization Gadget Attacks through Polymorphism (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of exploiting deserialization gadgets by controlling the class hierarchy that `kotlinx.serialization` can navigate during polymorphic deserialization.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Unintended Polymorphic Types (Medium Severity):**  Can prevent accidental information leakage if uncontrolled polymorphism leads to `kotlinx.serialization` instantiating types that expose sensitive data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** High risk reduction.  Controlled polymorphism using `kotlinx.serialization` features is critical for preventing this vulnerability.
    *   **Deserialization Gadget Attacks:** High risk reduction. Significantly limits the attack surface for gadget-based exploits within the context of `kotlinx.serialization`'s polymorphism.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Medium risk reduction. Helps control the types instantiated by `kotlinx.serialization`, reducing unintended data exposure.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented in some API endpoints that utilize polymorphic serialization, using `@Polymorphic` and `@SerialName` annotations. Sealed classes are used in certain polymorphic scenarios.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Inconsistent application of controlled polymorphism using `kotlinx.serialization` annotations across all polymorphic serialization use cases.
    *   Lack of clear, documented guidelines for developers specifically on secure polymorphic serialization with `kotlinx.serialization`.
    *   No automated tests specifically verifying the restrictions enforced by `kotlinx.serialization` on polymorphic deserialization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Kotlinx.serialization Dependency Up-to-Date](./mitigation_strategies/keep_kotlinx_serialization_dependency_up-to-date.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regularly Check for Kotlinx.serialization Updates:** Establish a process to routinely check for new releases of `kotlinx.serialization` on its GitHub repository ([https://github.com/kotlin/kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/kotlin/kotlinx.serialization)) or through dependency management tools.
    2.  **Monitor Kotlinx.serialization Release Notes and Security Advisories:** Pay close attention to release notes and any security advisories published by the `kotlinx.serialization` team.
    3.  **Update Kotlinx.serialization Promptly:** When new versions are released, especially those containing security fixes, prioritize updating your application's dependency on `kotlinx.serialization` to the latest stable version.
    4.  **Automated Dependency Updates (Consider):** Explore using automated dependency update tools that can help streamline the process of updating `kotlinx.serialization` and other dependencies.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Kotlinx.serialization Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from exploiting publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities that may exist in older versions of `kotlinx.serialization`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Kotlinx.serialization Vulnerabilities:** High risk reduction.  Staying updated with `kotlinx.serialization` is essential to benefit from security patches and avoid known vulnerabilities within the library itself.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Automated dependency scanning alerts for outdated dependencies, including `kotlinx.serialization`.
    *   Regular dependency updates are performed, but the update cadence for `kotlinx.serialization` specifically might not be immediate upon each release.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No dedicated process for immediately applying updates specifically for `kotlinx.serialization` when security advisories are released.
    *   Lack of automated testing specifically targeting scenarios fixed in new `kotlinx.serialization` versions after updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Review Focusing on Kotlinx.serialization Usage](./mitigation_strategies/code_review_focusing_on_kotlinx_serialization_usage.md)

*   **Description:**

        *   Validation logic within custom serializers/deserializers.
        *   Error handling specifically for `kotlinx.serialization` deserialization exceptions.
        *   Appropriate choice of serialization format (e.g., JSON, ProtoBuf) and its security implications.
    3.  **Developer Training on Secure Kotlinx.serialization Practices:**  Train developers specifically on secure coding practices related to `kotlinx.serialization`, highlighting common pitfalls and security considerations when using this library.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **All Kotlinx.serialization Related Threats (Varying Severity):** Code review, when focused on `kotlinx.serialization` usage, acts as a targeted safeguard against a range of vulnerabilities arising from improper or insecure use of the library.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **All Kotlinx.serialization Related Threats:** Medium risk reduction. Code review, when specifically focused on `kotlinx.serialization`, is effective in catching errors and oversights in how developers use the library securely.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Code reviews are standard practice. Security is considered, but specific focus on `kotlinx.serialization` is not always emphasized.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No dedicated `kotlinx.serialization` security checklist for code reviews.
    *   Lack of specific training for developers on secure `kotlinx.serialization` usage patterns and potential vulnerabilities.
