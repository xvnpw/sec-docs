# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, kotlinx.serialization, provides a Kotlin library for serializing and deserializing Kotlin objects into various formats. The primary business goal is to empower Kotlin developers with a robust, efficient, and versatile serialization solution. This directly contributes to increased developer productivity and enables the creation of more sophisticated and data-driven Kotlin applications.

Key business priorities include:
- Ease of use and developer experience: The library should be intuitive and simple to integrate into Kotlin projects.
- Performance and efficiency: Serialization and deserialization processes should be fast and resource-efficient.
- Format versatility: Support for a wide range of serialization formats (e.g., JSON, ProtoBuf, CBOR) to cater to diverse application needs.
- Stability and reliability: The library must be dependable and function correctly across different Kotlin environments and platforms.
- Community adoption and support: A thriving community ensures the library's long-term viability and provides a resource for users.

The most important business risks associated with this project are:
- Security vulnerabilities in the library: Exploits could lead to data corruption, information disclosure, or denial of service in applications using the library.
- Performance bottlenecks: Inefficient serialization or deserialization could negatively impact application performance and user experience.
- Compatibility issues: Problems arising from changes in Kotlin, serialization formats, or dependencies could break existing applications.
- Lack of adoption: If the library is not widely adopted, its long-term maintenance and support may be jeopardized.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for the kotlinx.serialization project:
- security control: Open source project with public code repository on GitHub. This allows for community review and scrutiny of the codebase. Implemented: GitHub repository.
- security control: Reliance on Kotlin's type system and memory safety features to reduce certain classes of vulnerabilities. Implemented: Kotlin language design.
- security control: Unit and integration testing to ensure functional correctness and identify potential bugs. Implemented: Project's test suite.
- security control: Dependency management using Gradle, allowing for control over external libraries used. Implemented: build.gradle.kts files.

Accepted risks for the kotlinx.serialization project:
- accepted risk: Vulnerabilities may exist in the code that have not yet been identified through community review or testing.
- accepted risk: Dependencies on external libraries may introduce vulnerabilities that are outside the direct control of the project.
- accepted risk: Malicious contributions could be introduced into the codebase if the contribution review process is insufficient.

Recommended security controls to implement:
- security control: Implement automated static analysis security testing (SAST) tools in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities.
- security control: Integrate dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by the project.
- security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, especially before major releases, to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.
- security control: Implement fuzz testing to discover unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities when processing malformed or unexpected input data during deserialization.
- security control: Establish a clear vulnerability reporting and response process to handle security issues reported by the community or discovered internally.

Security requirements for the kotlinx.serialization project:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable as this is a library and does not handle user authentication. However, secure distribution channels (e.g., HTTPS for Maven Central) are important.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable as this is a library and does not manage user authorization. Applications using the library are responsible for their own authorization logic.
- Input validation: Critical for deserialization processes. The library must robustly handle invalid or malicious input data to prevent vulnerabilities like injection attacks or denial of service. Deserialization logic should validate input data against expected schemas and formats.
- Cryptography: May be relevant depending on the serialization formats supported. If formats like CBOR or custom formats with encryption are supported, proper and secure cryptographic implementations are essential. Ensure usage of well-vetted cryptographic libraries and algorithms.

# DESIGN

The kotlinx.serialization project is designed as a Kotlin library that provides a framework for converting Kotlin objects into various data formats and vice versa. It consists of several modules, each responsible for different aspects of serialization, including core functionalities, format-specific implementations, and plugin integrations.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process being protected:
- Secure and reliable data serialization and deserialization within Kotlin applications. This is crucial for data persistence, data exchange between systems, and data processing workflows in applications using kotlinx.serialization.

Data being protected and sensitivity:
- Application data being serialized and deserialized by the library. The sensitivity of this data varies depending on the application using kotlinx.serialization. It can range from publicly available data to highly sensitive personal or financial information. The library itself should be designed to handle data securely regardless of its sensitivity, as it is a general-purpose serialization tool. Protecting the integrity and confidentiality of this data during serialization and deserialization is paramount.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What are the specific performance benchmarks and requirements for serialization and deserialization?
- What is the intended scope of supported serialization formats in the long term?
- Are there specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that the library needs to adhere to?
- What is the process for handling and disclosing security vulnerabilities in the library?
- Are there specific use cases or industries that are the primary target for kotlinx.serialization?

Assumptions:
- The primary goal is to provide a general-purpose, high-performance, and user-friendly serialization library for Kotlin.
- Security is a significant concern, but not the sole priority. Usability, performance, and feature richness are also important.
- The library is intended to be used in a wide range of Kotlin applications, from small projects to large enterprise systems.
- The development team is committed to maintaining the library and addressing security vulnerabilities in a timely manner.
- The community will play a role in identifying and reporting potential issues, including security vulnerabilities.
