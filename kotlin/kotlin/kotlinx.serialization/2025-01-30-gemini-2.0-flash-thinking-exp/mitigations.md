# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx.serialization

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Resource Limits during Deserialization](./mitigation_strategies/implement_resource_limits_during_deserialization.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Resource Limits during Deserialization
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Potential Resource Exhaustion Points:** Analyze data classes and serialization formats used with `kotlinx.serialization` to identify potential areas where large or deeply nested data structures could lead to resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, stack) *during deserialization*. Focus on:
        *   String fields: Limit maximum string length that `kotlinx.serialization` will process.
        *   Collection fields (Lists, Sets, Maps): Limit maximum collection size that `kotlinx.serialization` will process.
        *   Nested data classes: Limit maximum nesting depth that `kotlinx.serialization` will process.
    2.  **Configure Limits within Deserialization Process:** Implement mechanisms to enforce these limits *specifically during the `kotlinx.serialization` deserialization process*. This can be done:
        *   Programmatically within custom deserializers by checking data sizes and depths as data is being processed by `kotlinx.serialization`.
        *   Leveraging format-specific configuration options *of the `kotlinx.serialization` format decoders* if they provide such features (e.g., some JSON parsing libraries integrated with `kotlinx.serialization` might allow limiting string lengths).
        *   Wrapping `kotlinx.serialization` deserialization operations with timeout mechanisms to limit the overall time spent in deserialization.
    3.  **Error Handling for Limit Exceeded (during `kotlinx.serialization`):** When resource limits are exceeded *during `kotlinx.serialization` deserialization*:
        *   Abort the `kotlinx.serialization` deserialization process.
        *   Log the error with details about the exceeded limit, specifically related to `kotlinx.serialization`.
        *   Return an appropriate error response to the client or caller, indicating a problem with the input data (e.g., "Request too large") *as a result of `kotlinx.serialization` processing*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion (High Severity):** Maliciously crafted or excessively large serialized data can consume excessive CPU, memory, or stack space *during `kotlinx.serialization` deserialization*, leading to application slowdown, crashes, or complete service unavailability. This is directly related to how `kotlinx.serialization` processes input.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of DoS attacks by preventing unbounded resource consumption *specifically during `kotlinx.serialization` deserialization*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. String length limits are enforced for user input fields in API request deserialization using custom validation logic *applied after `kotlinx.serialization` deserialization*. Timeout mechanisms are in place for API requests, indirectly limiting `kotlinx.serialization` deserialization time.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing limits for:
    *   Collection sizes in deserialized objects *processed by `kotlinx.serialization`*, especially for data from external sources or database reads.
    *   Nesting depth limits for complex data structures *handled by `kotlinx.serialization`*.
    *   Specific configuration of `kotlinx.serialization` format decoders to enforce limits at the parsing level (if available and applicable), directly within `kotlinx.serialization`'s processing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Explicit Serializers for Sensitive Data](./mitigation_strategies/use_explicit_serializers_for_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Use Explicit Serializers for Sensitive Data
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data Classes (used with `kotlinx.serialization`):** Determine data classes that contain sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys, personal data, financial information) or are critical for application security and logic *and are serialized/deserialized using `kotlinx.serialization`*.
    2.  **Implement Explicit Serializers (in `kotlinx.serialization`):** For these sensitive data classes, avoid relying on automatic serializer derivation *provided by `kotlinx.serialization`*. Instead, create explicit serializers using:
        *   `@Serializable(with = CustomSerializer::class)` annotation, pointing to a custom serializer class *that you define for `kotlinx.serialization`*.
        *   Implementing custom `KSerializer` interfaces directly *for use with `kotlinx.serialization`*.
    3.  **Control Serialization Logic (within `kotlinx.serialization` serializers):** Within the explicit serializers *defined for `kotlinx.serialization`*, carefully control the serialization and deserialization process:
        *   **Omit Sensitive Fields (in `kotlinx.serialization` output):**  Exclude sensitive fields from serialization if they are not needed in the serialized representation *generated by `kotlinx.serialization`*.
        *   **Transform Data (during `kotlinx.serialization` serialization/deserialization):**  Apply transformations (e.g., encryption, hashing) to sensitive data during serialization and deserialization *within the `kotlinx.serialization` serializer*.
        *   **Validate Data Integrity (within `kotlinx.serialization` deserializers):**  Implement additional validation checks within the deserializer *of `kotlinx.serialization`* to ensure data integrity and prevent manipulation.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium to High Severity):** Automatic serializer derivation *in `kotlinx.serialization`* might unintentionally serialize sensitive data that should not be exposed in certain contexts. Explicit serializers allow for fine-grained control over what data is serialized *by `kotlinx.serialization`*.
    *   **Data Manipulation (Medium Severity):** Custom deserializers *in `kotlinx.serialization`* can implement additional validation and integrity checks, making it harder for attackers to manipulate serialized data and inject malicious values *during `kotlinx.serialization` deserialization*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium to High Impact):** Reduces the risk of unintentional exposure of sensitive data by providing explicit control over serialization *performed by `kotlinx.serialization`*.
    *   **Data Manipulation (Medium Impact):**  Reduces the risk of data manipulation by adding custom validation and integrity checks during deserialization *within `kotlinx.serialization`'s deserialization process*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Explicit serializers *for `kotlinx.serialization`* are used for data classes representing user credentials and API keys to ensure proper handling and potential encryption during serialization for storage *using `kotlinx.serialization`*.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing explicit serializers *for `kotlinx.serialization`* for:
    *   Data classes used in internal service communication that might contain sensitive business logic or configuration *and are serialized with `kotlinx.serialization`*.
    *   Configuration data classes that could expose sensitive settings if serialized and logged or transmitted insecurely *using `kotlinx.serialization`*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Whitelist Allowed Subtypes for Polymorphic Serialization](./mitigation_strategies/whitelist_allowed_subtypes_for_polymorphic_serialization.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Whitelist Allowed Subtypes for Polymorphic Serialization
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Polymorphic Serialization Use Cases (in `kotlinx.serialization`):** Locate all instances where `@Polymorphic` or `Sealed` classes are used with `kotlinx.serialization`.
    2.  **Define Allowed Subtypes (for `kotlinx.serialization`):** For each polymorphic hierarchy *serialized/deserialized by `kotlinx.serialization`*, explicitly define a whitelist of allowed concrete subtypes that are expected and safe to deserialize *by `kotlinx.serialization`*.
    3.  **Configure Subtype Registration (in `kotlinx.serialization`):** Use the `PolymorphicModuleBuilder` or similar mechanisms provided by `kotlinx.serialization` to register only the whitelisted subtypes *for `kotlinx.serialization`*. Avoid using open or overly permissive subtype registration strategies *in `kotlinx.serialization` configuration*.
    4.  **Handle Unknown Subtypes (during `kotlinx.serialization` deserialization):** Implement error handling for cases where deserialization *by `kotlinx.serialization`* encounters a type that is not in the whitelist. Reject deserialization *by `kotlinx.serialization`* and log an error.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Deserialization Gadgets / Remote Code Execution (High Severity):** If polymorphic serialization *in `kotlinx.serialization`* is not restricted, attackers might be able to craft serialized data that instantiates unexpected and potentially malicious classes present in the application's classpath (deserialization gadgets) *through `kotlinx.serialization`*. This could lead to remote code execution *via `kotlinx.serialization`*.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior / Logic Bypass (Medium Severity):** Deserializing unexpected types *via `kotlinx.serialization`* could lead to unexpected application behavior, logic bypasses, or vulnerabilities if the application logic is not prepared to handle these types *deserialized by `kotlinx.serialization`*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Deserialization Gadgets / Remote Code Execution (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of deserialization gadget attacks by preventing instantiation of arbitrary classes *through `kotlinx.serialization`'s polymorphic deserialization*.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior / Logic Bypass (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of unexpected behavior by ensuring only expected types are deserialized *by `kotlinx.serialization`*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Whitelisting is used for polymorphic serialization of event types in the event processing module, limiting deserialization *by `kotlinx.serialization`* to known event classes.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing whitelisting for:
    *   Polymorphic serialization used in configuration loading or plugin mechanisms *with `kotlinx.serialization`*, where the set of expected types might be less strictly controlled.
    *   Reviewing all existing `@Polymorphic` and `Sealed` class usages *with `kotlinx.serialization`* to ensure whitelisting is consistently applied.
