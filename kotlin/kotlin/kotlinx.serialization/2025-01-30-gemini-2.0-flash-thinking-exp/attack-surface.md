# Attack Surface Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx.serialization

## Attack Surface: [1. Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./attack_surfaces/1__deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

*   **Description:** Processing serialized data from sources that are not fully trusted, creating a pathway for malicious payloads.
*   **How kotlinx.serialization contributes:** `kotlinx.serialization` is the mechanism used to convert untrusted serialized data into Kotlin objects within the application. This conversion process is the direct point of interaction with potentially malicious input.
*   **Example:** An application receives JSON data from an external, potentially compromised API and uses `kotlinx.serialization` to deserialize it into application objects. A crafted JSON payload could inject malicious data, leading to data corruption or unintended application behavior.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, application malfunction, potential for further exploitation (e.g., injection attacks, business logic bypass). In severe scenarios, could lead to remote code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities (though less likely directly from `kotlinx.serialization` in typical Kotlin/JVM setups compared to Java serialization).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Post-Deserialization):**  Mandatory validation and sanitization of all deserialized data *after* it's converted to Kotlin objects, before any application logic processes it.
    *   **Restrict Deserialized Types (Polymorphism Control):**  For polymorphic deserialization, strictly define and whitelist the allowed classes. Use sealed classes, enums, or explicit registration in `SerializersModule` to limit potential types.
    *   **Implement Deserialization Limits:**  Enforce limits on the size and complexity of incoming serialized data (payload size, nesting depth) to prevent resource exhaustion and denial-of-service attacks.

## Attack Surface: [2. Polymorphic Deserialization Exploits](./attack_surfaces/2__polymorphic_deserialization_exploits.md)

*   **Description:** Abusing the polymorphic deserialization feature to force deserialization into unexpected or malicious classes, bypassing intended type safety.
*   **How kotlinx.serialization contributes:** `kotlinx.serialization`'s polymorphic deserialization, while powerful, relies on type information within the serialized data. If not carefully controlled, attackers can manipulate this type information to their advantage.
*   **Example:** An application uses polymorphic serialization for message handling. An attacker crafts a payload that declares itself as a benign message type but is designed to deserialize into a different, potentially vulnerable class present in the application's classpath.
*   **Impact:** Type confusion, unexpected application behavior, potential for instantiation of classes with vulnerabilities, denial of service, or in extreme cases, potential for code execution (though less direct in Kotlin/JVM).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Polymorphic Type Whitelisting:**  Implement a robust whitelist of allowed subtypes for polymorphic deserialization using `SerializersModule` and explicit registration. Favor sealed classes or enums to define a closed and controlled set of types.
    *   **Careful Design of Polymorphic Hierarchies:** Design polymorphic class hierarchies with security in mind. Avoid situations where unexpected types could lead to significant security implications.
    *   **Code Reviews of Polymorphic Deserialization Logic:** Thoroughly review code handling polymorphic deserialization to ensure robust type handling and prevent exploitation through unexpected type injection.

## Attack Surface: [3. Library Vulnerabilities in `kotlinx.serialization` or Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/3__library_vulnerabilities_in__kotlinx_serialization__or_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws present within the `kotlinx.serialization` library code itself or in its dependent libraries.
*   **How kotlinx.serialization contributes:** As a software library, `kotlinx.serialization` is a potential target for vulnerabilities. Exploits targeting these vulnerabilities would directly impact applications using the library.
*   **Example:** A hypothetical buffer overflow vulnerability in `kotlinx.serialization`'s JSON parsing could be discovered. Attackers could craft specific JSON payloads that trigger this overflow during deserialization, potentially leading to code execution.
*   **Impact:** Varies greatly depending on the vulnerability. Could range from denial of service and data corruption to information disclosure and remote code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (for vulnerabilities that allow code execution or significant data breaches)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Maintain Up-to-Date `kotlinx.serialization`:**  Always use the latest stable version of `kotlinx.serialization` to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    *   **Regular Dependency Scanning:**  Implement automated dependency scanning to detect known vulnerabilities in `kotlinx.serialization`'s dependencies. Update dependencies promptly when patches are available.
    *   **Security Monitoring and Advisories:**  Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reports related to `kotlinx.serialization` and its dependencies. Subscribe to relevant security mailing lists or feeds.
