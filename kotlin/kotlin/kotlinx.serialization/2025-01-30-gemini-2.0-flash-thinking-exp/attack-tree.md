*   **Attack Vector:** Directly deserializing user-provided or untrusted data without any validation.
*   **How it Exploits kotlinx.serialization:**  This is a classic deserialization vulnerability. If untrusted input is directly deserialized, attackers can inject malicious payloads that are then processed by the application, leading to various attacks.
*   **Potential Impact:** RCE, Data Manipulation, DoS, Information Disclosure.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Never Deserialize Untrusted Input Directly without Validation:**  Always treat deserialized data as potentially malicious and validate it thoroughly *after* deserialization.
    *   **Input Sanitization (if applicable):**  Sanitize input before deserialization if possible, but validation after deserialization is still crucial.
