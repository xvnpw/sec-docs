# Threat Model Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx.serialization

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Polymorphic Deserialization](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via_polymorphic_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious serialized data containing instructions to instantiate and execute arbitrary classes present in the application's classpath. This is achieved by exploiting polymorphic deserialization when handling untrusted data. The attacker gains full control over the application's execution flow.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Full compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system. Attackers can execute arbitrary commands, steal data, install malware, or cause complete system failure.
*   **Affected kotlinx.serialization component:** `PolymorphicSerializer`, `Json.decodeFromString`, `ProtoBuf.decodeFromByteArray`, `Cbor.decodeFromByteArray`, any deserialization function used with polymorphic types.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid deserializing polymorphic data from untrusted sources if possible.
    *   Whitelist explicitly registered subclasses using `PolymorphicSerializer` and avoid automatic class discovery.
    *   Implement strict input validation on serialized data before deserialization.
    *   Run the application with the principle of least privilege.

## Threat: [Deserialization of Unexpected Types](./threats/deserialization_of_unexpected_types.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates type information within the serialized data (if the format allows or if type information is externally provided) to force deserialization into unexpected types. This can lead to type confusion, memory corruption, or unexpected application behavior, potentially exploitable for further attacks.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Potential for application crash, data corruption, or exploitation leading to information disclosure or further code execution vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected kotlinx.serialization component:** Deserialization functions in general (`Json.decodeFromString`, `ProtoBuf.decodeFromByteArray`, `Cbor.decodeFromByteArray`), especially when used with formats that allow type hinting or external type information.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strict type checking during deserialization.
    *   Define and validate a strict schema for serialized data.
    *   Avoid relying on user-provided type information from untrusted sources.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion during Deserialization](./threats/resource_exhaustion_during_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends maliciously crafted serialized data designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) during deserialization. This can be achieved through deeply nested structures, extremely large strings, or other resource-intensive data patterns, leading to a Denial of Service.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Application unavailability, service disruption, and potential infrastructure overload.
*   **Affected kotlinx.serialization component:** Deserialization functions in general (`Json.decodeFromString`, `ProtoBuf.decodeFromByteArray`, `Cbor.decodeFromByteArray`).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement input size limits on incoming serialized data.
    *   Set timeouts for deserialization operations.
    *   Monitor application resource usage during deserialization.
    *   Implement rate limiting on endpoints accepting serialized data.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of Serialization Format or Features](./threats/misconfiguration_of_serialization_format_or_features.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect configuration of `kotlinx.serialization` features, such as insecure defaults, disabled security features, or improper polymorphic serialization setup, introduces vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** **Medium to High**.  Increased attack surface, potential for exploitation of deserialization vulnerabilities, information disclosure, or denial of service depending on the specific misconfiguration.
*   **Affected kotlinx.serialization component:** Configuration of `Json`, `ProtoBuf`, `Cbor` serializers, `PolymorphicSerializer` configuration, and other serialization feature configurations.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow security best practices and recommendations in `kotlinx.serialization` documentation.
    *   Conduct security reviews of serialization code and configuration.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege in configuration, enabling only necessary features.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in kotlinx.serialization Library or Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_kotlinx_serialization_library_or_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities are discovered in the `kotlinx.serialization` library itself or its dependencies. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to various impacts, including code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
*   **Impact:** **Variable (Low to Critical)**. Impact depends on the specific vulnerability. Could range from minor information disclosure to critical remote code execution.
*   **Affected kotlinx.serialization component:** Core `kotlinx.serialization` library, runtime libraries, and dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Variable (Low to Critical)**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use robust dependency management.
    *   Regularly update `kotlinx.serialization` and its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
    *   Use dependency vulnerability scanning tools.
    *   Stay informed about security advisories and release notes for `kotlinx.serialization`.
