# Attack Surface Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx.serialization

## Attack Surface: [High and Critical Attack Surfaces Directly Involving kotlinx.serialization](./attack_surfaces/high_and_critical_attack_surfaces_directly_involving_kotlinx_serialization.md)

*   **Deserialization of Untrusted Data Leading to Arbitrary Code Execution**
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized payload. When the application deserializes this payload using `kotlinx.serialization`, it instantiates objects that execute arbitrary code on the server or client.
    *   **How kotlinx.serialization Contributes:** `kotlinx.serialization` provides the mechanism to convert arbitrary byte streams back into Kotlin objects. If the application deserializes data from untrusted sources without proper validation *using `kotlinx.serialization`*, it becomes vulnerable to this attack.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a JSON payload that, when deserialized by `kotlinx.serialization`, creates an object that triggers a system command execution.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources directly using `kotlinx.serialization`.**
        *   **Implement strict input validation and sanitization *before* deserialization with `kotlinx.serialization`.**
        *   **Use digital signatures or message authentication codes (MACs) to verify the integrity and authenticity of serialized data *before deserialization with `kotlinx.serialization`*.**

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data Leading to Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data_leading_to_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a serialized payload that, upon deserialization using `kotlinx.serialization`, consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory), causing the application to become unresponsive or crash.
    *   **How kotlinx.serialization Contributes:** `kotlinx.serialization` will attempt to deserialize any validly formatted data it receives. Maliciously crafted payloads with deeply nested objects or very large strings can exploit this *during the `kotlinx.serialization` deserialization process*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a JSON payload with thousands of nested objects, overwhelming the `kotlinx.serialization` deserialization process.
    *   **Impact:** Application downtime, resource exhaustion, and potential service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement resource limits during deserialization *within the `kotlinx.serialization` configuration or by wrapping the deserialization process* (e.g., maximum nesting depth, maximum string length).**
        *   **Set timeouts for the `kotlinx.serialization` deserialization process.**

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data Leading to Information Disclosure](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data_leading_to_information_disclosure.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious payload, when deserialized using `kotlinx.serialization`, can expose sensitive information that should not be accessible. This could involve accessing internal state or properties not intended for external exposure.
    *   **How kotlinx.serialization Contributes:** If the application deserializes data into objects using `kotlinx.serialization` that contain sensitive information and doesn't properly control which fields are serialized/deserialized *by `kotlinx.serialization`*, an attacker might be able to extract this data.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a request that, when deserialized by `kotlinx.serialization`, populates an object containing database credentials, which are then inadvertently logged or returned in an error message.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of confidential data, potentially leading to further attacks or compliance violations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use appropriate serialization strategies within `kotlinx.serialization` (e.g., `@Transient` annotation) to exclude sensitive fields from serialization.**
        *   **Be mindful of default serialization behavior in `kotlinx.serialization` and explicitly define which properties should be serialized.**
        *   **Avoid deserializing untrusted data directly into objects that hold sensitive information using `kotlinx.serialization`.**

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data Leading to Object Injection/Modification](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data_leading_to_object_injectionmodification.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate the state of existing objects or inject new, malicious objects into the application's object graph during deserialization using `kotlinx.serialization`.
    *   **How kotlinx.serialization Contributes:** `kotlinx.serialization` allows the creation and population of objects based on the deserialized data. If the application doesn't validate the integrity and intended state of these objects *after `kotlinx.serialization` deserialization*, it can be vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a serialized payload that, when deserialized by `kotlinx.serialization`, modifies the state of a user's account object, granting them administrative privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized access, and potential privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Design your application to be resilient to unexpected object states *after `kotlinx.serialization` deserialization*.**
        *   **Implement proper access controls and validation on deserialized objects *obtained through `kotlinx.serialization`* before they are used.**
        *   **Consider using immutable objects where appropriate to prevent modification after `kotlinx.serialization` deserialization.**

## Attack Surface: [Polymorphism Issues During Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/polymorphism_issues_during_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** When using polymorphic serialization with `kotlinx.serialization`, an attacker might be able to substitute a malicious subclass for an expected superclass during deserialization, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How kotlinx.serialization Contributes:** `kotlinx.serialization` supports polymorphism, which requires careful configuration to ensure type safety during deserialization. Misconfigurations *within `kotlinx.serialization`* can allow the instantiation of unexpected types.
    *   **Example:** An application expects to deserialize a `Payment` object using `kotlinx.serialization`, but an attacker crafts a payload that deserializes a malicious `MaliciousPayment` subclass that performs unauthorized actions.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution, data manipulation, or other unexpected behavior depending on the malicious subclass.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use sealed classes or interfaces with explicit serializers for polymorphic types within `kotlinx.serialization` configuration.**
        *   **Carefully manage the registration of polymorphic serializers in `kotlinx.serialization` and ensure that only trusted types can be deserialized.**
        *   **Avoid using open or abstract classes directly for polymorphic deserialization from untrusted sources with `kotlinx.serialization` without strict type control.**
