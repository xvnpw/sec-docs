# Threat Model Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx.serialization

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution via Polymorphic Deserialization](./threats/remote_code_execution_via_polymorphic_deserialization.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a serialized payload containing a malicious object. When the application deserializes this payload using `kotlinx.serialization`'s polymorphic features, the malicious object is instantiated, and its constructor or other methods execute arbitrary code on the server. The attacker manipulates the type information within the serialized data to force the instantiation of a vulnerable class, leveraging `kotlinx.serialization`'s ability to handle different types.

**Impact:** Full system compromise, data breach, service disruption, malware installation.

**Affected Component:** `kotlinx-serialization-json` (or other format modules like `kotlinx-serialization-cbor`, `kotlinx-serialization-protobuf`) and the deserialization functions that handle polymorphism (e.g., when using sealed classes or interfaces with `@Polymorphic`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Polymorphic Data:** If possible, avoid deserializing polymorphic data from untrusted sources using `kotlinx.serialization`.
* **Restrict Deserializable Types:**  Use `SerializersModule` within `kotlinx.serialization` to explicitly register the allowed concrete subtypes for polymorphic deserialization. This creates a whitelist of acceptable types that `kotlinx.serialization` will instantiate.
* **Input Validation:**  While not foolproof against RCE, validate the structure and basic content of the serialized data before attempting deserialization with `kotlinx.serialization`.
* **Sandboxing:**  Deserialize untrusted data using `kotlinx.serialization` in a sandboxed environment with limited permissions.

## Threat: [Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in `kotlinx.serialization`](./threats/exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in__kotlinx_serialization_.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities might be discovered in the `kotlinx.serialization` library itself. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by crafting specific serialized data that triggers the flaw during deserialization by `kotlinx.serialization`, or by leveraging specific library features in unintended ways. This could lead to various impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability within the library's code.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), data corruption, information disclosure, depending on the vulnerability within `kotlinx.serialization`.

**Affected Component:** The specific module or function within `kotlinx.serialization` affected by the vulnerability. This could be in `kotlinx-serialization-core` or any of the format-specific modules.

**Risk Severity:** Can be Critical to High depending on the vulnerability.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep Library Up-to-Date:** Regularly update `kotlinx.serialization` to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches released by the `kotlinx.serialization` team.
* **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories and vulnerability reports specifically related to `kotlinx.serialization`.
* **Dependency Scanning:**  Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in `kotlinx.serialization` and its dependencies.

## Threat: [Code Injection through Malicious Custom Serializer](./threats/code_injection_through_malicious_custom_serializer.md)

**Description:** A developer creates a custom serializer for use with `kotlinx.serialization` with a vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code during the serialization or deserialization process. This could involve unsafe operations within the custom serializer's `serialize` or `deserialize` methods that are invoked by `kotlinx.serialization`.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data manipulation, privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** The specific custom serializer implementation within the application's codebase that interacts with `kotlinx.serialization`'s serialization engine.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability in the custom serializer).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Thoroughly Review Custom Serializers:**  Carefully review the code of all custom serializers used with `kotlinx.serialization` for potential security flaws.
* **Secure Coding Practices:**  Follow secure coding practices when developing custom serializers for `kotlinx.serialization`. Avoid using reflection or other potentially dangerous operations without careful consideration.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure custom serializers used with `kotlinx.serialization` only have access to the necessary resources and perform the intended operations.

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration of `SerializersModule`](./threats/insecure_configuration_of__serializersmodule_.md)

**Description:** An improperly configured `SerializersModule` within `kotlinx.serialization`, especially when used for polymorphic serialization, might allow the deserialization of unexpected or dangerous types. If the `SerializersModule` is not carefully managed, an attacker might be able to provide serialized data that `kotlinx.serialization` uses to instantiate malicious classes, even if the application intends to restrict the allowed types.

**Impact:** Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) or other vulnerabilities if unexpected types can be instantiated by `kotlinx.serialization` and their methods executed.

**Affected Component:** `kotlinx-serialization-core` and the `SerializersModule` configuration within the application that dictates how `kotlinx.serialization` handles type resolution.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Explicitly Register Allowed Serializers:** When using `SerializersModule` for polymorphism in `kotlinx.serialization`, explicitly register only the expected and safe concrete subtypes. Avoid using overly broad or wildcard registrations.
* **Review `SerializersModule` Configuration:** Regularly review the configuration of the `SerializersModule` to ensure it aligns with the application's security requirements when using `kotlinx.serialization`.
* **Avoid Dynamic Registration of Serializers from Untrusted Sources:** Do not dynamically register serializers within `SerializersModule` based on data received from untrusted sources when using `kotlinx.serialization`.
