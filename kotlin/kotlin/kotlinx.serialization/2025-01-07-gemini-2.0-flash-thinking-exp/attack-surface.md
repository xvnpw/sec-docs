# Attack Surface Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx.serialization

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Payload Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/malicious_payload_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized payload that, when deserialized by the application using `kotlinx.serialization`, leads to negative consequences such as denial-of-service (DoS) or, in more complex scenarios, potentially remote code execution (RCE).
    *   **How kotlinx.serialization Contributes:** `kotlinx.serialization` is the mechanism through which the malicious serialized data is processed and converted back into Kotlin objects, enabling the exploitation of parsing logic or resource consumption vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** Sending a JSON payload with extremely deep nesting levels, causing a stack overflow during deserialization performed by `kotlinx.serialization`.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, resource exhaustion, potential for more severe exploits depending on application logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation *before* passing data to `kotlinx.serialization` for deserialization.
        *   Set limits on the depth and size of objects that `kotlinx.serialization` is allowed to deserialize to prevent resource exhaustion.
        *   Consider using safer serialization formats if the threat model warrants it.
        *   Implement proper error handling and logging around deserialization processes using `kotlinx.serialization`.

## Attack Surface: [Uncontrolled Polymorphic Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/uncontrolled_polymorphic_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** When using polymorphism with `kotlinx.serialization`, the application might deserialize an object of an unexpected type, potentially leading to the instantiation of malicious or unintended classes if the set of possible types is not strictly controlled.
    *   **How kotlinx.serialization Contributes:** `kotlinx.serialization` provides the functionality for handling polymorphism during deserialization. If the application doesn't explicitly register or restrict the possible polymorphic types within the `SerializersModule`, an attacker could provide a serialized representation of a harmful class that `kotlinx.serialization` will instantiate.
    *   **Example:** An application using `kotlinx.serialization` expects to deserialize either `Dog` or `Cat` objects, but an attacker provides serialized data for a `MaliciousAction` class. Due to lack of type control in the `SerializersModule`, `kotlinx.serialization` instantiates this malicious class.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for remote code execution, privilege escalation, or other malicious activities depending on the capabilities of the unexpectedly instantiated class.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Explicitly register all allowed polymorphic types using `SerializersModule` and the `polymorphic` builder when configuring `kotlinx.serialization`.
        *   Prefer using sealed classes to represent a closed set of possible subtypes, providing compile-time safety that `kotlinx.serialization` can leverage.
        *   Avoid deserializing arbitrary user-provided type information without strict validation and whitelisting within the `kotlinx.serialization` configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Serializers/Deserializers](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_serializersdeserializers.md)

*   **Description:** If developers implement custom serializers or deserializers for specific data types used with `kotlinx.serialization`, vulnerabilities in this custom code can introduce new attack vectors.
    *   **How kotlinx.serialization Contributes:** `kotlinx.serialization` provides the extensibility mechanism through `KSerializer` implementations, allowing developers to define custom serialization logic. If this custom logic is flawed, it becomes a point of exploitation during the serialization or deserialization process managed by `kotlinx.serialization`.
    *   **Example:** A custom deserializer for a URL field, used within a class handled by `kotlinx.serialization`, might not properly validate the input, allowing for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if the deserialized URL is later used to make a request.
    *   **Impact:** Depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom code, ranging from information disclosure to remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test all custom serializers and deserializers used with `kotlinx.serialization` for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when implementing custom serialization logic, including proper input validation and sanitization within the custom `KSerializer`.
        *   Consider using existing, well-vetted serializers provided by `kotlinx.serialization` or other trusted libraries whenever possible.
