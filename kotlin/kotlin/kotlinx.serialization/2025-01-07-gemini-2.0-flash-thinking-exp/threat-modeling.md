# Threat Model Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx.serialization

## Threat: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data Leading to Arbitrary Code Execution](./threats/deserialization_of_untrusted_data_leading_to_arbitrary_code_execution.md)

**Description:**

*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized payload. This payload, when deserialized by the application using `kotlinx.serialization`, instantiates objects that, through their constructors, methods, or finalizers, execute arbitrary code on the server or client. This could involve leveraging existing classes (gadget chains) or exploiting vulnerabilities in custom deserialization logic.
*   **How:** The attacker exploits the fact that `kotlinx.serialization`'s deserialization can instantiate arbitrary classes and set their fields. If a class has side effects during instantiation or within its lifecycle methods, this can be abused.

**Impact:**

*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system. The attacker can gain full control, install malware, steal data, or disrupt services.

**Affected Component:**

*   **Component:** `kotlinx.serialization.json.Json.decodeFromString` (or similar decoding functions for other formats like CBOR, ProtoBuf) when used with untrusted input. Potentially also custom `KSerializer` implementations if they have vulnerabilities.

**Risk Severity:**

*   **Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources directly.
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization *before* deserialization.
*   Consider using a more restricted or curated set of allowed classes for deserialization (if the library allows for such configuration).
*   Minimize the use of custom serializers, and thoroughly audit any custom serializers for potential vulnerabilities.
*   Run the application with the least privileges necessary.
*   Utilize security monitoring and logging to detect suspicious deserialization attempts.

## Threat: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data Leading to Object Injection/Gadget Chains](./threats/deserialization_of_untrusted_data_leading_to_object_injectiongadget_chains.md)

**Description:**

*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized payload that, upon deserialization by `kotlinx.serialization`, creates a chain of object method calls (a "gadget chain"). These calls, when combined, can lead to unintended and harmful actions within the application's existing codebase, even without direct arbitrary code execution.
*   **How:** The attacker leverages the application's existing classes and their interactions to achieve a malicious goal through the instantiation and population of objects via `kotlinx.serialization`. This might involve manipulating object states or triggering specific sequences of operations.

**Impact:**

*   **Impact:** Can lead to various security breaches, including data manipulation, unauthorized access, or denial of service, depending on the available gadget chains within the application.

**Affected Component:**

*   **Component:** `kotlinx.serialization.json.Json.decodeFromString` (or similar decoding functions) when used with untrusted input. The vulnerability lies in the interaction between deserialized objects (created by `kotlinx.serialization`) and the application's logic.

**Risk Severity:**

*   **Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources directly.
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization *before* deserialization.
*   Regularly audit the application's codebase for potential gadget chains.
*   Consider using a serialization format that offers better security guarantees or mechanisms to prevent gadget chain exploitation.
*   Implement security checks and validations throughout the application's logic to prevent exploitation even if object injection occurs.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Serialization](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_through_serialization.md)

**Description:**

*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker gains access to serialized data produced by `kotlinx.serialization` that inadvertently contains sensitive information. This could happen through network interception, access to storage, or by exploiting other vulnerabilities that expose serialized data.
*   **How:** Developers might serialize objects using `kotlinx.serialization` containing sensitive data without proper masking or encryption. The serialized form then becomes a target for information disclosure.

**Impact:**

*   **Impact:** Leakage of confidential data, such as user credentials, API keys, personal information, or business secrets.

**Affected Component:**

*   **Component:** `kotlinx.serialization.json.Json.encodeToString` (or similar encoding functions) and potentially custom `KSerializer` implementations used for serializing sensitive data.

**Risk Severity:**

*   **Severity:** High (if highly sensitive data is exposed).

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid serializing sensitive information directly using `kotlinx.serialization`.
*   Use the `@Transient` annotation or custom serializers to exclude sensitive fields from serialization.
*   Encrypt sensitive data before serialization using `kotlinx.serialization`.
*   Ensure secure storage and transmission of serialized data.
*   Regularly review the data being serialized to identify and address potential information leaks.

## Threat: [Misuse of Library Features Leading to Vulnerabilities](./threats/misuse_of_library_features_leading_to_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**

*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities introduced by developers misusing features of `kotlinx.serialization`. This could involve using unsafe deserialization options or neglecting proper configuration within the `kotlinx.serialization` setup.
*   **How:** Developers might, for example, enable features in `kotlinx.serialization` that allow for more lenient deserialization without proper input validation, creating opportunities for exploitation.

**Impact:**

*   **Impact:** Can lead to various security issues, including those described in other threats (e.g., arbitrary code execution, resource exhaustion).

**Affected Component:**

*   **Component:** Various configuration options and functions within the `kotlinx.serialization` library itself, depending on the specific misuse (e.g., lenient parsing settings, handling of unknown properties).

**Risk Severity:**

*   **Severity:** High (can escalate to Critical depending on the specific misuse).

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Provide adequate training and documentation to developers on the secure usage of `kotlinx.serialization`.
*   Conduct code reviews to identify potential misuse of library features and insecure configurations.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring the library, enabling only necessary features with secure settings.
*   Use static analysis tools to detect potential security issues related to `kotlinx.serialization` configuration and usage.
