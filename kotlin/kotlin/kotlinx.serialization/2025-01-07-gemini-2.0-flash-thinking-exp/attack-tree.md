# Attack Tree Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx.serialization

Objective: To compromise application that use given project by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the project itself.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
* Compromise Application using kotlinx.serialization
    + [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities]
        - Malicious Payload Injection **(High-Risk Path)**
            * [Inject Code Execution Payload]
                | - [Leverage Polymorphism/Class Registration Issues]
        - Vulnerabilities in Custom Serializers **(High-Risk Path)**
            * [Exploit Logic Errors in Custom `KSerializer` Implementations]
    + Exploit Configuration Issues
        - Insecure Default Configurations **(High-Risk Path)**
            * Allow Deserialization of Arbitrary Classes (if applicable/configurable)
        - Misconfiguration of Polymorphism Handling **(High-Risk Path)**
            * Allow Deserialization of Unintended Subclasses
    + Exploit Dependencies of kotlinx.serialization **(High-Risk Path)**
        - Vulnerabilities in Underlying Serialization Formats (e.g., JSON, CBOR)
```
