# Threat Model Analysis for kotlin/anko

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Anko SQLite DSL](./threats/sql_injection_via_anko_sqlite_dsl.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in dynamically constructed SQL queries within Anko's SQLite DSL if user input is not properly sanitized. By injecting malicious SQL code, the attacker could bypass application logic, access unauthorized data, modify or delete data, or potentially gain control over the database.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, data loss, potential application compromise.
*   **Affected Anko Component:** `anko-sqlite` module, `db.use {}`, `transaction {}`, `select()`, `insert()`, `update()`, `delete()` and related SQLite DSL functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements** within Anko's SQLite DSL to prevent SQL injection.
    *   Avoid constructing SQL queries by directly concatenating user input strings.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization before using user input in SQL queries.
    *   Regularly review and test database interactions for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Data Storage in SQLite Database](./threats/insecure_data_storage_in_sqlite_database.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker who gains physical access to the device or exploits vulnerabilities to access the application's data directory could access sensitive data stored unencrypted in the SQLite database created and managed using Anko's SQLite DSL.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, privacy violation, potential identity theft, financial loss.
*   **Affected Anko Component:** `anko-sqlite` module, database creation and management features.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Encrypt sensitive data** before storing it in the SQLite database using Android's encryption facilities (e.g., `EncryptedSharedPreferences`, `Jetpack Security Crypto`) or dedicated encryption libraries.
    *   Implement proper file system permissions to restrict access to the database file.
    *   Consider using secure storage mechanisms beyond SQLite for highly sensitive data if appropriate.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Anko Library or Dependencies](./threats/vulnerable_anko_library_or_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities present in the specific version of the Anko library or its transitive dependencies used by the application. Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities can be leveraged to compromise the application if it uses a vulnerable version.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, data breach, denial of service, unpredictable application behavior.
*   **Affected Anko Component:** Entire Anko library and its dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly update Anko library to the latest stable version.**
    *   Utilize dependency management tools (like Gradle dependency management) to track and update Anko and its dependencies.
    *   **Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities** using security scanning tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk).
    *   Monitor security advisories related to Anko and its dependencies and promptly apply updates.

## Threat: [Outdated Anko Library Version](./threats/outdated_anko_library_version.md)

*   **Description:** Using an outdated version of Anko that contains known, patched security vulnerabilities leaves the application vulnerable to exploitation. Attackers can target applications using older versions of libraries with publicly known vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, data breach, denial of service, exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected Anko Component:** Entire Anko library.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly update Anko library to the latest stable version** as part of the application maintenance process.
    *   Implement automated dependency update checks and processes.
    *   Monitor Anko's release notes and changelogs for security-related updates and prioritize applying them.
    *   Establish a process for promptly updating dependencies when security vulnerabilities are disclosed.
