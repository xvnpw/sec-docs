# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Simplify Android application development using Kotlin Domain Specific Languages (DSLs).
  - Increase developer productivity by providing concise and expressive ways to define UI layouts, common Android functionalities, and asynchronous operations.
  - Promote the adoption of Kotlin in Android development by offering a comprehensive and user-friendly library.
  - Enhance code readability and maintainability in Android projects.

- Most Important Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the Anko library could be inherited by applications using it, potentially leading to application-level security breaches.
  - Poor code quality or lack of maintenance could lead to instability and reliability issues in applications using Anko.
  - Supply chain risks if dependencies used by Anko have vulnerabilities or if the Anko build and release process is compromised.
  - Negative developer perception if security concerns are not adequately addressed, hindering adoption and community growth.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: GitHub repository with standard security features like branch protection and issue tracking. (Implemented in: GitHub repository settings)
  - security control: Open-source development model allowing for community review and contributions. (Implemented in: GitHub public repository)
  - security control: Usage of Kotlin language, which has its own security features and coding conventions. (Implemented in: Kotlin language design)
  - security control: Reliance on Android platform security model for applications built using Anko. (Implemented in: Android OS and SDK)

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities might be discovered in the library code after release, requiring patches and updates.
  - accepted risk: Third-party dependencies used by Anko might introduce security vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Open-source nature means potential exposure of vulnerabilities to a wider audience, including malicious actors, once disclosed.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential code vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Implement Dependency Vulnerability Scanning to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Anko.
  - security control: Conduct regular security code reviews, especially for critical components and new features.
  - security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
  - security control: Consider signing releases to ensure integrity and authenticity of the library artifacts.
  - security control: Publish security advisories for any identified vulnerabilities and their fixes.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a library. Anko itself does not handle user authentication. Applications using Anko will be responsible for their own authentication mechanisms.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a library. Anko does not enforce authorization. Applications using Anko will manage authorization based on their specific needs.
  - Input Validation: Relevant if Anko DSLs process external input or user-provided data within applications. Ensure proper validation and sanitization of any input handled by Anko DSLs to prevent injection vulnerabilities in applications using the library.
  - Cryptography: Potentially relevant if Anko provides utilities for cryptographic operations (unlikely based on description). If cryptography is used, ensure usage of well-vetted and secure cryptographic libraries and practices. For general library usage, cryptography requirements are delegated to the applications using Anko.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Android application development using Kotlin.
  - Distribution of Anko library to Android developers.
  - Maintaining developer trust and community adoption of Anko.

- Data We Are Trying to Protect and Their Sensitivity:
  - Anko library source code: Sensitive as it represents the intellectual property and contains the logic of the library. Confidentiality and integrity are important.
  - Build artifacts (JAR/AAR files): Integrity and availability are crucial to ensure developers are using a safe and functional library.
  - Package repository credentials: Highly sensitive, as compromise could lead to unauthorized releases or tampering with the library. Confidentiality and integrity are paramount.
  - Security vulnerability information: Sensitive information that needs to be handled confidentially until a fix is released and publicly disclosed in a coordinated manner.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - Are there specific security compliance requirements for the Anko project (e.g., OWASP, specific industry standards)?
  - Is there a dedicated security team or individual responsible for security aspects of the Anko project?
  - What is the process for handling security vulnerability reports from the community?
  - Are there any plans for formal security audits or penetration testing of the Anko library?
  - What is the expected risk appetite for security vulnerabilities in the Anko library?

- Assumptions:
  - Anko library is primarily intended for UI and general Android development utilities, and not designed to handle highly sensitive data directly.
  - Security focus is on preventing common software vulnerabilities (e.g., injection, cross-site scripting - although less relevant for a library, but potential for misuse in applications, dependency vulnerabilities).
  - The primary users of Anko are Android developers who are expected to implement application-level security controls in their own applications.
  - The project benefits from the security practices inherent in the Kotlin language, Android platform, and GitHub platform.
  - The project aims for a reasonable level of security appropriate for an open-source library, balancing security efforts with development velocity and community contributions.
