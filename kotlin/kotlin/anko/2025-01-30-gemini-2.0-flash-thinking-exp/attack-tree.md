## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploiting UI DSL Vulnerabilities -> Inject Malicious UI Components -> Dynamic UI Generation with Unsanitized Input (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploiting_ui_dsl_vulnerabilities_-_inject_malicious_ui_components_-_dynamic_ui_gener_e579ae8f.md)

*   **Attack Vector Name:** Dynamic UI Injection via Unsanitized Input in Anko DSL
*   **Vulnerability Description:** The application dynamically constructs UI elements using Anko DSL based on user-provided input without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious UI components or code snippets into the application's UI.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Moderate
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Actionable Insight:** Sanitize all user-provided input used in dynamic UI generation within Anko DSL to prevent injection of malicious UI elements or code execution through UI manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploiting Anko SQLite Helpers Misuse -> SQL Injection via String Concatenation -> Building SQL Queries with User Input Directly (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploiting_anko_sqlite_helpers_misuse_-_sql_injection_via_string_concatenation_-_buil_c683e7ac.md)

*   **Attack Vector Name:** SQL Injection via String Concatenation in Anko SQLite Helpers
*   **Vulnerability Description:** The application uses Anko's SQLite helpers but constructs SQL queries by directly concatenating user-provided input instead of using parameterized queries. This creates a classic SQL injection vulnerability, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** Major to Critical
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Actionable Insight:** **Never** construct SQL queries by directly concatenating user input. Always use parameterized queries (placeholders) provided by Anko's SQLite helpers to prevent SQL injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Vulnerability: Database files created by Anko's SQLite helpers are stored with insecure file permissions.](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_vulnerability_database_files_created_by_anko's_sqlite_helpers_are_stored_with_insecure_9a2aa8bf.md)

*   **Attack Vector Name:** Insecure Database File Permissions (Anko SQLite Helpers Context)
*   **Vulnerability Description:** Database files created by Anko's SQLite helpers are stored with overly permissive file permissions, allowing unauthorized access to the database file by other applications or processes on the device.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Major
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Actionable Insight:** Ensure proper file permissions are set for database files created by Anko's SQLite helpers to restrict access to authorized application components only. (General Android security best practice).

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Vulnerability: Application uses Anko's logging features and unintentionally logs Personally Identifiable Information (PII), credentials, or other sensitive data.](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_vulnerability_application_uses_anko's_logging_features_and_unintentionally_logs_person_7eefc8d7.md)

*   **Attack Vector Name:** Unintentional Logging of Sensitive Information (Anko Logging Misuse)
*   **Vulnerability Description:** The application, utilizing Anko's logging features, unintentionally logs sensitive data such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or credentials. This logged data can be exposed through log files or logging systems, leading to information disclosure.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Moderate to Major
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
*   **Actionable Insight:** Implement strict logging policies and guidelines. Avoid logging sensitive data in production environments. If logging is necessary for debugging, sanitize or redact sensitive information before logging. Use appropriate log levels and configure logging systems securely.
