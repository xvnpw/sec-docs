# Threat Model Analysis for kotlin/anko

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Excessive Logging](./threats/information_disclosure_through_excessive_logging.md)

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure through Excessive Logging
    *   **Description:** An attacker with access to device logs (e.g., through ADB, malware, or physical access) could read sensitive information that was unintentionally logged using Anko's logging extensions. Developers might use Anko's convenient logging features without considering the security implications of logging sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, API keys, internal application state, or other confidential information. This could lead to identity theft, account compromise, or further attacks.
    *   **Affected Anko Component:** `AnkoLogger` module, specifically the logging extension functions like `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review all logging statements and avoid logging sensitive information in production builds.
        *   Use appropriate log levels (e.g., `debug` for development, `warn` or `error` for production).
        *   Consider using custom logging solutions that offer more control over log storage and access.
        *   Implement mechanisms to prevent accidental logging of sensitive data.

## Threat: [Data Tampering through Insecure SQLite Usage](./threats/data_tampering_through_insecure_sqlite_usage.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Tampering through Insecure SQLite Usage
    *   **Description:** An attacker could perform SQL injection attacks if developers use Anko's SQLite helpers to construct SQL queries by directly concatenating user-provided input. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands against the application's database.
    *   **Impact:** Modification, deletion, or unauthorized access to data within the application's SQLite database. This could lead to data corruption, loss of functionality, or further exploitation.
    *   **Affected Anko Component:** `Anko SQLite` module, specifically functions related to database access and query execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with the database, even when using Anko's helpers.
        *   Sanitize and validate user input before using it in database queries.
        *   Adhere to secure coding practices for database interactions.
