# Attack Surface Analysis for kotlin/anko

## Attack Surface: [Intent Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/intent_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploitation of vulnerabilities related to Android Intents, allowing attackers to trigger unintended actions, access restricted components, or leak data.
*   **Anko Contribution:** Anko's simplified Intent wrappers can obscure the underlying Intent flags and actions, potentially leading to developers overlooking necessary security configurations.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious Intent that targets an activity intended for internal use only.  Anko's `startActivity<InternalActivity>()` might not explicitly set `exported=false` in the manifest, making the activity accessible.
*   **Impact:**  Privilege escalation, data leakage, unauthorized access to application features.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the exposed component).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Explicitly set all necessary Intent flags (e.g., `FLAG_ACTIVITY_EXCLUDE_FROM_RECENTS`, `FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION`) even when using Anko wrappers.  Validate all data passed to Intents.  Prefer explicit Intents over Anko wrappers for security-critical operations.  Review AndroidManifest.xml to ensure proper `exported` attributes for all components.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection (via Anko SQLite)](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection__via_anko_sqlite_.md)

*   **Description:**  Injection of malicious SQL code into database queries, allowing attackers to read, modify, or delete data.
*   **Anko Contribution:** Anko SQLite's simplified query building can make it easier to accidentally introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities if developers use string concatenation instead of parameterized queries.
*   **Example:**  An attacker enters `'; DROP TABLE users; --` into a search field.  If Anko SQLite is used to build the query without parameterization (e.g., `db.select("users").where("name = '$userInput'")`), the attacker's input could delete the entire `users` table.
*   **Impact:**  Data breach, data loss, data corruption, application compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**  **Always use parameterized queries (placeholders) with Anko SQLite.**  Never construct SQL queries by concatenating strings with user input.  Utilize Anko's built-in support for parameterized queries (e.g., `db.select("users").whereArgs("name = {name}", "name" to userInput)`).  Consider migrating to Room.

## Attack Surface: [Layout Injection / UI Redressing](./attack_surfaces/layout_injection__ui_redressing.md)

*   **Description:** Manipulation of the application's UI to trick users into performing unintended actions or displaying malicious content.
*   **Anko Contribution:** While Anko Layouts themselves aren't directly vulnerable, the DSL can obscure the resulting XML, making it harder to spot layout-related vulnerabilities. Dynamic layout updates based on user input increase the risk.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides input that, when used to dynamically update a layout via Anko, injects a hidden overlay that captures user credentials. Or, a seemingly harmless button is repositioned over a sensitive area.
*   **Impact:** Phishing, credential theft, unauthorized actions, data leakage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Inspect the generated XML from Anko Layouts. Use Android's Layout Inspector. Sanitize and validate any data used to dynamically update layouts. Avoid using user-supplied data directly in layout definitions. Consider traditional XML layouts for security-critical UI. Thoroughly test UI.

## Attack Surface: [Unmaintained Library (Deprecation)](./attack_surfaces/unmaintained_library__deprecation_.md)

*   **Description:**  Anko is largely unmaintained, meaning security vulnerabilities are unlikely to be patched.
*   **Anko Contribution:**  This is a fundamental issue with using Anko itself.
*   **Example:**  A zero-day vulnerability is discovered in Anko's SQLite wrapper.  Since Anko is unmaintained, there will be no official patch.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure to known and unknown vulnerabilities, potentially leading to any of the impacts listed above.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**  **Migrate away from Anko to actively maintained alternatives.**  Use Jetpack Compose for UI, Room for database access, and Kotlin Coroutines directly. This is the *most important* mitigation step.
