# Threat Model Analysis for kotlin/anko

## Threat: [Unpatched SQL Injection](./threats/unpatched_sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when used in an Anko SQLite query without proper sanitization, modifies the intended SQL query to access, modify, or delete unauthorized data. The attacker leverages the simplified syntax of Anko SQLite, which might obscure the underlying SQL construction, making it easier to overlook proper sanitization.  Anko's *lack of ongoing security updates* means any vulnerabilities in its SQLite wrappers will remain unpatched.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data breach: Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
    *   Data modification: Alteration or deletion of critical data.
    *   Data loss: Complete loss of database contents.
    *   Potential for further attacks: The attacker might use the compromised database to launch further attacks on the application or the underlying system.
*   **Affected Anko Component:** Anko SQLite (specifically, any functions that interact with the database, such as `db.insert()`, `db.update()`, `db.select()`, and any custom helper functions built using these).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Parameterized Queries:** *Always* use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for all database interactions.  Anko SQLite supports this, but it's crucial to use it correctly.  *Never* construct SQL queries using string concatenation with user-provided data.
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for *all* data that might be used in database queries, even if parameterized queries are used (defense in depth).
    *   **ORM Migration:** Migrate to a modern, actively maintained ORM like Room, which provides stronger built-in protection against SQL injection.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure the database user account used by the application has the minimum necessary privileges.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_logs.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to application logs (e.g., through a compromised device, misconfigured logging server, or a separate vulnerability) and finds sensitive information that was inadvertently logged using Anko's logging helpers.  The ease of use of `AnkoLogger` might encourage developers to log excessively without considering the security implications. Anko's *lack of updates* means any potential vulnerabilities in how it handles logging (though unlikely) won't be addressed.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of user credentials, API keys, session tokens, or other sensitive data.
    *   Facilitation of further attacks.
    *   Privacy violations.
*   **Affected Anko Component:** Anko Commons (specifically, the `AnkoLogger` and related logging functions).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Log Level Control:** Use appropriate logging levels (e.g., `info`, `warn`, `error`). Avoid using `debug` or `verbose` levels in production builds.
    *   **Data Sanitization:** *Never* log sensitive information directly.  Redact, mask, or encrypt sensitive data before logging it.
    *   **Log Review:** Regularly review application logs to identify and address any potential security issues.
    *   **Secure Log Storage:** Ensure that logs are stored securely and access is restricted to authorized personnel.

## Threat: [Unpatched Vulnerabilities (General)](./threats/unpatched_vulnerabilities__general_.md)

*   **Description:** Because Anko is deprecated, any newly discovered vulnerabilities in the library will *not* be patched. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application. This applies to *all* of Anko's components and is the most significant overarching threat.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but could range from data breaches to complete application takeover.
*   **Affected Anko Component:** All Anko components.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Migration:** *The primary mitigation is to migrate away from Anko to actively maintained alternatives.* This is the only way to address this threat effectively.
    *   **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and mitigate any potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor for any reports of vulnerabilities in Anko (even though they won't be patched, knowing about them can help you assess the risk).

## Threat: [Insecure Data Storage (Anko SQLite - No Encryption)](./threats/insecure_data_storage__anko_sqlite_-_no_encryption_.md)

*   **Description:** Anko SQLite, by itself, does not provide built-in encryption for the database. If sensitive data is stored in the database without additional encryption, an attacker who gains access to the device's storage (e.g., through a rooted device or a separate vulnerability) could read the data directly. Anko's *lack of updates* means it won't receive any features to improve this situation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data breach: Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
    *   Privacy violations.
*   **Affected Anko Component:** Anko SQLite
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Database Encryption:** Use a library like SQLCipher to encrypt the entire database.
    *   **Data-Level Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data *before* storing it in the database, even if the database itself is not encrypted.
    *   **Secure Storage:** Use Android's secure storage mechanisms (e.g., Keystore) to protect encryption keys.
    *   **Room with SQLCipher:** Migrate to Room and use it in conjunction with SQLCipher for a more robust and secure solution.
