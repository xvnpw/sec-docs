## Attack Tree Path: [Anko Commons Exploitation - Intent Manipulation (`browse()`/`email()`):](./attack_tree_paths/anko_commons_exploitation_-_intent_manipulation___browse____email____.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** 1.1.2 Exploit `browse()` or `email()` with malicious URLs/addresses
*   **Description:**
    *   Anko's `browse()` function is a convenience wrapper for launching a browser to open a given URL.  The `email()` function similarly opens an email client with pre-filled fields.
    *   If the application does not validate the URL or email address passed to these functions, an attacker can provide a malicious URL or email address.
    *   For `browse()`, a malicious URL could lead to:
        *   Phishing websites that mimic legitimate sites to steal user credentials.
        *   Websites that exploit browser vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on the user's device.
        *   Websites that download malware.
    *   For `email()`, a malicious email address could be used in conjunction with social engineering to trick the user into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise their security.
*   **Likelihood:** High - It's a common oversight to not validate URLs/emails before using them.
*   **Impact:** Medium - Can lead to phishing, malware, or social engineering attacks.
*   **Effort:** Low - Requires minimal effort to craft a malicious URL.
*   **Skill Level:** Novice - Basic understanding of URLs and phishing techniques is sufficient.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy - The malicious URL/email is often visible in the application's UI or logs.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Strict URL Validation:** Implement robust URL validation using a whitelist of allowed domains or a well-vetted URL parsing library.  Do *not* rely on simple string checks.
    *   **Email Address Validation:** Validate email addresses using a regular expression that conforms to RFC 5322.
    *   **User Confirmation:** Consider prompting the user for confirmation before opening a URL or sending an email, especially if the URL/email originates from user input.

## Attack Tree Path: [Anko SQLite Exploitation - SQL Injection:](./attack_tree_paths/anko_sqlite_exploitation_-_sql_injection.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** 3.1 SQL Injection (Overall) [CRITICAL]
    *   3.1.1 Exploit `insert()` or `update()` with crafted data [CRITICAL]
    *   3.1.2 Exploit `query()` with crafted selection arguments [CRITICAL]
*   **Description:**
    *   Anko SQLite provides helper functions for interacting with SQLite databases.  However, these helpers do *not* automatically prevent SQL injection.  If developers construct SQL queries by concatenating strings, especially if those strings include user input, the application is vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   **`insert()` and `update()` (3.1.1):**  If user-provided data is directly inserted into the SQL query string without proper escaping or parameterization, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code. This could allow them to:
        *   Modify or delete data in the database.
        *   Bypass authentication mechanisms.
        *   Potentially execute arbitrary code on the database server (depending on the database configuration).
    *   **`query()` (3.1.2):**  Similarly, if user input is used to construct the `selection` or `selectionArgs` parameters of the `query()` function without proper parameterization, an attacker can inject SQL code.  This could allow them to:
        *   Retrieve sensitive data from the database.
        *   Modify data (if the query is used in a subsequent update operation).
        *   Cause denial-of-service by crafting queries that consume excessive resources.
*   **Likelihood:** High (if parameterized queries are *not* used) - This is a classic vulnerability, and developers often make mistakes when constructing SQL queries.
*   **Impact:** High - Can lead to complete data breaches, data modification, or denial of service.
*   **Effort:** Low - SQL injection attacks are well-documented, and tools are readily available to automate the process.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires understanding of SQL and SQL injection techniques.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (with proper logging/monitoring) - SQL injection attacks can be detected through careful monitoring of database logs and application behavior.  However, without proper logging and intrusion detection systems, they can be difficult to detect.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Parameterized Queries (Mandatory):**  *Always* use parameterized queries for all database interactions.  Anko provides mechanisms for this (e.g., using `?` placeholders in the SQL string and passing values as a separate array).  *Never* construct SQL queries by concatenating strings, especially if those strings include user input.
    *   **Input Validation:** While parameterized queries are the primary defense, it's still good practice to validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected data types and formats.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user account used by the application has only the minimum necessary privileges.  Do not use a root or administrator account.
    *   **Database Firewall:** Consider using a database firewall to restrict access to the database and monitor for suspicious activity.
    * **Static Analysis and Code Review:** Use static analysis tools and conduct thorough code reviews to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
