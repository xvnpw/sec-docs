# Attack Surface Analysis for kotlin/anko

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection Vulnerability](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_vulnerability.md)

*   **How Anko Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Anko simplifies database interactions with its `anko.db.*` package. This convenience can lead developers to construct raw SQL queries using string concatenation with user-provided input, making SQL injection vulnerabilities more likely if input is not properly sanitized.
*   **Example:** Using `db.writableDatabase.execSQL("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${userInput}'")` directly exposes the application to SQL injection if `userInput` is not sanitized.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, data modification, or even complete database compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** **Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements** provided by Android's SQLite API when interacting with the database. Avoid constructing raw SQL queries by concatenating strings, especially those containing user input. Utilize Anko's `transaction` and query builder functions with parameterized inputs where applicable.

## Attack Surface: [Race Conditions and Data Corruption in Asynchronous Operations](./attack_surfaces/race_conditions_and_data_corruption_in_asynchronous_operations.md)

*   **How Anko Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Anko simplifies asynchronous operations using `async` and `bg` functions. Improper use without proper synchronization mechanisms can lead to race conditions when multiple threads access and modify shared mutable data.
*   **Example:** Multiple `async` blocks updating the same shared variable without using `synchronized` or other concurrency control mechanisms can lead to unpredictable and potentially incorrect data states.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, application crashes, unexpected behavior, and potentially security vulnerabilities if the corrupted data is used for authorization or access control.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Employ proper synchronization techniques (e.g., `synchronized` blocks, mutexes, thread-safe data structures) when accessing shared mutable data from asynchronous tasks initiated by Anko. Carefully consider the threading model and potential for concurrent access. Utilize Kotlin coroutines' concurrency primitives if using `anko-coroutines`.

## Attack Surface: [Intent Redirection/Hijacking due to Improper Intent Handling](./attack_surfaces/intent_redirectionhijacking_due_to_improper_intent_handling.md)

*   **How Anko Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Anko provides helper functions like `startActivity` and `intentFor` to simplify launching activities. If the data used to construct these intents is derived from untrusted sources without proper validation, attackers could potentially manipulate the intent to launch unintended activities or inject malicious data.
*   **Example:** Using `startActivity<SomeActivity>("user_id" to untrustedInput)` where `untrustedInput` could be manipulated to point to a different user or inject malicious data into `SomeActivity`.
*   **Impact:** Launching unintended components, bypassing security checks, potentially executing code in a different context, or information disclosure if sensitive data is passed in the manipulated intent.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize any data used to construct intents, especially if it originates from user input or external sources. Use explicit intents whenever possible to avoid ambiguity in target component resolution. Avoid passing sensitive data directly in intent extras if possible; consider alternative secure storage or passing identifiers.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data in Shared Preferences](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_sensitive_data_in_shared_preferences.md)

*   **How Anko Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Anko provides easy access to shared preferences through `defaultSharedPreferences` and `customPreferences`. This convenience might tempt developers to store sensitive information directly in shared preferences without proper encryption.
*   **Example:** Storing API keys or user credentials directly using `defaultSharedPreferences.edit { putString("apiKey", sensitiveKey) }`.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data to other applications on the device or to an attacker with physical access or root privileges.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** **Never store sensitive data in plain text in shared preferences.** Utilize the Android Keystore system for storing cryptographic keys and encrypt sensitive data before storing it in shared preferences.
