# BUSINESS POSTURE

The kotlinx.coroutines project provides a library for coroutines and asynchronous programming in Kotlin.

- Business Priorities:
  - Enable efficient and performant asynchronous operations in Kotlin applications.
  - Improve developer productivity by providing a structured and easy-to-use concurrency framework.
  - Support a wide range of platforms including JVM, Native, and JavaScript.
  - Foster a strong community around Kotlin asynchronous programming.

- Business Goals:
  - Become the standard library for coroutines in the Kotlin ecosystem.
  - Ensure stability, reliability, and performance of the library.
  - Maintain compatibility with different Kotlin versions and platforms.
  - Encourage adoption of coroutines for asynchronous programming in Kotlin.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the library could impact applications using it.
  - Performance regressions could negatively affect application performance.
  - Breaking changes in new versions could disrupt existing applications.
  - Lack of adoption could limit the impact and value of the library.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control Open source development model with public code repository on GitHub. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
  - security control Community review and contributions. Implemented in: GitHub pull requests and issue tracking.
  - security control Dependency scanning using GitHub Dependabot. Implemented in: GitHub Dependabot alerts.
  - security control Standard Kotlin coding practices and code reviews. Implemented in: Development guidelines and pull request process.
  - security control Unit and integration testing. Implemented in: Gradle build scripts and CI workflows.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk Risks inherent in open source software, including potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
  - accepted risk Potential for vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control Implement Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential code vulnerabilities.
  - security control Conduct regular security code reviews by security experts, especially for critical components and new features.
  - security control Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy and process for reporting and handling security issues.
  - security control Perform dependency vulnerability scanning as part of the build process and monitor for updates.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a library. Authentication is the responsibility of applications using the library.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a library. Authorization is the responsibility of applications using the library.
  - Input Validation: The library APIs should perform input validation to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes due to invalid input from applications. This is especially important for public facing APIs.
  - Cryptography: The core coroutines library itself is unlikely to require cryptography. If specific extensions or modules are developed that handle sensitive data, appropriate cryptographic measures should be implemented in those modules.
