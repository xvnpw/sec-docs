# Threat Model Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines

## Threat: [Race Conditions in Shared Mutable State](./threats/race_conditions_in_shared_mutable_state.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit race conditions by sending concurrent requests or triggering concurrent operations that manipulate shared mutable data without proper synchronization. This could lead to data corruption, inconsistent application state, and potentially allow the attacker to manipulate application logic, bypass security checks, or gain unauthorized access if the corrupted state leads to privilege escalation or incorrect authorization decisions.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, application instability, potential security breaches, unauthorized access, privilege escalation.
*   **Affected kotlinx.coroutines component:** Core library, concurrency primitives (Mutex, Channels, Atomic operations).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Minimize shared mutable state.
    *   Use synchronization primitives (Mutex, Channels, Atomic operations) for shared mutable state access.
    *   Employ thread-safe data structures.
    *   Conduct thorough concurrency testing.

## Threat: [Unbounded Coroutine Launching leading to Resource Exhaustion](./threats/unbounded_coroutine_launching_leading_to_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could flood the application with requests or events that trigger the launching of new coroutines without any limits. This can lead to an excessive number of coroutines being created, overwhelming system resources (threads, memory, CPU) and causing performance degradation or denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Resource exhaustion, performance degradation, Denial of Service, application crash.
*   **Affected kotlinx.coroutines component:** Core library, `launch`, Dispatchers, CoroutineScope.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting or throttling for coroutine launching.
    *   Use bounded concurrency constructs (Semaphore, Channel).
    *   Use appropriate dispatchers and configure thread pool sizes.
    *   Monitor resource consumption.

## Threat: [Incorrect Security Context Propagation in Coroutine Context](./threats/incorrect_security_context_propagation_in_coroutine_context.md)

*   **Description:** If the application relies on security context propagation, an attacker might exploit scenarios where the security context is lost or incorrectly propagated in coroutines. This could lead to operations being performed with incorrect permissions, potentially allowing unauthorized access or privilege escalation. For example, a user's request might be processed in a coroutine with elevated privileges due to context mismanagement.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized access, security bypass.
*   **Affected kotlinx.coroutines component:** Core library, CoroutineContext, `withContext`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Explicitly capture and propagate security context in coroutine context.
    *   Use `withContext` to manage security context.
    *   Avoid relying on implicit thread-local storage for security context.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `kotlinx.coroutines` Library](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__kotlinx_coroutines__library.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the `kotlinx.coroutines` library itself. This could range from denial of service vulnerabilities to remote code execution depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Depends on the vulnerability, could range from Denial of Service to Remote Code Execution, complete system compromise.
*   **Affected kotlinx.coroutines component:** Entire library.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE), High (if DOS or other significant impact)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep `kotlinx.coroutines` library updated to the latest stable version.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases.
    *   Perform security code reviews and static analysis.

## Threat: [Lack of Timeouts in Asynchronous Operations leading to Denial of Service](./threats/lack_of_timeouts_in_asynchronous_operations_leading_to_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could initiate asynchronous operations (e.g., network requests) that are designed to be slow or never complete. If timeouts are not implemented for these operations within coroutines, they can block resources indefinitely, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Resource exhaustion, Denial of Service, application unresponsiveness.
*   **Affected kotlinx.coroutines component:** Core library, asynchronous operations within coroutines, `withTimeout`, `withTimeoutOrNull`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement timeouts for all asynchronous operations using `withTimeout` or `withTimeoutOrNull`.
    *   Configure appropriate timeout values.
    *   Handle timeout exceptions gracefully.
