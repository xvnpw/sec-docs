# Attack Surface Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines

## Attack Surface: [Race Conditions due to Concurrency](./attack_surfaces/race_conditions_due_to_concurrency.md)

*   **Description:**  Unintended and unpredictable behavior arising from unsynchronized concurrent access to shared mutable state.
*   **kotlinx.coroutines Contribution:**  `kotlinx.coroutines` facilitates concurrent execution through coroutines, directly increasing the likelihood of race conditions if concurrency is not carefully managed. The ease of launching coroutines can inadvertently lead to more concurrency and thus more opportunities for race conditions.
*   **Example:** Two coroutines concurrently incrementing a shared counter variable without using a mutex. The final counter value might be incorrect due to interleaved operations, leading to incorrect application logic or data corruption.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, incorrect business logic execution, potential for denial of service if race conditions lead to resource exhaustion or deadlocks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Synchronization Primitives:** Employ `Mutex`, `Semaphore`, `AtomicInteger`, and other synchronization mechanisms provided by Kotlin or the standard library to protect shared mutable state.
    *   **Immutable Data Structures:** Favor immutable data structures and functional programming principles to minimize shared mutable state and reduce the need for synchronization.
    *   **Message Passing:** Utilize channels (`Channel`) for communication and data sharing between coroutines instead of direct shared mutable state.
    *   **Thorough Testing:** Implement comprehensive concurrency tests, including stress tests and race condition detection tools, to identify and fix race conditions.

## Attack Surface: [Context Switching and State Leakage](./attack_surfaces/context_switching_and_state_leakage.md)

*   **Description:**  Exposure or unintended access to sensitive information due to improper management of coroutine contexts and state during context switching.
*   **kotlinx.coroutines Contribution:** Coroutines rely on context switching, a core feature of `kotlinx.coroutines`. If context data is not properly isolated or cleared, sensitive information might persist across coroutine executions or scopes due to the library's context management mechanisms.
*   **Example:** Storing user credentials or API keys in a coroutine context and then reusing that context for a different user request, potentially leading to unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, unauthorized access to sensitive data, privilege escalation if context leakage allows access to higher-privilege resources.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Minimize Context Data:** Avoid storing sensitive information directly in coroutine contexts if possible.
    *   **Context Isolation:** Ensure proper isolation of coroutine contexts, especially when handling requests from different users or security domains. Create new contexts or clear sensitive data from contexts after use.
    *   **Structured Concurrency:** Utilize `coroutineScope` and `supervisorScope` to define clear boundaries for coroutine execution and context lifecycle management, aiding in controlling context propagation.
    *   **Thread-Local Awareness:** Understand the behavior of thread-local storage within coroutines and dispatchers. Avoid relying on thread-local storage for security-sensitive data in coroutine contexts unless carefully managed.
