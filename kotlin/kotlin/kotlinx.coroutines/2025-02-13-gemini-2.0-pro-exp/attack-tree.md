## Attack Tree Path: [Uncontrolled Coroutine Creation (Starvation) [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/uncontrolled_coroutine_creation__starvation___high_risk___critical_.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits the application's lack of limits on coroutine creation to launch a massive number of coroutines, exhausting system resources (primarily memory and potentially CPU). This is analogous to a fork bomb.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   Identify an endpoint or functionality that triggers coroutine creation.
    *   Craft requests (often repeatedly) that cause the application to launch new coroutines.
    *   If there are no limits, continue sending requests until the application becomes unresponsive.
*   **Vulnerability:** The application does not limit the number of coroutines that can be created, especially in response to user input.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement strict limits on the number of coroutines that can be created, particularly those triggered by user input.
    *   Use a `Semaphore` to limit concurrent coroutine creation.
    *   Use structured concurrency to manage coroutine lifecycles.
    *   Monitor coroutine counts and set alerts for unusual spikes.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.a User Input Controls Coroutine Number [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_a_user_input_controls_coroutine_number__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The most direct and dangerous form of uncontrolled coroutine creation.  User-provided data (e.g., a parameter in a request) directly determines the number of coroutines launched.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Lack of input validation and sanitization allows an attacker to specify an arbitrarily large number of coroutines.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Validate and sanitize all user input.
        *   Implement strict limits on any input that influences coroutine creation.
        *   Avoid directly using user input to determine the number of coroutines.

## Attack Tree Path: [Blocking Calls in Coroutine Context [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/blocking_calls_in_coroutine_context__high_risk___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** A coroutine performs a long-running blocking operation (e.g., network I/O, file I/O, database queries) *without* using the appropriate `Dispatchers` (like `Dispatchers.IO`) or suspending functions. This blocks the underlying thread, preventing other coroutines from executing and potentially leading to thread pool exhaustion.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   Identify endpoints that perform potentially blocking operations.
    *   Trigger these endpoints, potentially with parameters that could cause the blocking operation to take a long time (e.g., large file uploads, slow network connections).
    *   Repeatedly trigger the endpoint to exhaust the thread pool.
*   **Vulnerability:** Blocking operations are performed within coroutines running on a limited dispatcher (like `Dispatchers.Default` or `Dispatchers.Main`).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   *Never* perform blocking operations directly within a coroutine running on a limited dispatcher.
    *   Use `withContext(Dispatchers.IO) { ... }` to switch to a thread pool designed for blocking operations.
    *   Use truly non-blocking, suspending alternatives whenever possible.
    *   Use code analysis tools to detect blocking calls in inappropriate contexts.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.a Missing Timeout on Blocking Calls [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_a_missing_timeout_on_blocking_calls__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** A blocking operation within a coroutine does not have a timeout, meaning it can potentially block indefinitely.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Lack of timeouts allows an attacker to cause a thread to be blocked for an extended period, contributing to thread pool exhaustion.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement timeouts on *all* blocking operations within coroutines (e.g., using `withTimeout` or `withTimeoutOrNull`).
        *   Choose appropriate timeout values based on the expected duration of the operation.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.b Improper Error Handling in Blocking Code [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_b_improper_error_handling_in_blocking_code__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** An exception thrown within a blocking operation inside a coroutine is not properly handled. This can lead to the coroutine terminating unexpectedly and, depending on the dispatcher and exception handler configuration, potentially affecting the underlying thread.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Unhandled exceptions in blocking code can lead to resource leaks and thread pool exhaustion.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use `try-catch` blocks around all blocking operations within coroutines.
        *   Handle exceptions gracefully, logging errors and potentially retrying operations (with appropriate backoff).
        *   Consider using a global `CoroutineExceptionHandler` to handle uncaught exceptions.
