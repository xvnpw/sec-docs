# Attack Surface Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines

## Attack Surface: [Race Conditions in Shared Mutable State](./attack_surfaces/race_conditions_in_shared_mutable_state.md)

*   **Description:** Concurrent access and modification of shared mutable data by multiple coroutines without proper synchronization.
*   **kotlinx.coroutines Contribution:** Coroutines simplify concurrent programming, making it easier to write code that *appears* correct but contains subtle race conditions. The lightweight nature of coroutines and cooperative multitasking can increase the likelihood of these races occurring, even on single-threaded dispatchers.
*   **Example:**
    ```kotlin
    var sharedCounter = 0

    fun incrementCounter() = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Default).launch {
        repeat(1000) {
            sharedCounter++ // Race condition!
        }
    }

    suspend fun main() {
        val job1 = incrementCounter()
        val job2 = incrementCounter()
        job1.join()
        job2.join()
        println(sharedCounter) // Likely not 2000
    }
    ```
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, unpredictable behavior. Could lead to security vulnerabilities if the shared state controls access, authentication, or other security-relevant data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Use `Mutex` (and `withLock`) to protect critical sections:
            ```kotlin
            val mutex = Mutex()
            var sharedCounter = 0

            fun incrementCounter() = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Default).launch {
                repeat(1000) {
                    mutex.withLock {
                        sharedCounter++
                    }
                }
            }
            ```
        *   Prefer immutable data structures.
        *   Use `Channel` for inter-coroutine communication, avoiding shared state.
        *   Use atomic variables (`AtomicInteger`, `AtomicReference`, etc.) for simple atomic operations.
        *   Employ thorough code reviews and testing, including concurrency testing tools.

## Attack Surface: [Coroutine Leaks](./attack_surfaces/coroutine_leaks.md)

*   **Description:** Coroutines that are launched but never properly cancelled or completed, leading to resource consumption (memory, threads, open connections).
*   **kotlinx.coroutines Contribution:** The ease of launching coroutines can lead to developers inadvertently creating long-running or orphaned coroutines without proper lifecycle management.  This is a direct consequence of using the library.
*   **Example:**
    ```kotlin
    fun startLongRunningTask() {
        CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO).launch { // No structured concurrency
            while (true) { // Infinite loop, no cancellation check
                delay(1000)
                println("Still running...")
            }
        }
    }
    // startLongRunningTask() is called, but the coroutine is never cancelled.
    ```
*   **Impact:** Resource exhaustion (memory, threads, file descriptors), leading to performance degradation, application instability, and potential denial-of-service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Use structured concurrency: Launch coroutines within a `CoroutineScope` tied to a lifecycle (e.g., `lifecycleScope` in Android, a custom scope with a `Job`). Cancel the scope when the associated lifecycle ends.
            ```kotlin
            val myScope = CoroutineScope(Job()) // Create a scope

            fun startLongRunningTask() {
                myScope.launch {
                    while (isActive) { // Check for cancellation
                        delay(1000)
                        println("Still running...")
                    }
                }
            }
            // Later, to cancel: myScope.cancel()
            ```
        *   Use `join()` or `await()` to wait for coroutines to complete when their results are needed.
        *   Use `use` blocks for resources that need to be closed when the coroutine completes or is cancelled.
        *   Monitor for leaked coroutines using debugging tools and profiling.

## Attack Surface: [Unhandled Exceptions in Coroutines](./attack_surfaces/unhandled_exceptions_in_coroutines.md)

*   **Description:** Exceptions thrown within a coroutine that are not caught, leading to coroutine termination and potential application crashes or inconsistent state.
*   **kotlinx.coroutines Contribution:** The structured concurrency model of coroutines can make exception handling seem simpler, but uncaught exceptions can still propagate and cause unexpected behavior if not handled correctly.  The propagation rules are specific to `kotlinx.coroutines`.
*   **Example:**
    ```kotlin
    fun riskyOperation() = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Default).launch {
        throw Exception("Something went wrong!") // Uncaught exception
    }
    // riskyOperation() is called, the exception is not caught, and the coroutine crashes (and potentially its parent).
    ```
*   **Impact:** Application crashes, inconsistent state, resource leaks, potential denial-of-service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Use `try-catch` blocks within coroutines to handle expected exceptions.
        *   Implement a global `CoroutineExceptionHandler` to catch uncaught exceptions at the top level of the coroutine hierarchy.
        *   Use `supervisorScope` or `SupervisorJob` to isolate failures in child coroutines, preventing them from cancelling the parent.
        *   Use `runCatching` to handle exceptions and return a `Result` object.
