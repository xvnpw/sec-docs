# Threat Model Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines

## Threat: [Unsynchronized Shared Mutable State Access (via Coroutine Misuse)](./threats/unsynchronized_shared_mutable_state_access__via_coroutine_misuse_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits the ease of launching coroutines (`launch`, `async`) to trigger concurrent access to shared mutable data *without* using the provided synchronization mechanisms (`Mutex`, `Channel`, `StateFlow`, etc.). The attacker might manipulate inputs or timing to cause multiple coroutines to modify the same data simultaneously. This is *specifically* a threat because coroutines make it easy to *accidentally* introduce concurrency.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, potential for privilege escalation (if shared state controls access), denial of service (if corruption leads to crashes), or information disclosure (if sensitive data is exposed).
    *   **Affected Component:** `launch`, `async`, any custom coroutine builders, and code accessing shared mutable state *within* coroutines without proper synchronization using `Mutex`, `Channel`, `StateFlow`, `SharedFlow`, or atomic operations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature of the shared state).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Prefer Immutability:** Design for immutable data structures.
        *   **`Mutex`:** Use `Mutex` and `withLock` for critical sections modifying shared state.
        *   **`Channel`:** Use `Channel` for communication and data transfer, avoiding direct shared state.
        *   **`StateFlow` / `SharedFlow`:** Use these for managing and sharing state updates safely.
        *   **Atomic Operations:** Use atomic variables (e.g., `AtomicInteger`) for simple atomic updates.
        *   **Structured Concurrency:** Limit coroutine scope and access to shared resources using `coroutineScope` and `supervisorScope`.

## Threat: [Deadlock Due to Improper `Mutex` or `Channel` Use within Coroutines](./threats/deadlock_due_to_improper__mutex__or__channel__use_within_coroutines.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker triggers a sequence of operations that causes coroutines to deadlock while waiting on `kotlinx.coroutines` synchronization primitives. This is a direct threat because the deadlock is caused by the interaction of coroutines *and* these specific primitives.  For example, two coroutines might try to acquire the same `Mutex` in different orders, or a coroutine might try to send to a full `Channel` while another is blocked trying to receive from it.
    *   **Impact:** Application hangs or becomes unresponsive; specific features or the entire application become unusable.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Mutex` (and its `withLock` function), `Channel` (especially bounded channels), and the coroutines (`launch`, `async`, etc.) that interact with them.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can lead to complete application unresponsiveness).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Consistent Lock Ordering:** Enforce a strict, consistent order for acquiring multiple `Mutex` instances across all coroutines.
        *   **Timeouts:** Use timeouts with `Mutex.lock` (via `withTimeoutOrNull`) and `Channel.send`/`Channel.receive`.
        *   **Avoid Holding Locks for Long Periods:** Minimize the time a coroutine holds a `Mutex`.
        *   **Structured Concurrency:** Use structured concurrency to ensure proper cancellation and resource release.
        *   **Deadlock Detection:** Employ deadlock detection tools during development.

## Threat: [Unhandled Exception in `launch` Leading to Application Crash](./threats/unhandled_exception_in__launch__leading_to_application_crash.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker triggers an exception *within* a coroutine launched using `launch` *without* a `try-catch` block *and* without a global `CoroutineExceptionHandler`.  Because `launch` propagates unhandled exceptions to the parent scope (ultimately to the uncaught exception handler), this can crash the entire application. This is a *direct* threat of `launch`'s exception handling behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `launch` (specifically), and any code within the launched coroutine that can throw an exception.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (application crash).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **`try-catch` Blocks:** Wrap code within the `launch` block that might throw exceptions in `try-catch` blocks.
        *   **`CoroutineExceptionHandler`:** Implement a global `CoroutineExceptionHandler` to catch and handle *all* uncaught exceptions from coroutines. This is crucial for preventing crashes.
        *   **`supervisorScope`:** If you *don't* want the parent to be cancelled, use `supervisorScope` to isolate the failing coroutine.

## Threat: [Context Loss Leading to Authorization Bypass (Using Coroutines)](./threats/context_loss_leading_to_authorization_bypass__using_coroutines_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker exploits the fact that security context (e.g., authentication tokens) is *not* automatically propagated across coroutine dispatcher changes (using `withContext`) or new coroutine launches (`launch`, `async`).  If the code relies on thread-local storage or implicit context, switching to a different dispatcher or launching a child coroutine might lose this context, leading to incorrect authorization checks.
    * **Impact:** Authorization bypass, allowing unauthorized access to resources or functionality.
    * **Affected Component:** `withContext`, `launch`, `async`, and any code relying on thread-local storage or implicit context for security-related information.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (if it leads to authorization bypass)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **`ThreadContextElement`:** Use `ThreadContextElement` to *explicitly* propagate security context across coroutine boundaries.
        *   **Context-Aware Libraries:** Use libraries that automatically handle context propagation for security frameworks.
        *   **Explicit Context Passing:** Pass security context as explicit parameters to coroutines and functions.
        *   **Careful Dispatcher Switching:** Be extremely cautious when switching dispatchers and ensure context is restored.
