# Attack Surface Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines

## Attack Surface: [Unbounded Coroutine Launching](./attack_surfaces/unbounded_coroutine_launching.md)

**Description:** An attacker can trigger the creation of an excessive number of coroutines, leading to resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, threads) and a denial of service.

**How kotlinx.coroutines contributes to the attack surface:** The ease with which new coroutines can be launched using functions like `launch`, `async`, or within `flow` operators makes it simple to create a large number of concurrent operations. If these launches are directly tied to untrusted input without proper control, it becomes an attack vector.

**Example:** A web endpoint that launches a new coroutine for each incoming request without any rate limiting or queueing mechanism. An attacker could send a flood of requests, causing the server to create an unsustainable number of coroutines.

**Impact:** Denial of service, application crashes, performance degradation for legitimate users.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting on endpoints or functions that trigger coroutine creation.
* Use bounded concurrency mechanisms like `Semaphore` or `Channel` with limited capacity to control the number of active coroutines.
* Implement proper request queuing and backpressure handling.
* Monitor resource usage and set up alerts for excessive coroutine creation.

## Attack Surface: [Channel Overload](./attack_surfaces/channel_overload.md)

**Description:** An attacker can send a large volume of data to a `Channel` faster than the receiving coroutine(s) can process it, leading to memory exhaustion or backpressure issues that degrade performance or cause crashes.

**How kotlinx.coroutines contributes to the attack surface:** `Channel` provides a mechanism for communication between coroutines. If the sending side is controlled by untrusted input and the channel's capacity is unbounded or too large, an attacker can overwhelm the receiver.

**Example:** A chat application where messages are sent through a `Channel`. An attacker could flood the channel with messages, potentially overwhelming the message processing coroutine and causing delays or crashes for other users.

**Impact:** Memory exhaustion, application crashes, performance degradation, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use bounded `Channel`s with a limited capacity to restrict the number of pending messages.
* Implement backpressure mechanisms on the sending side to prevent sending data faster than the receiver can handle.
* Implement flow control or rate limiting on the data source feeding the channel.
* Monitor channel size and implement alerts for exceeding thresholds.

## Attack Surface: [Race Conditions and Data Corruption](./attack_surfaces/race_conditions_and_data_corruption.md)

**Description:** Improperly synchronized access to shared mutable state within coroutines can lead to race conditions, where the outcome of operations depends on the unpredictable order of execution, potentially leading to data corruption or inconsistent application state.

**How kotlinx.coroutines contributes to the attack surface:** The concurrent nature of coroutines makes it easy to introduce race conditions if shared mutable state is accessed without proper synchronization.

**Example:** Multiple coroutines updating a shared counter without using a `Mutex` or atomic operations. An attacker might trigger specific timing of events to cause the counter to be incremented incorrectly.

**Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, unexpected behavior, potential security vulnerabilities depending on the data being corrupted.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Minimize the use of shared mutable state.
* Use appropriate synchronization primitives like `Mutex`, `Semaphore`, `AtomicInteger`, or thread-safe data structures when accessing shared mutable state.
* Consider using actor-based concurrency models to encapsulate state within a single coroutine.
* Thoroughly test concurrent code to identify potential race conditions.
