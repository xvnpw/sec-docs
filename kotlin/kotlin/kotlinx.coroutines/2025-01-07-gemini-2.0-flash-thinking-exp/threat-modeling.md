# Threat Model Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines

## Threat: [Race Condition in Shared Mutable State](./threats/race_condition_in_shared_mutable_state.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate the timing of concurrent coroutine execution (using `kotlinx.coroutines` constructs like `launch` or `async`) to cause unexpected interleaving of operations on shared mutable data. This could involve rapidly triggering actions that modify the same data from multiple coroutines simultaneously, leading to data corruption or inconsistent application state.

**Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application behavior, potential security vulnerabilities if the corrupted state is used for authorization or access control, application crashes.

**Affected Component:** `kotlinx.coroutines.launch`, `kotlinx.coroutines.async`, shared mutable variables accessed within coroutine blocks.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use appropriate synchronization primitives provided by `kotlinx.coroutines.sync` like `Mutex` to protect critical sections of code accessing shared mutable data.
*   Employ thread-safe data structures or immutable data structures when interacting with coroutines.
*   Minimize shared mutable state by encapsulating it within a single coroutine or actor.
*   Utilize coroutine contexts and dispatchers to control the execution environment and potentially limit concurrency in critical sections.

## Threat: [Deadlock](./threats/deadlock.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft scenarios where multiple coroutines become blocked indefinitely, each waiting for a resource held by another, specifically through the use of `kotlinx.coroutines` synchronization primitives. This could involve triggering sequences of operations that cause coroutines to acquire `Mutex` instances or interact with `Channel` instances in conflicting orders, leading to a standstill.

**Impact:** Application unresponsiveness, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `kotlinx.coroutines.sync.Mutex`, `kotlinx.coroutines.sync.Semaphore`, `kotlinx.coroutines.channels.Channel` with rendezvous semantics.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Establish a consistent order for acquiring locks (e.g., `Mutex` instances) to prevent circular dependencies.
*   Use timeouts when acquiring locks to prevent indefinite blocking.
*   Consider alternative synchronization mechanisms that avoid explicit locking, such as message passing using `Channel` or actor models.
*   Carefully analyze dependencies between coroutines and the resources they require, especially when using `Mutex` or `Channel`.

## Threat: [Deadlock in Channel Communication](./threats/deadlock_in_channel_communication.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate the flow of data through `kotlinx.coroutines.channels.Channel` instances, creating scenarios where coroutines are waiting indefinitely for messages that will never arrive, leading to a deadlock. This could involve disrupting the expected send/receive patterns on `Channel` instances.

**Impact:** Application unresponsiveness, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `kotlinx.coroutines.channels.Channel`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure that sends and receives on `Channel` instances are properly coordinated.
*   Use timeouts for send and receive operations on `Channel` instances to prevent indefinite blocking.
*   Carefully design communication patterns using `Channel` to avoid circular dependencies and ensure that channels are eventually closed.
