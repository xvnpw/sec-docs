# Threat Model Analysis for kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines

## Threat: [Race Condition Exploitation for Data Corruption](./threats/race_condition_exploitation_for_data_corruption.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might intentionally trigger race conditions by sending concurrent requests or inputs to the application, exploiting unsynchronized access to shared mutable state managed by coroutines. This could lead to data corruption, inconsistent application state, or incorrect business logic execution. For example, in an e-commerce application, an attacker could manipulate stock levels or pricing by exploiting race conditions in concurrent update operations.
*   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise, business logic errors, financial loss, application instability, potential denial of service.
*   **Affected kotlinx.coroutines Component:** Shared Mutable State accessed by multiple coroutines, `Mutex`, `Atomic` operations (if misused or insufficient).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Employ thread-safe data structures and collections for shared state.
    *   Utilize `Mutex` or `Semaphore` to protect critical sections accessing shared mutable state.
    *   Use `Atomic` variables for simple atomic operations on shared variables.
    *   Favor immutable data structures and functional programming principles to minimize shared mutable state.
    *   Thoroughly test concurrent code paths for race conditions using concurrency testing tools and techniques.

## Threat: [Deadlock Induction for Denial of Service](./threats/deadlock_induction_for_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could craft specific sequences of requests or actions that intentionally create deadlock situations in the application's coroutine execution flow. By triggering resource contention and circular dependencies in coroutine synchronization (e.g., mutex acquisition), the attacker can cause the application to hang indefinitely, leading to a denial of service. For instance, in an API endpoint handling resource allocation, an attacker could send requests designed to create a deadlock in mutex acquisition, making the endpoint unresponsive.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, application unresponsiveness, service disruption.
*   **Affected kotlinx.coroutines Component:** `Mutex`, `Semaphore`, `Channel` (if used for complex synchronization), `CoroutineScope` (if improperly managed resource lifecycle).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Establish and enforce a clear resource acquisition order to prevent circular dependencies in locking.
    *   Implement timeouts for mutex acquisition to break potential deadlocks.
    *   Simplify concurrent logic and reduce the complexity of locking schemes.
    *   Use higher-level concurrency abstractions where appropriate to minimize manual locking.
    *   Monitor application responsiveness and resource usage to detect potential deadlocks.
