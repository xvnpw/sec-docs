# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is the kotlinx.coroutines library, a fundamental component for asynchronous programming in Kotlin. Its primary business goal is to empower Kotlin developers to write efficient, concurrent, and reactive applications across various platforms (JVM, Native, JS).

Business priorities are:
- Developer Productivity: Providing a concise and expressive API for asynchronous operations, reducing boilerplate code and improving developer experience.
- Performance and Efficiency: Enabling high-performance concurrency with lightweight coroutines, minimizing overhead compared to traditional threads.
- Platform Compatibility: Ensuring seamless operation across all supported Kotlin platforms, allowing developers to write portable asynchronous code.
- Community Adoption and Growth: Fostering a vibrant community around kotlinx.coroutines, encouraging contributions and ensuring the library remains relevant and up-to-date.

Key business risks associated with kotlinx.coroutines include:
- Library Defects: Bugs or vulnerabilities in the library can negatively impact applications relying on it, leading to application failures, performance degradation, or security issues.
- Performance Bottlenecks: Inefficiencies in the library's implementation could lead to performance bottlenecks in applications, hindering their responsiveness and scalability.
- Platform Incompatibility: Issues with platform-specific implementations could limit the portability of applications and create fragmentation within the Kotlin ecosystem.
- Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: Compromises in the build or distribution process could introduce malicious code into the library, affecting all users.
- Security Vulnerabilities: Security flaws in the library could be exploited by attackers to compromise applications using kotlinx.coroutines.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for the kotlinx.coroutines project:
- security control: GitHub code scanning is enabled, automatically scanning the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities. Implemented in: GitHub repository settings.
- security control: GitHub dependency scanning is enabled, alerting maintainers to known vulnerabilities in project dependencies. Implemented in: GitHub repository settings.
- security control: Code review process is in place, where pull requests are reviewed by maintainers before merging. Implemented in: Project development workflow.
- security control: Publicly accessible issue tracker for reporting bugs and potential security issues. Implemented in: GitHub issue tracker.

Accepted risks for the kotlinx.coroutines project:
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions, which may introduce unforeseen security vulnerabilities or coding errors.
- accepted risk: Open-source nature of the project, making the codebase publicly available for scrutiny by both security researchers and malicious actors.
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies that are beyond the direct control of the project maintainers.

Recommended security controls to implement:
- recommended security control: Implement automated security testing as part of the CI/CD pipeline, including SAST (Static Application Security Testing) and DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) tools.
- recommended security control: Establish a formal vulnerability disclosure policy and security contact to streamline the reporting and handling of security issues.
- recommended security control: Generate and publish a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for each release to enhance transparency and facilitate vulnerability management for users.
- recommended security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing by external security experts to identify and address potential weaknesses.

Security requirements for kotlinx.coroutines:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to a library. Authentication is the responsibility of applications using the library.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to a library. Authorization is the responsibility of applications using the library.
- Input Validation: Input validation is relevant for the kotlinx.coroutines API. The library should perform input validation to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes due to invalid or malicious inputs from developers using the library. This includes validating parameters passed to coroutine builders, channel operations, and other API functions.
- Cryptography: Cryptography is not a core requirement for kotlinx.coroutines. However, if the library were to introduce features that involve handling sensitive data or secure communication in the future, cryptography would become a relevant security requirement. Currently, it's not a primary concern.

Build Process Description:

1. Developer commits code changes to the Git repository (GitHub).
2. GitHub Actions CI is triggered by the code commit.
3. GitHub Actions sets up a secure Build Environment, typically using a Docker container with necessary build tools.
4. Git Checkout step retrieves the latest code from the Git repository.
5. Gradle Build step executes the Gradle build script to compile the Kotlin code, run unit tests, and generate build artifacts.
6. SAST Scanner step performs Static Application Security Testing to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase.
7. Publish Artifacts step uploads the generated build artifacts (JAR files, etc.) to the Package Registry (e.g., Maven Central).
8. Build Artifacts are stored in the Package Registry, ready for consumption.
9. Developer (Consumer) can then download kotlinx.coroutines as a dependency in their Kotlin projects from the Package Registry.

Security Controls in Build Process:
- security control: Secure Build Environment: Using isolated and hardened build environments (e.g., Docker containers) to prevent build process contamination. Implemented in: GitHub Actions workflows.
- security control: Automated Build Process: Fully automated build process using GitHub Actions to reduce manual intervention and potential errors. Implemented in: GitHub Actions workflows.
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Integration of SAST scanners to automatically detect potential security vulnerabilities in the code during the build process. Implemented in: GitHub Actions workflows (example: using CodeQL or similar tools).
- security control: Dependency Scanning: GitHub dependency scanning to identify vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by the project. Implemented in: GitHub dependency scanning feature.
- security control: Code Signing: Signing of build artifacts to ensure integrity and authenticity. (Potentially recommended, but not explicitly stated in the input).
- security control: Access Control: Restricting access to the build environment and CI/CD pipelines to authorized personnel. Implemented in: GitHub repository and GitHub Actions permissions.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:
- The integrity and availability of the kotlinx.coroutines library itself. This is critical because many Kotlin applications rely on it for core asynchronous functionalities. Any compromise or unavailability of the library can have a wide-reaching impact on the Kotlin ecosystem.
- The trust and reputation of the kotlinx.coroutines project and its maintainers. Security vulnerabilities or supply chain attacks can severely damage the project's reputation and erode user trust.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Source code of kotlinx.coroutines: Publicly available, but integrity is crucial. Modification by unauthorized parties or introduction of malicious code would be a high-impact security incident. Sensitivity: Public, Integrity: High.
- Build artifacts (JARs, etc.): Publicly distributed, but integrity and authenticity are paramount. Compromised artifacts could be distributed to a large number of developers and applications. Sensitivity: Public, Integrity: High, Authenticity: High.
- Build process and CI/CD pipeline configurations: Sensitive, as they control the build and release process. Compromise could lead to unauthorized code injection or supply chain attacks. Sensitivity: Confidential, Integrity: High.
- Secrets and credentials used in the build and release process (e.g., package registry credentials): Highly sensitive. Exposure could lead to unauthorized publishing or tampering with releases. Sensitivity: Highly Confidential, Integrity: High.
