# Attack Surface Analysis for zhanghai/materialfiles

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate file paths provided to the application to access files and directories outside the intended scope.
    *   **How MaterialFiles Contributes:** If the application uses `materialfiles` to handle file navigation or operations based on user input (e.g., selecting a destination folder, opening a file), and the library doesn't properly sanitize or validate these paths, it can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A user provides a path like `../../../../sensitive_data.txt` when asked to select a destination folder. If `materialfiles` directly uses this unsanitized input for file operations, it might access the sensitive file.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential data breaches, modification or deletion of critical files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all file paths received from user input or external sources *before* passing them to `materialfiles` or any file system operations. Use canonicalization techniques to resolve symbolic links and relative paths. Restrict file access to a specific directory or set of allowed directories.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure through File Listings](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_through_file_listings.md)

*   **Description:** The library displays file and directory listings, potentially revealing sensitive information about the file system structure or the existence of sensitive files.
    *   **How MaterialFiles Contributes:** `materialfiles` is designed to display file listings. If the application doesn't properly control which directories are accessible through the library, it could expose more information than intended.
    *   **Example:** An application uses `materialfiles` to allow users to browse files within their storage. If not configured correctly, a user might be able to navigate to directories containing sensitive application data or system files.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive file names, directory structures, and potentially file metadata.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Carefully configure the root directory and access permissions for `materialfiles`. Implement application-level authorization to restrict access to sensitive directories. Avoid displaying system or application-critical directories.
