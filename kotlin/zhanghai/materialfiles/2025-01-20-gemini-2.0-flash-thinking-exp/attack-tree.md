## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Path Traversal](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_path_traversal.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates file path inputs provided to MaterialFiles (e.g., through user input in a file selection dialog or via an API) to access files and directories outside the intended scope.
    *   **Critical Nodes Involved:**
        *   **Application fails to sanitize or validate file paths passed to MaterialFiles:** The application does not properly check and clean file paths before using them with MaterialFiles, allowing malicious paths to be processed.
        *   **MaterialFiles processes unsanitized paths:** MaterialFiles itself does not have sufficient internal checks to prevent access to unintended files when provided with unsanitized paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Filenames](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_filenames.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker introduces files with specially crafted names containing characters or sequences that exploit vulnerabilities in MaterialFiles' file processing logic.
    *   **Critical Nodes Involved:**
        *   **Application allows uploading or creating files with arbitrary names:** The application does not restrict the naming of uploaded or created files, allowing attackers to use malicious filenames.
        *   **MaterialFiles mishandles special characters or sequences in filenames:** MaterialFiles' code has weaknesses in how it handles certain characters or sequences within filenames, leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Insecure Default Configurations](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_insecure_default_configurations.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits security weaknesses present in MaterialFiles' default configuration settings.
    *   **Critical Nodes Involved:**
        *   **MaterialFiles has default settings that introduce security risks:** The default settings of MaterialFiles are not secure and can be easily exploited.
        *   **Application uses default MaterialFiles configuration without review:** The application developers fail to review and adjust MaterialFiles' configuration, leaving it in its insecure default state.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies (Indirectly through MaterialFiles)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies__indirectly_through_materialfiles_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries that MaterialFiles depends on.
    *   **Critical Nodes Involved:**
        *   **MaterialFiles relies on vulnerable third-party libraries:** MaterialFiles uses external libraries that have known security flaws.
        *   **Application includes the vulnerable version of MaterialFiles:** The application includes a version of MaterialFiles that uses the vulnerable dependencies.
