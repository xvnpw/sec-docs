# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for zhanghai/materialfiles

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict `materialfiles` API Usage (Least Privilege)](./mitigation_strategies/strict__materialfiles__api_usage__least_privilege_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **API Review:** Thoroughly examine the `materialfiles` API documentation. Identify *all* API calls currently used within your application.
2.  **Least Privilege Selection:** For *each* file operation, meticulously choose the *most restrictive* `materialfiles` API call that accomplishes the required functionality.
    *   Favor specific methods like `getFile()` or `getDirectory()` over broader methods.
    *   If you only need to *read* file metadata, use methods designed *only* for reading metadata, not methods that also allow writing.
    *   If an API offers options for restricting access (e.g., read-only mode), *always* use those options when write access is not strictly necessary.
3.  **Avoid Dangerous APIs:** Identify any `materialfiles` APIs that are marked as potentially dangerous or deprecated in the library's documentation.  Avoid these unless absolutely essential, and if used, implement extra precautions (see other mitigation strategies).
4. **Parameter Validation:** Even when using the *correct* API, validate *all* parameters passed to `materialfiles` functions. This includes file paths, file names, and any other data provided to the library. This prevents passing potentially malicious data that could exploit internal library vulnerabilities.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unintended File Access Permissions (High Severity):** Directly reduces the risk of the application using the library to access files in unintended ways due to developer error in choosing overly permissive API calls.
*   **Vulnerabilities within `materialfiles` (Variable Severity):** Mitigates the risk of exploits that rely on passing malicious input to vulnerable `materialfiles` API calls, or triggering unintended behavior through less-secure API choices.

**Impact:**
*   **Unintended File Access Permissions:** Risk moderately reduced (Medium Impact).  This is "moderate" because even with the correct API, underlying library bugs could still exist.
*   **Vulnerabilities within `materialfiles`:** Risk moderately to significantly reduced (Medium to High Impact), depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Currently Implemented:** *(Example - Needs to be filled in by the development team)*
*   Some effort has been made to use specific read methods in `FileViewerActivity`.

**Missing Implementation:** *(Example - Needs to be filled in by the development team)*
*   A comprehensive review of *all* `materialfiles` API usage across the entire project has not been conducted.
*   `FileManager.listFiles()` is used in several places where a more specific method (e.g., listing only directories or only files) could be used.
* No systematic validation of parameters passed to *all* `materialfiles` functions is in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation *Before* `materialfiles` API Calls](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_before__materialfiles__api_calls.md)

**Description:**
1. **Identify All Input Points:** Identify all points in your application where data (especially file paths, file names, or user-provided content that influences file operations) is received from *untrusted sources*. This includes user input, data from external storage, network data, etc.
2. **Pre-`materialfiles` Validation:** *Before* passing *any* data to *any* `materialfiles` API call, rigorously validate and sanitize that data. This is crucial, even if you are using the "correct" API calls from the previous strategy.
    *   **Path Traversal Prevention:** Explicitly check for and reject any input containing path traversal sequences (e.g., "..", "//", potentially encoded versions).
    *   **Whitelist Characters:** Define a strict whitelist of allowed characters for file names and path components. Reject any input containing characters outside this whitelist.
    *   **Canonicalization:** Use `File.getCanonicalPath()` to resolve the path to its canonical form *before* passing it to *any* `materialfiles` function. This handles symbolic links and relative paths securely, preventing bypasses of other checks.
    * **Regular Expressions:** Employ regular expressions to enforce a specific, safe structure for file paths and names.
3. **Fail Securely:** If validation fails, *do not* proceed with the `materialfiles` operation. Log the error, inform the user appropriately (without revealing sensitive information), and handle the error gracefully.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unintended File Access Permissions (High Severity):** Prevents the application from being tricked into using `materialfiles` to access files outside of intended boundaries due to malicious input.
*   **Vulnerabilities within `materialfiles` (Variable Severity):** A *critical* defense against exploits that rely on passing crafted, malicious input (e.g., specially formatted file paths) to `materialfiles` API calls. This is your first line of defense against many potential library vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**
*   **Unintended File Access Permissions:** Risk significantly reduced (High Impact).
*   **Vulnerabilities within `materialfiles`:** Risk significantly reduced (High Impact). This is arguably the *most important* mitigation for library-specific vulnerabilities.

**Currently Implemented:** *(Example - Needs to be filled in by the development team)*
*   Basic null and empty string checks are performed in some areas.

**Missing Implementation:** *(Example - Needs to be filled in by the development team)*
*   No comprehensive input validation is performed *before* *every* `materialfiles` API call.
*   No whitelisting of characters is implemented.
*   No explicit checks for path traversal sequences are consistently performed.
*   Canonicalization is not used universally before calling `materialfiles` functions.
* Regular expressions validation is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [File Operation Timeouts (Within `materialfiles` Context)](./mitigation_strategies/file_operation_timeouts__within__materialfiles__context_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Long-Running Operations:** Identify any `materialfiles` API calls that could potentially take a significant amount of time to complete (e.g., listing a directory with a very large number of files, copying a large file).
2.  **Implement Timeouts:** Wrap calls to these potentially long-running `materialfiles` APIs within timeout mechanisms.
    *   Use `java.util.concurrent` classes (e.g., `ExecutorService`, `Future`, `Callable`) to execute the `materialfiles` operation in a separate thread.
    *   Set a reasonable timeout value for the operation.
    *   Use `Future.get(timeout, unit)` to retrieve the result of the operation, waiting only for the specified timeout.
3.  **Handle `TimeoutException`:**  Catch `TimeoutException` and handle it gracefully.  This might involve:
    *   Cancelling the underlying `materialfiles` operation (if the API supports cancellation).
    *   Logging the timeout.
    *   Displaying an appropriate error message to the user.
    *   Retrying the operation (with caution, and potentially with a longer timeout, up to a maximum limit).
4. **Consider `materialfiles`'s own timeout mechanisms:** Check if the `materialfiles` library *itself* provides any built-in timeout mechanisms for its operations. If so, use those in addition to your own timeouts.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from causing a denial-of-service by triggering `materialfiles` operations that consume excessive resources or take an extremely long time to complete.
*   **Vulnerabilities within `materialfiles` (Variable Severity):** Some vulnerabilities might only be exploitable under specific timing conditions or with very long operations. Timeouts can help mitigate these.

**Impact:**
*   **Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion:** Risk significantly reduced (High Impact).
*   **Vulnerabilities within `materialfiles`:** Risk moderately reduced (Medium Impact).

**Currently Implemented:** *(Example - Needs to be filled in by the development team)*
*   No timeouts are currently implemented for any `materialfiles` operations.

**Missing Implementation:** *(Example - Needs to be filled in by the development team)*
*   Timeouts need to be implemented for all potentially long-running `materialfiles` API calls, especially those involving listing directories, copying files, or performing other I/O-intensive operations.
