# Threat Model Analysis for zhanghai/materialfiles

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Crafted Filename (in `materialfiles`)](./threats/path_traversal_via_crafted_filename__in__materialfiles__.md)

*   **Description:** `materialfiles` itself contains a vulnerability in its path handling logic.  Even if the embedding application *attempts* to sanitize input, a flaw in how `materialfiles` internally processes filenames (e.g., insufficient validation, incorrect normalization, or a bypass of existing checks) allows an attacker to craft a filename that causes `materialfiles` to access files outside the intended directory. This is a vulnerability *within* the library.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential data leakage, system compromise (if the attacker can access and execute system files).
    *   **Affected Component:**  `PathUtils` (or similar module) within `materialfiles`; functions like `resolvePath()`, `normalizePath()`, or any function that takes a user-provided string and uses it to construct a filesystem path *without* proper, independent validation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Patch `materialfiles`:** The primary mitigation is to update to a patched version of `materialfiles` that fixes the vulnerability.  This is the responsibility of the `materialfiles` maintainers.
        *   **Contribute a Fix:** If a patch is not available, and you have the expertise, consider contributing a fix to the `materialfiles` project.
        *   **Temporary Workaround (If Possible):**  As a *temporary* workaround, you might be able to intercept calls to the vulnerable `materialfiles` functions and implement your *own* robust path validation *before* passing the data to `materialfiles`.  This is risky and should only be done as a last resort.  It requires a deep understanding of the vulnerability and the `materialfiles` API.  It is *not* a substitute for patching the library.
        *   **Limit Exposure:** Reduce the attack surface by limiting the ways in which user-provided input can influence file paths used by `materialfiles`.

## Threat: [Symlink Attack (due to `materialfiles` vulnerability)](./threats/symlink_attack__due_to__materialfiles__vulnerability_.md)

*   **Description:** `materialfiles` has a vulnerability in how it handles symbolic links.  It might follow symlinks without properly checking the target, or it might have a flaw in its symlink checking logic that allows an attacker to bypass the checks. This is a vulnerability *within* the library's handling of symlinks.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential data leakage, or system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:**  The file I/O module within `materialfiles`, specifically functions that handle file operations (reading, writing, deleting) and interact with the filesystem. Functions like `openFile()`, `readFile()`, `writeFile()`, etc., if they don't correctly handle symlinks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Patch `materialfiles`:** Update to a patched version of the library that addresses the symlink handling vulnerability.
        *   **Contribute a Fix:** If no patch is available, consider contributing a fix to the `materialfiles` project.
        *   **Temporary Workaround (Difficult):**  A temporary workaround is *very* difficult and risky in this case.  You would need to essentially re-implement the file I/O logic of `materialfiles` to safely handle symlinks, which is highly error-prone.  It's generally *not* recommended.
        *   **Disable Symlink Support (If Possible):** If the application using `materialfiles` does *not* require symlink support, and if `materialfiles` provides a way to disable it completely, do so. This eliminates the vulnerability. This is the best workaround if feasible.

## Threat: [File Content Injection via Upload (due to `materialfiles` vulnerability)](./threats/file_content_injection_via_upload__due_to__materialfiles__vulnerability_.md)

*   **Description:** `materialfiles`'s built-in file upload handling has a vulnerability that allows bypassing file type checks or other security measures. This is *not* about the embedding application's misuse, but a flaw *within* the library's upload mechanism. For example, `materialfiles` might rely solely on the file extension, or have a flawed implementation of its content-based type detection.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution on the server (if the uploaded file is a script that gets executed), cross-site scripting (XSS) if the uploaded file is an HTML file served by the web server, or exploitation of vulnerabilities in other applications.
    *   **Affected Component:** The file upload component within `materialfiles`, including functions related to handling file uploads, storing files, and potentially setting file permissions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on how `materialfiles` is used)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Patch `materialfiles`:** The primary mitigation is to update to a patched version of `materialfiles` that fixes the vulnerability in its upload handling.
        *   **Contribute a Fix:** If a patch is not available, consider contributing a fix to the `materialfiles` project.
        *   **Temporary Workaround (If Possible):** If `materialfiles` exposes the upload handling functions, you *might* be able to intercept the calls and implement your own file type validation and sanitization *before* the data is processed by `materialfiles`. This is risky and requires careful implementation. It's *not* a replacement for patching the library.
        * **Disable Uploads (If Possible):** If the application using `materialfiles` does not require the upload functionality *provided by materialfiles*, disable that feature within `materialfiles` if possible. If the application needs upload functionality, implement it *separately* from `materialfiles`, using secure practices.
