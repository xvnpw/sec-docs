# Attack Surface Analysis for zhanghai/materialfiles

## Attack Surface: [Broad File System Access](./attack_surfaces/broad_file_system_access.md)

*   **Description:** Access to the device's file system beyond the application's private storage.
    *   **`materialfiles` Contribution:** The library's core function is file browsing and management, requiring broad file system permissions.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a separate vulnerability in the app to read arbitrary files on the SD card, leveraging `materialfiles`'s granted `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive user data (photos, documents, etc.), potential data modification or deletion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Request *only* the minimum necessary file system permissions.  Prioritize scoped storage and SAF.
            *   Implement robust input validation to prevent path traversal attacks.
            *   Regularly audit permission usage and remove unnecessary permissions.
        *   **User:**
            *   Be cautious about granting broad file system permissions to any application.
            *   Monitor app permissions and revoke unnecessary ones.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Intent Handling](./attack_surfaces/malicious_intent_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from insecure handling of Android Intents used for file operations.
    *   **`materialfiles` Contribution:** The library likely uses Intents to open, share, and manage files, creating potential entry points for malicious Intents.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious Intent that targets the app, causing it to share a sensitive file with the attacker's app without user consent.
    *   **Impact:** Data leakage, unauthorized file sharing, potential for triggering vulnerabilities in other applications.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Use explicit Intents whenever possible.
            *   Thoroughly validate all incoming Intent data (action, data, type, extras).
            *   Implement strict checks on the sender of the Intent.
            *   Avoid blindly trusting data from external sources within Intents.
        *   **User:**
            *   Be aware of apps that request broad Intent-related permissions. (This is less directly controllable by the user).

## Attack Surface: [Symbolic Link (Symlink) Attacks](./attack_surfaces/symbolic_link__symlink__attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting improper handling of symbolic links to access files or directories outside the intended scope.
    *   **`materialfiles` Contribution:** The library needs to handle symlinks when navigating the file system.
    *   **Example:** An attacker creates a symlink in a publicly accessible directory that points to a sensitive file within the app's private storage.  `materialfiles`, if not handling symlinks correctly, might follow this link and expose the sensitive file.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential for data modification or deletion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Explicitly decide whether to follow symlinks. If not needed, disable them.
            *   If symlinks *must* be followed, validate the target path *after* resolving the symlink to ensure it's within allowed boundaries.
            *   Use canonical path resolution to prevent relative path traversal.
        *   **User:**
            *   No direct user mitigation, relies on developer best practices.
