## Attack Tree Path: [Unauthorized File/Directory Access (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/unauthorized_filedirectory_access__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Critical Node: Path Traversal**
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates file paths provided to the `materialfiles` library to access files or directories outside of the intended, restricted directory. This is often done by injecting ".." (parent directory) sequences or other special characters into the path.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Strictly validate and sanitize all file paths.
        *   Use a whitelist approach for allowed characters in paths.
        *   Canonicalize paths before using them.
        *   Avoid using user-provided input directly in file paths.
        *   Thoroughly test for path traversal vulnerabilities using fuzzing and manual testing.

    *   **(High-Risk Path) Critical Node: Read Outside Allowed**
        *   **Description:** A specific instance of Path Traversal where the attacker successfully reads the content of a file outside the allowed directory.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:** Same as Path Traversal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/arbitrary_code_execution__ace___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Critical Node: Native Code Interface (JNI) Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)**
    *   **Description:** If `materialfiles` uses JNI to interact with native code (C/C++), vulnerabilities in the native code (e.g., buffer overflows, use-after-free, integer overflows) can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution. This is a very high-risk area.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Thoroughly audit all JNI code.
        *   Use memory safety tools (AddressSanitizer, Valgrind).
        *   Consider rewriting critical JNI code in a memory-safe language (e.g., Rust).
        *   Apply rigorous input validation to data passed to JNI functions.
        *   Fuzz test the JNI interface extensively.

    *   **(High-Risk Path) Exploit JNI to Load Arbitrary Library**
        *   **Description:** An attacker leverages a JNI vulnerability to load a malicious shared library (.so file on Android) into the application's process. This gives the attacker full control.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** High
        *   **Skill Level:** Expert
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
        *   **Mitigation:** Same as JNI Vulnerabilities, with a focus on preventing library loading.

    *   **(High-Risk Path) Exploit JNI to Call Arbitrary System Function**
        *   **Description:** An attacker uses a JNI vulnerability to directly call a dangerous system function (e.g., `system()`, `execve()`) with attacker-controlled arguments. This also leads to complete compromise.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Very High
        *   **Skill Level:** Expert
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
        *   **Mitigation:** Same as JNI Vulnerabilities, with a focus on preventing arbitrary function calls.

* **Critical Node: Unsafe Deserialization of Untrusted Data**
    *   **Description:** If the library deserializes data from untrusted sources (files, network, user input) without proper validation, an attacker can craft malicious serialized data to execute arbitrary code upon deserialization.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Avoid unsafe deserialization mechanisms if possible.
        *   Use safer alternatives like JSON with schema validation.
        *   If using Java's `ObjectInputStream`, implement strict whitelisting of allowed classes.
        *   Thoroughly validate any data before deserialization.
