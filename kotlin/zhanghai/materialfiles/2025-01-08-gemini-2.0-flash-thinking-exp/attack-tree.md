## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities in MaterialFiles [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_input_validation_vulnerabilities_in_materialfiles__critical_.md)

*   This is a critical node because vulnerabilities in input validation are a common entry point for attackers and can lead to various high-impact attacks.

    *   **1.1 Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerability in File Browsing/Download [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** `materialfiles` might not properly sanitize or validate user-provided file paths.
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            *   Craft a malicious URL or API request containing a manipulated file path (e.g., `/files/../../../../etc/passwd`).
            *   Send this request to the application.
            *   If `materialfiles` doesn't sanitize, it attempts to access the unintended file.
        *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files.
            *   **1.1.1 Manipulate File Paths to Access Sensitive Application Files [CRITICAL]**
                *   This node represents the successful exploitation of path traversal to reach sensitive application files.
                *   **1.1.1.1 Read Configuration Files Containing Secrets [CRITICAL]**
                    *   **Description:** Accessing configuration files exposes critical secrets like database credentials and API keys.
                    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of backend systems and data.

    *   **1.2 Exploit Filename Handling Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** `materialfiles` might not properly sanitize or encode filenames when displaying them.
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            *   Upload a file with a malicious filename (e.g., `<script>alert("XSS")</script>.txt`).
            *   If `materialfiles` renders this filename without encoding, the script executes.
        *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
            *   **1.2.1 Inject Malicious Filenames (e.g., with XSS payloads) [CRITICAL]**
                *   This node represents the successful injection of a malicious filename.
                *   **1.2.1.1 Execute Arbitrary JavaScript in User's Browser When Viewing File List [CRITICAL]**
                    *   **Description:** The injected JavaScript executes in the user's browser.
                    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, malicious actions on behalf of the user.

    *   **1.3 Exploit File Content Handling Vulnerabilities (if preview functionality exists)**
        *   **Description:** If `materialfiles` previews file content, it might not sanitize malicious content.
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            *   Upload a file with malicious content (e.g., an SVG with `<script>...</script>`).
            *   If `materialfiles` renders this content without sanitization, the script executes.
        *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
            *   **1.3.1 Inject Malicious Code via File Content (e.g., SVG with embedded scripts) [CRITICAL]**
                *   This node represents the successful injection of malicious code within a file.
                *   **1.3.1.1 Execute Arbitrary Code in User's Browser [CRITICAL]**
                    *   **Description:** The malicious code within the file executes in the user's browser.
                    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, malicious actions on behalf of the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Dependencies of MaterialFiles (Indirectly)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_dependencies_of_materialfiles__indirectly_.md)

*   **Description:** `materialfiles` relies on other libraries, which might have vulnerabilities.
*   **2.1 Gain Control through Compromised Dependency [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** Exploiting a known vulnerability in a dependency used by `materialfiles`.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        *   Identify dependencies used by `materialfiles`.
        *   Check for known vulnerabilities in those dependencies.
        *   Exploit the vulnerability through `materialfiles`'s functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) or other severe compromises depending on the vulnerability.
