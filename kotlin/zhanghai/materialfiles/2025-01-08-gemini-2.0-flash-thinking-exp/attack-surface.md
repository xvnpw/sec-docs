# Attack Surface Analysis for zhanghai/materialfiles

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unsanitized File Names/Metadata](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_unsanitized_file_namesmetadata.md)

*   **Description:** If the application provides `materialfiles` with file names or metadata containing unescaped HTML or JavaScript, this script can be executed in other users' browsers when `materialfiles` renders the information.
    *   **How MaterialFiles Contributes:** `materialfiles` directly renders the file names and metadata it receives. Without proper sanitization by the application, malicious scripts can be injected and executed within the context of the user's session.
    *   **Example:** An application allows uploading files. A malicious user uploads a file named `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>.txt`. When another user views the file list through `materialfiles`, the browser executes the JavaScript in the file name.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, execution of arbitrary code in the user's browser.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  **Critically important:**  Strictly sanitize and encode all file names and metadata on the server-side *before* providing them to `materialfiles`. Use appropriate output encoding mechanisms provided by the templating engine or framework used in the application. Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful XSS.

## Attack Surface: [Reliance on Client-Side Permissions/Access Control (when directly reflected in MaterialFiles)](./attack_surfaces/reliance_on_client-side_permissionsaccess_control__when_directly_reflected_in_materialfiles_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application's access control mechanism solely relies on `materialfiles` to hide or show files based on client-side logic, this can be easily bypassed by manipulating the client-side code. While the core flaw is in the application's architecture, `materialfiles` becomes the point of exploitation.
    *   **How MaterialFiles Contributes:**  If the application provides data to `materialfiles` indicating which files to show or hide based on client-side checks, a malicious user can modify the client-side code or data to reveal files they shouldn't have access to.
    *   **Example:** The application provides a list of visible files to `materialfiles`. A user modifies the JavaScript code to remove the filtering logic, causing `materialfiles` to display all files, including those intended to be hidden.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files and information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** **Never rely on client-side logic for access control.** Implement and enforce all authorization and access control mechanisms on the server-side. `materialfiles` should only display the files that the server has already determined the user has permission to access. The server should be the single source of truth for access control.
