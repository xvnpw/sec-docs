**Key Attack Surface List (High & Critical, Sunflower Specific):**

*   **SQL Injection via Custom Plant Input:**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker injects malicious SQL code into input fields, potentially manipulating database queries.
    *   **How Sunflower Contributes:** If Sunflower allows users to input data (e.g., plant names, descriptions) that is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or using parameterized queries, it creates this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A user enters a plant name like: `' OR '1'='1`; --  This could bypass authentication or retrieve unintended data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (accessing sensitive plant data, user notes), data modification (altering existing records), or even potential denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Use Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  This is the primary defense against SQL injection. Treat user input as data, not executable code.
            *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and sanitize potentially dangerous characters.
            *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the database user the application uses has only the necessary permissions.

*   **Insecure Deserialization (If Applicable):**
    *   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the deserialization process of objects, potentially leading to remote code execution.
    *   **How Sunflower Contributes:** If Sunflower uses serialization (e.g., for saving application state or transferring data) and doesn't properly secure the deserialization process, it could be vulnerable. This is less likely in a typical Sunflower implementation but worth considering if custom serialization is used.
    *   **Example:** A malicious actor crafts a serialized object containing malicious code. When Sunflower deserializes this object, the code is executed.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain control of the device.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data:**  The best defense is to avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources.
            *   **Use Safe Serialization Mechanisms:**  Consider using safer data formats like JSON or protocol buffers instead of Java serialization.
            *   **Implement Deserialization Filters:**  If deserialization is necessary, use filters to restrict the classes that can be deserialized.
