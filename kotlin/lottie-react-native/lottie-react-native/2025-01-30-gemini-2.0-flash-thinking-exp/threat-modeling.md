# Threat Model Analysis for lottie-react-native/lottie-react-native

## Threat: [Malicious Lottie File Exploitation (Potential for Critical Impact)](./threats/malicious_lottie_file_exploitation__potential_for_critical_impact_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious Lottie file specifically designed to exploit parsing or rendering vulnerabilities within the `lottie-react-native` library's native components. This file, when processed by `LottieView`, could trigger unexpected behavior. Attackers might deliver this file by compromising servers hosting Lottie animations or through social engineering to trick users into uploading or providing malicious files.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical - Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Hypothetical but possible in native modules):** In a worst-case scenario, a parsing vulnerability in the native Lottie rendering libraries (used by `lottie-react-native`) could be exploited to achieve remote code execution on the user's device. This would allow the attacker to gain full control over the application and potentially the device.
    *   **High - Denial of Service (DoS):** The malicious file could reliably crash the application or cause it to become completely unresponsive, effectively denying service to legitimate users.
    *   **High - Client-Side Resource Exhaustion:** The file could be designed to consume excessive CPU, memory, or battery, rendering the application unusable and significantly degrading the user experience.
*   **Affected Component:** `LottieView` component, specifically the native parsing and rendering engine.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature of the exploitable vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Prioritize Regular Updates:**  Immediately apply updates to `lottie-react-native` as soon as they are released. Security patches are crucial for mitigating known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** If Lottie files are loaded from external sources or user input, implement robust validation to ensure they conform to the expected Lottie JSON schema and do not contain excessively complex or unusual structures. Consider using a dedicated Lottie schema validator.
    *   **Resource Limits and Monitoring:** Implement safeguards to limit the resources consumed by Lottie animations. Monitor resource usage and consider implementing mechanisms to terminate or throttle animations that consume excessive resources.
    *   **Secure Lottie File Sources:**  If fetching Lottie files dynamically, ensure they are loaded from trusted and secure sources over HTTPS. Verify the integrity of the source and consider using Content Security Policy (CSP) if loading within WebViews.
    *   **Consider Static Analysis:** Explore using static analysis tools that can analyze Lottie files for potentially malicious patterns or excessive complexity before they are loaded into the application.

## Threat: [Abuse of Complex Lottie Animations for Client-Side Denial of Service (High Impact)](./threats/abuse_of_complex_lottie_animations_for_client-side_denial_of_service__high_impact_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intentionally provides or injects extremely large and computationally complex Lottie animations. While not necessarily exploiting a vulnerability, these animations are designed to overwhelm the rendering capabilities of `lottie-react-native` and the user's device. This could be done to disrupt application functionality or degrade user experience.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High - Denial of Service (Client-Side):** The application becomes unusable due to extreme slowness, unresponsiveness, or crashes caused by the rendering of overly complex animations.
    *   **High - Severe Performance Degradation:**  Even if the application doesn't crash, the performance becomes so poor that it is effectively unusable, leading to a very negative user experience.
    *   **High - Battery Exhaustion:** On mobile devices, rendering extremely complex animations can rapidly drain the battery, impacting device usability.
*   **Affected Component:** `LottieView` component, specifically the rendering engine's performance under heavy load.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Establish and Enforce Animation Complexity Limits:** Define clear guidelines and technical limits for the complexity of Lottie animations used in the application. This includes limits on the number of layers, shapes, effects, animation duration, and file size.
    *   **Performance Testing and Optimization:** Conduct thorough performance testing with a variety of Lottie animations, including deliberately complex ones, to identify performance bottlenecks and establish realistic complexity limits. Optimize animation assets where possible.
    *   **Lazy Loading and Caching:** Implement lazy loading for Lottie animations, ensuring they are only loaded and rendered when they are actually needed and visible to the user. Cache animations aggressively to avoid redundant processing.
    *   **Progressive Loading/Streaming (If Available):** Investigate if `lottie-react-native` or underlying libraries support progressive loading or streaming of Lottie animations to improve perceived performance and reduce the impact of large animations.
    *   **User Feedback and Reporting:** Implement mechanisms for users to report performance issues related to animations. This can help identify problematic animations and usage patterns.
