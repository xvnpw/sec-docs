# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Enhance user experience in React Native applications by enabling the rendering of high-quality, performant Lottie animations.
 - Simplify the integration of complex vector animations into mobile applications, reducing development time and effort compared to traditional animation methods.
 - Improve user engagement and visual appeal of applications, leading to increased user satisfaction and retention.
 - Provide a cross-platform solution for Lottie animations, ensuring consistent animation rendering across both iOS and Android platforms.

- Business Risks:
 - Dependency on an open-source library introduces potential risks related to library maintenance, security vulnerabilities, and community support.
 - Performance issues related to animation rendering, especially on lower-end devices, could negatively impact user experience.
 - Compatibility issues with future versions of React Native or underlying platform updates could require ongoing maintenance and updates to the library.
 - Potential security vulnerabilities within the Lottie animation parsing or rendering logic could be exploited by malicious animation files.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Reliance on React Native framework security features. Implemented by: React Native framework. Described in: React Native security documentation.
 - security control: Operating system level security controls provided by iOS and Android. Implemented by: iOS and Android operating systems. Described in: iOS and Android security documentation.
 - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by the library. Accepted risk description: Open-source libraries may contain undiscovered vulnerabilities.
 - accepted risk: Potential for denial-of-service attacks through maliciously crafted animation files that consume excessive resources. Accepted risk description: Complex animations might be resource intensive.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement dependency scanning to identify and address known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by `lottie-react-native`.
 - security control: Regularly update dependencies to incorporate security patches and bug fixes.
 - security control: Conduct security testing, including fuzzing and static analysis, to identify potential vulnerabilities in the library's code, especially in animation parsing and rendering logic.
 - security control: Implement input validation on animation data to prevent processing of maliciously crafted or unexpected animation structures.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication: Not directly applicable to the `lottie-react-native` library itself, as it is a rendering component. Authentication is the responsibility of the application using the library.
 - Authorization: Not directly applicable to the `lottie-react-native` library itself. Authorization is the responsibility of the application using the library to control access to animations or application features.
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement: The library must validate the structure and content of Lottie animation data to prevent processing of malicious or malformed files.
  - Requirement: Input validation should protect against common injection attacks and denial-of-service attempts through oversized or overly complex animation data.
  - Requirement: Error handling for invalid animation data should be robust and prevent application crashes or unexpected behavior.
 - Cryptography: Not directly applicable to the core functionality of `lottie-react-native`. Cryptography might be relevant if applications using the library load animations from encrypted sources, but this is outside the scope of the library itself.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Rendering animations within React Native applications to enhance user experience and visual appeal.
 - Providing a stable and reliable animation library for React Native developers.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - Lottie animation files: Sensitivity depends on the source and content of the animations. Publicly available animations have low sensitivity. Custom or proprietary animations might contain intellectual property and have medium to high sensitivity.
 - Source code of `lottie-react-native`: Medium sensitivity. Protecting the integrity and confidentiality of the source code is important to prevent unauthorized modifications or disclosure of intellectual property.
 - Build artifacts (npm package): Medium sensitivity. Ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the published npm package is crucial to prevent supply chain attacks and ensure users are downloading a safe and legitimate library.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
 - What is the intended use case for applications using `lottie-react-native` in terms of data sensitivity? Are these applications handling highly sensitive user data?
 - Are there specific performance requirements for animation rendering in target applications?
 - What is the process for sourcing Lottie animation files? Are they always from trusted sources, or could applications potentially load animations from untrusted or user-provided sources?
 - What is the current level of security testing performed on `lottie-react-native`? Are there regular dependency scans or security audits?

- Assumptions:
 - The primary goal of using `lottie-react-native` is to improve user interface aesthetics and user engagement in React Native applications.
 - Security concerns are mainly focused on preventing vulnerabilities that could lead to application crashes, denial-of-service, or potentially code execution through malicious animation files.
 - The library itself does not directly handle sensitive user data, but applications using it might.
 - The development and build process for `lottie-react-native` follows standard open-source software development practices, including version control and automated builds.
