# Attack Surface Analysis for lottie-react-native/lottie-react-native

## Attack Surface: [1. Malicious Lottie JSON Files](./attack_surfaces/1__malicious_lottie_json_files.md)

*   **Description:** Loading and processing untrusted Lottie JSON files can expose the application to attacks due to vulnerabilities in parsing or rendering malicious animation data.
*   **How lottie-react-native contributes:** `lottie-react-native` is designed to render Lottie animations from JSON files. If the application loads files from untrusted sources, it directly utilizes this potentially vulnerable input.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides a Lottie JSON file with deeply nested structures that, when parsed by `lottie-react-native` or its underlying JSON library, causes excessive CPU usage, leading to application freeze and denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential resource exhaustion, and in theoretical scenarios, potentially code execution if severe parsing vulnerabilities exist in underlying libraries.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement checks on Lottie JSON files before loading, such as file size limits and basic schema validation if feasible.
    *   **Trusted Sources:**  Prioritize loading Lottie animations from secure, controlled sources within the application bundle or trusted backend APIs.

## Attack Surface: [2. Remote Animation Loading from Untrusted URLs](./attack_surfaces/2__remote_animation_loading_from_untrusted_urls.md)

*   **Description:** Loading Lottie animations from remote URLs, especially if user-provided or from untrusted sources, introduces risks of Man-in-the-Middle attacks and serving malicious content.
*   **How lottie-react-native contributes:** `lottie-react-native` allows specifying animation sources via URLs, enabling remote loading. This feature, if misused, expands the attack surface.
*   **Example:** An application loads a Lottie animation from an HTTP URL provided by a user. An attacker performs a MitM attack, intercepting the request and replacing the legitimate Lottie file with a malicious one designed to cause a DoS when rendered by `lottie-react-native`.
*   **Impact:** Man-in-the-Middle attacks, serving malicious Lottie files leading to DoS or other vulnerabilities, potential phishing or social engineering risks.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **HTTPS Only:**  Enforce loading Lottie animations exclusively from HTTPS URLs to ensure encrypted communication and prevent MitM attacks.
    *   **URL Validation and Sanitization:**  Rigorous validation and sanitization of URLs from user input or external sources to prevent manipulation and ensure they point to trusted domains.

## Attack Surface: [3. JSON Parsing Vulnerabilities in Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/3__json_parsing_vulnerabilities_in_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the JSON parsing libraries used by `lottie-react-native` or its dependencies can be exploited through crafted Lottie JSON files.
*   **How lottie-react-native contributes:** `lottie-react-native` relies on JSON parsing to process animation data, indirectly depending on the security of these parsing libraries.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability exists in the underlying JSON parsing library used by `lottie-react-native`. A malicious Lottie JSON file is crafted to trigger this vulnerability, leading to a buffer overflow and application crash.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential application crashes, and in theoretical scenarios, potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Updates:** Regularly update `lottie-react-native` and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities in JSON parsing libraries.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:**  Utilize dependency scanning tools to proactively identify and address known vulnerabilities in `lottie-react-native`'s dependency tree.

## Attack Surface: [4. Resource Exhaustion during Animation Rendering](./attack_surfaces/4__resource_exhaustion_during_animation_rendering.md)

*   **Description:** Rendering overly complex or maliciously crafted animations can consume excessive device resources, leading to Denial of Service.
*   **How lottie-react-native contributes:** `lottie-react-native` is responsible for rendering animations. Complex animations, especially those designed to be resource-intensive, can strain device resources through this library.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides a Lottie animation with an extremely high number of layers and complex effects. When `lottie-react-native` attempts to render this animation, it consumes all available CPU and memory, causing the application to become unresponsive or crash, especially on lower-end devices.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application slowdowns, crashes, and negative user experience.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Animation Complexity Limits:**  Establish guidelines or limits on the complexity of animations used in the application (e.g., maximum layers, shapes, effects).
    *   **Performance Testing:**  Thoroughly test the application with various Lottie animations, including complex ones, to identify performance bottlenecks and resource usage issues.

## Attack Surface: [5. Rendering Engine Vulnerabilities (Underlying Native Libraries)](./attack_surfaces/5__rendering_engine_vulnerabilities__underlying_native_libraries_.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs or vulnerabilities in the native rendering engines used by `lottie-react-native` (platform-specific) can be exploited through crafted animations.
*   **How lottie-react-native contributes:** `lottie-react-native` relies on native rendering engines for animation display, inheriting any vulnerabilities present in these underlying systems.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability exists in the native graphics rendering library on a specific Android version. A crafted Lottie animation, when processed by `lottie-react-native` and rendered by the vulnerable native library, triggers a crash in the rendering engine.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application crashes, potential memory corruption or other platform-specific vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Operating System Updates:** Encourage users to keep their operating systems (iOS and Android) updated to receive security patches for native libraries.
    *   **lottie-react-native Updates:** Regularly update `lottie-react-native` as updates may incorporate fixes or workarounds for issues in underlying native rendering components.
