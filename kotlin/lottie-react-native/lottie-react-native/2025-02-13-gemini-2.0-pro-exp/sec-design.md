# Project Design Document: lottie-react-native

## BUSINESS POSTURE

*   Priorities and Goals:
    *   Provide a React Native component for rendering Lottie animations.
    *   Maintain high performance and smooth animations.
    *   Ensure compatibility across different React Native versions and platforms (iOS and Android).
    *   Provide an easy-to-use API for developers.
    *   Maintain a vibrant and active open-source community.

*   Business Risks:
    *   Performance issues or crashes leading to poor user experience in applications using the library.
    *   Compatibility issues with specific React Native versions or device configurations, limiting adoption.
    *   Security vulnerabilities that could be exploited in applications using the library.
    *   Lack of maintainer support, leading to unresolved issues and stagnation of the project.
    *   Competition from alternative animation libraries.

## SECURITY POSTURE

*   Existing Security Controls:
    *   security control: The project uses automated builds and tests via GitHub Actions. (Workflows in `.github/workflows`)
    *   security control: Dependency management using npm/yarn, with potential for vulnerability scanning tools to be integrated.
    *   security control: Code style and linting checks are enforced. (eslint configuration)
    *   security control: Basic example app showcasing usage.

*   Accepted Risks:
    *   accepted risk: The library relies on third-party native Lottie libraries (lottie-ios and lottie-android), inheriting any potential vulnerabilities from those dependencies.
    *   accepted risk: Limited built-in input validation, relying on developers to sanitize animation data.
    *   accepted risk: No formal security audits or penetration testing have been conducted.

*   Recommended Security Controls:
    *   security control: Integrate a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot) to automatically scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   security control: Implement robust input validation to prevent loading malicious Lottie files. This could involve checking file size limits, supported features, and potentially using a schema validator.
    *   security control: Conduct a security review of the native bridge code to identify potential vulnerabilities related to data handling and inter-process communication.
    *   security control: Establish a security policy and vulnerability disclosure process for the project.
    *   security control: Consider adding fuzz testing to test the resilience of the library against malformed input.

*   Security Requirements:

    *   Authentication: Not directly applicable, as the library itself doesn't handle authentication.
    *   Authorization: Not directly applicable.
    *   Input Validation:
        *   The library should validate the input Lottie JSON to ensure it conforms to expected size and structure limitations.
        *   The library should handle potentially malicious or malformed Lottie files gracefully, without crashing or exposing the application to vulnerabilities.
    *   Cryptography: Not directly applicable, unless the library is used to handle encrypted Lottie files (which is not a standard feature).

### DEPLOYMENT

Possible deployment scenarios:

1.  **Bundled with React Native Application:** The most common scenario. The library is included as a dependency in the React Native application, and the native code is linked during the application build process.
2.  **Development Environment:** Developers clone the repository and link it locally to their React Native project for development and testing.

### BUILD

The build process for lottie-react-native involves several steps, primarily managed by npm/yarn and automated through GitHub Actions:

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"]
    GitHubRepository["GitHub Repository"]
    GitHubActions["GitHub Actions"]
    BuildArtifacts["Build Artifacts (npm package)"]
    NPMRegistry["NPM Registry"]

    Developer -- Pushes code --> GitHubRepository
    GitHubRepository -- Triggers --> GitHubActions
    GitHubActions -- Runs tests, lints, builds --> BuildArtifacts
    GitHubActions -- Publishes --> NPMRegistry
```

*   Build Process Description:

    1.  **Code Commit:** A developer commits code changes to the GitHub repository.
    2.  **GitHub Actions Trigger:** The commit triggers a GitHub Actions workflow (defined in `.github/workflows`).
    3.  **Environment Setup:** The workflow sets up the build environment (e.g., Node.js version, dependencies).
    4.  **Linting:** Code linters (e.g., ESLint) are run to check for code style and potential errors.
    5.  **Testing:** Unit tests and potentially integration tests are executed.
    6.  **Build:** The JavaScript code is transpiled (if necessary), and the native code is compiled (for iOS and Android). This typically involves using tools like `react-native-builder-bob`.
    7.  **Packaging:** The built code is packaged into an npm package.
    8.  **Publish (Optional):** If the workflow is configured for publishing (e.g., on a tagged commit), the npm package is published to the NPM Registry.

*   Security Controls in Build Process:

    *   security control: **Automated Builds:** GitHub Actions ensures consistent and reproducible builds.
    *   security control: **Linting:** Enforces code style and helps prevent common coding errors.
    *   security control: **Testing:** Automated tests help catch bugs and regressions early.
    *   security control: **Dependency Management:** npm/yarn manage dependencies, allowing for vulnerability scanning.
    *   security control: **(Recommended)** Integrate SCA tools (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot) into the GitHub Actions workflow to automatically scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   security control: **(Recommended)** Add static code analysis tools to scan for potential security vulnerabilities in the JavaScript and native code.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

*   Critical Business Processes:
    *   Rendering Lottie animations within React Native applications smoothly and reliably.
    *   Maintaining compatibility with various React Native versions and platforms.
    *   Providing a user-friendly API for developers.

*   Data Protection:
    *   **Data:** Lottie animation files (JSON format).
    *   **Sensitivity:** Generally low, as most Lottie animations are not inherently sensitive. However, in some cases, animations *could* contain embedded data or be used in a context where they reveal sensitive information.  The primary concern is malicious Lottie files crafted to exploit vulnerabilities.
    *   **Protection:** Input validation is crucial to prevent loading malicious Lottie files that could exploit vulnerabilities in the native rendering libraries.

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

*   Questions:
    *   Are there any specific performance requirements or limitations for the animations?
    *   Are there any plans to support encrypted or protected Lottie files?
    *   What is the expected frequency of updates and releases?
    *   What level of support is provided for older React Native versions?
    *   Are there any specific device configurations or operating system versions that need to be prioritized?

*   Assumptions:
    *   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a stable and performant Lottie animation library for React Native.
    *   SECURITY POSTURE: The project relies on the security of the underlying native Lottie libraries (lottie-ios and lottie-android).
    *   DESIGN: The library will be primarily used by embedding it within React Native applications.
    *   DESIGN: Developers are responsible for providing valid Lottie JSON data.
    *   DESIGN: The library will be distributed via npm.
    *   DESIGN: GitHub Actions will be used for continuous integration and potentially continuous delivery.
