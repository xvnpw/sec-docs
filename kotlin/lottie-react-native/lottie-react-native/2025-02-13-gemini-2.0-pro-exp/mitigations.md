# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for lottie-react-native/lottie-react-native

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Validation (JSON Schema Validation)](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_validation__json_schema_validation_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a JSON Schema validator:** Select a robust JSON Schema validator (e.g., `ajv`).
    2.  **Define a restrictive schema:** Create a `lottie-schema.json` that *strictly* defines allowed structure and data types.  This schema should:
        *   Specify required properties.
        *   Define allowed values for enumerations.
        *   Set maximum lengths for strings.
        *   Limit the number of layers, shapes, etc.
        *   Disallow/restrict features you don't need (expressions, masks).
        *   Validate external resource URLs (if allowed), referencing an allowlist.
    3.  **Integrate validation:** *Before* passing JSON data to `lottie-react-native`'s `LottieView` component, validate the JSON against your schema using the chosen validator.  This is done in your React Native code, *before* the animation data reaches the library.
    4.  **Handle validation errors:** If validation fails, reject the animation, log a detailed error (including schema violations), and show a user-friendly error.  Do *not* render the animation.
    5.  **Regularly update the schema:** Update the schema as animation requirements evolve, keeping it as restrictive as possible.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious JSON Payloads (Denial of Service):** Severity: High. Impact: Reduces risk by enforcing limits and preventing unexpected data.
    *   **Malicious JSON Payloads (Code Execution - Theoretical):** Severity: Critical. Impact: Reduces risk by preventing injection of unexpected data.
    *   **Malicious JSON Payloads (Data Exfiltration):** Severity: High. Impact: Reduces risk by validating external URLs (if used).

*   **Impact:** High. Critical mitigation against malformed/malicious input.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No JSON Schema validation is currently implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Selection of a JSON Schema validator.
    *   Creation of a restrictive JSON Schema.
    *   Integration of schema validation *before* calling `LottieView`.
    *   Error handling for validation failures.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unnecessary Features](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unnecessary_features.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify used features:** Analyze your animations; determine required features (expressions, text, images, masks, mattes).
    2.  **Consult documentation:** Check `lottie-react-native` and native Lottie (iOS/Android) docs for configuration options to disable features.
    3.  **Disable through props (if possible):** Some features might be disabled via props to the `LottieView` component.  This is the *direct* interaction with `lottie-react-native`. For example, you might find props related to caching, image loading behavior, or progressive rendering that can be adjusted for security.
    4.  **Modify animation JSON (if necessary):** If a feature can't be disabled via props, modify the Lottie JSON to remove it (enforced by your schema).
    5.  **Test thoroughly:** After disabling features, test animations to ensure correct rendering.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious JSON Payloads (Denial of Service):** Severity: Medium. Impact: Reduces attack surface by limiting animation complexity.
    *   **Malicious JSON Payloads (Code Execution - Theoretical):** Severity: High. Impact: Reduces attack surface by removing potential exploit entry points.
    *   **Malicious JSON Payloads (Data Exfiltration):** Severity: Low. Impact: May indirectly reduce risk.

*   **Impact:** Medium. Reduces attack surface and can improve performance.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No specific features are intentionally disabled.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Analysis of animations to identify unnecessary features.
    *   Investigation of `LottieView` props and native configuration options.
    *   Implementation of feature disabling (via props or JSON).
    *   Testing after disabling features.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe Loading and Error Handling with `LottieView`](./mitigation_strategies/safe_loading_and_error_handling_with__lottieview_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Controlled `source` prop:**  Ensure the `source` prop passed to `LottieView` *always* comes from a trusted, validated source (after JSON schema validation).  Never directly accept user input or untrusted URLs for this prop.
    2.  **Implement `onError` prop:**  Use the `onError` prop provided by `LottieView`.  This prop takes a callback function that will be executed if the animation fails to load or render.
    3.  **Robust Error Handling:**  Within the `onError` callback:
        *   Log the error details (for debugging, but *never* expose raw error messages to the user).
        *   Display a user-friendly error message or fallback UI (e.g., a static placeholder image).
        *   *Do not* attempt to retry loading the animation automatically, especially if the error indicates a potential security issue.
    4. **Consider `onAnimationFinish`:** Use the `onAnimationFinish` prop to track when an animation completes. This can be useful for managing resources and preventing potential issues if an animation is unexpectedly long or never finishes.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious JSON Payloads (Denial of Service):** Severity: Medium. Impact: Helps prevent crashes and resource exhaustion by gracefully handling loading/rendering errors.
    *   **Malicious JSON Payloads (Code Execution - Theoretical):** Severity: Low (indirect). Impact: Reduces the chance of unexpected behavior due to errors.
    *   **Malicious JSON Payloads (Data Exfiltration):** Severity: Low (indirect). Impact: Reduces the chance of unexpected behavior.

*   **Impact:** Medium. Improves application stability and user experience, and provides a mechanism to handle potential issues gracefully.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The `source` prop is used, but its input isn't rigorously validated (relies on other mitigations).
    *   No `onError` or `onAnimationFinish` props are currently used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Full integration of the `onError` prop with robust error handling and logging.
    *   Consideration of using the `onAnimationFinish` prop.
    *   Ensuring the `source` prop *always* receives validated data.
