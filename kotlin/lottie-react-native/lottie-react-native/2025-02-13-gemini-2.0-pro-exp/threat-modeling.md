# Threat Model Analysis for lottie-react-native/lottie-react-native

## Threat: [Malicious Lottie JSON - Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/malicious_lottie_json_-_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a Lottie JSON file with excessively complex animations, deeply nested layers, or a very large number of elements.  When the application attempts to render this file using `lottie-react-native`, it consumes excessive CPU and/or memory resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition. The application may freeze, crash, or the entire device may become unresponsive. The attacker might distribute this file through user-uploaded content, a compromised CDN, or by exploiting a vulnerability in a third-party service that provides Lottie files.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, device unresponsiveness, poor user experience, potential data loss (if the crash occurs during a critical operation).
*   **Affected Component:** The core animation rendering engine within `lottie-react-native`. This includes the JSON parsing logic and the components responsible for translating the JSON data into visual elements on the screen (e.g., `Animated.View`, internal rendering functions).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Input Validation:** Implement a multi-stage validation process:
        *   **Pre-parse Validation:** Use a separate, lightweight JSON parsing library *before* passing the data to `lottie-react-native`. Check for:
            *   File size limits (e.g., maximum 1MB).
            *   Maximum number of layers.
            *   Maximum nesting depth.
            *   Disallow or limit the use of complex features like expressions.
        *   **Schema Validation:** Ensure the JSON conforms to the Lottie schema.
        *   **Whitelist Allowed Features:** Only allow a specific subset of Lottie features known to be safe.
    *   **Resource Limiting:**
        *   Investigate platform-specific APIs (iOS and Android) for limiting the CPU and memory usage of a process or thread. This may require native code modifications.
        *   Consider using timeouts to interrupt animation rendering if it takes too long.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Analyze Lottie files before deployment to identify potentially problematic animations.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** Use fuzzing tools to test the input validation and parsing logic with a wide range of malformed Lottie files.
    *   **Trusted Sources:** Load Lottie files only from trusted sources that you control.

## Threat: [`lottie-react-native` Library Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/_lottie-react-native__library_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers a vulnerability (e.g., a buffer overflow, an injection flaw) in a specific version of the `lottie-react-native` library itself. They then craft a Lottie JSON file that triggers this vulnerability when rendered. This could lead to arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions. The attacker would likely need to know the specific version of `lottie-react-native` being used by the target application.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from application crashes to complete device compromise. Potential for data theft, unauthorized access, and installation of malware.
*   **Affected Component:** The specific vulnerable component within the `lottie-react-native` library (e.g., a particular parsing function, a specific animation feature handler). This could be in the JavaScript code or in the native (iOS/Android) code that `lottie-react-native` wraps.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep `lottie-react-native` Updated:** This is the *primary* mitigation. Regularly update to the latest version of the library to receive security patches. Use automated dependency management tools.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security mailing lists or follow the `lottie-react-native` GitHub repository to be alerted to disclosed vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use tools like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, Snyk, or Dependabot to automatically detect known vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies.
