## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Lottie Parser/Renderer](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_lottie_parserrenderer.md)

*   **1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Lottie Parser/Renderer**

    *   **1.3 Logic Errors / Untrusted Input [HIGH RISK]**
        *   Description: This path involves exploiting vulnerabilities arising from how the Lottie parser and renderer handle untrusted input, particularly related to advanced animation features. The attacker leverages flaws in the logic of how these features are processed to bypass security checks or inject malicious code.
        *   **1.3.1 Exploiting Animation Features (e.g., Expressions, Masks, Matte Layers) to Bypass Input Validation {CRITICAL}**
            *   Description: This is the most critical vulnerability within this branch. Lottie animations can include JavaScript expressions for dynamic behavior. If these expressions are not properly sandboxed or validated, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes within the context of the application. This could lead to arbitrary code execution, data theft, or other malicious actions. Masks and matte layers, if improperly handled, could also be used to create visual misdirection or trigger unexpected behavior.
            *   Likelihood: Medium (High if expressions are enabled and not properly sandboxed; Low if disabled)
            *   Impact: High (Potential for arbitrary code execution or data exfiltration)
            *   Effort: Medium (Requires understanding of Lottie features and potential vulnerabilities)
            *   Skill Level: Medium-High (Requires knowledge of JavaScript, Lottie internals, and security best practices)
            *   Detection Difficulty: High (Difficult to detect without careful code review and security audits, especially if expressions are obfuscated)

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Social Engineering / Supply Chain Attack](./attack_tree_paths/2__social_engineering__supply_chain_attack.md)

*   **2. Social Engineering / Supply Chain Attack**

    *   **2.1 Tricking User to Load Malicious Animation [HIGH RISK]**
        *   Description: This path relies on deceiving the user into loading a malicious Lottie animation. The attacker doesn't directly exploit a code vulnerability in the library but instead uses social engineering techniques to trick the user into interacting with a malicious animation file or link.
        *   **2.1.1 Phishing/Deceptive UI {CRITICAL}**
            *   Description: This is a critical attack vector within social engineering. The attacker crafts a convincing phishing email, website, or other communication that lures the user into loading a malicious Lottie animation. This could involve embedding the animation in a seemingly legitimate context, such as a fake invoice, a promotional offer, or a social media post.
            *   Likelihood: High (Phishing is a very common attack vector)
            *   Impact: High (Depends on the malicious animation; could range from DoS to arbitrary code execution)
            *   Effort: Low-Medium (Requires crafting a convincing phishing campaign)
            *   Skill Level: Low-Medium (Requires social engineering skills and basic web development knowledge)
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (Depends on user awareness and security measures in place)

    *   **2.2 Compromise Upstream Dependency**
        *   **2.2.1 Inject Malicious Code into Lottie Library or its Dependencies {CRITICAL}**
            *   Description: This represents a supply chain attack. The attacker compromises the `lottie-react-native` library itself (or one of its dependencies) and injects malicious code. This code will then be executed by any application that uses the compromised library. This is a highly impactful but less likely attack.
            *   Likelihood: Low (Requires compromising a well-maintained project or its dependencies)
            *   Impact: High (Widespread impact, affecting all users of the compromised library/dependency)
            *   Effort: High (Requires significant resources and expertise to compromise a secure repository or package registry)
            *   Skill Level: High (Requires expert-level hacking skills and knowledge of software supply chain security)
            *   Detection Difficulty: High (Difficult to detect without rigorous code audits, dependency analysis, and supply chain monitoring)
