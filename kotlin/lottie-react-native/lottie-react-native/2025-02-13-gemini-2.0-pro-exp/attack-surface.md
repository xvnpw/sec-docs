# Attack Surface Analysis for lottie-react-native/lottie-react-native

## Attack Surface: [1. Untrusted Animation Source](./attack_surfaces/1__untrusted_animation_source.md)

*   **Description:** Loading and rendering Lottie animation files (JSON) from untrusted or unvalidated sources. This is the primary attack vector, and it's *directly* handled by `lottie-react-native`.
*   **How `lottie-react-native` Contributes:** The library's core function is to parse and render these JSON files, making it the direct target of attacks using malicious animations.  The library *is* the attack surface in this case.
*   **Example:** A user uploads a `.json` file containing a Lottie animation to a social media app. The file is crafted to cause a denial-of-service or, less likely, attempt code execution.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS)
    *   Potential (though unlikely) arbitrary code execution
    *   Possible information disclosure or data exfiltration (very low probability, but still a consequence of parsing a malicious file)
*   **Risk Severity:** High (DoS is likely; code execution is a low-probability but high-impact risk)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous validation of *all* JSON files *before* passing them to `lottie-react-native`. This is paramount.  This should include:
        *   **Schema Validation:** Define a strict schema for the expected JSON structure and reject any files that don't conform.  Use a robust JSON schema validator.
        *   **Whitelist Allowed Elements/Attributes:** Only allow a specific set of known-safe Lottie features and attributes. Reject anything outside this whitelist.  This requires a deep understanding of the Lottie file format.
        *   **Size Limits:** Enforce maximum file size limits to prevent resource exhaustion.
        *   **Complexity Limits:** Limit the number of layers, elements, and nesting depth within the animation.
    *   **Trusted Sources Only:** Ideally, only load animations from sources you completely control (e.g., your own backend servers, where you can ensure the files are safe).
    *   **Sanitize file name and path:** Sanitize file name and path to prevent path traversal attacks.

## Attack Surface: [2. Animation File Tampering (Man-in-the-Middle)](./attack_surfaces/2__animation_file_tampering__man-in-the-middle_.md)

*   **Description:** Modification of a Lottie animation file during transmission, even if the original source is trusted.  `lottie-react-native` is directly involved because it processes the tampered file.
*   **How `lottie-react-native` Contributes:** The library will process the tampered file, potentially leading to the same vulnerabilities as an untrusted source. It's the direct recipient of the malicious input.
*   **Example:** An attacker intercepts the network traffic between the app and the server, injecting malicious code into the Lottie JSON.
*   **Impact:** Same as "Untrusted Animation Source" (DoS, potential code execution, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **HTTPS (TLS):** Always use HTTPS to encrypt the communication. This is a general security best practice, but it's crucial here to protect the integrity of the animation file.
    *   **Integrity Checks (Checksums/Digital Signatures):** Calculate a cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the animation file on the server and verify it on the client *before* loading the animation into `lottie-react-native`. This ensures the file hasn't been altered.

## Attack Surface: [3. Outdated Library/Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/3__outdated_librarydependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Using an outdated version of `lottie-react-native` or its underlying native libraries (Lottie-iOS, Lottie-Android). This directly impacts `lottie-react-native` as the vulnerabilities reside within the library or its direct dependencies.
*   **How `lottie-react-native` Contributes:** Older versions may contain known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer releases.  The vulnerability is *in* the library or its native components.
*   **Example:** Using a version of `lottie-react-native` that relies on a vulnerable version of Lottie-Android with a known buffer overflow exploit, triggered by a specially crafted JSON file.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability â€“ could range from DoS to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if known vulnerabilities exist)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `lottie-react-native` and all its dependencies (including the native Lottie libraries) up-to-date. Use a dependency management tool.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use security scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in your dependencies.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories.

## Attack Surface: [4. Enabled Expressions/Scripting (If Supported)](./attack_surfaces/4__enabled_expressionsscripting__if_supported_.md)

*   **Description:** If the Lottie implementation supports and *enables* expressions or scripting within the animation file (less common in `lottie-react-native`, but a critical risk if present). This is a direct feature of the library (if enabled).
*   **How `lottie-react-native` Contributes:** If expressions are enabled, the library *will execute them*, potentially leading to severe security vulnerabilities. The library is the execution engine.
*   **Example:** A malicious animation file contains an expression that attempts to access the device's file system or make network requests.
*   **Impact:** High risk of arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, and other serious security breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if enabled)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable Expressions:** Ensure that expressions and scripting are *completely disabled* in the `lottie-react-native` configuration and in the underlying native libraries. This is the *most important* mitigation.  Do not rely on input validation if expressions are enabled.
    *   **Strict Input Validation and Sandboxing (if expressions *must* be used - strongly discouraged):**  If, and *only if*, expressions are absolutely necessary (which is strongly discouraged), implement extremely strict input validation and sandboxing. This is very difficult to do securely and is generally not recommended.
