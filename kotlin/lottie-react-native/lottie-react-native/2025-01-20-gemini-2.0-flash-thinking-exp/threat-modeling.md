# Threat Model Analysis for lottie-react-native/lottie-react-native

## Threat: [Malicious Local Animation File Inclusion](./threats/malicious_local_animation_file_inclusion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker includes a deliberately crafted malicious Lottie animation file within the application's assets. This file is then loaded and rendered by `lottie-react-native`, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in its rendering engine or causing unexpected and harmful behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, unexpected UI behavior, potential for denial of service by consuming excessive resources on the device, or potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying native rendering libraries leading to more severe consequences like arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Compromised Remote Animation Source Serving Malicious Files](./threats/compromised_remote_animation_source_serving_malicious_files.md)

*   **Description:** The application fetches Lottie animations from a remote server. An attacker compromises that server and replaces legitimate animation files with malicious ones. When `lottie-react-native` attempts to download and render these compromised files, it can lead to exploitation of vulnerabilities within the library or the underlying rendering mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, unexpected behavior, resource exhaustion, or exploitation of underlying rendering vulnerabilities potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. This can affect multiple users of the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `lottie-react-native` Library](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in__lottie-react-native__library.md)

*   **Description:** The `lottie-react-native` library itself contains security vulnerabilities. An attacker crafts a specific Lottie animation file that, when rendered by `lottie-react-native`, triggers these vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, unexpected behavior, potential for arbitrary code execution on the device, or information disclosure, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if a severe vulnerability exists)

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Underlying Native Libraries (via Lottie React Native)](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_native_libraries__via_lottie_react_native_.md)

*   **Description:** `lottie-react-native` relies on underlying native libraries for rendering. These native libraries have security vulnerabilities. A specially crafted Lottie animation, processed by `lottie-react-native`, can trigger these vulnerabilities in the native libraries.
    *   **Impact:** Application crashes, unexpected behavior, potential for arbitrary code execution at the native level, or information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the severity of the native library vulnerability)
