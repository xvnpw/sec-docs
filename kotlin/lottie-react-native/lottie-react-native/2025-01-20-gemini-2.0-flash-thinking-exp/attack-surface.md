# Attack Surface Analysis for lottie-react-native/lottie-react-native

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Animation Data (Code Injection)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_animation_data__code_injection_.md)

* **Description:** The Lottie animation JSON format allows for expressions that can be evaluated by the rendering engine. If a malicious actor crafts an animation with harmful JavaScript code within these expressions, it could be executed within the application's context.
    * **How Lottie-React-Native Contributes:** `lottie-react-native` is responsible for parsing and rendering the Lottie JSON. If the underlying Lottie rendering engine (native or JavaScript-based) doesn't properly sanitize or sandbox these expressions, it can lead to code execution.
    * **Example:** An attacker provides a Lottie animation where an expression attempts to access sensitive device information or make unauthorized network requests when the animation is rendered.
    * **Impact:** Potentially full compromise of the application, including data theft, unauthorized actions, and further exploitation of the device.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Validate and Sanitize Animation Data: Implement server-side validation and sanitization of Lottie JSON before it reaches the client application. Remove or neutralize potentially harmful expressions.
        * Use Trusted Animation Sources: Only load animations from trusted and verified sources. Avoid loading user-generated or third-party animations without thorough inspection.
        * Regularly Update Lottie Libraries: Ensure the underlying native Lottie libraries and `lottie-react-native` are updated to the latest versions, as they may contain fixes for expression evaluation vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Animation Data (Resource Exhaustion/DoS)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_animation_data__resource_exhaustiondos_.md)

* **Description:** A maliciously crafted Lottie animation can contain an excessive number of layers, complex shapes, or extremely high frame rates, leading to excessive CPU and memory usage on the client device.
    * **How Lottie-React-Native Contributes:** `lottie-react-native` renders the animation as described in the JSON. If the animation is overly complex, the rendering process can consume significant resources.
    * **Example:** An attacker provides a Lottie animation with thousands of layers or extremely intricate vector paths, causing the application to freeze, become unresponsive, or crash due to excessive resource consumption.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service for the application, potentially impacting other device functions and user experience.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Limit Animation Complexity: Set limits on the complexity (e.g., number of layers, shapes) and size of Lottie animations that can be loaded.
        * Resource Monitoring: Implement monitoring to detect excessive resource usage during animation rendering and potentially halt the rendering process.
        * Throttling/Rate Limiting: If animations are fetched remotely, implement throttling or rate limiting on animation requests to prevent a large number of complex animations from being loaded simultaneously.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** `lottie-react-native` relies on underlying native Lottie libraries for iOS and Android. These dependencies may contain known security vulnerabilities.
    * **How Lottie-React-Native Contributes:** The security of `lottie-react-native` is directly tied to the security of its dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited through the `lottie-react-native` interface.
    * **Example:** A known vulnerability exists in the native Lottie library for Android that allows for arbitrary code execution. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability through a specially crafted Lottie animation rendered by `lottie-react-native`.
    * **Impact:** Depends on the severity of the dependency vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly Update Dependencies: Keep `lottie-react-native` and its underlying native dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. Use dependency management tools to track and update dependencies.
        * Vulnerability Scanning: Integrate vulnerability scanning tools into the development pipeline to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Platform-Specific Vulnerabilities in Native Libraries](./attack_surfaces/platform-specific_vulnerabilities_in_native_libraries.md)

* **Description:** The underlying native Lottie libraries for iOS and Android might have platform-specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
    * **How Lottie-React-Native Contributes:** `lottie-react-native` acts as a bridge to these native libraries. If the native libraries have vulnerabilities, they can be indirectly exploited through `lottie-react-native`.
    * **Example:** A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the iOS Lottie library. A specially crafted animation rendered by `lottie-react-native` on iOS could trigger this vulnerability, leading to application crashes or potentially more severe consequences.
    * **Impact:** Depends on the nature of the native vulnerability, ranging from application crashes to potential code execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly Update Lottie Libraries: As mentioned before, keeping the native libraries updated is crucial.
