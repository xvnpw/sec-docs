## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Lottie-React-Native (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_lottie-react-native__critical_node_.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved a significant level of control or impact on the application. This could involve data breaches, denial of service, or unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Lottie File Processing (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_lottie_file_processing__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in how the `lottie-react-native` library handles and processes Lottie animation files.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Providing maliciously crafted Lottie files designed to trigger vulnerabilities in the parsing or rendering logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Maliciously Crafted Lottie File (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/provide_maliciously_crafted_lottie_file__critical_node_.md)

This is a crucial step for many attacks targeting Lottie. The attacker needs to deliver a specially crafted animation file to the application.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Uploading a malicious file through an application feature.
        * Tricking an administrator or developer into using a malicious file.
        * If the application fetches files dynamically, manipulating the source or path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Parser Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_parser_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on exploiting flaws in the JSON parser used by the Lottie library to interpret the animation data.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Exploit Logic Errors in Parser:** Crafting Lottie files that exploit logical flaws in how the parser handles specific combinations of animation properties or data types. This can lead to unexpected behavior, data corruption, or even crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Lottie File from Untrusted Source (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/supply_lottie_file_from_untrusted_source__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

This path highlights the risk of relying on external sources for animation files without proper verification.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Compromising the server or CDN where the application fetches Lottie files.
        * Performing a Man-in-the-Middle attack to intercept and replace legitimate animation files with malicious ones.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Animation Server/CDN (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_animation_servercdn__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

If the application fetches Lottie files from a remote server or CDN, compromising this infrastructure allows the attacker to inject malicious animations that will be served to all users of the application.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the server software or operating system.
        * Using compromised credentials to gain access to the server.
        * Social engineering attacks targeting server administrators.
        * Exploiting misconfigurations in the server or CDN setup.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Animation Delivery (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle_attack_on_animation_delivery__high-risk_path_.md)

If the connection between the application and the server hosting the Lottie files is not properly secured (e.g., not using HTTPS), an attacker can intercept the communication and replace the legitimate animation file with a malicious one.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * ARP spoofing on a local network.
        * DNS spoofing to redirect requests to a malicious server.
        * Exploiting vulnerabilities in network infrastructure.
