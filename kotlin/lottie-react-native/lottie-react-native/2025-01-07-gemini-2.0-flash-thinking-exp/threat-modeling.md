# Threat Model Analysis for lottie-react-native/lottie-react-native

## Threat: [Malicious Animation Data Leading to Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/malicious_animation_data_leading_to_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted Lottie JSON file with extreme complexity. The `LottieView` component attempts to render this complex animation, consuming excessive CPU and memory resources, leading to application unresponsiveness or crashes.

**Impact:** The application becomes unusable, potentially impacting user experience and business functionality.

**Affected Component:** `LottieView` component, specifically the rendering logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement size limits for animation files.
* Set timeouts for animation rendering.
* Consider pre-processing animation files on a trusted backend.
* Implement error handling for rendering failures.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Rendering Vulnerabilities through Crafted Animation Data](./threats/exploitation_of_rendering_vulnerabilities_through_crafted_animation_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a Lottie JSON file that exploits a vulnerability within the Lottie rendering engine (either in the JavaScript bridge or the underlying native libraries as accessed by `lottie-react-native`). This could lead to crashes, memory corruption, or potentially remote code execution.

**Impact:** Application crashes, unexpected behavior, potential data corruption, or in severe cases, the attacker could gain control of the application or the user's device.

**Affected Component:** Native Lottie rendering libraries (iOS/Android) accessed by `lottie-react-native`, the JavaScript bridge.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep `lottie-react-native` and its dependencies updated.
* Monitor security advisories for `lottie-react-native` and native Lottie implementations.
* Consider sandboxing the rendering process.

## Threat: [Execution of Malicious Expressions within Animation Data](./threats/execution_of_malicious_expressions_within_animation_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within Lottie expressions. When the `LottieView` renders the animation, this malicious code could be executed within the application's context.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the application's context, potentially allowing the attacker to access sensitive data or perform other malicious actions.

**Affected Component:** The expression evaluation engine within the native Lottie libraries, the JavaScript bridge.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully review and potentially disable or restrict the use of expressions if the animation source is untrusted.
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization on animation data.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack Targeting `lottie-react-native`](./threats/supply_chain_attack_targeting__lottie-react-native_.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the `lottie-react-native` library itself or its direct dependencies. This could involve injecting malicious code into the library's source code or distribution packages.

**Impact:** Depending on the malicious code, the impact can range from data theft and unauthorized access to complete compromise of the application and user devices.

**Affected Component:** The entire `lottie-react-native` library and its direct dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly audit project dependencies for vulnerabilities.
* Use dependency management tools with integrity verification.
* Pin specific versions of dependencies.
* Be cautious about using unofficial or forked versions.

## Threat: [Loading Animations from Untrusted or Compromised Sources](./threats/loading_animations_from_untrusted_or_compromised_sources.md)

**Description:** The application fetches animation data from an untrusted server or a server that has been compromised. The attacker can then serve malicious animation files to the application, which `lottie-react-native` will attempt to render.

**Impact:** The application could load and render malicious animations, leading to DoS, exploitation of vulnerabilities, or execution of malicious expressions.

**Affected Component:** Network requests to fetch animation data, the `LottieView` component.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Only load animations from trusted and authenticated sources using HTTPS.
* Implement integrity checks for downloaded animation files.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Underlying Native Lottie Libraries](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_native_lottie_libraries.md)

**Description:** The `lottie-react-native` library relies on native Lottie implementations for iOS and Android. Vulnerabilities in these underlying native libraries could be exploited through specific animation data or interactions facilitated by `lottie-react-native`.

**Impact:** Application crashes, unexpected behavior, memory corruption, or potentially remote code execution.

**Affected Component:** Native Lottie implementations for iOS and Android as utilized by `lottie-react-native`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure that the native Lottie libraries used by `lottie-react-native` are kept up-to-date. This often involves updating the `lottie-react-native` library itself.
* Monitor security advisories for the native Lottie libraries on the relevant platforms.
