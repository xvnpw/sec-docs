# Attack Surface Analysis for lottie-react-native/lottie-react-native

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted JSON Animation Data](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_json_animation_data.md)

**Description:**  The `lottie-react-native` library parses JSON files (or JSON strings) representing animations. A specially crafted JSON payload can exploit vulnerabilities in the parsing process or the rendering engine *within lottie-react-native*.
*   **How lottie-react-native contributes:**  It is the direct component responsible for parsing and interpreting the JSON animation data.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides a Lottie JSON file with extremely deep nesting of objects, causing the JSON parser within `lottie-react-native` to consume excessive memory and potentially crash the application (DoS).
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (application crash or freeze), potential for exploiting vulnerabilities in Lottie's JSON parsing logic leading to other issues.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Load animation data from trusted sources only.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization on the animation data *before* passing it to `lottie-react-native`.
    *   Set resource limits for animation processing within the application.
    *   Keep `lottie-react-native` updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches within the library itself.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Animation Data](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_animation_data.md)

**Description:** If the application processes animation data from untrusted sources and the animation attempts to load external resources, an attacker might be able to leverage `lottie-react-native` to make requests to internal servers or services.
*   **How lottie-react-native contributes:** It interprets the animation data and attempts to fetch external resources specified within it, potentially making unintended network requests.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides a Lottie file with a URL pointing to an internal service within the application's infrastructure (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/admin`). `lottie-react-native`, while rendering the animation, attempts to fetch this resource.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, potential data breaches, or manipulation of internal systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize and validate URLs within animation data *before* they are processed by `lottie-react-native`.
    *   Implement a whitelist of allowed domains or IP addresses for external resource loading that `lottie-react-native` is permitted to access.
    *   Avoid processing animation data from completely untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal (If Loading from Local Files)](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal__if_loading_from_local_files_.md)

**Description:** If the application uses `lottie-react-native` to load animation files from local paths provided by users, insufficient validation could allow access to unintended files.
*   **How lottie-react-native contributes:** It is the component instructed to load files from the specified paths. If these paths are malicious, Lottie will attempt to access them.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides a path like `../../../sensitive_data.json` as the animation source. If not validated by the application before being passed to `lottie-react-native`, the library might attempt to load this sensitive file.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive local files, potential for further exploitation based on the content of the accessed files.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid allowing users to directly specify arbitrary file paths for animation loading with `lottie-react-native`.
    *   If local file loading is necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization of the provided paths *before* passing them to `lottie-react-native`.
    *   Restrict the directories from which `lottie-react-native` is allowed to load animation files.
