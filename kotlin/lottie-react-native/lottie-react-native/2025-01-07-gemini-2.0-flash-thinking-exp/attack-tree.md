## Attack Tree Path: [Delivering Malicious Lottie Animation via Crafting](./attack_tree_paths/delivering_malicious_lottie_animation_via_crafting.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious Lottie animation file specifically designed to exploit vulnerabilities in how the application processes it.
* **Critical Node: Craft Lottie File with Exploitable Properties:**
    * **Description:** The attacker meticulously creates a Lottie animation file containing properties or structures that can trigger vulnerabilities in the Lottie parser or renderer.
    * **Potential Exploits:** This could involve buffer overflows by providing excessively long strings, attempts at script injection (if the library or application has unforeseen vulnerabilities), or crafting animations that cause excessive resource consumption leading to denial-of-service.
    * **Risk:** This is a direct method of attack that bypasses standard content. Successful exploitation at this stage can lead to code execution or application crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Delivering Malicious Lottie Animation via Man-in-the-Middle](./attack_tree_paths/delivering_malicious_lottie_animation_via_man-in-the-middle.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker intercepts the download of a legitimate Lottie animation file and replaces it with a malicious one.
* **Critical Node: Target Insecure Download Protocol (HTTP):**
    * **Description:** If the application downloads Lottie animations over an insecure HTTP connection, an attacker on the network can intercept the traffic.
    * **Exploitation:** The attacker can perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack to replace the legitimate animation file with a malicious one before it reaches the application.
    * **Risk:** This is a relatively easy attack to execute if the application uses HTTP, and it allows the attacker to deliver any type of malicious animation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Backend Serving Animations](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_backend_serving_animations.md)

**Description:** If the backend server that hosts and serves Lottie animations is compromised, the attacker gains control over the animation files delivered to the application.
* **Impact:** The attacker can replace legitimate animations with malicious ones, affecting all users of the application. This is a high-impact vulnerability due to its potential for widespread compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Handling of User-Provided Animations](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_handling_of_user-provided_animations.md)

**Description:** If the application allows users to upload or specify arbitrary Lottie animation URLs without proper security measures, it creates a direct pathway for malicious content.
* **Exploitation:** Attackers can upload or link to malicious animation files, which the application will then load and process, potentially triggering vulnerabilities.
* **Risk:** This simplifies the attacker's task, as they don't need to rely on exploiting network vulnerabilities or backend compromises.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Input Validation and Sanitization](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_input_validation_and_sanitization.md)

**Description:** If the application does not validate and sanitize the content of Lottie animation files before processing them, it becomes vulnerable to a wide range of attacks.
* **Impact:** This allows attackers to inject malicious payloads within the animation files, relying on the application's failure to recognize and neutralize them. This is a fundamental security flaw that enables many other attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Lottie-React-Native Version](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_lottie-react-native_version.md)

**Description:** Using an outdated version of the `lottie-react-native` library exposes the application to known security vulnerabilities that have been patched in later versions.
* **Exploitation:** Attackers can leverage publicly available information about these vulnerabilities to craft exploits targeting the application.
* **Risk:** This is a common vulnerability, and exploiting known weaknesses is often easier than discovering new ones. Regular updates are crucial to mitigate this risk.
