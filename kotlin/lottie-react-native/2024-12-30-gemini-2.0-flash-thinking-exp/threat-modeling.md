### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving lottie-react-native

This list details high and critical security threats that directly involve the `lottie-react-native` library.

*   **Threat:** Maliciously Crafted Lottie File - Exploiting Parsing Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a Lottie JSON file with specific structures or values designed to trigger vulnerabilities in the `lottie-react-native` library's JSON parsing logic. This could involve malformed data, excessively large numbers, or unexpected data types that the library's parser doesn't handle correctly.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential for arbitrary code execution if the parsing vulnerability is severe enough to allow memory corruption within the `lottie-react-native` native module.
    *   **Affected Component:** `lottie-react-native` core module, specifically the JSON parsing and interpretation logic within its native code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature of the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `lottie-react-native` library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that address parsing vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement robust error handling around the Lottie loading and rendering process to catch and gracefully handle parsing errors within the `lottie-react-native` module.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed environment or a separate process for rendering Lottie animations from untrusted sources to limit the impact of potential parsing exploits within `lottie-react-native`.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in the Underlying Native Libraries
    *   **Description:** The `lottie-react-native` library relies on native libraries (like Lottie for Android and Lottie for iOS) for rendering. Vulnerabilities in these underlying native libraries could be directly exploitable through the `lottie-react-native` interface if the library doesn't properly sanitize or handle data passed to these native components.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for remote code execution, denial of service, or other security breaches depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the underlying native library, directly triggered through `lottie-react-native`.
    *   **Affected Component:** The native Lottie libraries used by `lottie-react-native` and the bridging code within `lottie-react-native` that interacts with them.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature of the underlying vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `lottie-react-native` library updated, as updates often include updates to the underlying native libraries, addressing known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to the native Lottie libraries used by the platform to understand potential risks to `lottie-react-native`.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Handling of External Resources Referenced in Lottie Files
    *   **Description:** If Lottie animations reference external resources (e.g., images hosted on a remote server), and the `lottie-react-native` library does not handle these references securely, it could lead to vulnerabilities. An attacker could manipulate the animation file to point to malicious resources, and `lottie-react-native` might attempt to load them without proper validation.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for loading malicious content into the application, man-in-the-middle attacks if resources are loaded over insecure connections (HTTP) by `lottie-react-native`, or exposure to cross-site scripting (XSS) if the loaded content is rendered within a web view controlled by the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** The part of `lottie-react-native` responsible for fetching and handling external resources referenced in the animation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (due to the potential for malicious content injection or MITM directly facilitated by `lottie-react-native`).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that the `lottie-react-native` library only loads external resources over secure protocols (HTTPS). This might require configuring the library or ensuring the animation files are created with HTTPS URLs.
        *   If possible, configure `lottie-react-native` to restrict the sources from which external resources can be loaded.
        *   Validate and sanitize any URLs or paths used to load external resources *before* they are passed to `lottie-react-native` for loading. Consider hosting all necessary assets locally within the application package to avoid external dependencies.
