Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving LeakCanary, with high and critical severity:

**Key Attack Surface: Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Data in Heap Dumps**

* **Description:** LeakCanary creates heap dumps to identify memory leaks. These dumps capture the application's memory state, potentially including sensitive data.
* **How LeakCanary Contributes:** LeakCanary's core functionality involves triggering and storing these heap dumps.
* **Example:** An API key stored in a String variable is present in memory when LeakCanary takes a heap dump. If an attacker gains access to the device's file system (e.g., through rooting or a separate vulnerability), they can extract the heap dump and find the API key.
* **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, unauthorized access to resources, potential financial loss or reputational damage.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Disable LeakCanary in Release Builds:** Ensure LeakCanary is only active in debug or internal testing builds using build variants or conditional initialization.

**Key Attack Surface: Exposure of Debug Information in Release Builds (Configuration Issue)**

* **Description:** If LeakCanary is mistakenly included and active in release builds, it exposes debugging capabilities and the potential for the aforementioned risks to end-users.
* **How LeakCanary Contributes:**  Its presence and activity in the release build enable its functionalities, including heap dump creation and leak reporting.
* **Example:** A release build accidentally includes LeakCanary, allowing an attacker on a rooted device to trigger a heap dump and potentially extract sensitive information.
* **Impact:**  Increased risk of data breaches, information disclosure, and resource exhaustion on end-user devices.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strict Build Configuration Management:** Implement robust build processes and configurations to ensure LeakCanary is only included in debug or internal builds.
    * **Automated Checks:** Use automated tools or scripts to verify that LeakCanary is not included in release builds.
    * **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to catch any accidental inclusion of LeakCanary in release configurations.
