## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Sanitization and Redaction within Timber Trees](./mitigation_strategies/data_sanitization_and_redaction_within_timber_trees.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Data Sanitization and Redaction within Timber Trees
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Determine the types of sensitive information your application might log (PII, API keys, etc.).
    2.  **Create Custom `Tree` Implementation:** Develop a custom `Tree` class (e.g., `RedactingTree`) that extends `Timber.Tree`.
    3.  **Implement Sanitization in `log()` Method:** Within the `log()` method of your custom `Tree`, add code to sanitize or redact sensitive data *before* it's actually logged. This can involve:
        *   Using regular expressions to find and mask patterns (e.g., credit card numbers).
        *   Maintaining lists of sensitive keywords to redact.
        *   Replacing sensitive data with placeholders like `[REDACTED]` or hashed representations.
    4.  **Register Custom `Tree` with Timber:**  Use `Timber.plant(new RedactingTree())` to replace or add your custom `Tree` to Timber's logging pipeline. This ensures all logs processed by Timber will go through your redaction logic.
    5.  **Test Redaction:** Thoroughly test your `RedactingTree` to confirm it correctly sanitizes sensitive data in various logging scenarios without hindering debugging of non-sensitive issues.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Accidental logging of sensitive data, leading to unauthorized access if logs are compromised.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Impact):**  Significantly reduces the risk of information disclosure by proactively removing sensitive data *within Timber's logging process*.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** A basic `RedactingTree` exists in the `core` module, redacting some API keys and emails.
    *   **Location:** `com.example.myapp.logging.RedactingTree` in the `core` module.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Expanded Redaction Rules in `RedactingTree`:** Need to enhance `RedactingTree` with more comprehensive redaction rules for various PII and sensitive data types.
    *   **Context-Aware Redaction in `RedactingTree`:**  Improve `RedactingTree` to understand log context for smarter redaction, avoiding over or under-redaction.
    *   **Configurable Redaction Rules for `RedactingTree`:**  Make redaction rules configurable (e.g., via configuration files) for easier updates without code changes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Timber's Tagging and Filtering for Sensitive Data](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_timber's_tagging_and_filtering_for_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Tagging and Filtering via Timber
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Sensitivity-Based Tagging:** Define a tagging convention to categorize logs by sensitivity (e.g., `sensitive_data`, `debug`, `info`).
    2.  **Apply Sensitivity Tags with `Timber.tag()`:** When logging sensitive information, consistently use `Timber.tag("sensitive_data")` before the log message.
    3.  **Implement Filtering `Tree`s:** Create or modify `Tree` implementations to filter logs based on tags.
        *   For production, create a `Tree` that ignores or discards logs tagged as `sensitive_data`.
        *   For development/staging, allow `sensitive_data` logs but potentially route them to separate, secure destinations.
    4.  **Environment-Specific `Tree` Planting:** Use environment detection to plant different `Tree` configurations with `Timber.plant()` based on the environment. Production environments should use filtering `Tree`s.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Reduces accidental disclosure in production by preventing sensitive logs from being written in production environments.
    *   **Log Clutter (Low Severity):** Reduces unnecessary log volume in production by filtering out verbose or sensitive logs.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Impact):** Moderately reduces risk by controlling log output based on sensitivity tags *within Timber's framework*.
    *   **Log Clutter (Low Impact):**  Slightly improves log readability and performance in production.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** Basic tagging for module categorization exists, but not consistently for sensitivity.
    *   **Location:** Tagging used across codebase, but sensitivity tagging is missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Sensitivity Tagging Across Modules:** Implement and enforce sensitivity-based tagging throughout the application.
    *   **Filtering `Tree` for Production:** Develop and deploy a `Tree` that filters out `sensitive_data` tagged logs specifically for production builds, using Timber's filtering capabilities.
    *   **Tagging Guidelines for Developers:** Create clear guidelines for developers on when and how to use sensitivity tags with Timber.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Log Levels Dynamically Using Timber](./mitigation_strategies/control_log_levels_dynamically_using_timber.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Dynamic Log Level Control via Timber
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Environment Detection:** Implement a way to detect the current environment (production, staging, development).
    2.  **Environment-Specific Log Levels:** Define appropriate Timber log levels for each environment: `WARN`/`ERROR` for production, `INFO`/`DEBUG` for staging, `VERBOSE`/`DEBUG` for development.
    3.  **Dynamic Timber Level Setting:** In application initialization, use environment detection to dynamically set Timber's log level. This involves:
        *   `Timber.uprootAll()` to remove existing `Tree`s.
        *   `Timber.plant()` with `Tree` instances configured for the determined log level.
    4.  **Centralized Level Configuration (Optional):** Consider centralizing log level configuration for Timber in a remote service or config file for easier management.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Reduces risk in production by limiting log verbosity and the amount of potentially sensitive data logged by Timber.
    *   **Performance Impact (Low Severity):** Reduces logging overhead in production by minimizing log volume processed by Timber.
    *   **Log Clutter (Medium Severity):** Reduces log clutter in production logs generated by Timber.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Impact):** Moderately reduces risk by controlling Timber's log verbosity in production.
    *   **Performance Impact (Low Impact):**  Slightly improves performance related to Timber logging in production.
    *   **Log Clutter (Medium Impact):** Improves production log readability related to Timber logs.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** Log level is set based on build variant (Debug builds are more verbose via Timber's default `DebugTree`).
    *   **Location:** Build scripts and application initialization code.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Environment Variable Level Configuration for Timber:** Allow log level configuration for Timber via environment variables for runtime adjustments.
    *   **Granular Timber Level Control:** Explore if different modules could benefit from different Timber log levels for more fine-grained control *within Timber's framework*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize User Input Before Passing to Timber Logging](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_user_input_before_passing_to_timber_logging.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Pre-Timber Input Sanitization
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify User Input in Logs:** Find all places where user-controlled input is included in log messages passed to Timber methods (`Timber.d()`, `Timber.e()`, etc.).
    2.  **Implement Sanitization Functions:** Create or use functions to sanitize user input *before* it's passed to Timber. This includes encoding, escaping, or removing potentially harmful characters.
    3.  **Apply Sanitization Before Timber Calls:**  Ensure that user input is sanitized *before* being used as arguments in `Timber.d()`, `Timber.e()`, etc. calls.
    4.  **Context-Appropriate Sanitization:** Apply sanitization relevant to the log message context to avoid over-sanitization that obscures useful debugging information when using Timber.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Log Injection (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious code or manipulating log entries *via user input logged by Timber*.
    *   **Log Tampering (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of attackers altering log integrity *through user input logged by Timber*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Log Injection (High Impact):**  Significantly reduces log injection risk by neutralizing malicious input *before it's processed by Timber*.
    *   **Log Tampering (Medium Impact):**  Moderately reduces log tampering risk related to user input *logged via Timber*.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Not Implemented:** User input is generally logged directly via Timber without explicit sanitization.
    *   **Location:** Logging statements throughout the application using Timber.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Sanitization Functions for Timber Logging:** Develop and integrate input sanitization functions specifically for use *before Timber logging*.
    *   **Systematic Sanitization Before Timber:** Implement a systematic approach to ensure user input is sanitized *before every Timber logging call* across the codebase.
    *   **Developer Training on Timber Input Sanitization:** Train developers on the importance of sanitizing user input *before using Timber for logging*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Structure Log Messages for Timber to Minimize Injection Risk](./mitigation_strategies/structure_log_messages_for_timber_to_minimize_injection_risk.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Structured Logging with Timber
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Adopt Timber's Parameterized Logging:**  Shift from string concatenation to Timber's parameterized logging (e.g., `Timber.d("User ID: {}, Name: {}", userId, userName)`).
    2.  **Separate Data from Message Structure in Timber:** Structure log messages passed to Timber to clearly separate fixed message parts from variable data, especially user-controlled data.
    3.  **Consider Structured Formats with Timber (Indirectly):** While Timber itself doesn't enforce structured formats, using parameterized logging prepares for easier integration with structured logging systems later or within custom `Tree` implementations if needed.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Log Injection (Medium Severity):** Reduces log injection risk by making it harder to inject malicious code that is interpreted as part of the log message structure *when using Timber*.
    *   **Log Parsing Issues (Low Severity):** Improves log parsing reliability for logs generated by Timber.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Log Injection (Medium Impact):**  Moderately reduces log injection risk by improving log structure *in Timber logs*.
    *   **Log Parsing Issues (Low Impact):**  Slightly improves parsing of Timber logs.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** Parameterized logging is used in some areas with Timber, but string concatenation is still common.
    *   **Location:** Mixed usage across different modules using Timber.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Consistent Parameterized Logging with Timber:** Enforce consistent use of parameterized logging throughout the application *when using Timber*.
    *   **Code Style Guidelines for Timber Logging:** Update code style guidelines to emphasize structured logging and discourage string concatenation for log messages *passed to Timber*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Timber Library](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_timber_library.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Timber Library Updates

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerability Exploitation (Low Severity - for Timber itself):** While Timber is simple, updates address potential undiscovered vulnerabilities in Timber or its minimal dependencies.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerability Exploitation (Low Impact):**  Slightly reduces vulnerability exploitation risk by using the most up-to-date and potentially more secure version of Timber.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** Timber library updates are performed periodically, but not on a strict schedule.
    *   **Location:** Project dependency management files (e.g., `build.gradle`).
