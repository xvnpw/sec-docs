# Attack Surface Analysis for jakewharton/timber

## Attack Surface: [Log Injection](./attack_surfaces/log_injection.md)

* **Attack Surface: Log Injection**
    * **Description:** Malicious data is injected into log messages, potentially leading to misinterpretation or exploitation by log analysis tools or viewers.
    * **How Timber Contributes:** Timber directly accepts string inputs for log messages. If these inputs contain user-controlled data without proper sanitization, Timber will faithfully record the malicious content.
    * **Example:** An attacker provides the username `"; DROP TABLE users; --"` which is then logged using `Timber.d("User logged in: %s", username);`. A vulnerable log analysis tool might interpret this as a SQL command.
    * **Impact:** Log forgery, log poisoning, potential command injection on systems processing logs, cross-site scripting (XSS) in log viewers.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Sanitize or encode user-provided data before including it in log messages.
        * **Structured Logging:** Use structured logging formats (e.g., JSON) where data is treated as data, not executable code. Timber supports this through its `log` method with a `JSONObject` or similar.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom `Tree` Implementations](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom__tree__implementations.md)

* **Attack Surface: Vulnerabilities in Custom `Tree` Implementations**
    * **Description:** Security flaws exist within custom `Tree` implementations that handle log output in specific ways (e.g., writing to databases, sending to remote services).
    * **How Timber Contributes:** Timber's extensibility allows developers to create custom `Tree` classes. If these implementations are not developed with security in mind, they can introduce vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** A custom `DatabaseTree` directly executes SQL queries constructed from log message parameters without proper parameterization, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.
    * **Impact:** SQL injection, remote code execution (RCE) if interacting with external systems, denial of service (DoS) due to resource exhaustion in the `Tree`, information disclosure if the `Tree` mishandles sensitive data.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding guidelines when developing custom `Tree` implementations, especially when interacting with external systems or databases.
        * **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough security reviews of custom `Tree` implementations.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure custom `Tree` implementations have only the necessary permissions to perform their logging tasks.
        * **Input Validation within `Tree`:** Validate and sanitize data received within the custom `Tree` before processing it further.
