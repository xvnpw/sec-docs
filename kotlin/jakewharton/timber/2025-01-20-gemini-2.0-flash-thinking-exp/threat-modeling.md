# Threat Model Analysis for jakewharton/timber

## Threat: [Accidental Logging of Sensitive Data](./threats/accidental_logging_of_sensitive_data.md)

**Threat:** Accidental Logging of Sensitive Data

**Description:** An attacker who gains access to the application's logs (through compromised servers, insecure storage, or other means) can read sensitive information that was unintentionally logged by developers *using Timber's logging methods*. This could include passwords, API keys, personal identifiable information (PII), session tokens, or internal secrets passed as arguments to `Timber.d()`, `Timber.e()`, etc.

**Impact:**  Compromise of user accounts, data breaches, unauthorized access to systems, and violation of privacy regulations.

**Affected Timber Component:** Log Statements (calls to `Timber.d()`, `Timber.e()`, etc.) within the application code, potentially affecting any custom `Tree` implementations.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rigorous code review processes to identify and remove logging of sensitive data *through Timber*.
* Utilize Timber's `redact` functionality or create custom `Tree` implementations to automatically sanitize or mask sensitive information before logging *with Timber*.
* Educate developers on secure logging practices and the risks of logging sensitive data *using Timber*.
* Implement mechanisms to prevent logging of sensitive data by default *when using Timber*, requiring explicit opt-in for specific, non-sensitive information.

## Threat: [Overly Verbose Logging in Production](./threats/overly_verbose_logging_in_production.md)

**Threat:** Overly Verbose Logging in Production

**Description:** An attacker who gains access to production logs can glean detailed information about the application's internal workings, including potential vulnerabilities, system architecture, and data flow, due to debug or verbose logging levels being enabled *within Timber's configuration*. This information can be used to plan and execute more targeted attacks.

**Impact:** Increased attack surface, information leakage, potential for reverse engineering, and performance degradation due to excessive I/O *caused by Timber*.

**Affected Timber Component:** Timber's logging level configuration (e.g., setting the minimum log level for a `Tree`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure appropriate logging levels for different environments (e.g., error or warning levels in production) *within Timber*.
* Utilize build configurations or environment variables to dynamically control logging levels *applied to Timber*.
* Regularly review and adjust logging levels *in Timber* to ensure they are not overly verbose in production.
* Consider using separate logging destinations for different environments *configured for Timber*.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Timber Trees](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_timber_trees.md)

**Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Custom Timber Trees

**Description:** Developers might create custom `Tree` implementations to extend Timber's functionality. If these custom trees contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., insecure file handling, network communication without proper security), attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities *through the Timber logging pipeline*.

**Impact:**  Depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom `Tree`, potentially leading to information disclosure, remote code execution, or other security breaches.

**Affected Timber Component:** Custom `Tree` implementations.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly review and audit custom `Tree` implementations for security vulnerabilities.
* Follow secure coding practices when developing custom `Tree` implementations.
* Keep dependencies used within custom `Tree` implementations up to date.
* Consider the security implications before implementing complex logic within custom `Tree` implementations.
