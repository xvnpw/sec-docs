## Mitigation Strategy: [Custom Timber Trees for Automated Sanitization](./mitigation_strategies/custom_timber_trees_for_automated_sanitization.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Custom Timber Trees for Automated Sanitization
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create Custom `SanitizingTree` Class:** Develop a custom `Tree` class that extends Timber's `Tree` and overrides the `log()` method.
    2.  **Implement Sanitization Logic in `log()`:** Within the overridden `log()` method of the `SanitizingTree`, implement data sanitization logic. This can involve:
        *   **PII Removal:** Use regular expressions or string manipulation to remove or replace patterns matching PII (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers).
        *   **Financial Data Masking:** Mask credit card numbers, bank account numbers, and other financial identifiers by replacing most digits with asterisks.
        *   **Secret Redaction:**  Completely remove or replace API keys, passwords, tokens, and other secrets with placeholders like "[REDACTED]".
        *   **Configuration Filtering:** Filter out sensitive configuration parameters, logging only generic descriptions.
    3.  **Register `SanitizingTree` in Application:**  In your application's initialization code, register the `SanitizingTree` using `Timber.plant(new SanitizingTree())`. Ensure this is registered to process log messages.
    4.  **Centralized Sanitization:** This approach centralizes sanitization within the `SanitizingTree`, ensuring consistent application of sanitization rules across all Timber logging calls.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of accidentally logging and disclosing sensitive data through Timber.
    *   **Human Error in Sanitization (Medium Severity):** Mitigates the risk of developers forgetting to manually sanitize data before using Timber.
*   **Impact:**  Significantly reduces information disclosure risk by providing automated and consistent sanitization within the Timber logging pipeline.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Needs to be developed as a custom `Tree` and registered in the application's core module during startup.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Log Output Destinations in Production via Timber Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_log_output_destinations_in_production_via_timber_configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Restrict Log Output Destinations in Production via Timber Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Conditional Timber Tree Planting:** Use build variants or conditional logic to plant different Timber `Tree` implementations for debug and release builds.
    2.  **Remove `DebugTree` in Production:** In production builds, avoid planting the default `DebugTree` which logs to Logcat. This prevents logs from being written to potentially accessible system logs.
    3.  **Configure Production-Specific Trees (If Needed):** If production logging is required, plant custom `Tree` implementations that log to more secure destinations (e.g., internal logging systems, secure files with restricted access) instead of default system logs.
    4.  **Control Log Level via Timber:** Configure Timber's log level threshold programmatically or via configuration for production builds to be higher (e.g., `WARN`, `ERROR`, `ASSERT`). This reduces verbose logging in production.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Logcat (Medium Severity - Android):**  Reduces the risk of information disclosure through Android Logcat by preventing Timber from logging to it in production.
    *   **Excessive Logging (Low Severity):** Prevents unnecessary verbose logging in production by configuring Timber's log level.
*   **Impact:** Partially reduces information disclosure risk, especially on Android, and improves production performance by limiting verbose logging through Timber's configuration.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `DebugTree` is removed in release builds, but dynamic log level configuration via Timber is not fully implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to implement dynamic log level configuration for Timber based on build type or environment. Ensure production builds use a higher log level threshold within Timber's configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Appropriate Log Levels in Timber Calls](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_appropriate_log_levels_in_timber_calls.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize Appropriate Log Levels in Timber Calls
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Developer Training on Timber Log Levels:** Train developers on the proper use of Timber's log levels (`VERBOSE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `ASSERT`) and their implications for production security.
    2.  **Code Review for Timber Log Level Usage:** Incorporate code reviews specifically focused on verifying that developers are using appropriate Timber log levels for each logging statement.
    3.  **Restrict `VERBOSE` and `DEBUG` Timber Usage in Production Code:** Establish guidelines and enforce through code review that `VERBOSE` and `DEBUG` Timber log levels are primarily for development and should be avoided in production code paths unless absolutely necessary for critical troubleshooting and with extreme caution.
    4.  **Favor Higher Log Levels for Sensitive Contexts:** In code sections that handle sensitive data or critical operations, encourage the use of higher Timber log levels (like `WARN` or `ERROR`) only for exceptional conditions and avoid `INFO`, `DEBUG`, or `VERBOSE` in these areas unless strictly necessary and carefully sanitized.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure through Verbose Logs (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of accidentally logging sensitive information at verbose levels (`VERBOSE`, `DEBUG`) through Timber in production.
    *   **Log Noise and Analysis Difficulty (Low Severity):** Reduces log noise in production logs generated by Timber, making it easier to analyze logs for genuine issues.
*   **Impact:** Partially reduces information disclosure risk and improves log analysis efficiency by promoting responsible Timber log level usage.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. General guidelines exist, but consistent enforcement and review of Timber log level usage are lacking.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to implement stricter code review processes to specifically check and enforce appropriate Timber log level usage in all code modules. Provide developers with clear, Timber-specific guidelines on log level selection.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Sanitization Before Timber Logging Calls](./mitigation_strategies/data_sanitization_before_timber_logging_calls.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Data Sanitization Before Timber Logging Calls
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data for Timber Logging:** Developers must identify sensitive data that might be passed to Timber logging methods.
    2.  **Implement Sanitization Functions for Timber:** Create dedicated functions or modules specifically designed to sanitize data *before* it is passed to Timber. These functions should handle:
        *   **PII Removal for Timber:** Remove or redact PII before logging with Timber.
        *   **Financial Data Masking for Timber:** Mask financial data before logging with Timber.
        *   **Secret Redaction for Timber:** Redact secrets before logging with Timber.
    3.  **Apply Sanitization Before Every Timber Call:** Developers must ensure these sanitization functions are called *immediately before* any sensitive data is passed as arguments to Timber's logging methods (e.g., `Timber.d(sanitize(sensitiveData))`).
    4.  **Code Review Focus on Timber Sanitization:** Code reviews should specifically verify that sanitization is applied correctly and consistently *before* every Timber logging call that might involve sensitive data.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Prevents sensitive data from being logged by Timber, thus mitigating information disclosure risks.
    *   **Compliance Violations (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of logging PII or financial data in violation of data privacy regulations when using Timber.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces information disclosure and compliance violation risks by ensuring data is sanitized *before* it is processed by Timber.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic sanitization for user IDs is sometimes applied before Timber calls in the authentication module.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Missing comprehensive and consistent sanitization applied *before* Timber calls for financial data, API keys, and PII across all relevant modules. Need to enforce sanitization as a standard practice before using Timber for potentially sensitive data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strip Timber Logging Code in Release Builds (ProGuard/R8 Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/strip_timber_logging_code_in_release_builds__proguardr8_configuration_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strip Timber Logging Code in Release Builds via ProGuard/R8 Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure ProGuard/R8 Rules for Timber Removal:**  Specifically configure ProGuard or R8 rules to identify and remove Timber library code and all Timber logging calls during the build process for release builds.
    2.  **Target Timber Classes and Methods:** Define ProGuard/R8 rules that target Timber classes (like `timber.log.Timber`) and methods (like `Timber.d()`, `Timber.e()`, `Timber.plant()`) for removal.
    3.  **Verify Timber Code Stripping in Release APK:** After configuration, verify that Timber code and logging calls are effectively removed from the generated release APK or application package.
    4.  **Evaluate Trade-offs for Timber Removal:** Carefully consider the trade-offs of completely removing Timber. This eliminates production logging capabilities, which might be needed for troubleshooting. This strategy is most suitable for applications with extremely high security sensitivity where log exposure risk outweighs the need for production logging via Timber.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **All Timber-Related Log Threats (High Severity):**  Eliminates all threats related to information disclosure, log injection, and unauthorized access *specifically through Timber logs*, as Timber code is removed from production.
*   **Impact:** Maximally reduces all Timber-related log security risks by removing Timber from production builds, but at the cost of losing production logging functionality provided by Timber.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. ProGuard/R8 is used for general code shrinking, but not specifically configured to remove Timber.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to add specific ProGuard/R8 rules to strip Timber library code from release builds. Thoroughly evaluate the implications of removing Timber before implementing this strategy.
