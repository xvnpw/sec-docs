## Attack Tree Path: [1. High-Risk Path: Exploit Logging of Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/1__high-risk_path_exploit_logging_of_sensitive_data.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Unintentional Logging:**
        * **Developer Mistake in Logging Code:**
            * Developers inadvertently include sensitive data (PII, secrets, business logic) in log messages during development or debugging.
            * Examples:
                * Logging request or response bodies without sanitization.
                * Logging user input directly.
                * Using verbose logging levels in production that expose internal variables.
        * **Intentional (but Misguided) Logging in Production:**
            * Developers enable verbose logging in production environments to troubleshoot issues.
            * They forget to disable verbose logging after debugging, leaving sensitive data exposed in production logs.
            * Example:
                * Temporarily enabling `DebugTree` in production to capture detailed logs for error analysis.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Critical Node: Exploit Logging of Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/2__critical_node_exploit_logging_of_sensitive_data.md)

* **Why Critical:**
    * This is the primary attack vector related to Timber's core functionality - logging.
    * Successful exploitation can lead to direct exposure of sensitive information.
    * It is a root cause for multiple high-risk paths.
* **Associated Attack Vectors:**
    * All vectors listed under "High-Risk Path: Exploit Logging of Sensitive Data" are directly associated with this critical node.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. High-Risk Path: Unintentional Logging of Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/3__high-risk_path_unintentional_logging_of_sensitive_data.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Developer Mistake in Logging Code (Detailed):**
        * **Lack of Awareness:** Developers may not be fully aware of what constitutes sensitive data or the risks of logging it.
        * **Copy-Paste Errors:**  Copying and pasting code snippets from debugging sessions into production code without removing verbose logging statements.
        * **Insufficient Code Review:** Code reviews may not specifically focus on identifying and removing sensitive data from log messages.
        * **Dynamic Logging Configurations:** Complex or poorly understood logging configurations can lead to unintended logging of sensitive data in certain scenarios.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Critical Node: Developer Mistake in Logging Code](./attack_tree_paths/4__critical_node_developer_mistake_in_logging_code.md)

* **Why Critical:**
    * This is the direct action that leads to unintentional logging of sensitive data.
    * It is a common human error and difficult to completely eliminate.
    * Mitigation strategies must focus on prevention, detection, and remediation of these mistakes.
* **Associated Attack Vectors:**
    * All vectors listed under "High-Risk Path: Unintentional Logging of Sensitive Data" and its detailed breakdown are associated with this critical node.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. High-Risk Path: Intentional (but Misguided) Logging of Sensitive Data in Production](./attack_tree_paths/5__high-risk_path_intentional__but_misguided__logging_of_sensitive_data_in_production.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Emergency Debugging:** In urgent situations, developers may resort to quick and dirty debugging methods, including enabling verbose logging in production without proper planning or security considerations.
    * **Lack of Process:** Absence of clear procedures for production debugging and logging management.
    * **Forgotten Configurations:**  Temporary logging configurations enabled for debugging are not properly disabled or reverted after the issue is resolved.
    * **Insufficient Monitoring:** Lack of monitoring to detect when verbose logging is enabled in production or when sensitive data is being logged.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Critical Node: Exploit Custom Timber Trees](./attack_tree_paths/6__critical_node_exploit_custom_timber_trees.md)

* **Why Critical:**
    * Custom Trees extend Timber's functionality but also introduce new attack surfaces.
    * Malicious or vulnerable custom Trees can bypass standard Timber security considerations.
    * Exploitation can lead to significant impact, including data exfiltration and system compromise.
* **Associated Attack Vectors:**
    * **Malicious Custom Tree Implementation:**
        * **Supply Chain Attack (Compromised Dependency):**
            * Attacker compromises a dependency used by a custom Tree.
            * The compromised dependency contains malicious code that is executed when the custom Tree is used.
            * Example: A logging library used for formatting within a custom Tree is backdoored.
        * **Insider Threat (Malicious Developer):**
            * A rogue developer intentionally creates a custom Tree with malicious functionality.
            * The malicious Tree could exfiltrate logs to an attacker-controlled server, inject malicious code, or perform other harmful actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Critical Node: Malicious Custom Tree Implementation](./attack_tree_paths/7__critical_node_malicious_custom_tree_implementation.md)

* **Why Critical:**
    * Represents a deliberate attempt to subvert the logging mechanism for malicious purposes.
    * Can be very difficult to detect if the malicious Tree is well-disguised.
    * Can have severe consequences, including complete system compromise.
* **Associated Attack Vectors:**
    * **Supply Chain Attack (Compromised Dependency)**
    * **Insider Threat (Malicious Developer)**

## Attack Tree Path: [8. High-Risk Path: Exploit Log Storage and Access](./attack_tree_paths/8__high-risk_path_exploit_log_storage_and_access.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Insecure Log Storage Location:**
        * **Logs Stored in Publicly Accessible Directory:**
            * Logs are written to directories accessible via the web server (e.g., `public_html`, `wwwroot`).
            * Attackers can directly access log files by browsing to predictable URLs.
        * **Logs Stored in Unprotected Cloud Storage:**
            * Logs are sent to cloud storage services (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage) with overly permissive access policies.
            * Attackers can enumerate and access these storage buckets if permissions are misconfigured.
        * **Logs Stored on Shared File System with Weak Permissions:**
            * Logs are written to network shares with weak access controls, allowing unauthorized users within the internal network to access them.
    * **Inadequate Access Control to Logs:**
        * **Weak Authentication/Authorization for Log Access:**
            * Log management systems or interfaces have weak passwords, default credentials, or easily bypassed authentication mechanisms.
            * Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the log management system and view all logs.
        * **Lack of Auditing of Log Access:**
            * No logging or monitoring of who accesses logs.
            * Makes it difficult to detect and investigate unauthorized log access or data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [9. Critical Node: Insecure Log Storage Location](./attack_tree_paths/9__critical_node_insecure_log_storage_location.md)

* **Why Critical:**
    * Direct exposure of logs if storage is misconfigured.
    * Relatively easy to exploit if logs are in publicly accessible locations.
    * Negates any security efforts made in logging practices if the storage itself is insecure.
* **Associated Attack Vectors:**
    * **Logs Stored in Publicly Accessible Directory**
    * **Logs Stored in Unprotected Cloud Storage**
    * **Logs Stored on Shared File System with Weak Permissions**

## Attack Tree Path: [10. Critical Node: Inadequate Access Control to Logs](./attack_tree_paths/10__critical_node_inadequate_access_control_to_logs.md)

* **Why Critical:**
    * Allows unauthorized access to logs even if storage location is somewhat secure.
    * Weak access controls are a common vulnerability in many systems.
    * Lack of auditing hinders detection and response to log-related security incidents.
* **Associated Attack Vectors:**
    * **Weak Authentication/Authorization for Log Access**
    * **Lack of Auditing of Log Access**

## Attack Tree Path: [11. Critical Node: Weak Authentication/Authorization for Log Access](./attack_tree_paths/11__critical_node_weak_authenticationauthorization_for_log_access.md)

* **Why Critical:**
    * A common and easily exploitable vulnerability.
    * Provides attackers with broad access to potentially all logs.
    * Can be exploited with relatively low skill and effort.

## Attack Tree Path: [12. Critical Node: Lack of Auditing of Log Access](./attack_tree_paths/12__critical_node_lack_of_auditing_of_log_access.md)

* **Why Critical:**
    * While not a direct attack vector itself, it significantly hinders security.
    * Makes it difficult to detect breaches, investigate incidents, and establish accountability.
    * Increases the overall risk by reducing visibility into log access activities.
