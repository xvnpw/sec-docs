# Threat Model Analysis for jakewharton/timber

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Logs](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_logs.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain access to log files or logging aggregation systems where sensitive data has been inadvertently logged *using Timber*. This access could be due to insecure storage, misconfigured access controls, or a breach of the logging infrastructure. The attacker could then read this sensitive information logged via `Timber.d()`, `Timber.e()`, etc.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, potential identity theft, financial loss, reputational damage, legal and regulatory penalties due to exposure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or other protected data.

**Affected Timber Component:** `Timber.d()`, `Timber.i()`, `Timber.w()`, `Timber.e()`, `Timber.v()` (all logging methods). The core logging functionality of `Timber` is the direct mechanism for this threat.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict policies against logging sensitive data using `Timber`.
* Sanitize or redact sensitive information before logging with `Timber`.
* Utilize appropriate logging levels in `Timber`, reserving verbose levels for development environments only.

## Threat: [Insecure Custom Tree Implementations](./threats/insecure_custom_tree_implementations.md)

**Description:** Developers can create custom `Tree` implementations within `Timber` to direct logs to various destinations. If a custom `Tree` is implemented insecurely, it could introduce vulnerabilities. For example, a custom `Tree` might write logs to an insecurely configured file, expose logs over a network without proper authentication, or be susceptible to injection attacks itself. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain access to logs handled by the custom `Tree` or compromise the system where the custom `Tree` is running.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to logs, potential for remote code execution or other attacks depending on the custom `Tree`'s functionality and the vulnerabilities introduced.

**Affected Timber Component:** `Timber.Tree` (the abstract class), custom classes extending `Timber.Tree`. The security of this component depends entirely on developer implementation within the `Timber` framework.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly review and test custom `Tree` implementations for security vulnerabilities.
* Adhere to secure coding practices when developing custom `Tree` classes within `Timber`.
* Ensure proper authentication and authorization for any external log destinations used by custom `Tree`s.
* Avoid storing sensitive data in logs handled by custom `Tree`s unless absolutely necessary and with appropriate security measures.

## Threat: [Accidental Information Leaks through Debug Logging in Production](./threats/accidental_information_leaks_through_debug_logging_in_production.md)

**Description:** If debug-level logging (`Timber.v()`, `Timber.d()`) is unintentionally left enabled in production builds using `Timber`, it can expose internal application details, debugging information, or sensitive data that would not normally be present in production logs. An attacker gaining access to these logs could leverage this information to understand the application's inner workings, identify potential vulnerabilities, or gain unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, providing attackers with valuable insights into the application due to `Timber`'s verbose output, potential exploitation of identified vulnerabilities, increased attack surface.

**Affected Timber Component:** `Timber.plant()` (the configuration of `Tree` instances for different build types), `Timber.DebugTree` (if used inappropriately in production), `Timber.v()`, `Timber.d()`. The configuration and usage of logging levels within `Timber` are critical here.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust build configurations to ensure debug logging in `Timber` is disabled in production builds.
* Utilize different `Timber.plant()` configurations for debug and release builds.
* Avoid using `Timber.DebugTree` directly in production environments.
* Regularly audit `Timber` logging configurations to ensure appropriate levels are set for each environment.
