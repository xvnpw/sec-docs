# Attack Surface Analysis for jakewharton/timber

## Attack Surface: [Log Injection](./attack_surfaces/log_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious data into log messages, which can be interpreted as commands or code when viewed in log systems.
* **How Timber Contributes:** Timber provides the mechanism for logging data. If untrusted input is directly passed to Timber's logging methods without sanitization, it becomes vulnerable to injection.
* **Example:**
    *  A user provides input like `"; rm -rf / #"` in a field that gets logged.
    *  When viewing the logs in a system that doesn't sanitize output, this could potentially execute the dangerous command.
* **Impact:**
    * Log tampering (injecting false information).
    * Denial of Service (DoS) by injecting excessively long strings.
    * Potential for command execution or script injection depending on the log viewing system's capabilities.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Sanitize User Input:**  Always sanitize or encode user-provided data before logging it.
    * **Use Parameterized Logging:** If the logging infrastructure supports it, use parameterized logging to separate data from the log message structure.

## Attack Surface: [Sensitive Data Exposure through Logs](./attack_surfaces/sensitive_data_exposure_through_logs.md)

**Description:** Developers unintentionally log sensitive information (API keys, passwords, PII) using Timber.
* **How Timber Contributes:** Timber is the tool used to write these sensitive details into the logs.
* **Example:**
    *  `Timber.d("User authentication details: username=%s, password=%s", username, password);`
    *  This logs the user's password in plain text.
* **Impact:**
    * Data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    * Compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
    * Reputational damage.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Avoid Logging Sensitive Data:**  Never log sensitive information directly.
    * **Redact Sensitive Data:** If logging sensitive data is absolutely necessary (for debugging purposes only and in non-production environments), redact or mask the sensitive parts before logging.
    * **Use Appropriate Logging Levels:** Ensure sensitive information is not logged at verbose levels (like `DEBUG`) in production builds.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Custom `Tree` Implementations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_custom__tree__implementations.md)

**Description:** Developers create custom `Tree` implementations for Timber that introduce security vulnerabilities.
* **How Timber Contributes:** Timber's extensibility allows developers to create custom `Tree` classes to handle log output in various ways (e.g., writing to files, sending to remote servers). Insecure implementations of these can be a risk.
* **Example:**
    * A custom `Tree` writes logs to a file with world-readable permissions.
    * A custom `Tree` sends logs to a remote server over an unencrypted connection (HTTP).
* **Impact:**
    * Data breaches due to insecure log storage.
    * Man-in-the-middle attacks if logs are transmitted insecurely.
    * Potential for remote code execution if the custom `Tree` interacts with a vulnerable logging service.
* **Risk Severity:** Medium to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices when implementing custom `Tree` classes.
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:** If the custom `Tree` processes data before logging or transmitting, ensure proper validation and sanitization.
    * **Secure Communication:** Use secure protocols (HTTPS, TLS) for transmitting logs to remote servers.
