## Attack Tree Path: [Infiltrate Log Data - Log Injection](./attack_tree_paths/infiltrate_log_data_-_log_injection.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Inject Malicious Payloads via Logged User Input
    *   **Description:** When user-provided data is logged without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious code that is later interpreted in a harmful way.
    *   **Action:** Inject XSS payloads that get rendered in a log viewer.
        *   **Details:** If a log viewing interface displays log messages without proper encoding, injected JavaScript code can be executed in the context of the viewer's browser, potentially leading to account compromise of users viewing the logs or further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Infiltrate Log Data - Log File Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/infiltrate_log_data_-_log_file_manipulation.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploit Insecure Log File Storage
    *   **Description:** If log files are stored in publicly accessible locations or with overly permissive access controls, attackers can directly access and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.
    *   **Action:** Access publicly accessible log files containing sensitive information. **CRITICAL NODE:**
        *   **Details:** Attackers can directly read log files to discover sensitive data like credentials, API keys, or user information if these are inadvertently logged and the files are accessible.

## Attack Tree Path: [Infiltrate Log Data - Log Data Interception](./attack_tree_paths/infiltrate_log_data_-_log_data_interception.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploit Insecure Log Transmission
    *   **Description:** When log data is transmitted over insecure channels, such as an unencrypted network, attackers can intercept the communication and gain access to the log contents.
    *   **Action:** Intercept logs sent over insecure channels (e.g., unencrypted network). **CRITICAL NODE:**
        *   **Details:** Using network sniffing tools, attackers can capture log data as it travels across the network, potentially revealing sensitive information contained within the logs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Information Disclosure via Logs - Extract Sensitive Information - Analyze Logged Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_information_disclosure_via_logs_-_extract_sensitive_information_-_analyze_logged_credential_545acda2.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Extract Sensitive Information
    *   **Description:** Logs often unintentionally contain sensitive information that, if accessed by an attacker, can lead to significant compromise.
    *   **Action:** Analyze Logged Credentials **CRITICAL NODE:**
        *   **Details:** Attackers can scan log files for patterns resembling usernames and passwords or other authentication tokens. If found, these credentials can be used to gain unauthorized access to the application or related systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Information Disclosure via Logs - Extract Sensitive Information - Analyze Logged API Keys/Tokens](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_information_disclosure_via_logs_-_extract_sensitive_information_-_analyze_logged_api_keysto_d8f00a0a.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Extract Sensitive Information
    *   **Description:** Logs often unintentionally contain sensitive information that, if accessed by an attacker, can lead to significant compromise.
    *   **Action:** Analyze Logged API Keys/Tokens **CRITICAL NODE:**
        *   **Details:** Similar to credentials, API keys or tokens that are inadvertently logged can be extracted and used to access external services or resources that the application interacts with.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Information Disclosure via Logs - Extract Sensitive Information - Analyze Logged User Data](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_information_disclosure_via_logs_-_extract_sensitive_information_-_analyze_logged_user_data.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Extract Sensitive Information
    *   **Description:** Logs often unintentionally contain sensitive information that, if accessed by an attacker, can lead to significant compromise.
    *   **Action:** Analyze Logged User Data **CRITICAL NODE:**
        *   **Details:** Logs might contain personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive user data that, if exposed, can lead to privacy violations, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.
