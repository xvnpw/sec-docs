# Attack Surface Analysis for jakewharton/timber

## Attack Surface: [1. Log Injection/Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/1__log_injectionmanipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious content into log entries by exploiting insufficient input validation or encoding when user-supplied data is used in logging statements.
    *   **How Timber Contributes:** Timber is the *direct mechanism* through which the injected data is written to the logs. While the root cause is improper input handling, Timber is the point of execution for the malicious input.
    *   **Example:**
        ```java
        String userInput = request.getParameter("comment"); // Untrusted input
        Timber.e("Failed to process comment: " + userInput); // Vulnerable!
        //If userInput contains:  "; DROP TABLE users; --" or javascript code
        ```
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Log Forgery (creating false entries, potentially to cover tracks)
        *   Log Poisoning (disrupting log analysis, potentially leading to DoS of analysis tools)
        *   Indirect Data Exfiltration (revealing sensitive data if it's already present in memory due to *other* vulnerabilities)
        *   Indirect Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if logs are displayed in a web UI without proper escaping (vulnerability in the *viewer*, but Timber is the conduit).
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** (Potentially Critical if it leads to data exfiltration or XSS in a sensitive context).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Rigorously validate *all* user-supplied data before using it anywhere, including logging. Use whitelisting where possible. This is the *most important* mitigation.
        *   **Output Encoding:** Encode data appropriately for the logging context (e.g., escaping special characters).
        *   **Parameterized Logging:** *Always* use Timber's parameterized logging: `Timber.e("Failed to process comment: %s", userInput);` This prevents the direct concatenation of untrusted input.
        *   **Avoid Logging Sensitive Data:** Minimize logging of sensitive information to reduce the impact of any potential exposure.

## Attack Surface: [2. Information Disclosure via Overly Verbose Logging](./attack_surfaces/2__information_disclosure_via_overly_verbose_logging.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information (PII, credentials, internal system details) is inadvertently exposed in log files due to excessive or careless logging.
    *   **How Timber Contributes:** Timber is the *direct tool* used to write the sensitive information to the logs. The vulnerability is in the *decision* of what to log, but Timber executes that decision.
    *   **Example:**
        ```java
        Timber.d("User object: " + user.toString()); // If user object contains sensitive data (PII, etc.).
        Timber.e("Database connection error", exception); // If exception contains a connection string with a password.
        ```
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure of PII (leading to privacy breaches and potential legal consequences)
        *   Exposure of Internal System Details (aiding attackers in understanding the system and finding further vulnerabilities)
        *   Exposure of Credentials (passwords, API keys â€“ a *critical* security risk)
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** (Potentially Critical depending on the specific data exposed; credential exposure is *always* critical).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Data Minimization:** Log only the information that is *absolutely essential* for debugging and operational needs.  Err on the side of logging *less*.
        *   **Data Masking/Redaction:** Implement mechanisms to mask or redact sensitive data *before* it is passed to Timber. This might involve custom formatters or pre-processing steps.  This is a *crucial* mitigation.
        *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review code (and any libraries used) to identify and prevent the logging of sensitive data.  Make this a standard part of the code review process.
        *   **Security Audits:** Regularly audit logging practices and log content to ensure compliance with security policies and to detect any accidental exposure.
