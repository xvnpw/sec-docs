## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Mitigation Strategy: Data Masking/Redaction (using a Custom `Tree`)](./mitigation_strategies/1__mitigation_strategy_data_maskingredaction__using_a_custom__tree__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Create a comprehensive list of all sensitive data types that *might* be logged.
    2.  **Create a Custom `Tree`:** Subclass `Timber.Tree` to create a custom logging tree. This is the core of this strategy, as it intercepts *all* log messages *within Timber*.
    3.  **Implement Redaction Logic:** Inside the `log()` method of your custom `Tree`, implement the redaction logic:
        *   Use regular expressions or a dedicated library to match sensitive data patterns.
        *   Replace matched patterns with placeholders.
        *   Thoroughly test the redaction logic.
    4.  **Plant the Custom `Tree`:** Replace any default `Timber.plant()` calls with your custom `Tree`.  Example: `Timber.plant(new MyRedactingTree());`
    5.  **Regularly Review and Update:** Periodically review the list of sensitive data types and the redaction logic.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure (Severity: High):** Prevents accidental logging of sensitive information.
    *   **Log Injection (Severity: Medium):** Provides a secondary layer of defense by redacting potentially malicious payloads that match redaction patterns.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **Log Injection:** Provides some mitigation, but input validation is the primary defense.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in `AuthService.java` with basic password redaction *before* calling `Timber.d()`. This is *not* a Timber-centric solution.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A centralized, custom `Tree` is missing. Redaction should be handled *within* Timber.
    *   Redaction logic is incomplete.
    *   No regular review process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Mitigation Strategy: Structured Logging (with a Custom `Tree` for Enforcement)](./mitigation_strategies/2__mitigation_strategy_structured_logging__with_a_custom__tree__for_enforcement_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Log Event Classes:** Create specific classes to represent different types of log events.
    2.  **Define Allowed Fields:** Within each event class, define *only* the fields that are permitted to be logged.
    3.  **Create a Custom `Tree` (Enforcement):** Create a custom `Tree` that *enforces* the use of these event classes. This is the key Timber-related step.
        *   In the `log()` method, check the type of the logged object.
        *   Only allow specific classes or fields to be logged.
        *   Reject or modify log messages that don't conform to the structured logging format.
    4.  **Modify Logging Calls:** Replace free-form text logging calls with calls that use the defined event classes.
    5.  **Serialization Control (within the Custom `Tree`):** Control how event objects are serialized to strings (e.g., using a JSON library) within the custom `Tree`. Ensure only allowed fields are included.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure (Severity: High):** Strictly controls the data that can be logged.
    *   **Log Injection (Severity: Low):** Makes it slightly harder to inject arbitrary data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** High impact.
    *   **Log Injection:** Minor impact.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No defined log event classes.
    *   No custom `Tree` to enforce structured logging *within Timber*.
    *   All logging calls need refactoring.

## Mitigation Strategy: [3. Mitigation Strategy: Dynamic Logging Level Control (using Timber's Planting)](./mitigation_strategies/3__mitigation_strategy_dynamic_logging_level_control__using_timber's_planting_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Configuration Mechanism:** Decide how to control logging levels dynamically (e.g., config file, environment variables).
    2.  **Implement a Configuration Loader:** Create a component to load the logging configuration.
    3.  **Integrate with Timber:** Modify your Timber setup (in application initialization) to read the logging level from the configuration.  This is the Timber-specific part:
        *   You might need to *unplant* existing trees: `Timber.uprootAll();`
        *   Then, *re-plant* your `Tree` (or trees) with the desired level: `Timber.plant(new Timber.DebugTree());` or `if (logLevel >= Log.INFO) { Timber.plant(new MyInfoTree()); }`
    4.  **Implement Configuration Change Mechanism:** Provide a way to safely modify the configuration.
    5. **Consider a Watcher (Optional):** For file-based configurations, consider a file watcher.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Excessive Logging/Storage (Severity: Medium):** Allows reducing logging verbosity.
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure (Severity: Medium):** Reduces the risk by lowering the logging level in production.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Excessive Logging/Storage:** Medium impact.
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Medium impact.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No mechanism for dynamically changing logging levels. The entire implementation is missing. The key missing piece is the dynamic `Timber.plant()` and `Timber.uprootAll()` calls based on configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [4. Mitigation Strategy: Custom `Tree` for Log Rotation (If Writing to Files Directly)](./mitigation_strategies/4__mitigation_strategy_custom__tree__for_log_rotation__if_writing_to_files_directly_.md)

*   **Description:**
   *This strategy is *only* relevant if you are using a custom `Tree` that writes directly to files, *bypassing* any platform-provided logging system.*
    1.  **Choose a Rotation Strategy:** Decide how to rotate log files (size, time, or both).
    2.  **Implement Rotation Logic (within the Custom `Tree`):** This is entirely within the custom `Tree`'s `log()` method:
        *   Check the file size or date/time.
        *   If rotation criteria are met:
            *   Close the current file.
            *   Create a new file (with a timestamped name).
            *   Update the `Tree` to write to the new file.
    3.  **(Separate Task) Implement Deletion:** Create a *separate* scheduled task (not part of Timber) to delete old log files. This is *not* a Timber-specific task.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Excessive Logging/Storage (Severity: Medium):** Prevents log files from growing indefinitely.
    *   **Data Retention Issues (Severity: Medium):** Facilitates compliance with data retention policies (though the deletion itself is a separate task).
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure (Severity: Low):** Reduces the window of opportunity for access to old data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Excessive Logging/Storage:** High impact.
    *   **Data Retention Issues:** High impact (for compliance).
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Low impact.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic log rotation is configured through the Android logging system (for `Timber.DebugTree()`), but this strategy is about *custom* trees.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   If any custom `Tree` writes directly to files, full rotation logic *within that `Tree`* is missing.
    *   Automated, secure deletion (a separate task) is also missing.
