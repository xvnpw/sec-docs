## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Logging](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__via_excessive_logging.md)

*   **1.1 Disk Space Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **Description:** This attack path aims to exhaust available disk space by causing the application to generate an excessive volume of log data. This leads to application failure when the system can no longer write to the log files.
    *   **1.1.1 Trigger Excessive Logging Calls (Application Logic Flaw) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** This is the core vulnerability that enables disk space exhaustion.  An attacker exploits a flaw in the application's logic to trigger a large number of logging calls.
        *   **1.1.1.1 Exploit application bug that causes repeated, unnecessary logging in a tight loop.**
            *   **Description:**  The attacker identifies and exploits a specific bug, such as an infinite loop or uncontrolled recursion, that includes logging statements.  This causes the application to rapidly generate log entries, filling the disk.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on application quality and the presence of exploitable bugs)
            *   **Impact:** High (Application outage due to inability to write logs)
            *   **Effort:** Low (If a suitable bug is already present and easily exploitable)
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Requires the ability to find and exploit application bugs)
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Resource monitoring would reveal high disk I/O and rapidly decreasing free space)

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack path focuses on obtaining sensitive information that is improperly logged by the application.
*   **2.1 Sensitive Data Leakage in Logs [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** This is the primary vulnerability within the information disclosure path. It occurs when the application logs sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII), credentials, API keys, or other confidential information.
    *   **2.1.1 Application Logs Sensitive Data (PII, Credentials, etc.) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** This is the specific scenario where the application's code directly logs sensitive data.
        *   **2.1.1.1 Exploit application logic flaw where sensitive data is inadvertently passed to Timber.log() calls.**
            *   **Description:** The attacker leverages a flaw in the application's logic where sensitive data is, either intentionally or unintentionally, passed as an argument to Timber's logging methods (e.g., `Timber.d()`, `Timber.e()`, etc.). This data is then written to the log files.
            *   **Likelihood:** High (Unfortunately, this is a common mistake in application development)
            *   **Impact:** Very High (Can lead to data breaches, identity theft, financial loss, and reputational damage)
            *   **Effort:** Very Low (Once the sensitive data is in the logs, it's easily accessible if the attacker gains access to the log files)
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice (Requires minimal technical skill; simply needs to find and read the log files)
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Requires careful log analysis and a clear understanding of what constitutes sensitive data.  Automated tools can help, but manual review is often necessary)
