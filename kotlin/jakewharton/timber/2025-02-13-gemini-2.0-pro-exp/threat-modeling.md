# Threat Model Analysis for jakewharton/timber

## Threat: [Threat: Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs](./threats/threat_sensitive_data_exposure_in_logs.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to log files and extracts sensitive information that was inadvertently logged by the application *through Timber*. This assumes the attacker has already gained access to the logs; the threat here is the *presence* of sensitive data *because* of how Timber was used. The attacker might exploit a separate vulnerability to get the logs, but the core issue is that Timber was used to record the sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, privacy violations (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, etc.), reputational damage, financial loss, potential for further attacks (credential stuffing, identity theft).
*   **Timber Component Affected:** Primarily `Timber.Tree` implementations (especially the default `DebugTree` if used in production), and any custom `Tree` implementations that don't properly handle sensitive data. The `log()` method and its variants across all `Tree` implementations are the points of entry for data.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Data Minimization:** Log only the *absolute minimum* necessary information via Timber. Avoid logging entire objects or data structures.
    *   **Data Masking/Sanitization:** Implement a custom `Timber.Tree` that intercepts log messages *before they are written* and redacts or masks sensitive data. This is a *Timber-specific* mitigation.
    *   **Log Level Discipline:** Strictly adhere to log levels. Never use `DEBUG` or `VERBOSE` in production unless absolutely necessary, and ensure any planted `DebugTree` instances are removed or appropriately configured for production.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Enforce mandatory code reviews with a focus on identifying potential sensitive data logging *calls to Timber*.
    *   **Training:** Educate developers on secure logging practices *specifically related to Timber's API*.

## Threat: [Threat: Log Injection (Log Forging) - *If Timber is used to log unsanitized input*](./threats/threat_log_injection__log_forging__-_if_timber_is_used_to_log_unsanitized_input.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious content into log messages *by manipulating input that is directly passed to Timber's logging methods*. This is only a direct Timber threat if the application fails to sanitize input *before* passing it to Timber. If sanitization happens before the Timber call, this becomes a general application security issue, not a Timber-specific one.
*   **Impact:** Compromised log integrity, making incident response unreliable. Potential for XSS or other injection attacks if the log viewer is vulnerable (but that's a separate threat related to the viewer, not Timber itself).
*   **Timber Component Affected:** Any `Timber.Tree` implementation that logs user-supplied input without prior sanitization. The `log()` method and its variants are the entry points.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation & Sanitization (Prior to Timber):** *Crucially*, validate and sanitize *all* user-supplied input *before* it is passed to any `Timber.log()` call. This is the primary defense and shifts the responsibility away from Timber itself.
    *   **Parameterized Logging (Workaround):** While Timber doesn't have built-in parameterized logging, construct log messages carefully to avoid direct concatenation of unsanitized input with the logged string.  For example, instead of `Timber.d("User input: " + userInput)`, use separate log statements or carefully format the message.

## Threat: [Threat: Dependency Vulnerabilities (Directly in Timber)](./threats/threat_dependency_vulnerabilities__directly_in_timber_.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability is discovered *within the Timber library itself*. This is distinct from vulnerabilities in *other* application dependencies. An attacker exploits this Timber-specific vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure to, in a worst-case scenario, remote code execution (though less likely given Timber's purpose).
*   **Timber Component Affected:** The entire Timber library or specific modules within it.
*   **Risk Severity:** Potentially Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Timber updated to the latest version. This is the *most direct* mitigation for vulnerabilities *within* Timber.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use SCA tools, but be aware that they primarily focus on *identifying* the vulnerability; updating Timber is the *action* to take.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories specifically for Timber.
