# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Simplify Android UI event handling for developers using RxJava.
  - Improve developer productivity by providing a reactive programming approach to Android UI events.
  - Enhance code readability and maintainability in Android applications that utilize reactive programming paradigms.
  - Reduce boilerplate code associated with traditional Android event listeners.

- Business Risks:
  - Dependency risk: Introducing a third-party library dependency into Android projects, which could become a single point of failure or introduce vulnerabilities if the library is not actively maintained or contains security flaws.
  - Integration risk: Potential for incompatibility or conflicts with other libraries or frameworks used in Android projects.
  - Adoption risk: Developers may not fully understand or correctly use RxBinding, leading to improper implementation and potential issues in applications.
  - Maintenance risk: If the library becomes unmaintained, it could become outdated and incompatible with newer versions of Android or RxJava, requiring migration or replacement efforts in dependent projects.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Project - The project is hosted on GitHub, allowing for public scrutiny of the code and contributions from the community.
  - security control: Code Review - Changes to the codebase are typically reviewed through pull requests on GitHub, providing a level of peer review.
  - security control: Dependency Management - The project uses Gradle for dependency management, allowing for control over included libraries and their versions.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on external dependencies - The library depends on RxJava and Android SDK, inheriting any potential vulnerabilities present in these dependencies.
  - accepted risk: Community-driven security - Security relies on the vigilance of the open-source community to identify and report vulnerabilities.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - recommended security control: Automated Dependency Scanning - Implement automated tools to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities during the build process.
  - recommended security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically analyze the codebase for potential security flaws.
  - recommended security control: Regular Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits of the codebase, especially before major releases, to proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
  - recommended security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Policy - Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a public disclosure policy.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a library. Authentication is the responsibility of the applications that use RxBinding.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a library. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications that use RxBinding.
  - Input Validation: RxBinding primarily handles events from Android UI components. Input validation is generally the responsibility of the application logic that consumes these events. RxBinding itself should not introduce vulnerabilities through improper handling of UI events.
  - Cryptography: Not directly applicable to RxBinding. Cryptographic operations are the responsibility of the applications that use RxBinding if they need to handle sensitive data.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Development of Android applications that rely on reactive UI event handling.
  - Maintaining the quality and security of Android applications using RxBinding.
  - Developer productivity and efficiency in building reactive Android UIs.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - The RxBinding library itself does not directly handle sensitive data. Data sensitivity is determined by the Android applications that use RxBinding. If an application uses RxBinding to handle UI events related to sensitive data (e.g., user input fields for passwords, personal information), then the application must implement appropriate security measures to protect that data. The sensitivity level is application-dependent and not inherent to RxBinding.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the intended use case and security context for applications using RxBinding? Are they expected to handle highly sensitive data?
  - What is the process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in RxBinding? Is there a dedicated security team or contact?
  - What are the typical security practices of developers who are expected to use RxBinding? Are they generally security-aware?
  - Are there any specific regulatory compliance requirements for applications that might use RxBinding (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR)?

- Assumptions:
  - RxBinding is intended to be used in a wide range of Android applications, with varying security requirements.
  - Developers using RxBinding are responsible for implementing application-level security controls and ensuring the secure usage of the library within their applications.
  - The primary security concern for RxBinding is to prevent the library itself from introducing vulnerabilities into applications that use it.
  - The build and release process for RxBinding follows standard open-source project practices, including code review and community contributions.
