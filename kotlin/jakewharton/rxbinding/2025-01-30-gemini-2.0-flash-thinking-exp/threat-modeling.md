# Threat Model Analysis for jakewharton/rxbinding

## Threat: [Unbounded Event Stream Resource Exhaustion](./threats/unbounded_event_stream_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might trigger a large number of UI events rapidly (e.g., programmatically clicking a button repeatedly, rapidly typing in a text field) that are converted into RxBinding Observables. If these Observables are not properly managed *due to RxBinding's nature of easily creating event streams*, the application will process these events without limit, consuming excessive CPU and memory resources.
*   **Impact:** Application slowdown, unresponsiveness, crashes due to resource exhaustion, denial of service for the application on the client device.
*   **RxBinding Component Affected:**  `RxView`, `RxTextView`, `RxAdapterView`, `RxCompoundButton`, and any RxBinding module that creates Observables from UI events. Specifically, the *easy creation of unbounded streams by RxBinding* and lack of application-level backpressure handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement backpressure strategies using RxJava operators like `throttleFirst()`, `debounce()`, `sample()`, `buffer()`, or `window()` to control the rate of event processing *when using RxBinding event streams*.
    *   Use `takeUntil()` or `dispose()` to unsubscribe from Observables *created by RxBinding* when the associated UI component is no longer active or needed.
    *   Monitor resource usage of the application during development and testing, especially under heavy user interaction scenarios *involving RxBinding event streams*.

## Threat: [Client-Side Security Reliance on RxBinding Event Handling](./threats/client-side_security_reliance_on_rxbinding_event_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might mistakenly rely solely on client-side UI event handling with RxBinding for security-critical operations like input validation or authorization checks, without proper backend validation and security measures. Attackers can bypass client-side checks by manipulating requests or directly interacting with backend APIs, circumventing UI-based security *that might be superficially implemented using RxBinding*.
*   **Impact:** Bypass of security controls, unauthorized access, data manipulation, security breaches.
*   **RxBinding Component Affected:** Misuse of RxBinding in application's security architecture, not a vulnerability in RxBinding itself, but *a risk amplified by the ease of event handling RxBinding provides, potentially leading to a false sense of security on the client-side*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement security-critical operations and validations on the backend or in dedicated security layers of the application.
    *   Use RxBinding primarily for UI event handling and presentation logic, not as the sole security mechanism.
    *   Perform thorough security testing, including penetration testing, to identify and address client-side security weaknesses *that might be masked by RxBinding's UI event handling*.
