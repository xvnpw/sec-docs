# Threat Model Analysis for jakewharton/rxbinding

## Threat: [Malicious Input Injection via UI Events](./threats/malicious_input_injection_via_ui_events.md)

**Description:** An attacker could input malicious data into a UI element (e.g., a specially crafted string into an EditText) that is being observed by RxBinding. This data, if not properly sanitized *after* being emitted by the RxBinding observable, could be propagated through the RxJava stream and used in a way that compromises the application's security or functionality. The vulnerability lies in the application's failure to handle the raw data provided by RxBinding's event observation.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) if the input is displayed in a WebView, SQL injection if used in database queries, application crashes, data corruption, or unauthorized actions depending on how the unsanitized input is used downstream.

**Affected RxBinding Component:** `rxbinding4-widget`: Specifically, bindings for input elements like `RxTextView.textChanges()`, `RxTextView.afterTextChangeEvents()`, `RxSearchView.queryTextChanges()`, etc. These functions directly provide the user input as an observable stream.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the data emitted by RxBinding observables *immediately* after it is received and *before* it is used in any sensitive operations.
*   Use parameterized queries or ORM frameworks to prevent SQL injection.
*   Properly encode output when displaying user-provided data in WebViews or other UI elements to prevent XSS.
*   Apply appropriate data type checks and constraints using RxJava operators like `map` and `filter`.

## Threat: [Data Leakage through Unintended Side Effects Triggered by UI Events](./threats/data_leakage_through_unintended_side_effects_triggered_by_ui_events.md)

**Description:** If RxBinding observables are used to trigger actions with unintended side effects (e.g., logging sensitive data based on UI interactions, making unauthorized API calls with data derived from UI events), an attacker might be able to trigger specific UI events to leak sensitive information. The vulnerability arises from the application logic connected to the RxBinding observable, where the processing of the observed event leads to the data leak.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, application secrets, or internal system information due to actions triggered by observed UI events.

**Affected RxBinding Component:** Depends on the specific binding used and how the emitted data is processed *within the RxJava stream connected to the RxBinding observable*. Could involve any RxBinding module if the resulting data stream is mishandled, leading to a side effect that leaks data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully review the side effects introduced in RxJava streams that are initiated by events observed through RxBinding.
*   Avoid logging sensitive data directly within the processing of UI event streams.
*   Ensure that any API calls triggered by UI events are properly authorized and do not expose more information than necessary. Sanitize and validate data derived from UI events before using it in API calls.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when accessing and processing data within the RxJava streams connected to RxBinding.
