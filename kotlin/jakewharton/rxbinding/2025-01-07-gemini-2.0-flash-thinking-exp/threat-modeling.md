# Threat Model Analysis for jakewharton/rxbinding

## Threat: [Unintended Execution of Sensitive Actions on Detached Views](./threats/unintended_execution_of_sensitive_actions_on_detached_views.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could potentially trigger actions associated with a UI element even after that element's corresponding Activity or Fragment has been destroyed or detached. This occurs if the RxBinding subscription for that element's events is not properly disposed of. A malicious actor could manipulate the application state or use automated tools to trigger events on these lingering subscriptions, leading to the execution of sensitive operations in an unintended context. For instance, triggering a "delete account" button's click listener from a previous screen that is no longer active.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized execution of sensitive actions, potentially leading to data loss, privilege escalation, or other security breaches.
    *   **Affected RxBinding Component:** Any `*Observable` created by RxBinding that directly binds to UI events and whose subscription lifecycle is not correctly managed. This includes components within modules like `rxbinding-core` (e.g., `ViewClickObservable`, `ViewLongClickObservable`) and specific view bindings in other RxBinding modules. The core issue is the lack of automatic subscription disposal tied to the UI component's lifecycle.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory Subscription Management:** Enforce strict subscription lifecycle management using `CompositeDisposable` or similar mechanisms. Ensure all RxBinding subscriptions are explicitly disposed of in the appropriate lifecycle methods (e.g., `onDestroyView` for Fragments, `onDestroy` for Activities).
        *   **Lifecycle-Aware Components:** Strongly recommend or mandate the use of Android Architecture Components like `ViewModel` and `LiveData` in conjunction with RxBinding. Utilize `observe()` on `LiveData` which inherently manages its lifecycle. For RxBinding Observables, integrate with `ViewModel` to handle disposables within the ViewModel's `onCleared()` method.
        *   **Defensive Programming:** Within the event handler logic, add checks to ensure the associated UI component is still valid and attached to its window before executing any sensitive actions. This provides a secondary layer of defense even if subscription disposal fails.

## Threat: [Potential for Resource Exhaustion due to Unbounded Event Streams](./threats/potential_for_resource_exhaustion_due_to_unbounded_event_streams.md)

*   **Description:** If RxBinding is used to observe events that can be emitted at a very high rate (e.g., sensor data, rapid UI interactions without debouncing), and these streams are not properly managed or throttled, it could lead to excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory). An attacker could intentionally trigger these high-frequency events to cause a denial-of-service condition on the device.
    *   **Impact:** Application unresponsiveness, crashes due to out-of-memory errors or excessive CPU usage, and battery drain. In severe cases, it could impact the overall device performance.
    *   **Affected RxBinding Component:**  `Observable`s created by RxBinding for events that can be emitted rapidly, such as those found in modules like `rxbinding-sensors` or UI event streams without proper rate limiting applied. The vulnerability lies in the potential for uncontrolled emission of events.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory Rate Limiting/Throttling:**  Enforce the use of RxJava operators like `debounce`, `throttleFirst`, or `throttleLatest` on event streams that are susceptible to high-frequency emissions. This should be a standard practice when dealing with such events.
        *   **Backpressure Handling:** For streams that inherently produce data faster than it can be consumed, implement proper backpressure handling strategies using RxJava's backpressure operators (e.g., `onBackpressureBuffer`, `onBackpressureDrop`, `onBackpressureLatest`).
        *   **Resource Monitoring and Limits:** Implement mechanisms to monitor resource usage and potentially limit the rate of event processing if resource thresholds are exceeded.
