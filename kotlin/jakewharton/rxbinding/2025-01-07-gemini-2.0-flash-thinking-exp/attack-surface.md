# Attack Surface Analysis for jakewharton/rxbinding

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Input via UI Events](./attack_surfaces/malicious_input_via_ui_events.md)

* **Description:** An attacker injects malicious data through UI elements, which is then processed by the application due to RxBinding's simplified observation of UI events as reactive streams.
    * **How RxBinding Contributes:** RxBinding directly facilitates the observation of UI events and the conversion of user input into reactive streams. This makes it straightforward for developers to process user input, potentially without sufficient sanitization or validation *before* it enters the application's logic via the RxJava stream.
    * **Example:** An attacker enters a malicious JavaScript payload into a text field observed using `RxTextView.textChanges()`. This unsanitized payload is then used to update a WebView, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    * **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Command Injection, SQL Injection (if the input is used in database queries), Logic Bugs leading to significant application compromise or data breaches.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict Input Sanitization:** Implement rigorous sanitization of all data received from UI events *within the reactive stream* before any further processing. This includes escaping special characters and removing potentially harmful code.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP) for WebViews:** For applications using WebViews, enforce a strong Content Security Policy to prevent the execution of injected scripts.
        * **Parameterized Queries for Databases:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases to prevent SQL injection, especially when using user input from RxBinding streams.
        * **Robust Input Validation:** Validate user input against strict expected formats and ranges within the reactive stream to prevent unexpected or malicious data from being processed.
