## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in RxHttp's Parsing](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_rxhttp's_parsing.md)

*   **1.1 XXE via XML/JSON Parsing [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the XML or JSON parser used by RxHttp (or its underlying libraries) to include external entities. This can allow the attacker to read local files, access internal network resources, or potentially cause a denial of service.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:** Disable external entity resolution in the XML parser. Use a well-vetted and up-to-date XML/JSON parser. Sanitize all input used in XML/JSON processing.

*   **1.2 DoS via Resource Exhaustion [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends crafted responses (e.g., very large, deeply nested JSON/XML) that consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) on the server when RxHttp attempts to parse them. This leads to a denial of service.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
    *   **Mitigation:** Set reasonable limits on the maximum size of responses that RxHttp will process. Implement input validation to reject overly complex or large data. Use rate limiting.

*   **1.4 Parameter Tampering in URL/Headers [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates parameters in the URL or HTTP headers of requests made by RxHttp. This can bypass security checks, inject malicious headers, or modify the application's behavior.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize *all* user-supplied input used to construct URLs and headers. Use allow-lists instead of block-lists. Encode data appropriately.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Manipulate RxHttp's Request Flow](./attack_tree_paths/2__manipulate_rxhttp's_request_flow.md)

*   **2.1 SSRF via Redirects (if enabled) [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** If RxHttp is configured to follow redirects, and the application doesn't properly validate the redirect URLs, an attacker can craft a request that causes the server to make requests to internal or otherwise inaccessible resources (Server-Side Request Forgery).
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:** Disable redirect following if it's not absolutely necessary. If redirects are required, implement a strict whitelist of allowed redirect URLs. Validate the redirect URL to ensure it conforms to expected patterns.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Leverage RxHttp's File Download/Upload Capabilities](./attack_tree_paths/3__leverage_rxhttp's_file_downloadupload_capabilities.md)

*    **3.1 Path Traversal during Download [CRITICAL]**
    *    **Description:** If the application uses RxHttp for file downloads and does not properly sanitize the filename or path, an attacker can use ".." sequences in the filename to access files outside the intended directory.
    *    **Likelihood:** Low
    *    **Impact:** High
    *    **Effort:** Medium
    *    **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *    **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *    **Mitigation:** Sanitize filenames and paths before downloading files. Do *not* trust filenames provided by the server or user. Use a whitelist of allowed characters. Validate that the requested file is within the intended directory.

*   **3.2 Malicious File Upload (if enabled) [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** If the application uses RxHttp for file uploads and doesn't properly validate the uploaded file's content, type, or size, an attacker could upload a malicious file (e.g., a web shell) that could lead to RCE.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement strict validation of uploaded files: check the actual file content (not just the extension), limit the maximum file size, scan for malware, and store uploaded files outside the webroot with randomly generated filenames.
