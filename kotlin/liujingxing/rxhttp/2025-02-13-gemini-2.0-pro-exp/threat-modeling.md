# Threat Model Analysis for liujingxing/rxhttp

## Threat: [TLS Misconfiguration Leading to MITM (RxHttp-Specific)](./threats/tls_misconfiguration_leading_to_mitm__rxhttp-specific_.md)

*   **Threat:**  TLS Misconfiguration Leading to MITM (RxHttp-Specific)

    *   **Description:** An attacker performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack due to *incorrect configuration within RxHttp*. This includes disabling certificate validation, using weak ciphers, or failing to verify hostnames *specifically through RxHttp's API*. The attacker intercepts, modifies, or steals data in transit.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of sensitive data (credentials, personal information, API keys), injection of malicious data, complete control over communication with the backend.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `RxHttp` class (configuration methods like `setSslSocketFactory`, `setHostnameVerifier`, any custom `TrustManager` implementation used *with RxHttp*). Methods that set up the underlying `OkHttpClient` *if used through RxHttp's API*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never disable certificate validation in production.** Use a properly configured `TrustManager` (validating against a trusted CA or using certificate pinning) *within RxHttp's configuration*.
        *   Explicitly configure RxHttp to use strong, modern cipher suites. Regularly review and update these configurations.
        *   Ensure hostname verification is enabled and correctly configured *within RxHttp*.
        *   Use the latest version of RxHttp.

## Threat: [Unintentional Cleartext Traffic (RxHttp URL Misconfiguration)](./threats/unintentional_cleartext_traffic__rxhttp_url_misconfiguration_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Unintentional Cleartext Traffic (RxHttp URL Misconfiguration)

    *   **Description:**  A developer accidentally uses `http://` instead of `https://` *within the URL passed to an RxHttp method*. This bypasses TLS, sending data in plain text. The attacker passively eavesdrops on the network. This is a *direct* misuse of RxHttp's API.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data transmitted in the request and response.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Any RxHttp method that accepts a URL as input (e.g., `RxHttp.get(url)`, `RxHttp.post(url)`, etc.). The URL string *passed to* RxHttp is the direct point of failure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce HTTPS URLs through code reviews and automated checks (linting rules specifically targeting RxHttp calls).
        *   Use a centralized URL builder or configuration mechanism to ensure consistency and prevent typos *when constructing URLs for RxHttp*.
        *   Use Android's Network Security Configuration (this is a general mitigation, but still relevant).

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerability in RxHttp's Response Parsing](./threats/deserialization_vulnerability_in_rxhttp's_response_parsing.md)

*   **Threat:**  Deserialization Vulnerability in RxHttp's Response Parsing

    *   **Description:**  A malicious server sends a crafted response (e.g., JSON or XML) that exploits a vulnerability *in RxHttp's parsing logic or how the application uses RxHttp's parsing features*. This could lead to arbitrary code execution. The attacker crafts a malicious payload designed to trigger the vulnerability *during RxHttp's deserialization process*.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the device, data corruption, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:**  RxHttp's parsing methods (e.g., `asString()`, `asClass(Class<T>)`, `asList(Class<T>)`, `asJSONObject()`, `asJSONArray()`, and any custom parsers used with `toParser(...)`). The vulnerability lies *within RxHttp's handling of the response and its interaction with underlying parsing libraries*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on the underlying parser and the nature of the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use the latest version of RxHttp (to get updates to the parsing libraries it uses).
        *   **Always validate and sanitize data *after* RxHttp has parsed it.** Treat the parsed data as untrusted, even after it comes out of RxHttp. Use appropriate validation libraries (e.g., JSON Schema).
        *   If parsing XML, explicitly configure RxHttp (or the underlying XML parser it uses) to disable external entity resolution.
        *   Prefer simpler data formats (like JSON) over more complex ones (like XML).
        *   If using a custom parser *with RxHttp's `toParser(...)`*, ensure it's thoroughly tested and secured against deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [XXE Vulnerability (If RxHttp is Used for XML)](./threats/xxe_vulnerability__if_rxhttp_is_used_for_xml_.md)

*   **Threat:**  XXE Vulnerability (If RxHttp is Used for XML)

    *   **Description:**  If RxHttp is used to parse XML responses, and external entity processing is not disabled *within RxHttp's configuration or the underlying XML parser it uses*, a malicious server could include external entities. This allows the attacker to read local files, access internal resources, or cause a DoS.
    *   **Impact:**  Information disclosure (local files, internal network details), denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:**  RxHttp methods that parse XML responses (if any are used; RxHttp primarily focuses on JSON). The underlying XML parser *used by RxHttp*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Explicitly configure RxHttp (or the underlying XML parser it uses) to disable external entity resolution. This is the critical mitigation.
        *   Avoid using XML if possible; prefer JSON.
        *   Validate the XML against a strict schema *after* RxHttp processes it.
