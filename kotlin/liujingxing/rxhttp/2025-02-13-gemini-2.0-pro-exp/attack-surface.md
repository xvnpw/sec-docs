# Attack Surface Analysis for liujingxing/rxhttp

## Attack Surface: [Improper TLS/SSL Certificate Validation](./attack_surfaces/improper_tlsssl_certificate_validation.md)

**Description:** Failure to properly validate server certificates during HTTPS connections, allowing Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
**rxhttp Contribution:** `rxhttp` provides APIs for configuring TLS/SSL, including options that *could* be misused to disable or weaken certificate validation. It relies on OkHttp for the underlying TLS implementation, inheriting any vulnerabilities present there.  This is a *direct* contribution because the library provides the mechanism for (mis)configuration.
**Example:** A developer uses `setSSLSocketFactory(...)` or a similar method with an insecure `TrustManager` that accepts all certificates, or disables hostname verification using rxhttp methods.
**Impact:** An attacker can intercept and modify traffic, stealing credentials, session tokens, or injecting malicious data.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Default Settings:** Rely on `rxhttp`'s default TLS/SSL configuration (which should leverage OkHttp's secure defaults).
    *   **Avoid Disabling Validation:**  Never disable certificate validation or hostname verification in production.
    *   **Certificate Pinning (Carefully):** Implement certificate pinning *correctly* if used, pinning to the public key and having a backup. Use rxhttp methods for pinning if available.
    *   **Regularly Update:** Keep `rxhttp` and its dependencies (especially OkHttp) updated.
    *   **Thorough Testing:** Test TLS/SSL configuration with invalid certificates.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Request Smuggling/Splitting](./attack_surfaces/http_request_smugglingsplitting.md)

**Description:** Exploiting inconsistencies in how `rxhttp` (and the underlying OkHttp) handles malformed `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers.
**rxhttp Contribution:** `rxhttp` relies on OkHttp for HTTP request processing. While `rxhttp` doesn't *directly* parse headers, it *uses* the OkHttp component that does. Vulnerabilities in OkHttp's header parsing are exposed *through* `rxhttp`. This is considered *direct* because the vulnerable component is a core dependency used for all HTTP requests.
**Example:** An attacker sends a request with conflicting `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers.  The vulnerability lies within OkHttp, but is triggered by a request made *via* `rxhttp`.
**Impact:** Cache poisoning, request hijacking, bypassing security controls.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Updated:** Ensure `rxhttp` and OkHttp are updated to the latest versions.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Use a WAF (this is an external mitigation, but important).

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the libraries used by `rxhttp` to deserialize responses (e.g., JSON, XML), leading to arbitrary code execution.
**rxhttp Contribution:** `rxhttp` uses converter libraries for deserialization. The choice of library and its configuration, *directly managed by or through rxhttp*, impact the vulnerability. This is a *direct* contribution because `rxhttp` provides the mechanism for choosing and configuring the deserializer.
**Example:** `rxhttp` is configured to use a vulnerable version of a JSON parsing library, or a custom converter is used that has a deserialization flaw. The attacker sends a crafted JSON payload.
**Impact:** Remote code execution.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Secure Deserializers:** Ensure `rxhttp` is configured to use secure and up-to-date deserialization libraries.  Check the documentation for recommended converters.
    *   **Avoid Untrusted Data:** Be extremely cautious when deserializing data from untrusted sources.
    *   **Input Validation (Before Deserialization):** Perform strict input validation *before* passing data to the deserializer.
    *   **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update `rxhttp` and all converter libraries.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_dependencies.md)

**Description:** `rxhttp` depends on other libraries (OkHttp, RxJava, converters). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited.
**rxhttp Contribution:** `rxhttp`'s security is directly tied to the security of its dependencies.  The choice of dependencies and their versions is a *direct* aspect of `rxhttp`.
**Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in OkHttp that allows for request smuggling. Applications using `rxhttp` are also vulnerable *because* `rxhttp` uses OkHttp.
**Impact:** Varies (could be High or Critical, depending on the dependency vulnerability).
**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `rxhttp` and *all* of its dependencies updated.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories.
