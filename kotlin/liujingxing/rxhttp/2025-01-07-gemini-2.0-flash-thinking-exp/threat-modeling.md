# Threat Model Analysis for liujingxing/rxhttp

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization of Response Data](./threats/insecure_deserialization_of_response_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate the server response to include malicious serialized objects. If the application uses `rxhttp` with a `Converter.Factory` (like `GsonConverterFactory` or `JacksonConverterFactory`) to automatically deserialize responses, these malicious objects could be deserialized, leading to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or data manipulation on the user's device. `rxhttp` facilitates this by handling the response and applying the configured deserialization mechanism.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the user's device, application crash, data corruption, or unauthorized access to local resources.

**Affected RxHttp Component:** `Converter` (specifically the `Converter.Factory` implementations used for response body conversion).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid automatic deserialization of server responses if possible, especially from untrusted sources.
* Implement strict type checking and validation *after* `rxhttp` has performed deserialization.
* Use secure deserialization libraries and configurations that prevent the instantiation of arbitrary classes.
* Consider using alternative data formats like Protocol Buffers with schema validation, which are less prone to deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Data Injection through Unvalidated Response Body Processed by RxHttp](./threats/data_injection_through_unvalidated_response_body_processed_by_rxhttp.md)

**Description:** A compromised or malicious server could inject malicious code (e.g., JavaScript for a WebView-based application) into the response body. If the application directly renders data received and processed by `rxhttp` without proper sanitization or escaping, it could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within the application's context. `rxhttp` delivers the potentially malicious payload to the application.

**Impact:** Execution of malicious scripts within the application, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.

**Affected RxHttp Component:** `Response Body Handling` (the part of `rxhttp` that retrieves and provides the raw or converted response body).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always sanitize and encode data received from the server (obtained via `rxhttp`) before rendering it in any UI component (especially WebViews).
* Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) if using WebViews to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
* Treat all server-provided data obtained through `rxhttp` as potentially untrusted.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Logs or Caches Managed by RxHttp](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_logs_or_caches_managed_by_rxhttp.md)

**Description:** `rxhttp` might be configured to use a logging interceptor (or the underlying HTTP client's logging) that logs request and response headers or bodies, potentially including sensitive information like API keys, authentication tokens, or personal data. Similarly, if `rxhttp`'s caching mechanisms are used, this sensitive data might be stored insecurely. An attacker gaining access to device logs or the application's cache could retrieve this information.

**Impact:** Compromise of user accounts, unauthorized access to backend systems, or exposure of personal data, leading to privacy violations.

**Affected RxHttp Component:** `Logging Interceptor` (if enabled), `Cache Management` (related to how `rxhttp` or the underlying client handles caching).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Disable verbose logging in production builds of the application using `rxhttp`.
* If logging is necessary, ensure sensitive data is redacted or masked *before* it is logged by `rxhttp`'s interceptor.
* Configure caching mechanisms used by `rxhttp` to avoid storing sensitive information or use encrypted storage.
* Follow platform-specific guidelines for secure storage of sensitive data.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack due to Insufficient Certificate Validation in RxHttp's Configuration](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_due_to_insufficient_certificate_validation_in_rxhttp's_configuration.md)

**Description:** If the application using `rxhttp` is not configured to properly validate SSL/TLS certificates (either through default settings being overridden insecurely or through custom `SSLSocketFactory` or `HostnameVerifier` implementations), an attacker could intercept network traffic between the application and the server. This allows the attacker to eavesdrop on communication and potentially modify requests and responses. `rxhttp` relies on the underlying networking stack, but its configuration choices impact the security of the connection.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transmitted over the network, manipulation of data exchanged between the application and the server, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data breaches.

**Affected RxHttp Component:** `HTTPS Configuration` (how `rxhttp` or the underlying client's SSL/TLS settings are configured).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure proper SSL/TLS certificate validation is enabled and not bypassed when configuring `rxhttp`.
* Use certificate pinning for critical connections to specific servers when using `rxhttp`.
* Avoid trusting custom `TrustManager` or `HostnameVerifier` implementations unless absolutely necessary and implemented correctly. Rely on the platform's default secure settings.
