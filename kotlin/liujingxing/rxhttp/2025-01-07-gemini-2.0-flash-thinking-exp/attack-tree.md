## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Manipulate HTTP Request via RxHttp -> URL Manipulation -> Inject Malicious Characters in Query Parameters (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_manipulate_http_request_via_rxhttp_-_url_manipulation_-_inject_malicious_characters_i_fae5267b.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits the application's failure to properly sanitize or validate data used to construct query parameters in HTTP requests made using RxHttp.

**How it Works:**
*   The application takes user input or data from an untrusted source and directly incorporates it into the query parameters of a URL used with RxHttp.
*   The attacker crafts malicious input containing special characters or commands that, when interpreted by the backend server, lead to unintended actions.
*   Common examples include injecting SQL commands (SQL Injection) or operating system commands (Command Injection).

**Impact:** Can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, and in severe cases, full server compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Manipulate HTTP Request via RxHttp -> Header Manipulation -> Override Security-Sensitive Headers (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_manipulate_http_request_via_rxhttp_-_header_manipulation_-_override_security-sensitiv_6d7b39a8.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages the application's ability to set or modify HTTP headers using RxHttp to override security-sensitive headers.

**How it Works:**
*   The application allows control over certain HTTP headers used in RxHttp requests, potentially through configuration or direct manipulation of request objects.
*   The attacker crafts requests that override headers like `Authorization`, `Cookie`, or custom authentication headers.
*   By setting these headers to known or predictable values, or by removing them entirely, the attacker can bypass authentication or authorization checks on the server.

**Impact:** Complete bypass of authentication and authorization mechanisms, allowing unauthorized access to resources and functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Manipulate HTTP Request via RxHttp -> Body Manipulation -> Inject Malicious Code/Payload in Request Body (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_manipulate_http_request_via_rxhttp_-_body_manipulation_-_inject_malicious_codepayload_9a513bf7.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits the application's failure to sanitize data included in the request body of HTTP requests sent via RxHttp.

**How it Works:**
*   The application takes user input or data from an untrusted source and includes it in the body of a POST, PUT, or other request with a body.
*   The attacker injects malicious code or payloads into this data.
*   When the backend server processes this unsanitized data, the injected code or payload is executed, leading to vulnerabilities.
*   Examples include injecting script tags (if the backend renders the body) or specific data formats that exploit backend processing flaws.

**Impact:** Can lead to various server-side vulnerabilities, including cross-site scripting (if the backend renders the data), data manipulation, or even remote code execution depending on the backend's processing logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Manipulate HTTP Response Handling via RxHttp -> Exploit Insecure Deserialization (If Applicable)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_manipulate_http_response_handling_via_rxhttp_-_exploit_insecure_deserialization__if_ap_1d65e63e.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits the application's use of RxHttp to handle responses containing serialized objects without proper validation.

**How it Works:**
*   The application uses RxHttp to make requests to a server that returns data in a serialized format (e.g., using Java serialization, Gson, Jackson).
*   The attacker intercepts or influences the response, replacing the legitimate serialized data with a malicious serialized object.
*   When the application deserializes this malicious object, it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the client application.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution on the client application, potentially allowing the attacker to gain full control over the application and the device it's running on.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Improper SSL/TLS Configuration -> Man-in-the-Middle Attack due to Insecure Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_improper_ssltls_configuration_-_man-in-the-middle_attack_due_to_insecure_configuration.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits misconfigurations in RxHttp's SSL/TLS settings to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.

**How it Works:**
*   The application is configured to allow insecure SSL/TLS protocols (e.g., SSLv3, TLS 1.0) or does not properly validate server certificates.
*   An attacker intercepts the network traffic between the application and the server.
*   Due to the insecure configuration, the attacker can decrypt, inspect, and modify the communication without the application or the server being aware.

**Impact:**  Confidential information transmitted between the application and the server can be intercepted, including sensitive data, credentials, and API keys. The attacker can also modify the communication, potentially injecting malicious data or code.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Dependencies of RxHttp -> Vulnerabilities in Underlying HTTP Client (e.g., OkHttp)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_dependencies_of_rxhttp_-_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_http_client__e_g___okht_879b072d.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in the underlying HTTP client library used by RxHttp (likely OkHttp).

**How it Works:**
*   RxHttp relies on a lower-level HTTP client library to handle the actual network communication.
*   This underlying library might have known security vulnerabilities that have been publicly disclosed.
*   If the application is using an outdated version of RxHttp or the underlying client library, these vulnerabilities can be exploited.
*   Attackers can leverage existing exploits or develop new ones targeting these known weaknesses.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the underlying library. It can range from Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the device running the application.
