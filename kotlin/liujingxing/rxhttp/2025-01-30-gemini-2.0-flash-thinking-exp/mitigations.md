## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure HTTP Client Configuration (via RxHttp/OkHttp)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_http_client_configuration__via_rxhttpokhttp_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure HTTP Client Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access OkHttpClient Builder:**  `rxhttp` allows access to the underlying OkHttpClient builder. Use this to configure security-related settings.
    2.  **Enforce HTTPS:** Ensure `rxhttp` is configured to use `https://` URLs. Verify base URLs and request URLs are using HTTPS.
    3.  **Disable Insecure TLS/SSL:**  Using the OkHttpClient builder accessible through `rxhttp`, disable outdated TLS/SSL versions (SSLv3, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1) and prioritize strong cipher suites.
    4.  **Set Timeouts:** Configure connection, read, and write timeouts in OkHttpClient via `rxhttp` to prevent resource exhaustion and DoS scenarios.
    5.  **Implement Certificate Pinning (Optional but Recommended):**  Use OkHttp's `CertificatePinner` (accessible through `rxhttp`'s OkHttpClient builder) to implement certificate pinning for enhanced MitM protection. Be cautious with implementation and certificate rotation.
    6.  **Restrict Redirect Following (If Necessary):**  Configure OkHttp via `rxhttp` to disable or restrict HTTP redirect following if uncontrolled redirects pose a security risk in your application context.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):**  Mitigated by HTTPS enforcement and certificate pinning.
    *   **Data Interception (High Severity):** Mitigated by HTTPS encryption.
    *   **Downgrade Attacks (Medium to High Severity):** Mitigated by disabling insecure TLS/SSL versions.
    *   **Exploitation of Weak Ciphers (Medium Severity):** Mitigated by prioritizing strong cipher suites.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Slowloris Attacks (Medium Severity):** Mitigated by setting appropriate timeouts.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Mitigated by setting appropriate timeouts.
    *   **Phishing via Redirects (Low to Medium Severity):** Mitigated by restricting redirect following.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **MitM & Data Interception:** High risk reduction. HTTPS and pinning provide strong protection against eavesdropping and manipulation.
    *   **Downgrade & Weak Ciphers:** Medium to High risk reduction.  Enforces use of modern, secure encryption.
    *   **DoS & Resource Exhaustion:** Medium risk reduction. Prevents indefinite waiting and resource depletion.
    *   **Phishing via Redirects:** Low to Medium risk reduction (context-dependent). Reduces risk of redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. HTTPS is generally used. Default OkHttp settings are in place, but explicit secure TLS/SSL configuration and certificate pinning are missing. Timeouts are likely default OkHttp values.
    *   **Location:** `rxhttp` initialization code where OkHttpClient is configured (if customized). Base URL configurations.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Explicitly configure OkHttpClient via `rxhttp` to: disable insecure TLS/SSL, prioritize strong ciphers, potentially implement certificate pinning, and review/tune timeouts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Handling in RxJava Streams (via RxHttp)](./mitigation_strategies/data_handling_in_rxjava_streams__via_rxhttp_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Data Handling in RxJava Streams
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Validate Server Responses:** Within RxJava streams processing responses from `rxhttp` requests, implement validation logic for data received from the server. Use RxJava operators like `map`, `filter`, `doOnNext` for validation.
    2.  **Sanitize Data (If Necessary):** If server data is displayed in UI components (e.g., WebViews) or used in contexts susceptible to injection, sanitize the data within RxJava streams before use.
    3.  **Graceful Error Handling:** Use RxJava error handling operators (`onErrorReturn`, `onErrorResumeNext`) within `rxhttp` request chains to handle network errors, server errors, and data parsing exceptions gracefully. Avoid exposing sensitive error details to users.
    4.  **Backpressure Handling (If Streaming Large Data):** If `rxhttp` is used to stream large datasets, implement RxJava backpressure handling to prevent client-side resource exhaustion.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium to High Severity - if displaying in webviews):** Mitigated by sanitizing server responses before displaying in webviews.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Mitigated by validating server responses to ensure data conforms to expectations.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low to Medium Severity):** Mitigated by graceful error handling and avoiding exposure of technical error details.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Client-Side (Low Severity):** Mitigated by backpressure handling for large data streams.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Medium to High risk reduction (if applicable). Sanitization prevents execution of malicious scripts.
    *   **Data Integrity:** Medium risk reduction. Validation ensures data reliability and application stability.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Low to Medium risk reduction. Prevents leakage of internal details through error messages.
    *   **DoS (Client-Side):** Low risk reduction. Prevents resource exhaustion from excessive data.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Some basic data parsing and error handling exist in RxJava streams, but comprehensive validation, sanitization, and secure error handling are missing. Backpressure handling is likely not explicitly implemented.
    *   **Location:** RxJava chains used to process `rxhttp` responses throughout the application.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement comprehensive data validation and sanitization within RxJava streams for all `rxhttp` responses. Refine error handling to be secure and user-friendly. Evaluate and implement backpressure handling if streaming large data via `rxhttp`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Request Interceptors (via RxHttp/OkHttp) - Secure Implementation](./mitigation_strategies/request_interceptors__via_rxhttpokhttp__-_secure_implementation.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Request Interceptor Implementation
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize Interceptor Complexity:** Keep interceptor logic simple and focused on essential request modifications (e.g., adding headers, authentication).
    2.  **Securely Handle Sensitive Data in Interceptors:** If interceptors handle sensitive data (tokens, API keys):
        *   **Avoid Logging Sensitive Data:**  Do not log sensitive data in interceptor logs. Use redacted logging if needed for debugging.
        *   **Secure Storage Access:** Retrieve sensitive data from secure storage (Keystore, secure configs) within interceptors, not hardcoded.
    3.  **Code Review Interceptors:** Subject interceptor code to thorough security code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities or information leaks.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium to High Severity):**  Logging sensitive data in interceptors can expose credentials.
    *   **Authentication Bypass (Medium Severity):**  Incorrect interceptor logic could unintentionally bypass authentication.
    *   **Data Manipulation (Medium Severity):**  Flawed interceptor logic modifying requests could lead to unintended data changes.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Medium to High risk reduction. Secure handling prevents accidental credential leaks.
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** Medium risk reduction. Careful implementation and review prevent security control bypass.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces risk of unintended request modifications.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Interceptors are used for authentication header injection. Sensitive data is retrieved from secure storage. Logging is generally avoided, but could be more robustly controlled.
    *   **Location:** OkHttpClient configuration in `rxhttp` initialization. Interceptor classes.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Formal security code review process for interceptors.  Enforce strict no-logging of sensitive data in interceptors, even in debug builds (or use robust redaction).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Client-Side Rate Limiting (with RxHttp)](./mitigation_strategies/client-side_rate_limiting__with_rxhttp_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Client-Side Rate Limiting
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Rate-Limited APIs:** Determine APIs with rate limits used via `rxhttp`.
    2.  **Implement Rate Limiting Logic:**  Implement client-side rate limiting logic that controls the rate of requests sent through `rxhttp`. This can be done using RxJava operators to throttle or buffer requests before they are executed by `rxhttp`.
    3.  **Handle Rate Limit Exceeded:** Implement logic to handle client-side rate limit breaches (delay requests, queue, inform user).
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Server-Side Rate Limiting/DoS Trigger (Low to Medium Severity):** Prevents triggering server-side rate limits or DoS protection due to excessive client requests.
    *   **API Abuse (Low Severity):**  Reduces accidental or intentional API abuse by limiting request frequency.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Server-Side Rate Limiting/DoS Trigger:** Low to Medium risk reduction. Improves application resilience and prevents service disruption.
    *   **API Abuse:** Low risk reduction. Promotes responsible API usage.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Client-side rate limiting is not currently in place for `rxhttp` requests.
    *   **Location:** N/A - would be implemented in the application logic controlling `rxhttp` request initiation.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement client-side rate limiting for relevant APIs used with `rxhttp`. Choose a suitable rate limiting strategy and integrate it into the request flow.
