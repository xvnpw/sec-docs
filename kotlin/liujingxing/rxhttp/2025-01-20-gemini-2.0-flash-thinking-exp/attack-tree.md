## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

- Attack Vector: HTTP Header Injection
    - Description: An attacker injects malicious headers into the HTTP request. This is possible if the application allows user-controlled data to be included in headers without proper sanitization by RxHttp.
    - Potential Impact: Bypassing security checks, session hijacking, manipulating server-side logic, cross-site scripting (if headers are reflected).
- Attack Vector: URL Manipulation/Injection
    - Description: An attacker injects malicious characters or URLs into the request path or query parameters. This occurs if RxHttp or the application doesn't properly encode or validate URLs constructed with user input.
    - Potential Impact: Accessing unauthorized resources, performing unintended actions on the server, server-side request forgery (SSRF), information disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [RxHttp Does Not Properly Sanitize/Encode](./attack_tree_paths/rxhttp_does_not_properly_sanitizeencode.md)

- Description: RxHttp fails to properly sanitize or encode user-provided data before including it in HTTP requests (headers, URLs, parameters).
- Consequence: This failure directly enables HTTP Header Injection and URL Manipulation/Injection attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [HTTP Header Injection](./attack_tree_paths/http_header_injection.md)

- Description: An attacker injects malicious headers into the HTTP request. This is possible if the application allows user-controlled data to be included in headers without proper sanitization by RxHttp.
    - Potential Impact: Bypassing security checks, session hijacking, manipulating server-side logic, cross-site scripting (if headers are reflected).

## Attack Tree Path: [URL Manipulation/Injection](./attack_tree_paths/url_manipulationinjection.md)

- Description: An attacker injects malicious characters or URLs into the request path or query parameters. This occurs if RxHttp or the application doesn't properly encode or validate URLs constructed with user input.
    - Potential Impact: Accessing unauthorized resources, performing unintended actions on the server, server-side request forgery (SSRF), information disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Response Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_response_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

- Attack Vector: Malicious JSON/XML Payload
    - Description: The server sends a crafted JSON or XML response containing malicious content. This becomes a vulnerability if RxHttp or the application's logic improperly processes this response, particularly during deserialization.
    - Potential Impact: Remote code execution (if deserialization is not handled securely), data corruption, application crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [RxHttp or Application Logic Improperly Processes Response](./attack_tree_paths/rxhttp_or_application_logic_improperly_processes_response.md)

- Description: RxHttp or the application's logic fails to securely process the HTTP response received from the server. This includes issues with deserialization, header handling, and handling large responses.
- Consequence: This failure directly enables the exploitation of malicious JSON/XML payloads and other response-based attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious JSON/XML Payload](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_jsonxml_payload.md)

- Description: A specific type of malicious response where the JSON or XML payload is crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in the application's deserialization process.
- Consequence: Often leads to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain complete control of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Improper Certificate Pinning Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/improper_certificate_pinning_configuration.md)

- Description: The application fails to implement or incorrectly implements certificate pinning.
- Consequence: Allows Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, where an attacker can intercept and manipulate communication between the application and the server, potentially stealing sensitive data or injecting malicious content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leaked API Keys/Secrets in Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/leaked_api_keyssecrets_in_configuration.md)

- Description: API keys or other sensitive secrets used by RxHttp are stored insecurely within the application's configuration or code.
- Consequence: Attackers can retrieve these secrets and use them to gain unauthorized access to backend services, impersonate the application, or access sensitive data.
