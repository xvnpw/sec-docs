# Threat Model Analysis for liujingxing/rxhttp

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker identifies a known vulnerability in OkHttp or RxJava (RxHttp's direct dependencies). They then craft malicious requests or responses that exploit this vulnerability when processed by RxHttp, potentially gaining unauthorized access or control. For example, a vulnerability in OkHttp's HTTP/2 implementation could be used to cause a denial-of-service or bypass security checks.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, the impact could range from application crashes and denial of service to remote code execution and data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** Underlying OkHttp and RxJava libraries integrated within RxHttp.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific dependency vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update RxHttp to the latest version, which typically includes updated dependencies.
        *   Implement dependency scanning tools in the development pipeline to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Monitor security advisories for OkHttp and RxJava.

## Threat: [Insecure Default TLS Configuration](./threats/insecure_default_tls_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** RxHttp, by default, might have a TLS configuration that is not sufficiently strict. An attacker could perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack by intercepting network traffic if the application doesn't enforce strong certificate validation or uses outdated TLS protocols due to RxHttp's default settings. The attacker could then eavesdrop on sensitive data or modify requests and responses.
    *   **Impact:** Confidential information transmitted over the network could be compromised. Data integrity could be violated, leading to incorrect application behavior or manipulation of user data.
    *   **Affected Component:** `RxHttp`'s internal `OkHttpClient` configuration, specifically related to `SSLSocketFactory` and `HostnameVerifier`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Explicitly configure RxHttp to use strong TLS protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher).
        *   Ensure strict certificate validation is enabled and that the application does not trust all certificates.
        *   Consider implementing certificate pinning for critical connections to known servers.

## Threat: [Disabled or Improper SSL/TLS Verification](./threats/disabled_or_improper_ssltls_verification.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might intentionally or unintentionally disable SSL/TLS certificate verification when configuring RxHttp. This makes the application highly vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attacks, as the application will trust any server, regardless of its certificate's validity. An attacker can then intercept and manipulate all communication facilitated by RxHttp.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of communication security, allowing attackers to eavesdrop, modify data, and potentially inject malicious content.
    *   **Affected Component:** `RxHttp`'s `OkHttpClient` configuration, specifically the `HostnameVerifier` and `SSLSocketFactory`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never disable SSL/TLS certificate verification in production environments when using RxHttp.
        *   Ensure that the default certificate validation mechanisms within RxHttp's `OkHttpClient` are in place.
        *   If custom certificate handling is required, implement it securely through RxHttp's configuration options and with thorough understanding of the implications.
