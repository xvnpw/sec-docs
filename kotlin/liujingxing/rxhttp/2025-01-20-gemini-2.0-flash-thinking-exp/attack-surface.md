# Attack Surface Analysis for liujingxing/rxhttp

## Attack Surface: [URL Manipulation/Injection](./attack_surfaces/url_manipulationinjection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate the URL used in an RxHttp request, potentially leading to unintended actions or access to unauthorized resources.
    *   **How RxHttp Contributes:** The application passes dynamically constructed URLs to RxHttp's request methods without proper sanitization, and RxHttp executes the request with the attacker-controlled URL.
    *   **Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), access to sensitive data, modification of data, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input before incorporating it into URLs used with RxHttp.
        *   **Parameterized Requests:** Utilize parameterized requests if supported by RxHttp and the backend API.
        *   **Avoid String Concatenation:** Prefer using URL builder classes or methods to construct URLs safely.

## Attack Surface: [Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious HTTP headers into an RxHttp request, potentially leading to various exploits.
    *   **How RxHttp Contributes:** The application allows user input to directly influence HTTP headers passed to RxHttp's `addHeader()` or similar methods without proper validation, and RxHttp includes these malicious headers in the request.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via reflected headers, session fixation, cache poisoning, bypassing security controls.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Header Validation:** Validate and sanitize user input intended for HTTP headers.
        *   **Header Whitelisting:** Only allow setting a predefined set of safe headers.
        *   **Avoid Direct User Input in Headers:** Minimize or eliminate the use of direct user input to set HTTP headers.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization of Responses](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization_of_responses.md)

*   **Description:** If RxHttp is used in conjunction with automatic response deserialization and the application doesn't validate the deserialized data, it could be vulnerable to attacks exploiting flaws in the deserialization process.
    *   **How RxHttp Contributes:** RxHttp fetches the response, and if configured, automatically deserializes it. The application's subsequent use of this unvalidated deserialized data creates the vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (depending on the deserialization library and application logic), data manipulation, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is possible), High (otherwise)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation on Deserialized Data:** Thoroughly validate all data received from API responses after deserialization before using it in the application.
        *   **Use Safe Deserialization Libraries:** Choose deserialization libraries known for their security and keep them updated.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Error Handling](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_error_handling.md)

*   **Description:** RxHttp's error handling or the application's handling of RxHttp errors might inadvertently expose sensitive information.
    *   **How RxHttp Contributes:** RxHttp provides error information (e.g., network errors, server errors). The application's logging or display of these errors without proper filtering can leak sensitive details originating from the RxHttp interaction.
    *   **Impact:** Disclosure of API keys, internal server paths, database credentials, or other sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the sensitivity of the exposed information)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Error Logging:** Log errors securely and redact sensitive information from log messages related to RxHttp interactions.
        *   **Generic Error Messages for Users:** Display generic error messages to users and log detailed error information securely on the server-side.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Secure Connection Enforcement](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_secure_connection_enforcement.md)

*   **Description:** If the application doesn't enforce the use of HTTPS when making requests with RxHttp, it can be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **How RxHttp Contributes:** The application's configuration of RxHttp determines whether secure connections are enforced. If the base URL or individual requests use `http://` instead of `https://`, the connection is insecure when using RxHttp.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transmitted over the network, manipulation of data in transit.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce HTTPS:** Ensure that all API endpoints used with RxHttp utilize HTTPS. Configure RxHttp with a base URL that starts with `https://`.
        *   **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):** Encourage the backend API to implement HSTS.
