## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **High-Risk Path:**
    *   `---***---> [Trigger Stack Overflow via Deeply Nested Folds/Traversals]`
        *   **Description:**  An attacker crafts malicious input containing deeply nested data structures.  When Arrow's `fold`, `traverse`, or similar functions process this input, the recursive calls consume excessive stack space, leading to a stack overflow and application crash (DoS).
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
    *   `---***---> [Craft Input to Maximize Fold/Traversal Depth]`
        *   **Description:** Similar to the stack overflow attack, but the attacker focuses on maximizing the depth of processing even if it doesn't directly cause a stack overflow.  This can lead to excessive CPU and memory consumption.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
    *   `[*** DoS via CPU/Memory Exhaustion ***]`
        *   **Description:** The ultimate goal of the resource exhaustion attacks.  The attacker successfully crashes the application or makes it unresponsive by consuming excessive resources.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

* **Critical Node (Not on highlighted path):**
    *   `[Misuse Lens for Unintended State Modification]`
        *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a custom Lens implementation or uses reflection to bypass intended access restrictions. This allows them to modify data they shouldn't have access to, potentially including security-critical information.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    * `[Find Vulnerable Lens Implementation]`
        * **Description:** Find implementation of Lens that has vulnerability.
        * **Likelihood:** Low
        * **Impact:** High
        * **Effort:** High
        * **Skill Level:** Advanced
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    * `[Bypass Access Control via Lens]`
        * **Description:** Use Lens to bypass access control.
        * **Likelihood:** Low
        * **Impact:** High
        * **Effort:** Medium
        * **Skill Level:** Advanced
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    * `[Modify Security-Critical Data]`
        * **Description:** Modify security-critical data using Lens.
        * **Likelihood:** Low
        * **Impact:** Very High
        * **Effort:** Medium
        * **Skill Level:** Advanced
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Abuse Error Handling](./attack_tree_paths/2__abuse_error_handling.md)

*   **High-Risk Path:**
    *   `---***---> [Exploit `Raise` for Uncaught Exceptions]`
        *   **Description:**  The application uses Arrow's `Raise` effect for error handling.  If errors are not properly caught and handled with a corresponding `catch` block (or equivalent), an unhandled exception can occur, crashing the application (DoS).
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Concurrency Issues](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_concurrency_issues.md)

*   **High-Risk Path:**
    *   `---***---> [Race Conditions due to Improper Synchronization with Shared State]`
        *   **Description:**  The application uses Arrow's concurrency features (e.g., `parZip`, `parMap`) to perform operations in parallel.  If shared mutable state is accessed by multiple threads without proper synchronization (e.g., mutexes, atomic operations), race conditions can occur.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   `[*** Data Corruption/Inconsistency ***]`
        *   **Description:** The result of a successful race condition.  Data is left in an inconsistent or corrupted state due to unpredictable thread interleaving.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Critical Node (Outside High-Risk Paths):](./attack_tree_paths/4__critical_node__outside_high-risk_paths_.md)

    * `[Exploit `kClass.cast` or Similar for Unsafe Type Conversions]`
        * **Description:** An attacker manages to control the type parameter used in a type cast operation (e.g., using `kClass.cast`). This allows them to force an unsafe type conversion, potentially leading to type confusion and, in extreme cases, arbitrary code execution. This is a very difficult attack to pull off in practice, but the potential impact is very high.
        * **Likelihood:** Low
        * **Impact:** High
        * **Effort:** High
        * **Skill Level:** Expert
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
