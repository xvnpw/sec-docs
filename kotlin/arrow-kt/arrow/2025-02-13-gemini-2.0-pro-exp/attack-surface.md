# Attack Surface Analysis for arrow-kt/arrow

## Attack Surface: [1. Unhandled Errors (Ignoring `Either`/`Result`)](./attack_surfaces/1__unhandled_errors__ignoring__either__result__.md)

*   **Description:** Failure to properly handle the error branch of `Either`, `Result`, or `Validated` constructs, leading to unexpected program behavior.
*   **How Arrow Contributes:** Arrow provides these constructs for explicit error handling, but developers can choose to ignore the error case. This is *the* core risk of using Arrow's error handling.
*   **Example:**
    ```kotlin
    val result: Either<Error, User> = getUserFromDatabase(userId)
    val user = result.getOrNull() // Ignoring the potential Left(Error)
    // ... use user, potentially causing a NullPointerException or worse
    ```
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, information leakage (through unhandled exceptions reaching the user), denial of service (due to resource exhaustion), logic flaws bypassing security checks.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (Can lead to a variety of serious issues, depending on the context).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Code Reviews:** Enforce code reviews that *specifically* check for proper handling of `Either`/`Result`/`Validated`.  Reject code that ignores the error branch without explicit justification.
    *   **Static Analysis (Custom Rules):** Develop or find static analysis tools/lint rules that flag unhandled `Either`/`Result` values.  Standard Kotlin null-safety checks are insufficient.
    *   **Comprehensive Error Testing:**  Write unit and integration tests that *specifically* trigger error conditions and verify that the application handles them gracefully and securely.  Focus on boundary conditions and invalid inputs.
    *   **Error Handling Training:**  Provide developers with training on Arrow's error handling best practices, emphasizing the importance of handling *all* possible outcomes.

## Attack Surface: [2. Uncontrolled Side Effects (Outside `IO`)](./attack_surfaces/2__uncontrolled_side_effects__outside__io__.md)

*   **Description:** Performing side effects (e.g., database writes, network calls, file I/O) *outside* of Arrow's `IO` monad, leading to concurrency problems and unpredictable behavior.
*   **How Arrow Contributes:** Arrow's `IO` is designed to manage side effects, but developers might bypass it or misuse it. This is a direct misuse of a core Arrow feature.
*   **Example:**
    ```kotlin
    fun updateUser(user: User) {
        // Side effect OUTSIDE of IO:
        database.update(user) // Direct database interaction, potential race condition
        sendEmailNotification(user) // Another side effect outside IO
    }
    ```
    A correct example would be:
    ```kotlin
    fun updateUser(user: User): IO<Unit> = IO {
        database.update(user)
        sendEmailNotification(user)
    }
    ```
*   **Impact:** Data races, deadlocks, resource leaks, inconsistent application state, potential for denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (Concurrency issues are notoriously difficult to debug and can have severe consequences).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict `IO` Enforcement:**  Establish a coding standard that *requires* all side effects to be encapsulated within `IO`.  Code reviews should enforce this strictly.
    *   **Concurrency Testing:**  Implement robust concurrency testing using tools that can detect race conditions and deadlocks.  This is crucial for identifying subtle concurrency bugs.
    *   **Resource Management with `Resource`:**  Utilize Arrow's `Resource` type to ensure that resources (e.g., database connections, file handles) are acquired and released safely, even in the presence of errors or exceptions.
    *   **Minimize Shared Mutable State:**  Favor immutable data structures and functional programming principles to reduce the risk of concurrency issues.  Avoid shared mutable state whenever possible.

## Attack Surface: [3. Vulnerable Transitive Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/3__vulnerable_transitive_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in libraries that Arrow-kt depends on (transitively), which can be exploited to compromise the application.
*   **How Arrow Contributes:** Arrow, like any library, has dependencies, and those dependencies might have their own dependencies. This is an indirect, but important, aspect of using *any* library, including Arrow.
*   **Example:**  If Arrow depends on a version of a logging library with a known remote code execution vulnerability, the application using Arrow is also vulnerable.
*   **Impact:**  Remote code execution (RCE), denial of service (DoS), data breaches, a wide range of potential security compromises.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (Vulnerabilities in dependencies can be just as dangerous as vulnerabilities in the application's own code).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):**  Use SCA tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, Dependabot) to *automatically* scan your project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.  Integrate this into your CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Regular Dependency Updates:**  Establish a policy of regularly updating Arrow-kt and *all* of its transitive dependencies to the latest stable versions.  Automate this process as much as possible.
    *   **Dependency Minimization:**  Be mindful of the number of dependencies you introduce.  Avoid unnecessary dependencies to reduce the overall attack surface.
    * **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists related to Arrow-kt and its dependencies to stay informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities.
