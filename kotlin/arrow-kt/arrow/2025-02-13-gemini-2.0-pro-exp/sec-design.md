# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a functional programming library for Kotlin to enhance developer productivity and code maintainability.
*   Attract and grow a community of users and contributors around the library.
*   Establish Arrow as a leading functional programming library in the Kotlin ecosystem.
*   Ensure the library is reliable, performant, and well-documented.
*   Offer features that promote type safety and reduce common programming errors.

Business Risks:

*   Low adoption rate due to competition from other libraries or lack of awareness.
*   Difficulty in maintaining the library due to its complexity and evolving Kotlin language features.
*   Security vulnerabilities introduced through dependencies or custom code, potentially leading to exploits in applications using Arrow.
*   Negative impact on project reputation due to bugs, performance issues, or lack of support.
*   Inability to keep up with the evolving Kotlin ecosystem and functional programming best practices.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: The project uses GitHub for version control, which provides built-in security features like access control, audit logs, and branch protection rules. (Described in GitHub repository settings and workflows).
*   security control: The project utilizes GitHub Actions for continuous integration, which can be configured to run security checks. (Described in GitHub workflow files).
*   security control: The project may have code quality checks and linters in place to identify potential issues. (Described in build configuration files and GitHub workflows).
*   security control: Dependency management is handled by Gradle, which allows for specifying versions and potentially using vulnerability scanning tools. (Described in build.gradle.kts files).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The library relies on external dependencies, which may introduce vulnerabilities. Mitigation strategies include regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning.
*   accepted risk: The complexity of functional programming concepts and the library's internals may increase the risk of subtle bugs or security flaws. Mitigation strategies include thorough testing and code reviews.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement static application security testing (SAST) tools in the CI pipeline to automatically scan for vulnerabilities in the codebase.
*   security control: Integrate software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies and manage their updates.
*   security control: Establish a clear security policy and vulnerability disclosure process for the project.
*   security control: Conduct regular security reviews and penetration testing of the library.
*   security control: Provide security documentation and guidance for users of the library.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable to the library itself, as it's a dependency used within other applications. However, any supporting infrastructure (e.g., documentation websites, package repositories) should have appropriate authentication mechanisms.
*   Authorization: Not directly applicable to the library itself. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications using Arrow.
*   Input Validation: The library should employ defensive programming techniques to handle unexpected inputs gracefully and prevent potential vulnerabilities like injection attacks. This is particularly relevant for functions that deal with external data or user-provided inputs.
*   Cryptography: If the library includes any cryptographic functionality, it should adhere to industry best practices and use well-vetted cryptographic libraries. Avoid implementing custom cryptography.

## BUILD

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] -- Commits code --> GitHubRepo["GitHub Repository"]
    GitHubRepo -- Triggers --> GitHubActions["GitHub Actions (CI)"]
    GitHubActions -- Runs --> Build["Build (Gradle)"]

    Build -- Performs --> SAST["SAST (Optional)"]
    Build -- Produces --> Artifacts["Artifacts (JAR files)"]
    GitHubActions -- Publishes --> MavenCentral["Maven Central"]

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers commit code to the GitHub repository.
2.  GitHub Actions is triggered by commits or pull requests.
3.  The GitHub Actions workflow sets up the build environment (e.g., Java, Kotlin, Gradle).
4.  Gradle is used to build the project. This includes:
    *   Compiling the code.
    *   Running unit and integration tests.
    *   Performing linting checks (e.g., using ktlint).
    *   Optionally, running SAST tools for static code analysis.
5.  If all checks pass, Gradle produces the library artifacts (JAR files).
6.  GitHub Actions publishes the artifacts to Maven Central.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: GitHub Actions workflows are defined in code (YAML files) and version-controlled, providing an audit trail of changes.
*   security control: Secrets (e.g., API keys, publishing credentials) are managed securely using GitHub Actions secrets.
*   security control: Linting tools (ktlint) help enforce code style and identify potential issues.
*   security control: SAST tools (optional, but recommended) can be integrated into the build process to detect vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Dependency management (Gradle) allows for specifying versions and using vulnerability scanning tools.
*   security control: Build process is automated, reducing the risk of manual errors and ensuring consistency.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Software development using the Arrow library: Ensuring the library is reliable, secure, and performs well is crucial for developers relying on it.
*   Community engagement: Maintaining a healthy and active community is important for the long-term success of the project.
*   Reputation management: Protecting the reputation of the Arrow project and its contributors.

Data Sensitivity:

*   The library itself does not handle sensitive data directly. However, it's used to build applications that might handle sensitive data. Therefore, the library must be secure to avoid introducing vulnerabilities into those applications.
*   The library's source code and build artifacts are publicly available.
*   Any data handled by CI/CD pipelines (e.g., secrets) should be treated as sensitive.
