# Threat Model Analysis for arrow-kt/arrow

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Arrow-kt Library Code](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_arrow-kt_library_code.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker can directly exploit bugs or security vulnerabilities present within the Arrow-kt library itself. If a vulnerability exists in Arrow-kt's core functionalities, applications using the library become susceptible. An attacker might discover and exploit these vulnerabilities to cause denial of service, information disclosure, or potentially even remote code execution, depending on the nature of the flaw.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, Information Disclosure, Remote Code Execution (depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Affected Arrow Component:** Core Arrow-kt library modules (e.g., Core, Optics, Fx).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always use the latest stable version of Arrow-kt.**
    *   **Monitor Arrow-kt's official channels (GitHub, community forums) for security advisories and updates.**
    *   **Subscribe to security mailing lists or vulnerability databases that track Kotlin and Arrow-kt related issues.**
    *   **Implement a process for quickly patching or updating Arrow-kt when security vulnerabilities are announced.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Arrow-kt Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_arrow-kt_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker can indirectly exploit vulnerabilities present in the dependencies of Arrow-kt. If a dependency used by Arrow-kt contains a security flaw, applications using Arrow-kt can be affected, even if the Arrow-kt code itself is secure. An attacker might exploit these transitive dependencies to compromise the application.
*   **Impact:** Various, depending on the vulnerability in the dependency (e.g., Denial of Service, Information Disclosure, Remote Code Execution).
*   **Affected Arrow Component:** Arrow-kt's dependency management, transitive dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk) to identify vulnerabilities in Arrow-kt's dependencies.**
    *   **Regularly update dependencies, including transitive dependencies, to their latest secure versions.**
    *   **Implement a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track and manage dependencies effectively.**
    *   **Monitor security advisories for Arrow-kt's dependencies and proactively address reported vulnerabilities.**
