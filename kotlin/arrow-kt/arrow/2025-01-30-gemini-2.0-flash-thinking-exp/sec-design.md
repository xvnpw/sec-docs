# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Arrow-kt/arrow project is a library for Kotlin that aims to bring functional programming paradigms and tools to the Kotlin ecosystem.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide high-quality, robust functional programming tools for Kotlin developers.
  - Increase developer productivity and code quality by enabling functional programming techniques.
  - Foster a strong community around functional programming in Kotlin.
  - Ensure compatibility and interoperability with existing Kotlin and Java ecosystems.

- Business Risks:
  - Adoption risk: The library might not be widely adopted by Kotlin developers.
  - Community risk: Lack of sufficient community contribution and support could hinder the project's growth and maintenance.
  - Compatibility risk: Changes in Kotlin or Java platforms could break compatibility and require significant rework.
  - Security risk: Vulnerabilities in the library could negatively impact projects that depend on it.
  - Maintenance risk: Long-term maintenance and support might be challenging if the project lacks resources or community engagement.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Review - The project is open source, allowing for community review of the code. Implemented: GITHUB REPOSITORY.
  - security control: Version Control - Source code is managed in a version control system (Git). Implemented: GITHUB REPOSITORY.
  - security control: Publicly Available - The library is publicly available, allowing for broad scrutiny and usage. Implemented: GITHUB REPOSITORY, MAVEN CENTRAL (or similar).

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities -  The library depends on other open-source libraries, which might contain vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Code Vulnerabilities -  The library code itself might contain vulnerabilities that are not yet discovered.
  - accepted risk: Supply Chain Risk -  The build and release process might be vulnerable to supply chain attacks.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Dependency Scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the build process to detect potential code vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA) - Use SCA tools to manage and monitor open source components and their licenses.
  - security control: Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits of the codebase by security experts.
  - security control: Secure Release Process - Implement a secure release process, including code signing and verification of artifacts.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a library. Authentication is relevant for systems that use this library, but not for the library itself.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a library. Authorization is relevant for systems that use this library.
  - Input Validation: Important for library APIs. The library should perform input validation to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities in systems that use it. This should be considered for all public facing APIs of the library.
  - Cryptography: Potentially relevant if the library provides cryptographic functionalities. If so, ensure proper and secure implementation of cryptographic algorithms and key management. If not, avoid implementing custom cryptography and rely on well-established libraries.
