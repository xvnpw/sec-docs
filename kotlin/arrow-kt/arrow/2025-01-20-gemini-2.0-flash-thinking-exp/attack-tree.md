## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Type System Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_type_system_weaknesses.md)

* **High-Risk Path: Exploit Type System Weaknesses**

    * **Critical Node: Type Class Instance Injection**
        * Attack Vector: Provide Malicious Type Class Instance
            * Description: The application uses Arrow's type classes and relies on implicit resolution to find instances. An attacker crafts a malicious type class instance that, when resolved and used by the application, overrides the intended behavior. This malicious instance could perform actions like:
                * Executing arbitrary code within the application's context.
                * Modifying data in unexpected ways, leading to data corruption or privilege escalation.
                * Bypassing security checks by providing an instance that always returns a "success" or "authorized" result.
            * Likelihood: Medium
            * Impact: High
            * Effort: Medium
            * Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
            * Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Effect System (IO, Resource)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_effect_system__io__resource_.md)

* **High-Risk Path: Abuse Effect System (IO, Resource)**

    * **Critical Node: Uncontrolled Side Effects in IO**
        * Attack Vector: Inject Malicious IO Action
            * Description: The application uses Arrow's `IO` monad to manage side effects. An attacker finds a way to inject or manipulate `IO` actions that are subsequently executed by the application. This could involve:
                * Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application constructs `IO` actions from external input.
                * Manipulating data structures that hold `IO` actions before they are executed.
                * Using reflection or other techniques to introduce malicious `IO` actions.
            * Consequences of executing malicious `IO` actions:
                * Performing unauthorized file system operations (reading, writing, deleting files).
                * Making unauthorized network requests to external systems.
                * Executing arbitrary system commands.
                * Accessing or modifying sensitive data.
            * Likelihood: Medium
            * Impact: High
            * Effort: Medium
            * Skill Level: Intermediate
            * Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Vulnerabilities Introduced by Arrow](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_vulnerabilities_introduced_by_arrow.md)

* **High-Risk Path: Dependency Vulnerabilities Introduced by Arrow**

    * **Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Arrow's Transitive Dependencies**
        * Attack Vector: Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries
            * Description: Arrow-kt, like most software libraries, depends on other libraries (transitive dependencies). These underlying libraries might have known security vulnerabilities. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities if they exist in the versions used by the application. This can be done by:
                * Identifying the specific versions of Arrow's dependencies used by the application.
                * Searching for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) associated with those versions.
                * Crafting exploits that target those vulnerabilities.
            * Potential consequences depend on the specific vulnerability but can include:
                * Remote code execution.
                * Denial of service.
                * Information disclosure.
                * Other forms of compromise.
            * Likelihood: Medium
            * Impact: High
            * Effort: Low to Medium
            * Skill Level: Basic to Intermediate
            * Detection Difficulty: Low
