# Attack Surface Analysis for arrow-kt/arrow

## Attack Surface: [Logic Errors in Functional Composition](./attack_surfaces/logic_errors_in_functional_composition.md)

* **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from incorrect or insecure composition of functional operations, leading to unexpected program behavior.
    * **How Arrow Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Arrow encourages functional programming with immutable data and function composition. Incorrectly chained operations, especially those dealing with side effects or error handling (like `Either` or `IO`), can introduce subtle bugs that are hard to detect and potentially exploitable.
    * **Example:** A sequence of `Either` computations where a critical error case (`Either.Left`) is not properly handled, leading to a default or fallback path being executed unintentionally, bypassing security checks.
    * **Impact:**  Bypassing security controls, incorrect data processing, unexpected state changes, potential for denial of service if errors lead to infinite loops or resource exhaustion.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement thorough unit and integration tests for all functional compositions, especially those involving error handling and side effects.
        * Use linters and static analysis tools to identify potential issues in functional code.
        * Employ property-based testing to explore a wider range of inputs and compositions.
        * Carefully review and document the intended behavior of complex functional pipelines.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Type Class Implementations](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_type_class_implementations.md)

* **Description:** Security flaws introduced within custom implementations of Arrow's type classes (e.g., `Eq`, `Show`, `Monad`).
    * **How Arrow Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Arrow's power lies in its type classes, allowing for polymorphism and abstraction. If developers create custom instances of these type classes with security vulnerabilities, those flaws can be exploited wherever that instance is used.
    * **Example:** A custom `Eq` instance for a user authentication object that incorrectly compares user credentials, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication.
    * **Impact:**  Authentication bypass, authorization failures, data corruption, information disclosure depending on the vulnerable type class.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Exercise extreme caution when implementing custom type class instances, especially for security-sensitive data.
        * Thoroughly test custom type class implementations with a focus on security implications.
        * Consider using existing, well-vetted implementations where possible.
        * Conduct code reviews specifically focusing on custom type class logic.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Optics for Data Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_optics_for_data_manipulation.md)

* **Description:**  Exploiting Arrow's Optics (Lenses, Prisms, etc.) to access and modify data in unintended or unauthorized ways.
    * **How Arrow Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Optics provide powerful mechanisms for navigating and manipulating immutable data structures. If an attacker can influence the optics used within the application, they can potentially modify sensitive data or bypass access controls.
    * **Example:**  An attacker manipulates user input that is used to construct a Lens, allowing them to modify a user's permissions or other sensitive attributes within an application's state.
    * **Impact:**  Privilege escalation, data corruption, unauthorized data access, bypassing business logic.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Sanitize and validate any input used to construct or select Optics.
        * Limit the creation and usage of dynamic Optics based on user input.
        * Consider using more restricted forms of Optics if full flexibility is not required.
        * Implement access controls and authorization checks before applying Optics to modify data.

## Attack Surface: [Security Implications of Effect Systems (e.g., `IO`, `Resource`)](./attack_surfaces/security_implications_of_effect_systems__e_g____io____resource__.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from the incorrect or insecure handling of side effects managed by Arrow's effect systems.
    * **How Arrow Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Arrow's `IO` type allows for controlled side effects. If `IO` actions are composed without proper security considerations, they can introduce vulnerabilities related to external interactions.
    * **Example:** Unsanitized user input is passed to an `IO` action that executes a shell command, leading to command injection.
    * **Impact:**  Remote code execution, command injection, information disclosure through uncontrolled external interactions.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Treat all external interactions within `IO` as potentially dangerous.
        * Sanitize and validate all input before using it in `IO` actions that interact with external systems.
        * Avoid constructing shell commands directly from user input. Use parameterized commands or safer alternatives.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Issues with Arrow Data Types](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_issues_with_arrow_data_types.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities introduced during the deserialization of Arrow's data types (e.g., `Either`, sealed classes, data classes using Arrow features).
    * **How Arrow Contributes to the Attack Surface:** While not inherently an Arrow vulnerability, the complexity of Arrow's data types can increase the likelihood of errors or vulnerabilities in custom serialization/deserialization logic if not handled carefully.
    * **Example:** A custom deserializer for an `Either` type fails to properly validate the structure of the incoming data, allowing an attacker to inject malicious data into the application's state.
    * **Impact:**  Remote code execution (if deserialization leads to object instantiation with malicious code), data corruption, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use well-vetted and secure serialization libraries.
        * Implement robust validation of deserialized data to ensure its integrity and prevent malicious payloads.
        * Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources if possible.
        * Consider using safer serialization formats that are less prone to vulnerabilities.
