# Threat Model Analysis for arrow-kt/arrow

## Threat: [Race Conditions and Deadlocks due to Improper Effect Management](./threats/race_conditions_and_deadlocks_due_to_improper_effect_management.md)

**Threat:** Race Conditions and Deadlocks due to Improper Effect Management

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit improperly managed effects (like `IO`, `Resource`) in concurrent scenarios provided by `arrow-kt/arrow-fx-coroutines`. This could involve manipulating the timing of operations or introducing unexpected states, leading to race conditions where the outcome depends on the unpredictable order of execution, or deadlocks where threads or fibers are blocked indefinitely.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, application crashes, denial of service, or inconsistent application state leading to security vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected Arrow Component:** Primarily affects code using effect types in `arrow-kt/arrow-fx-coroutines` (e.g., `IO`, `Resource`, `parMap`, `race`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly adhere to functional programming principles, minimizing mutable shared state.
    *   Carefully manage the lifecycle and scope of effects, especially in concurrent contexts.
    *   Utilize appropriate synchronization primitives (if absolutely necessary) when dealing with shared mutable state within effects.
    *   Thoroughly test concurrent code under various load conditions to identify potential race conditions or deadlocks.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Unhandled `Either` Errors](./threats/information_disclosure_through_unhandled__either__errors.md)

**Threat:** Information Disclosure through Unhandled `Either` Errors

*   **Description:** An attacker might trigger error conditions that result in unhandled `Either` types propagating outwards from `arrow-kt/arrow-core`. If the left side of the `Either` (representing the error) contains sensitive information and is not properly handled before being logged or returned in an API response, this information could be exposed to the attacker.
*   **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive data, including internal system details, user information, or business logic.
*   **Affected Arrow Component:** Primarily affects code using `Either` from `arrow-kt/arrow-core`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the sensitivity of the information).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always handle both the left (error) and right (success) sides of `Either` explicitly.
    *   Sanitize or redact sensitive information from error messages before logging or returning them to external systems.
    *   Define specific error types that do not contain sensitive data for external communication.
    *   Implement centralized error handling mechanisms to ensure consistent and secure error reporting.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion with `Resource`](./threats/denial_of_service_through_resource_exhaustion_with__resource_.md)

**Threat:** Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion with `Resource`

*   **Description:** An attacker could intentionally trigger the acquisition of resources managed by Arrow's `Resource` type from `arrow-kt/arrow-fx-coroutines` without ensuring their proper release. Repeatedly acquiring resources without releasing them could lead to resource exhaustion (e.g., database connections, file handles), causing a denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation, potential system instability.
*   **Affected Arrow Component:** Primarily affects code using `Resource` from `arrow-kt/arrow-fx-coroutines`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the criticality of the resource).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure that `Resource` usage is always within a safe context that guarantees release (e.g., using `use` or `bracket`).
    *   Implement appropriate timeouts and resource limits to prevent excessive resource consumption.
    *   Monitor resource usage to detect potential leaks or abuse.
