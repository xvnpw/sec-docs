# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for arrow-kt/arrow

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Error Handling in `Either` and `Option` (Arrow-kt Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_error_handling_in__either__and__option___arrow-kt_specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Sanitize Error Messages in Arrow-kt `Either` and `Option`
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Arrow-kt Error Usage:**  Specifically examine all code sections where Arrow-kt's `Either.Left` and `Option.None` are used to represent error conditions or absence of values. Identify what data is being placed within these constructs.
    2.  **Create Arrow-kt Specific Sanitization Logic:** Develop sanitization functions or logic that are applied *specifically* when creating `Either.Left` or `Option.None` instances that might be exposed externally or logged in non-secure locations. This logic should replace sensitive details with generic error codes or user-friendly messages.
    3.  **Implement Arrow-kt Error Mapping:** Utilize Arrow-kt's functional capabilities (like `mapLeft` on `Either`) to transform detailed error information into sanitized versions *within* the functional flow, ensuring sanitization is consistently applied when dealing with error types.
    4.  **Test Arrow-kt Error Paths:**  Focus testing efforts on error handling paths within the application that utilize `Either` and `Option`. Verify that sanitized messages are produced in user-facing scenarios and detailed information is only present in secure logs.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Leakage (High Severity):** Exposure of sensitive system information through verbose error messages within Arrow-kt's `Either.Left` or `Option.None`, potentially aiding attackers.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Leakage:** High reduction. By sanitizing error messages specifically within Arrow-kt error handling constructs, the risk of information leakage is significantly reduced in functional error flows.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in API layer using generic error responses, but not consistently applied to all `Either` and `Option` usages across the application.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Missing consistent sanitization logic applied to all `Either.Left` and `Option.None` instances, especially in backend services and internal processing logic that utilizes Arrow-kt for error representation. Need to implement systematic sanitization within Arrow-kt error handling workflows.
