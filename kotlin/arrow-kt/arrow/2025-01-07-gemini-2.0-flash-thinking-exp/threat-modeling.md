# Threat Model Analysis for arrow-kt/arrow

## Threat: [Unhandled `Option.None` Leading to Null Pointer Exceptions](./threats/unhandled__option_none__leading_to_null_pointer_exceptions.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could provide input or trigger a state where an `Option` variable is `None` (representing the absence of a value). If the application doesn't explicitly handle this `None` case using methods like `getOrElse`, `fold`, or pattern matching provided by Arrow, it can lead to a `NullPointerException` at runtime. This can be triggered by providing unexpected data or manipulating the application state to create null scenarios where Arrow's `Option` is used.
*   **Impact:** Application crashes, denial of service, potential for information leakage if the crash dumps contain sensitive data.
*   **Affected Arrow Component:** `arrow-core` module, `Option` data type.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce explicit handling of `Option.None` using methods like `getOrElse`, `fold`, `orElse`, or pattern matching provided by Arrow.
    *   Utilize linters and static analysis tools to identify potential unhandled `Option.None` cases.
    *   Write unit tests specifically covering scenarios where `Option` variables might be `None`.

## Threat: [Improper Handling of `Either.Left` Leading to Incorrect Program Flow](./threats/improper_handling_of__either_left__leading_to_incorrect_program_flow.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could intentionally trigger conditions that result in an `Either` variable being in the `Left` state (representing an error). If the application logic doesn't properly handle the `Left` case using Arrow's combinators and continues processing as if the operation was successful, it can lead to incorrect data processing, logical errors, or security bypasses. This could involve providing invalid input or exploiting business logic flaws that interact with Arrow's `Either`.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, incorrect business logic execution, potential security vulnerabilities if error conditions are not properly addressed (e.g., bypassing authorization checks).
*   **Affected Arrow Component:** `arrow-core` module, `Either` data type.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure comprehensive handling of `Either.Left` cases using methods like `fold`, `mapLeft`, or pattern matching provided by Arrow.
    *   Log error conditions represented by `Either.Left` for debugging and auditing purposes.
    *   Implement clear error propagation mechanisms to prevent silent failures when using Arrow's `Either`.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Arrow-kt Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_arrow-kt_library_itself.md)

*   **Description:** Like any software library, Arrow-kt might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities in its core implementation. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if they are discovered.
*   **Impact:**  Potentially wide-ranging, depending on the nature of the vulnerability. Could lead to remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Arrow Component:** Various modules within the Arrow-kt library.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Arrow-kt to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues related to Arrow-kt.
    *   Contribute to the Arrow-kt project by reporting any potential security issues found.
