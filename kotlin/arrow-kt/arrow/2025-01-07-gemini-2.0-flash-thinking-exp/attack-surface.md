# Attack Surface Analysis for arrow-kt/arrow

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Type Class Instances](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_type_class_instances.md)

**Description:** If custom instances for Arrow's type classes (e.g., `Eq`, `Ord`) are implemented incorrectly or insecurely, they can introduce vulnerabilities wherever those type classes are used.

**How Arrow Contributes:** Arrow's power lies in its type class system, allowing developers to define custom behavior for different types. Poorly implemented instances directly introduce security risks within the Arrow ecosystem of the application.

**Example:**
```kotlin
data class User(val id: Int, val email: String)

// Insecure Eq instance (only compares IDs):
object UserEq : Eq<User> {
    override fun User.eqv(other: User): Boolean = this.id == other.id
}

// Vulnerable code:
val user1 = User(1, "attacker@example.com")
val user2 = User(1, "legitimate@example.com")
println(user1.eqv(user2)) // Output: true, despite different emails
```

**Impact:** Bypass of security checks, data manipulation, incorrect authorization decisions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Thoroughly review and test custom type class instances for correctness and security implications.**
* **Adhere to the principles of the type class when implementing instances.**
* **Consider using existing, well-tested instances where possible.**

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Issues with Arrow's Serialization Modules](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_issues_with_arrow's_serialization_modules.md)

**Description:** If the application uses Arrow's serialization modules (e.g., `arrow-serializers`), vulnerabilities related to deserializing untrusted data can arise, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other security breaches.

**How Arrow Contributes:** Arrow provides modules for serialization, making it easier to serialize and deserialize data. This direct integration introduces the potential for deserialization vulnerabilities if not handled securely.

**Example:** (Illustrative - specific vulnerability depends on the serializer used)
```kotlin
import arrow.serializers.json.Json

// Potentially vulnerable code if userInput is malicious:
val deserializedData = Json.decodeFromString<MyDataClass>(userInput)
```

**Impact:** Remote code execution, data corruption, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Sanitize and validate all data before deserialization.**
* **Consider using safer serialization formats or libraries if handling highly sensitive or untrusted data.**
* **Keep Arrow's serialization modules updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.**
* **Implement proper access controls to limit who can provide data for deserialization.**

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion with `IO` and Concurrency Primitives](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_with__io__and_concurrency_primitives.md)

**Description:** Improper use of Arrow's `IO` type or other concurrency primitives can lead to resource exhaustion, such as excessive memory or thread consumption, resulting in denial of service.

**How Arrow Contributes:** Arrow's `IO` monad and related constructs facilitate asynchronous and concurrent operations. The way these features are used directly impacts the application's susceptibility to resource exhaustion attacks.

**Example:**
```kotlin
import arrow.fx.IO
import arrow.fx.unsafe.runBlocking

// Potentially vulnerable code:
fun processRequest(): IO<Unit> = IO { /* Simulate resource-intensive operation */ }

fun handleMultipleRequests(count: Int) = (0 until count).map { processRequest() }.sequence()

// If userInput is a large number, this could exhaust resources
runBlocking { handleMultipleRequests(userInput.toInt()).unsafeRunSync() }
```

**Impact:** Denial of service, application slowdown, system instability.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Implement proper resource management for asynchronous operations (e.g., using bounded thread pools, backpressure).**
* **Limit the number of concurrent operations based on available resources.**
* **Implement timeouts and circuit breakers to prevent runaway operations.**
* **Monitor resource usage and implement alerts for potential exhaustion.**
