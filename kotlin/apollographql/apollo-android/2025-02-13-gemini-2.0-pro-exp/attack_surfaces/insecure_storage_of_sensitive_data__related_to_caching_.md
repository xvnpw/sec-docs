# Deep Analysis: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data (Related to Caching) in Apollo Android

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly investigate the risk of insecurely storing sensitive data fetched via GraphQL using the `apollo-android` library.  We will examine how the library's default caching mechanisms can lead to vulnerabilities, explore specific attack scenarios, and provide detailed, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the initial high-level overview.  The ultimate goal is to provide developers with the knowledge and tools to prevent data breaches related to `apollo-android`'s caching.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on:

*   **`apollo-android` library:**  Versions 3.x and later (as the most commonly used and actively maintained).  We will consider earlier versions if significant differences in caching behavior exist.
*   **Default caching mechanisms:**  `NormalizedCache` (both in-memory and SQLite-based) provided by `apollo-android`.
*   **Sensitive data:**  This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   Authentication tokens (JWTs, API keys, session identifiers)
    *   Personally Identifiable Information (PII) (names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth)
    *   Financial information (credit card numbers, bank account details)
    *   Protected Health Information (PHI)
    *   Any data subject to regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA, etc.)
    *   Any data that, if exposed, could cause harm or embarrassment to the user.
*   **Android platform:**  We will consider the security features and limitations of the Android operating system, including different API levels and device configurations.
*   **Attack vectors:**  Focus on scenarios where an attacker gains access to the device's file system or memory.

This analysis *excludes*:

*   Server-side vulnerabilities (e.g., GraphQL server misconfigurations).
*   Network-level attacks (e.g., Man-in-the-Middle attacks).  While important, these are separate attack surfaces.
*   Other client-side vulnerabilities unrelated to `apollo-android`'s caching.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the `apollo-android` source code (available on GitHub) to understand the implementation details of the caching mechanisms, particularly `NormalizedCache` and its interaction with SQLite and in-memory storage.
2.  **Documentation Review:**  Analyze the official `apollo-android` documentation, including caching guides, API references, and security recommendations.
3.  **Experimentation:**  Create a test Android application that uses `apollo-android` to fetch and cache sensitive data.  We will then use Android debugging tools (ADB, Android Studio's debugger, file explorers) to inspect the cache contents and assess the level of security.
4.  **Threat Modeling:**  Develop specific attack scenarios based on common Android attack vectors (e.g., compromised device, malicious apps with file system access).
5.  **Best Practices Research:**  Investigate industry best practices for secure data storage on Android, including the use of EncryptedSharedPreferences, the Android Keystore system, and secure coding guidelines.
6.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** Search for known vulnerabilities related to `apollo-android` caching or similar libraries.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 4.1.  `apollo-android` Caching Mechanisms: A Closer Look

`apollo-android` provides a `NormalizedCache` to improve performance and reduce network requests.  This cache stores GraphQL responses in a normalized format, keyed by the object's ID and field name.  The two primary implementations are:

*   **`MemoryCache`:**  An in-memory cache that is fast but volatile.  Data is lost when the application process is terminated.  While seemingly less vulnerable, data in memory *can* be accessed by attackers with sufficient privileges (e.g., root access, debugging tools on a compromised device).
*   **`SqlNormalizedCache`:**  A persistent cache that uses an SQLite database to store data.  By default, this database is stored in the application's private data directory (`/data/data/<package_name>/databases/`).  This is the *primary concern* for insecure storage.

### 4.2.  The Vulnerability: Unencrypted SQLite Database

The core vulnerability lies in the fact that the `SqlNormalizedCache`, by default, stores data in a *plain-text* SQLite database.  While the application's private data directory is protected by Android's sandboxing mechanism, this protection is *not* absolute.  Several scenarios can lead to data exposure:

*   **Rooted/Compromised Device:**  An attacker with root access can bypass the sandboxing and directly access the SQLite database file.  This is the most common and severe threat.
*   **Malicious Apps with `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` Permission (Pre-Android 10):**  On older Android versions, apps with this permission could potentially access the application's data directory if it was inadvertently placed on external storage (which is *not* recommended but possible).
*   **Backup Exploits:**  Android's backup system (both cloud and local backups) can be exploited to extract the database file.  If the backup is not encrypted, or the encryption key is weak, the attacker can access the data.
*   **Debugging Tools:**  Developers (or attackers with physical access to the device) can use ADB to pull the database file from the device, even without root access, if USB debugging is enabled.
*   **Vulnerabilities in SQLite itself:** While rare, vulnerabilities in the SQLite library could potentially be exploited to read or modify the database contents.

### 4.3.  Attack Scenarios

Let's illustrate with concrete examples:

**Scenario 1: Rooted Device**

1.  An attacker roots a user's device.
2.  The attacker uses a file explorer with root access to navigate to `/data/data/<your_app_package>/databases/`.
3.  The attacker finds the SQLite database file created by `apollo-android`.
4.  The attacker opens the database file using an SQLite browser and extracts sensitive data, such as authentication tokens or user profiles.

**Scenario 2: ADB Backup Extraction**

1.  A user enables USB debugging on their device.
2.  An attacker connects the device to a computer.
3.  The attacker uses `adb backup` to create a backup of the application's data.
4.  The attacker extracts the backup archive and finds the SQLite database file.
5.  The attacker opens the database file and extracts sensitive data.

**Scenario 3: Malicious App (Pre-Android 10)**
1.  The application is incorrectly configured to store data on external storage.
2.  A malicious app with `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission is installed.
3.  The malicious app scans the external storage for SQLite database files.
4.  The malicious app finds the `apollo-android` database and extracts sensitive data.

### 4.4.  Mitigation Strategies: Detailed Implementation

The initial mitigation strategies were high-level.  Here's a detailed breakdown with code examples:

**1.  Never Store Sensitive Data in the Default Cache:**

This is the most crucial step.  Modify your GraphQL queries to *exclude* sensitive fields from being cached by `apollo-android`.  Use the `@skip` directive:

```graphql
query GetUserProfile {
  user(id: "123") {
    id
    username
    email @skip(if: true)  # Skip caching the email
    authToken @skip(if: true) # Skip caching the auth token
  }
}
```

This prevents sensitive fields from ever entering the `apollo-android` cache.

**2.  Use EncryptedSharedPreferences (for small, key-value data):**

For small pieces of sensitive data like tokens, `EncryptedSharedPreferences` is a good option:

```java
// Kotlin
import androidx.security.crypto.EncryptedSharedPreferences
import androidx.security.crypto.MasterKeys

val masterKeyAlias = MasterKeys.getOrCreate(MasterKeys.AES256_GCM_SPEC)

val sharedPreferences = EncryptedSharedPreferences.create(
    "secret_shared_prefs",
    masterKeyAlias,
    context,
    EncryptedSharedPreferences.PrefKeyEncryptionScheme.AES256_SIV,
    EncryptedSharedPreferences.PrefValueEncryptionScheme.AES256_GCM
)

// Store the token
sharedPreferences.edit().putString("auth_token", authToken).apply()

// Retrieve the token
val retrievedToken = sharedPreferences.getString("auth_token", null)
```

**3.  Use the Android Keystore System (for cryptographic keys):**

If you need to store cryptographic keys used for encrypting other data, use the Android Keystore:

```java
// Kotlin
import java.security.KeyStore

val keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance("AndroidKeyStore").apply {
    load(null)
}

// Generate a key (example)
val keyGenerator = KeyGenerator.getInstance(KeyProperties.KEY_ALGORITHM_AES, "AndroidKeyStore")
keyGenerator.init(
    KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder("my_key_alias",
        KeyProperties.PURPOSE_ENCRYPT or KeyProperties.PURPOSE_DECRYPT)
        .setBlockModes(KeyProperties.BLOCK_MODE_GCM)
        .setEncryptionPaddings(KeyProperties.ENCRYPTION_PADDING_NONE)
        .build()
)
val secretKey = keyGenerator.generateKey()

// Use the key to encrypt/decrypt data (using a Cipher)
```

**4.  Custom Cache Implementation with Encryption:**

If you *must* cache larger sensitive data structures, implement a custom `NormalizedCache` that encrypts the data before storing it in SQLite (or another persistent storage mechanism).  This is the most complex but most flexible approach.

```java
// Kotlin (Illustrative - Requires significant additional code)
import com.apollographql.apollo3.cache.normalized.api.NormalizedCache
import com.apollographql.apollo3.cache.normalized.api.Record
import javax.crypto.Cipher
import javax.crypto.SecretKey
// ... other imports

class EncryptedNormalizedCache(private val secretKey: SecretKey) : NormalizedCache() {

    override fun loadRecord(key: String, cacheHeaders: CacheHeaders): Record? {
        // 1. Load the encrypted record from SQLite (or other storage).
        // 2. Decrypt the record using the secretKey and a Cipher.
        // 3. Return the decrypted Record.
        return null // Placeholder - Implement decryption logic
    }

    override fun merge(records: Collection<Record>, cacheHeaders: CacheHeaders): Set<String> {
        // 1. Encrypt each Record using the secretKey and a Cipher.
        // 2. Store the encrypted records in SQLite (or other storage).
        // 3. Return the set of changed keys.
        return emptySet() // Placeholder - Implement encryption and storage logic
    }
    // ... other methods to override ...
}
```

**Key Considerations for Custom Cache:**

*   **Key Management:**  Securely store and manage the `secretKey` used for encryption.  Use the Android Keystore system.
*   **Encryption Algorithm:**  Use a strong, modern encryption algorithm like AES-256-GCM.
*   **Initialization Vector (IV):**  Use a unique, random IV for each encryption operation.  *Never* reuse IVs with GCM.
*   **Performance:**  Encryption and decryption add overhead.  Consider the performance impact on your application.
*   **Data Integrity:** Use authenticated encryption (like AES-GCM) to ensure data integrity and prevent tampering.

**5. Disable Android Backup (if appropriate):**
If your app does not require backup functionality, or if the risk of exposing cached data via backup is too high, you can disable Android backup entirely:

```xml
<!-- In your AndroidManifest.xml -->
<application
    ...
    android:allowBackup="false"
    android:fullBackupContent="false"
    ...>
</application>
```
Or, use a custom backup scheme to exclude the cache database.

**6.  Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**

Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

## 5. Conclusion

The default caching behavior of `apollo-android` presents a significant security risk if used to store sensitive data without proper precautions.  Developers *must* take proactive steps to mitigate this risk.  The most effective approach is to prevent sensitive data from entering the cache in the first place.  If caching is unavoidable, use secure storage mechanisms provided by Android, such as `EncryptedSharedPreferences` or a custom, encrypted `NormalizedCache`.  Proper key management and adherence to secure coding practices are essential for protecting user data.  Regular security audits and penetration testing are crucial for maintaining a strong security posture.
