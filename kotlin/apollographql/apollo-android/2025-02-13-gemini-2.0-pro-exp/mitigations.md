# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apollographql/apollo-android

## Mitigation Strategy: [Server-Side Query Complexity and Depth Limiting (with Client Awareness)](./mitigation_strategies/server-side_query_complexity_and_depth_limiting__with_client_awareness_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Documentation Review:** Android developers, using `apollo-android`, review the documented limits provided by the backend team (regarding query complexity and depth).
    2.  **Client-Side Design:**  Design GraphQL queries within the `apollo-android` client (in `.graphql` files or programmatically) to stay within the server's defined limits. Avoid deeply nested or overly complex queries.
    3.  **Error Handling:** Implement error handling in the `apollo-android` client to detect server responses indicating query complexity violations (typically a specific error code or message in the GraphQL error response). Use `apollo-android`'s error handling mechanisms.
    4.  **User Feedback:** When a complexity violation occurs, provide user-friendly feedback (e.g., "Your request is too complex. Please simplify it."). Do *not* expose raw error messages from the server.
    5.  **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests using `apollo-android` that deliberately send complex queries to verify the server's enforcement and the client's error handling.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) due to Complex Queries:** (Severity: High) - Client-side awareness helps prevent sending queries that would be rejected by the server.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** (Severity: Medium) - Client avoids sending unnecessarily resource-intensive queries.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS due to Complex Queries:** Risk reduced. The client is designed to avoid triggering the issue.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced. Client-side awareness helps minimize the likelihood of sending resource-intensive queries.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Error handling for GraphQL errors is implemented in `NetworkClient.kt`.
    *   Basic query structure is defined in `.graphql` files.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Specific tests for query complexity violations are missing.
    *   No explicit design considerations to minimize query complexity within the `apollo-android` client code.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Persisted Queries](./mitigation_strategies/use_persisted_queries.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Client-Side Integration:** Configure the `apollo-android` client to use persisted queries. Instead of sending the full query string with each request, the client sends the identifier (hash or ID) of the pre-registered query. This requires using `apollo-android`'s APIs for persisted queries.
    2.  **Automated Generation (with Client Integration):** Integrate a tool (like `apollo-tooling`) into the Android build process. This tool should:
        *   Automatically extract GraphQL queries from the project (e.g., from `.graphql` files).
        *   Generate a manifest of persisted queries (mapping query strings to identifiers).
        *   Potentially upload the manifest to the server (depending on the server's setup).
        *   Configure `apollo-android` to use the generated manifest.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arbitrary Query Injection:** (Severity: High) - The client *cannot* send arbitrary queries; it only sends pre-approved identifiers.
    *   **Reduced Attack Surface:** (Severity: Medium) - The server only exposes a limited set of operations.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Query Injection:** Risk almost entirely eliminated from the client-side perspective.
    *   **Reduced Attack Surface:** Significant reduction in attack surface.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   None. The project currently sends full query strings using `apollo-android`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Entirely missing. Requires client-side changes and build process integration with `apollo-android`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of GraphQL Errors](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_graphql_errors.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Error Parsing:** Use `apollo-android`'s error handling capabilities (e.g., `ApolloCall.Callback`, `ApolloException`) to parse GraphQL error responses. Extract relevant information (error code, message, extensions, path).
    2.  **Sanitization:** *Never* directly display raw error messages from the server to the user. Sanitize the error information within the `apollo-android` client code, removing any potentially sensitive details.
    3.  **User-Friendly Messages:** Create user-friendly error messages based on the parsed and sanitized error information. Provide helpful guidance to the user, appropriate for the application's context.
    4.  **Secure Logging:** When logging errors for debugging within the `apollo-android` client, be extremely careful not to log sensitive data that might be present in the raw error response. Redact or remove any sensitive information before logging.
    5.  **Error Classification:** Within the `apollo-android` client, differentiate between different types of GraphQL errors (e.g., validation errors, authorization errors, internal server errors) and handle them appropriately (different UI treatment, retry logic, etc.).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Error Messages:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents leaking sensitive information through error messages displayed by the `apollo-android` client.
    *   **Improved User Experience:** (Severity: Low) - Provides more helpful and less confusing error messages.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced. Raw error messages are not exposed by the client.
    *   **Improved User Experience:** Positive impact on user experience.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic error parsing is done in `NetworkClient.kt` using `apollo-android`'s APIs.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No sanitization of error messages before displaying them to the user within the `apollo-android` client.
    *   No secure logging practices in place for error handling within the client.
    *   No differentiation between different types of GraphQL errors within the client's error handling logic.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Authentication Token Handling](./mitigation_strategies/secure_authentication_token_handling.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Secure Storage:** Use Android's Keystore system (or a similarly secure mechanism) to store authentication tokens. Do *not* store tokens in SharedPreferences, plain text files, or other insecure locations.
    2.  **Token Retrieval:** Retrieve tokens from secure storage only when needed for a request.
    3.  **HTTP Headers:** Use standard HTTP headers (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`) to include the token in requests to the GraphQL server. Use `apollo-android`'s interceptor capabilities (e.g., `addApplicationInterceptor`) to add the authentication header to each request.
    4.  **Token Refresh:** Implement a token refresh mechanism using `apollo-android`'s interceptor capabilities.  The interceptor should:
        *   Check for token expiration before sending a request.
        *   If the token is expired, attempt to refresh it (using a refresh token or other mechanism).
        *   If the refresh is successful, update the stored token and retry the original request.
        *   If the refresh fails, handle the authentication failure appropriately (e.g., redirect to login).
    5. **Logout:** When user logout, securely remove token from storage.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Token Theft:** (Severity: High) - Reduces the risk of attackers stealing authentication tokens.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** (Severity: High) - Prevents unauthorized access if a token is compromised or expired.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Token Theft:** Risk significantly reduced by using secure storage.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced by proper token handling and refresh mechanisms, implemented using `apollo-android`'s features.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Tokens are stored in `SharedPreferences` (INSECURE!).
    *   HTTP headers are used for authentication via `apollo-android`'s interceptors.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Secure storage using Android Keystore is *not* implemented.
    *   Token refresh mechanism is not implemented using `apollo-android`'s interceptor capabilities.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Client-Side Testing for Disabled Introspection](./mitigation_strategies/client-side_testing_for_disabled_introspection.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Test Environment:** Set up a test environment that mimics the production environment, specifically with GraphQL introspection *disabled* on the server.
    2.  **Client-Side Tests:** Write tests using `apollo-android` that attempt to perform introspection queries.
    3.  **Error Handling Verification:** Ensure that the `apollo-android` client gracefully handles the errors that occur when introspection is disabled. Verify that the application functions correctly even without introspection.
    4. **No reliance on introspection:** Ensure that production code does not rely on introspection.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Schema Exposure (Indirectly):** (Severity: Medium) - Ensures the client doesn't break if introspection is disabled, supporting the server-side mitigation.
    *   **Reliance on Introspection:** (Severity: Low) - Prevents the client from relying on a feature that may not be available.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Schema Exposure:** Indirectly supports the server-side mitigation.
    *   **Reliance on Introspection:** Prevents unexpected behavior in production.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   None.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Client-side testing against an environment without introspection is not explicitly done.
    *   Error handling for failed introspection attempts is not specifically implemented or tested within the `apollo-android` client.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Dependencies Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_dependencies_updated.md)

* **Description:**
    1.  **Regular Updates:** Regularly check for updates to the `apollo-android` library itself using Gradle. Update to the latest stable version.
    2.  **Vulnerability Scanning:** Although this is a general practice, it directly impacts `apollo-android`. Use a vulnerability scanner to check for known vulnerabilities in `apollo-android` and its transitive dependencies.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in `apollo-android`:** (Severity: Variable, can be High) - Reduces the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities in the `apollo-android` library.

* **Impact:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced by keeping `apollo-android` up-to-date.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Gradle is used for dependency management.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No regular, scheduled updates of the `apollo-android` library.
    *   No vulnerability scanning specifically targeting `apollo-android` and its dependencies.
