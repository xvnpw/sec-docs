## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: [[Attacker's Goal]]](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node___attacker's_goal__.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker. All attack paths converge here.
*   **Attack Vectors:** All sub-nodes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: [[3. Exploit Server-Side Interactions]]](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node___3__exploit_server-side_interactions__.md)

*   **Description:** This represents the successful exploitation of any vulnerability on the server-side that can be triggered through the GraphQL API via `apollo-android`.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   3.1 Overly Permissive Schema
    *   3.2 Insecure Directives
    *   3.3 Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: [[3.1 Overly Permissive Schema]]](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node___3_1_overly_permissive_schema__.md)

*   **Description:** The GraphQL schema exposes sensitive data or mutations without proper authorization checks, allowing unauthorized access or modification.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker uses `apollo-android` to query fields or execute mutations that should be restricted based on user roles or permissions, but the schema doesn't enforce these restrictions.
    *   Introspection queries are used to discover sensitive fields or mutations that are not properly protected.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: [[3.2 Insecure Directives]]](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node___3_2_insecure_directives__.md)

*   **Description:** Custom directives on the server-side are implemented insecurely, allowing attackers to inject malicious code or manipulate server-side logic.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   A directive that modifies database queries based on user input without proper sanitization, leading to SQL injection.
    *   A directive that executes system commands based on user input without proper validation, leading to remote code execution (RCE).
    *   A directive that performs server-side requests based on user input without proper validation, leading to server-side request forgery (SSRF).

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: [[3.3 Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities]]](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node___3_3_exploit_server-side_vulnerabilities__.md)

*   **Description:** This is a general category representing any vulnerability in the server-side code or its dependencies that can be triggered through a GraphQL request made by `apollo-android`.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploiting a known vulnerability in a library used by the GraphQL server (e.g., a vulnerable version of a JSON parsing library).
    *   Triggering a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability through a crafted GraphQL query.
    *   Causing a denial-of-service (DoS) by sending a computationally expensive query that overwhelms the server.
    *   Exploiting a vulnerability in the database access layer (e.g., SQL injection, NoSQL injection).

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: [2.3 Session Hijacking]](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node__2_3_session_hijacking_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker gains control of a valid user session, allowing them to impersonate the user and perform actions on their behalf.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * Intercepting a session token (e.g., JWT) during transmission due to a lack of HTTPS or a successful MITM attack.
    * Stealing a session token from insecure storage on the device.
    * Exploiting a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability to steal the token from the browser's local storage (if the token is accessible to JavaScript).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: ===> [2. Intercept/Manipulate Network Traffic] -> [2.1 MITM Attacks]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_===__2__interceptmanipulate_network_traffic__-__2_1_mitm_attacks_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between the `apollo-android` client and the GraphQL server, modifying requests or responses.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploiting a lack of certificate pinning to intercept HTTPS traffic.
    *   Using a compromised Wi-Fi network to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
    *   Installing a malicious root certificate on the user's device.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: [1. Client-Side Vulnerabilities] -> [1.3 Input Validation Issues]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__1__client-side_vulnerabilities__-__1_3_input_validation_issues_.md)

* **Description:** Application is vulnerable to attacks based on a lack of proper input validation.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker provides a malicious value for a custom scalar that is not properly validated.
    *   An attacker provides a malicious value for directive that is not properly validated.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: [1. Client-Side Vulnerabilities] -> [1.1 Cache Poisoning]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__1__client-side_vulnerabilities__-__1_1_cache_poisoning_.md)

* **Description:** Application is vulnerable to attacks based on a lack of proper cache validation.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker crafts a malicious GraphQL response that, when cached, will overwrite a legitimate response for a different query.
