# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Apollo Android, provides a GraphQL client library for Android and Kotlin Multiplatform applications. It aims to simplify the process of interacting with GraphQL APIs from mobile applications, improving developer productivity and application performance by enabling efficient data fetching.

Business Priorities:
- Developer Productivity: Streamline the development of Android and Kotlin Multiplatform applications that consume GraphQL APIs.
- Application Performance: Optimize data fetching from GraphQL APIs to improve the responsiveness and efficiency of mobile applications.
- Platform Adoption: Encourage the adoption of GraphQL in mobile development by providing a robust and easy-to-use client library.
- Community Growth: Foster a strong community around Apollo Android to ensure its continued development and support.

Business Risks:
- Data Breaches: Vulnerabilities in the Apollo Android library or its usage could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data exposed through GraphQL APIs.
- Service Disruption: Bugs or performance issues in the library could negatively impact the reliability and availability of applications using Apollo Android.
- Supply Chain Attacks: Compromise of dependencies or the build process of Apollo Android could introduce malicious code into applications using the library.
- Security Misconfiguration: Incorrect usage of the library by developers could lead to security vulnerabilities in applications.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Code Reviews - The project is hosted on GitHub and encourages community contributions, implying code reviews are part of the development process. (Location: GitHub Pull Request process)
- security control: Dependency Management - Gradle is used for dependency management, allowing for control over included libraries. (Location: build.gradle files)
- security control: HTTPS - Communication with GraphQL APIs is expected to be over HTTPS. (Location: Best practice in mobile development and GraphQL usage)
- security control: Input Validation - GraphQL itself has a schema and type system that provides some level of input validation on the server side. (Location: GraphQL specification)

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Third-party Dependencies - Reliance on open-source dependencies introduces potential vulnerabilities from those dependencies.
- accepted risk: Client-Side Security - Mobile applications are inherently less secure than server-side applications due to the client-controlled environment.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Implement SAST tools in the build pipeline to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities in the Apollo Android codebase.
- security control: Dependency Scanning - Integrate dependency scanning tools to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Apollo Android.
- security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA) - Regularly perform SCA to gain visibility into the open source components and their associated risks within the project.
- security control: Secure Build Pipeline - Harden the build pipeline to prevent tampering and ensure the integrity of the released artifacts.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - Requirement: Apollo Android should support various authentication mechanisms commonly used with GraphQL APIs, such as API keys, JWTs, and OAuth 2.0.
    - Requirement: The library should provide clear documentation and examples on how to securely integrate authentication headers or tokens into GraphQL requests.
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: Apollo Android should correctly handle authorization responses from GraphQL APIs and allow developers to implement authorization logic in their applications based on the API responses.
    - Requirement: The library should not introduce any mechanisms that bypass or weaken the authorization enforced by the GraphQL API.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: While server-side input validation is primary, Apollo Android should encourage and facilitate client-side input validation where appropriate to improve user experience and reduce unnecessary API calls.
    - Requirement: The library should handle potential errors and invalid responses from the GraphQL API gracefully and prevent application crashes or unexpected behavior.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Apollo Android should ensure all network communication with GraphQL APIs is encrypted using HTTPS.
    - Requirement: If the library handles any sensitive data locally (e.g., caching), it should provide options for secure storage and encryption of that data. (Although caching sensitive data on the client should be minimized).

The build process for Apollo Android is likely automated using a CI/CD system like GitHub Actions.

1. Developer commits code changes to the GitHub repository.
2. The build system (e.g., GitHub Actions workflows) is triggered by code changes.
3. Dependency Check: The build system performs dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
4. SAST Scanner: Static Application Security Testing tools are used to analyze the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities.
5. Compiler: The code is compiled using the Kotlin compiler.
6. Test Suite: Unit and integration tests are executed to ensure code quality and functionality.
7. Artifact Repository: If all checks pass, the build artifacts (JAR/AAR files) are published to an artifact repository like Maven Central.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Mobile application data fetching: The core business process reliant on Apollo Android is the ability of mobile applications to reliably and efficiently fetch data from GraphQL APIs to provide application functionality and user experience. Disruption or compromise of this process directly impacts application usability and business value.

Data Sensitivity:
- Data sensitivity depends entirely on the specific GraphQL APIs that applications using Apollo Android interact with.
- Potential data types could include:
    - Personally Identifiable Information (PII): User profiles, contact details, location data. Sensitivity: High.
    - Authentication Credentials: API keys, tokens. Sensitivity: Critical.
    - Financial Data: Transaction history, payment information. Sensitivity: High.
    - Business Data: Product information, sales data, operational metrics. Sensitivity: Medium to High depending on the business context.
    - Public Data: Publicly available information. Sensitivity: Low.

The sensitivity of data handled by applications using Apollo Android needs to be assessed in the context of each specific application and its connected GraphQL APIs. Apollo Android itself is a library and does not inherently handle sensitive data unless application developers choose to cache sensitive information using the library's caching mechanisms.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What are the primary use cases and industries targeted by applications using Apollo Android? (e.g., e-commerce, social media, enterprise applications). This would help refine the risk assessment based on industry-specific data sensitivity and regulatory requirements.
- What are the typical authentication and authorization mechanisms used with GraphQL APIs that Apollo Android clients interact with? (API Keys, JWT, OAuth 2.0, etc.). This will inform the security requirements related to authentication and authorization support in the library.
- What are the performance and scalability requirements for applications using Apollo Android? This can influence design decisions, especially around caching and network communication strategies, which can have security implications.
- Are there specific regulatory compliance requirements that applications using Apollo Android need to adhere to (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS)? This will impact the required security controls and features of the library.

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: We assume the primary business goal is to facilitate efficient and secure development of mobile applications using GraphQL.
- SECURITY POSTURE: We assume a standard secure software development lifecycle is desired, including code reviews, testing, and dependency management. We assume that applications using Apollo Android will handle data of varying sensitivity levels, requiring robust security measures.
- DESIGN: We assume Apollo Android is designed as a modular library with clear separation of concerns between different components like network communication, caching, and query processing. We assume the library is intended to be used in typical Android application deployment scenarios communicating over HTTPS with backend GraphQL servers.
