# Attack Surface Analysis for apollographql/apollo-android

## Attack Surface: [GraphQL Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/graphql_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting dynamically constructed GraphQL queries using unsanitized user input to manipulate query logic, access unauthorized data, or cause denial of service.
*   **Apollo Android Contribution:** Apollo Android facilitates query building and execution. If developers use string concatenation with user input to create queries when using Apollo Android, it directly enables this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An e-commerce app uses Apollo Android to fetch products. The query is built in the app as `query { products(name: "${userInput}") { ... } }`. An attacker inputs `a") OR (1=1) --` as `userInput` through the app's UI. Apollo Android sends the crafted query, potentially bypassing intended filtering on the server and exposing more data than intended.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive information, data manipulation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Parameterized Queries with Apollo Android:**  Developers should utilize Apollo Android's API to define query variables and pass user input as parameters. This separates data from the query structure, preventing injection.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Client & Server):** While Apollo Android is client-side, developers must implement input validation on both the client (for better UX and basic checks) and, crucially, on the server-side GraphQL resolvers to prevent injection regardless of how queries are constructed client-side.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Queries](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_complex_queries.md)

*   **Description:**  Overwhelming the GraphQL server or client application with computationally expensive or deeply nested GraphQL queries, leading to performance degradation or service unavailability.
*   **Apollo Android Contribution:** Apollo Android is the library used to send GraphQL queries from the Android application. It directly contributes by being the mechanism through which potentially malicious, complex queries are transmitted to the server.  Furthermore, Apollo Android client needs to process potentially large responses, which can also lead to client-side DoS if responses are excessively large.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses the Android application, leveraging Apollo Android, to repeatedly send extremely complex, nested GraphQL queries to the server. These queries, when processed by the server, consume excessive resources (CPU, memory).  Alternatively, the server might respond with a massive dataset, causing the Apollo Android client to struggle with processing and rendering, leading to a client-side DoS.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, application unavailability, performance degradation, increased infrastructure costs.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Query Complexity Analysis and Limits (Server-Side):** Developers and server administrators must implement query complexity analysis and limits on the GraphQL server. This is crucial to reject overly complex queries before they can harm server resources.
    *   **Rate Limiting (Server-Side):** Implement rate limiting on the GraphQL server to restrict the number of requests from a single client or IP address within a given timeframe, mitigating rapid-fire DoS attempts via Apollo Android clients.
    *   **Client-Side Timeouts in Apollo Android:** Developers should configure Apollo Client within the Android app with appropriate timeouts. This prevents the client from indefinitely waiting for responses, mitigating potential client-side resource exhaustion if the server is slow or unresponsive due to DoS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Cache Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/cache_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious or incorrect data into the Apollo Client cache, leading to the application displaying false information or exhibiting unexpected behavior.
*   **Apollo Android Contribution:** Apollo Android provides a caching mechanism. The security of this cache, and thus the risk of poisoning, is directly related to how developers configure and utilize Apollo Android's caching features. Predictable cache keys or lack of proper cache invalidation strategies in an Apollo Android application increase this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers or reverse engineers the cache key generation logic used by an Apollo Android application. They then manage to inject a crafted, malicious GraphQL response (perhaps through a MitM attack if HTTPS is not enforced, or by exploiting a server-side vulnerability) into the cache using a predictable key. When the application retrieves data using that key via Apollo Android's cache, it now serves the attacker's poisoned data.
*   **Impact:** Display of incorrect or malicious data to users, application malfunction, potential for phishing or social engineering attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Strong and Unpredictable Cache Keys in Apollo Android:** Developers must ensure that Apollo Android's cache keys are robust and not easily predictable. Avoid simple or sequential key generation.
    *   **Implement Robust Cache Invalidation Strategies:**  Developers need to define clear and effective cache invalidation strategies within their Apollo Android application. This ensures that cached data is refreshed appropriately and stale or potentially poisoned data is not served indefinitely.
    *   **Secure Communication (HTTPS):** Enforce HTTPS for all network communication initiated by Apollo Android. This is critical to prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks that could be used to inject malicious responses intended for cache poisoning.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Interception and potential modification of network traffic between the Apollo Android application (using Apollo Android library) and the GraphQL server by an attacker positioned on the network path.
*   **Apollo Android Contribution:** Apollo Android is responsible for network communication to the GraphQL server. If developers fail to properly configure secure network communication when using Apollo Android (e.g., not enforcing HTTPS, neglecting certificate pinning), the application becomes vulnerable to MitM attacks.
*   **Example:** A user connects to a public Wi-Fi network to use an Android application powered by Apollo Android. An attacker on the same network intercepts the communication. If the application doesn't enforce HTTPS or implement certificate pinning when using Apollo Android to communicate, the attacker can read or modify GraphQL queries and responses in transit, potentially stealing sensitive data or manipulating application behavior.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, data manipulation, session hijacking, application malfunction.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce HTTPS for Apollo Android Communication:** Developers must configure Apollo Android to exclusively use HTTPS for all communication with the GraphQL server. This encrypts the network traffic, protecting it from eavesdropping.
    *   **Implement Certificate Pinning in Apollo Android:** Developers should implement certificate pinning within their Apollo Android application. This validates the server's SSL certificate against a known, trusted certificate embedded in the app, preventing MitM attacks even if the attacker has a compromised or rogue Certificate Authority.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities present in the Apollo Android library itself or its transitive dependencies (e.g., OkHttp, Kotlin Coroutines).
*   **Apollo Android Contribution:**  Apollo Android, as a library, introduces dependencies into the Android application. Vulnerabilities in Apollo Android or its dependencies directly impact the security of applications using it.
*   **Example:** A critical security vulnerability is discovered in a specific version of the OkHttp library, which is a transitive dependency of Apollo Android. If an Android application uses a vulnerable version of Apollo Android that relies on the vulnerable OkHttp, the application becomes susceptible to exploitation through this dependency vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**  Various impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, ranging from information disclosure to remote code execution, potentially compromising the Android application and user data.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly Update Apollo Android Library:** Developers must diligently update the Apollo Android library to the latest stable version. Updates often include security patches that address known vulnerabilities in the library itself and its dependencies.
    *   **Automated Dependency Scanning:** Integrate dependency scanning tools into the development pipeline. These tools can automatically identify known vulnerabilities in Apollo Android and its transitive dependencies, alerting developers to update vulnerable components.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories for Apollo Android and Dependencies:** Developers should actively monitor security advisories and release notes from the Apollo Android project and its key dependencies (like OkHttp). This proactive monitoring allows for timely updates and mitigation of newly discovered vulnerabilities.
