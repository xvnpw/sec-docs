# Threat Model Analysis for apollographql/apollo-android

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on GraphQL Requests/Responses](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_graphql_requestsresponses.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the Android application and the GraphQL server. They can eavesdrop on sensitive data being transmitted in both requests and responses. The attacker might also modify requests to manipulate data or responses to inject malicious content or misinformation. This is facilitated by the network communication mechanisms used by Apollo Android.

**Impact:** Loss of confidentiality (sensitive data is exposed), loss of data integrity (data is modified), potential for account compromise or unauthorized actions if authentication tokens are intercepted and reused.

**Affected Apollo Android Component:** Network Layer (specifically the underlying OkHttp client used by Apollo for network requests).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce HTTPS for all communication with the GraphQL server.
*   Implement certificate pinning to trust only specific certificates, preventing interception by attackers using rogue certificates.
*   Regularly update the Apollo Android library and its dependencies to benefit from security patches related to network communication.

## Threat: [Insecure Local Caching of Sensitive Data](./threats/insecure_local_caching_of_sensitive_data.md)

**Description:** The Apollo Android cache stores GraphQL responses locally. If the application caches sensitive data and the device is compromised (e.g., through malware or physical access), an attacker could access this unencrypted data directly from the device's storage. This vulnerability arises from how Apollo Android manages its local cache.

**Impact:** Loss of confidentiality, potential for identity theft or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Affected Apollo Android Component:** Cache Module (specifically the mechanisms used for storing cached responses).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid caching highly sensitive data locally if possible.
*   If caching is necessary, utilize Android's security features like EncryptedSharedPreferences or the Jetpack Security library to encrypt the cache data at rest.
*   Implement appropriate cache expiration policies to minimize the time window for potential attacks.
*   Consider using in-memory caching for highly sensitive, short-lived data.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Apollo Android Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_targeting_apollo_android_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Apollo Android relies on other libraries (dependencies). If any of these dependencies are compromised with malicious code, it could indirectly introduce vulnerabilities into the application. This is a risk inherent in using external libraries like Apollo Android.

**Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities inherited from compromised dependencies, potentially leading to a wide range of security issues.

**Affected Apollo Android Component:** Dependencies (while not directly an Apollo component, the risk arises from its dependencies).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use dependency management tools to track and manage dependencies.
*   Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like dependency-check or similar.
*   Keep dependencies updated to their latest secure versions.
*   Be mindful of the provenance and reputation of dependencies.
