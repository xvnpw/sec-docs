### High and Critical Apollo Android Threats

Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve the Apollo Android library:

*   **Threat:** GraphQL Response Parsing Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker controlling the GraphQL server sends a crafted response with malformed data, unexpected types, or excessively large payloads. Apollo Android's parsing logic fails to handle this correctly.
    *   **Impact:** Application crashes, denial of service (client-side), potential for memory corruption (less likely in Kotlin/JVM but still a concern), or unexpected application state leading to further vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** `apollo-runtime` (specifically the response parsing logic within the network module).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Apollo Android library updated to the latest stable version.
        *   Implement robust error handling around GraphQL response processing.
        *   Consider using schema validation on the client-side (if feasible) to enforce expected data structures.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Network Configuration
    *   **Description:** Developers inadvertently configure the `ApolloClient` to use insecure network protocols (e.g., plain HTTP) or disable security features like certificate validation.
    *   **Impact:** Sensitive data transmitted between the application and the GraphQL server can be intercepted by attackers.
    *   **Affected Component:** `apollo-client` (specifically the network configuration within the client initialization).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce HTTPS for all GraphQL endpoint configurations.
        *   Ensure proper certificate validation is enabled and not bypassed.
        *   Implement checks during development or testing to flag insecure network configurations.

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Apollo Android relies on other third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited through the application.
    *   **Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, ranging from information disclosure to remote code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Various modules depending on the vulnerable dependency (e.g., `okhttp`, `kotlinx.coroutines`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update the Apollo Android library and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
        *   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
