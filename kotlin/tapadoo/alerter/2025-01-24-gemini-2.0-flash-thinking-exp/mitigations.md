## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Encoding for Alert Content in `Alerter`](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_encoding_for_alert_content_in__alerter_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all `Alerter.create()` calls in the codebase where `.setText()` is used to set the alert message.**
    2.  **Trace the source of the data passed to `.setText()`.** Determine if this data originates from user input, external APIs, databases, or internal application logic.
    3.  **For data from external or untrusted sources used in `Alerter.setText()`:**
        *   **Sanitize the data *before* passing it to `.setText()`.**  Use appropriate sanitization techniques in your code (e.g., Java string manipulation, encoding libraries) to remove or encode potentially harmful characters or markup *before* setting the text in `Alerter`.
        *   **Treat user-provided text as plain text when using `.setText()`.** Avoid interpreting any user-provided input as HTML or script within the `Alerter` message unless explicitly intended and carefully handled (which is generally not recommended for simple alerts).
    4.  **Test `Alerter` display with various inputs:** Manually test alerts created with `Alerter.create()` and `.setText()` using different types of input, including special characters and long strings, to ensure proper rendering and prevent unexpected behavior within the `Alerter` display.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Content Injection/Unintended Formatting (Medium Severity):**  If unsanitized data is passed to `Alerter.setText()`, malicious or unintended formatting characters could disrupt the alert display or potentially mislead users. While full XSS is less likely in native Android alerts, unexpected formatting within `Alerter` can still be an issue.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low to Medium Severity):** If unsanitized data passed to `Alerter.setText()` contains sensitive information, it could be accidentally exposed in the alert message.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Content Injection/Unintended Formatting:** **High Impact Reduction.**  Sanitizing input *before* using `.setText()` in `Alerter` effectively eliminates the risk of unintended formatting and most forms of content injection within the alert messages displayed by `Alerter`.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** **Medium Impact Reduction.** Reduces the risk of accidental information disclosure in `Alerter` messages by ensuring data is processed before being displayed by `Alerter`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** Input sanitization is currently implemented for user-provided names before displaying them in success/error `Alerter` messages in the user profile update feature. This sanitization happens in the Java code *before* calling `Alerter.setText()`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Missing for API error messages displayed via `Alerter`:** Error messages from backend API calls are directly passed to `Alerter.setText()` without sanitization in several parts of the application (e.g., login, data fetching).
    *   **Missing for database query results displayed via `Alerter`:** Data retrieved from the local database and displayed in `Alerter` messages (e.g., item names in a list update alert) is not consistently sanitized *before* being used with `.setText()`.
    *   **No centralized sanitization function specifically for `Alerter` content:** Sanitization logic for `Alerter` messages is scattered, leading to inconsistency.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting and Alert Queuing for `Alerter` Display](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_and_alert_queuing_for__alerter__display.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all code locations that trigger `Alerter.show()` or related methods.**
    2.  **Implement a rate limiting mechanism *around* `Alerter.show()` calls:**
        *   **Introduce a timer or counter to track `Alerter` displays.** Monitor the frequency of `Alerter.show()` calls within a specific time window.
        *   **Set a threshold for `Alerter` displays.** Define a maximum number of `Alerter` alerts allowed to be displayed within the time window.
        *   **Throttle subsequent `Alerter` alerts:** If the threshold is exceeded, either:
            *   **Delay subsequent `Alerter` displays:** Queue `Alerter` alerts and display them with a delay after previous `Alerter` alerts have been dismissed.
            *   **Drop excessive `Alerter` alerts:** Discard `Alerter` alerts that exceed the rate limit, potentially logging the dropped `Alerter` alerts.
    3.  **Implement alert queuing for `Alerter` (optional but recommended):**
        *   **Create an alert queue for `Alerter` messages.** Use a data structure to store messages intended for `Alerter` display.
        *   **Process the queue sequentially and call `Alerter.show()` for each message.** Display `Alerter` alerts from the queue one by one, with a short delay between each `Alerter` display.
        *   **Limit queue size for `Alerter` messages.** Set a maximum size for the `Alerter` alert queue.
    4.  **Configure rate limits and queue parameters for `Alerter`:** Adjust parameters like time window, threshold, delay, and queue size specifically for controlling `Alerter` alert display frequency.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via `Alerter` Flooding (High Severity):** An attacker or application bug could trigger a large number of `Alerter.show()` calls, overwhelming the user and potentially freezing the application's UI thread due to excessive `Alerter` displays.
    *   **Poor User Experience due to `Alerter` Clutter (Medium Severity):** Even without malicious intent, excessive `Alerter` alerts can be disruptive and negatively impact user experience.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via `Alerter` Flooding:** **High Impact Reduction.** Rate limiting and queuing `Alerter` displays effectively prevent alert flooding and mitigate the risk of DoS attacks targeting the `Alerter` system.
    *   **Poor User Experience due to `Alerter` Clutter:** **High Impact Reduction.** Reduces `Alerter` alert clutter and improves user experience by controlling the frequency and presentation of `Alerter` alerts.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Not Implemented:**  Currently, there is no rate limiting or alert queuing mechanism in place for `Alerter` displays. `Alerter.show()` calls result in immediate alert display.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Global `Alerter` handling with rate limiting and queuing:** Rate limiting and queuing need to be implemented as a global mechanism for all `Alerter.show()` calls throughout the application. This could be achieved by creating a centralized `Alerter` manager class that handles `Alerter` creation and display with rate limiting and queuing logic.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Information Disclosure Prevention in `Alerter` Messages](./mitigation_strategies/information_disclosure_prevention_in__alerter__messages.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review all alert messages created using `Alerter.create()` and `.setText()` in the application code.** Identify instances where sensitive information might be passed to `.setText()` for display in `Alerter` messages.
    2.  **Apply the principle of least privilege to content displayed in `Alerter` messages:**  Question whether displaying sensitive information in `Alerter` alerts is truly necessary.
    3.  **Abstract sensitive details *before* passing them to `Alerter.setText()`:**
        *   **Replace sensitive data with generic messages in `Alerter` alerts.** Instead of displaying specific error details or sensitive IDs in `Alerter`, use generic messages like "An error occurred" or "Operation failed" when setting text via `.setText()`.
        *   **Use error codes or non-sensitive identifiers in `Alerter` messages.** If specific information is needed for debugging or support, display non-sensitive error codes or identifiers in `Alerter` alerts that can be cross-referenced with logs.
        *   **Log detailed information securely *instead of* displaying in `Alerter` alerts.** Log detailed error messages and sensitive data in secure application logs, but avoid passing them to `.setText()` for display in user-facing `Alerter` alerts.
    4.  **Provide alternative channels for detailed information *instead of* relying on `Alerter` messages:** If users need access to detailed information related to an alert, provide alternative, more secure channels instead of displaying details in `Alerter` alerts.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium to High Severity):**  Accidental display of sensitive information in `Alerter` messages can expose confidential data, potentially leading to privacy breaches or security vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** **High Impact Reduction.**  By abstracting sensitive details and avoiding direct display of confidential data in `Alerter` messages (by controlling what is passed to `.setText()`), this mitigation strategy significantly reduces the risk of information disclosure through `Alerter` alerts.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** For critical errors like authentication failures, generic error messages are used in `Alerter` alerts instead of displaying detailed server error responses in `.setText()`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Detailed error messages in `Alerter` in development builds:** In development builds, detailed error messages are still often passed to `.setText()` for `Alerter` display for debugging convenience, which could inadvertently expose sensitive information if development builds are accidentally distributed.
    *   **Inconsistent abstraction in `Alerter` messages:** Abstraction of sensitive details is not consistently applied across all `Alerter` messages in the application. Some `Alerter` alerts still display more detailed information than necessary via `.setText()`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Responsible Styling and Placement of `Alerter` Alerts](./mitigation_strategies/responsible_styling_and_placement_of__alerter__alerts.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review how `Alerter` alerts are styled and positioned using `Alerter`'s customization options (e.g., `.setBackgroundColorRes()`, `.setIcon()`, `.setDuration()`, `.setOnClickListener()`, `.setAnimation()`).**
    2.  **Ensure clear visual distinction of `Alerter` alerts:**
        *   **Use distinct styling for `Alerter` alerts.** Style `Alerter` alerts to be visually distinct from system prompts, dialogs, or other critical UI elements. Avoid making `Alerter` alerts look like system-level notifications or warnings by choosing appropriate styling options provided by `Alerter`.
        *   **Maintain consistent styling for `Alerter` alerts.** Maintain a consistent `Alerter` styling throughout the application by using the styling options provided by `Alerter` in a uniform manner.
    3.  **Avoid misleading placement of `Alerter` alerts:**
        *   **Do not obscure critical UI elements with `Alerter` alerts.** Ensure `Alerter` alerts are positioned (using `Alerter`'s default placement or any custom positioning if available) in a way that does not obscure or cover important UI elements.
        *   **Avoid deceptive placement of `Alerter` alerts.** Do not place `Alerter` alerts in a way that could trick users into performing unintended actions.
    4.  **User interface testing specifically for `Alerter` alerts:**
        *   **Conduct UI/UX testing focusing on `Alerter` alerts.** Perform UI/UX testing to evaluate the clarity, usability, and potential for confusion related to `Alerter` alert styling and placement.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **UI Redress/Clickjacking (Low Severity):**  Poorly styled or positioned `Alerter` alerts could potentially be misused to create UI redress-like scenarios.
    *   **User Confusion/Misinterpretation (Medium Severity):** Poorly styled or placed `Alerter` alerts can confuse users, leading to misinterpretations of messages or unintended actions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **UI Redress/Clickjacking:** **Low Impact Reduction.**  Responsible styling and placement of `Alerter` alerts reduce the already low risk of UI redress attacks related to `Alerter` alerts.
    *   **User Confusion/Misinterpretation:** **Medium Impact Reduction.**  Improves user experience and reduces the risk of user confusion and misinterpretation of `Alerter` messages by ensuring clear and well-designed `Alerter` alerts through appropriate styling and placement using `Alerter`'s features.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** Basic styling is applied to `Alerter` alerts to match the application's theme using some of `Alerter`'s styling options. `Alerter` alerts are generally displayed at the top of the screen using `Alerter`'s default placement.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Formal UI/UX testing of `Alerter` alerts:** No specific UI/UX testing has been conducted to evaluate `Alerter` alert design and placement.
    *   **Standardized `Alerter` styling guidelines:**  No formal guidelines or standards for `Alerter` alert styling and placement are documented or enforced within the development team, specifically regarding the use of `Alerter`'s styling and placement features.
