# Attack Surface Analysis for tapadoo/alerter

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Alert Content](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_alert_content.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information is unintentionally displayed in alert messages.

**How Alerter Contributes:** `Alerter` displays the exact message content it is given. If the application developers mistakenly include sensitive data in the message passed to `alerter`, the library will faithfully display it, making it visible to the user.

**Example:** During development, an alert might be used to display a user's session ID or an internal error message containing database connection strings. If this code makes it to production, `alerter` will expose this information to the user through the alert dialog.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, internal system information, or potential security vulnerabilities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developer:** Conduct thorough code reviews to ensure no sensitive information is included in alert messages before passing them to `alerter`. Implement logging and debugging practices that avoid displaying sensitive data in the UI.

## Attack Surface: [Reliance on Alerter's Security Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/reliance_on_alerter's_security_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The application becomes vulnerable if security flaws are discovered within the `alerter` library itself.

**How Alerter Contributes:** The application directly depends on the `alerter` library for its alert functionality. Any vulnerabilities within `alerter`'s code, particularly those related to how it processes and displays messages, become potential attack vectors for the application.

**Example:** If a critical vulnerability is found in `alerter` that allows for arbitrary code execution through a specially crafted alert message (while less likely for a simple UI library, it's a possibility), applications using that vulnerable version of `alerter` would be at risk.

**Impact:** Can range from minor UI issues to critical security breaches, including arbitrary code execution or cross-site scripting (or equivalent in the application's context) depending on the nature of the vulnerability in `alerter`.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developer:** Regularly update the `alerter` library to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches. Monitor security advisories related to the `alerter` library and its dependencies. Consider performing static and dynamic analysis on the library if significant concerns arise.
