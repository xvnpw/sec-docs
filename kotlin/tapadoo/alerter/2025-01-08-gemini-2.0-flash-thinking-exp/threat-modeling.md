# Threat Model Analysis for tapadoo/alerter

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Alert Content](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_alert_content.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the alert message if the application doesn't properly sanitize user-provided or untrusted data before passing it to `alerter`. The attacker might craft specific input that, when displayed by `alerter`, executes arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser within the application's context. This directly involves `alerter`'s rendering of the unsanitized content.

**Impact:**  Session hijacking (stealing session cookies), redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the application, keystroke logging, or performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent.

**Affected Component:** `alerter`'s content rendering mechanism (how it displays the provided message).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Strictly HTML encode any user-provided or untrusted data before passing it to `alerter` for display.
* Avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or similar mechanisms within the application's code when handling alert content if possible.
* Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to further restrict the execution of inline scripts and the sources from which scripts can be loaded.

## Threat: [DOM Clobbering through Alert Element IDs](./threats/dom_clobbering_through_alert_element_ids.md)

**Description:** An attacker could define HTML elements in the application's page with the same IDs that `alerter` uses internally for its alert elements (e.g., the container div, close button). This can lead to the attacker's elements overriding `alerter`'s intended elements, disrupting its functionality. This directly involves how `alerter` creates and interacts with the DOM.

**Impact:** Denial of service (alerts not showing), broken functionality, or potentially manipulating the alert's behavior or content indirectly.

**Affected Component:** The way `alerter` creates and injects its alert elements into the DOM.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Inspect the `alerter` library's source code or documentation to understand the IDs it uses for its elements.
* Avoid using those same IDs in the application's HTML structure.
* Consider using a unique prefix for all application-specific IDs to prevent collisions.

## Threat: [Potential Vulnerabilities in Future Alerter Versions](./threats/potential_vulnerabilities_in_future_alerter_versions.md)

**Description:** Like any software, future versions of the `alerter` library might introduce new vulnerabilities. An attacker might discover and exploit these vulnerabilities if the application uses an outdated version of the library. This is a direct risk associated with using the `alerter` library.

**Impact:** The application could become vulnerable to newly discovered exploits within the `alerter` library.

**Affected Component:** The entire `alerter` library.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update the `alerter` library to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
* Subscribe to security advisories or watch the library's repository for announcements of vulnerabilities.
* Implement a process for quickly updating dependencies when security issues are identified.
