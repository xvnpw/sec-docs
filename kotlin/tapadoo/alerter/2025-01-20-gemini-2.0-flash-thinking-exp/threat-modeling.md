# Threat Model Analysis for tapadoo/alerter

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Alert Message Content](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_alert_message_content.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker crafts a malicious payload containing JavaScript code and injects it into data that is subsequently used as the alert message content by the application. The `alerter` library, if not properly handled by the application, renders this malicious script in the user's browser.
    *   **How:** This occurs if the application passes unsanitized user-provided input or data from an untrusted source directly to `alerter` for display.
*   **Impact:**
    *   The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser within the context of the application's domain, leading to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, or data theft.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `Alerter`'s content rendering mechanism.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:** The application *must* sanitize all user-provided data or data from untrusted sources before passing it to `alerter`. Use appropriate HTML escaping or sanitization libraries.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to limit resource loading and mitigate injected scripts.
    *   **Avoid Direct HTML Rendering:** Configure `alerter` to treat input as plain text or strictly control allowed HTML elements.

## Threat: [HTML Injection Leading to UI Redress/Clickjacking](./threats/html_injection_leading_to_ui_redressclickjacking.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker injects malicious HTML tags and attributes into the alert message content, manipulating the alert's appearance.
    *   **How:** This happens when the application doesn't properly sanitize HTML tags before passing data to `alerter`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   The attacker can trick users into unintended actions by overlaying malicious elements on legitimate alert elements, leading to clicks on malicious links or unintended actions.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `Alerter`'s content rendering mechanism.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **HTML Escaping:** Escape HTML special characters before passing data to `alerter`.
    *   **Restrict Allowed HTML:** If `alerter` allows, restrict the allowed HTML tags to safe and necessary ones.
    *   **Careful Content Construction:** Avoid direct string concatenation for alert messages, especially with user input.
