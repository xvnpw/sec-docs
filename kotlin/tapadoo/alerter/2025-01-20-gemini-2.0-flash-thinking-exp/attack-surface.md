# Attack Surface Analysis for tapadoo/alerter

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Alert Content](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_alert_content.md)

* **Description:**  Malicious JavaScript code is injected into the alert's text or title, which is then executed in the user's browser when the alert is displayed.
* **How Alerter Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `Alerter` is directly responsible for rendering the provided text and title content within the alert. If the application doesn't sanitize this input before passing it to `alerter`, the library will faithfully display the malicious script, leading to execution.
* **Example:** An attacker crafts a URL or form input that, when processed by the application, results in the following `alerter` call: `Alerter.show("Vulnerable App", "<script>alert('XSS!')</script>");` When this alert is shown, the JavaScript `alert('XSS!')` will execute due to `alerter` rendering the unsanitized content.
* **Impact:**  Can lead to stealing user credentials, session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious sites, defacing the application, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Input Sanitization:**  Always sanitize and encode user-provided or dynamically generated content *before* passing it to `alerter`'s `show()`, `setTitle()`, and `setText()` methods. Use appropriate HTML escaping techniques.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement and configure a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, reducing the impact of successful XSS attacks even if `alerter` renders malicious content.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Custom View Functionality](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_custom_view_functionality.md)

* **Description:** If `alerter` allows embedding custom views or layouts, vulnerabilities within these custom components can be exploited, and `alerter` acts as the delivery mechanism.
* **How Alerter Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `Alerter` provides the direct mechanism to integrate and display these custom views within the alert. If the custom view itself has vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS), `alerter` is the component that renders the vulnerable view.
* **Example:** An application uses `alerter` to display a custom view that contains an input field. If this input field doesn't sanitize user input, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript that executes when the alert (and the custom view within it) is displayed by `alerter`.
* **Impact:**  Depends on the vulnerability within the custom view. Could range from XSS within the custom view, leading to credential theft or session hijacking, to more severe application-level vulnerabilities if the custom view interacts with backend systems insecurely.
* **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the complexity and functionality of the custom view and the potential vulnerabilities it introduces via `alerter`'s rendering)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure Development Practices for Custom Views:**  Apply secure coding practices when developing custom views intended for use with `alerter`, paying particular attention to input sanitization and output encoding within the custom view itself.
    * **Input Validation within Custom Views:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize any input processed by the custom views *before* it's rendered within the `alerter` context.
    * **Regular Security Audits of Custom Views:**  Conduct security reviews and testing of custom views to identify and address potential vulnerabilities that could be exposed through `alerter`.
