# Attack Surface Analysis for tapadoo/alerter

## Attack Surface: [Content Injection (UI Redressing/Spoofing)](./attack_surfaces/content_injection__ui_redressingspoofing_.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious content into the alert's text or custom view, potentially leading to UI redressing, phishing, or code execution.
**How Alerter Contributes:** `Alerter` is the *direct mechanism* used to display the injected content. The vulnerability exists because `Alerter` displays content provided to it by the application, and the application may not properly sanitize that content.
**Example:**
    *   An attacker injects HTML with a hidden iframe that overlays a legitimate button with a malicious one (if custom views are used).
    *   An attacker injects text that mimics a system login prompt.
    *   If using a `WKWebView` in a custom view, an attacker injects malicious JavaScript.
**Impact:**
    *   User deception (phishing for credentials or sensitive information).
    *   Unauthorized actions performed by the user.
    *   Potential code execution (if JavaScript injection via `WKWebView` is possible).
    *   Loss of user trust.
**Risk Severity:** **Critical** (especially if `WKWebView` is used with unsanitized input) / **High** (for other forms of content injection).
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Strict Input Sanitization:**  *Always* sanitize and escape any user-provided or externally-sourced data before displaying it in an alert. Use a whitelist approach.
        *   **Avoid `WKWebView`:** Strongly prefer native UI elements. If `WKWebView` *must* be used, enforce a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) and *never* display unsanitized content.
        *   **URL Validation:** If displaying URLs, validate them rigorously and use `NSAttributedString` to control link attributes. Display a URL preview.
        *   **Text Formatting Control:** Use attributed strings with controlled formatting.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) - Alert Flooding](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__-_alert_flooding.md)

**Description:** An attacker triggers a large number of alerts to be displayed rapidly, making the application unusable.
**How Alerter Contributes:** `Alerter` is the *direct mechanism* for displaying the alerts. While the root cause is the application's lack of rate limiting, `Alerter` is the component being abused.
**Example:** An attacker repeatedly triggers an error condition that causes an alert to be displayed, flooding the UI.
**Impact:**
    *   Application becomes unresponsive.
    *   User frustration and inability to use the app.
**Risk Severity:** **High**
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Rate Limiting/Throttling:** Implement robust rate limiting or throttling *at the source of the alert trigger* (before calling `Alerter`). Debounce or use a time window.
        *   **Queue Management:** Limit the total number of alerts that can be queued.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities within the `Alerter` library itself could be exploited.
**How Alerter Contributes:** This is a direct vulnerability in the library code.
**Example:** A hypothetical buffer overflow vulnerability in `Alerter`'s image handling code.
**Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (could range from crashes to code execution).
**Risk Severity:**  Potentially **Critical**.
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `Alerter` updated to the latest version.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in `Alerter` and other libraries.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:**  Stay informed about security advisories related to `Alerter`.
