## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization for `Alerter` Content](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_for__alerter__content.md)

1.  **Identify `Alerter` Data Sources:** Pinpoint *every* location in your code where data is passed to `Alerter`'s properties (e.g., `title`, `text`, `customView`). This includes data from user input, network requests, local storage, or any other source.
2.  **Implement Sanitization *Before* `Alerter` Usage:** Immediately *before* setting any `Alerter` property with potentially untrusted data, use a robust HTML sanitization library (like SwiftSoup) to clean the input.  This is the critical step.
    ```swift
    import SwiftSoup

    func sanitizeInput(input: String) -> String {
        do {
            let clean = try SwiftSoup.clean(input, Whitelist.basic) // Or a more restrictive whitelist
            return clean ?? input // Fallback (log!)
        } catch {
            print("Sanitization error: \(error)")
            return input // Fallback (log!)
        }
    }

    // ... When using Alerter ...
    let potentiallyUnsafeText = ... // Get data from somewhere
    alerter.text = sanitizeInput(input: potentiallyUnsafeText) // Sanitize *before* setting
    ```
3.  **Whitelist Approach:** Configure the sanitization library to use a *whitelist* of allowed HTML tags and attributes.  Start with a very restrictive whitelist (e.g., plain text only) and add elements only as strictly necessary.
4.  **Context-Specific Handling:** If you *intend* to allow *some* limited HTML formatting (e.g., bolding), choose a whitelist that permits only those specific safe tags.  If it's plain text, HTML-encode it.
5. **Regular Expression Validation (For Specific Formats):** If the input is expected to be in a specific format (e.g., a date, a phone number, an email address), use regular expressions *in addition to* sanitization to validate the format *before* displaying it.
6. **Encoding:** If you are displaying plain text, and not HTML, ensure the text is properly encoded.
7.  **Custom View Caution:** If using `Alerter`'s `customView`, apply the *same* sanitization principles to any data displayed within that custom view.  This is often overlooked.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via `Alerter`:** (Severity: **High**) - This is the *primary* threat this mitigation addresses. It prevents malicious code injection through `Alerter` content.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Partial):** (Severity: **Medium**) - By controlling what's displayed, you reduce the risk of unintentionally showing sensitive data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduction: **Very High**.  This is the *core* defense against XSS in `Alerter`.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduction: **Moderate**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Be very specific. Example: "Implemented for `title` and `text` properties using SwiftSoup with a `basic` whitelist.  *Not* yet implemented for `customView` content in `ProductDetailsViewController`."
    *   Or: "Not currently implemented."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Precisely list where sanitization is missing. Example: "Missing for `customView` content in all instances.  Missing for `text` property when data comes from the `NotificationService`."

## Mitigation Strategy: [UI Redressing Prevention for `Alerter`](./mitigation_strategies/ui_redressing_prevention_for__alerter_.md)

1.  **Padding Around Interactive Elements:** Ensure that all buttons, text fields, or other interactive elements *within* the `Alerter` view have sufficient padding. This makes precise overlay attacks more difficult.
2.  **Avoid `Alerter` Transparency:** Use a solid background color for the `Alerter`. Avoid transparency unless absolutely necessary, and if used, keep it to a minimum. This prevents underlying content from being visible and confusing the user.
3.  **Test `Alerter` Dismissal:** Thoroughly test all ways the `Alerter` can be dismissed (tapping outside, dismiss buttons, programmatic dismissal). Ensure these methods work reliably and cannot be easily blocked by an attacker.
4.  **Short-Lived `Alerter` Instances:** Design the application flow so that `Alerter` instances are displayed for a short duration.  Either automatically dismiss them after a brief period or require explicit user interaction to dismiss.  Avoid long-lived alerts.
5. **Avoid Complex Layouts:** Keep the layout of the alert simple. Complex layouts with many overlapping elements can increase the risk of UI redressing.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **UI Redressing (Clickjacking) targeting `Alerter`:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Reduces the likelihood of successful clickjacking attacks specifically aimed at the `Alerter` component.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **UI Redressing:** Risk reduction: **Moderate**.  Makes attacks harder, but doesn't eliminate the possibility.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "Padding is implemented for buttons.  Transparency is *not* used.  Dismissal is tested.  Some alerts are automatically dismissed, but others are not."
    *   Or: "Not currently implemented."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "Need to implement automatic dismissal for all informational alerts.  Need to review padding for custom views within alerts."

## Mitigation Strategy: [`Alerter` Rate Limiting and Management](./mitigation_strategies/_alerter__rate_limiting_and_management.md)

1.  **Identify `Alerter` Trigger Points:** List all code locations that *initiate* the display of an `Alerter`.
2.  **Implement Rate Limiting *Before* `Alerter` Display:** For each trigger point, implement rate limiting to control how frequently `Alerter` instances can be shown.  This prevents an attacker from flooding the UI with alerts.
3.  **Queueing/Deduplication (Optional, but Recommended):** If multiple alerts are triggered in quick succession, consider:
    *   **Queueing:** Display them one at a time, in a controlled manner.
    *   **Deduplication:** If the *same* alert is triggered repeatedly, show it only once.
4. **Centralized Alert Service (Highly Recommended):** Create a single service responsible for managing all `Alerter` displays. This makes it much easier to enforce rate limiting, queueing, and deduplication consistently across the application.  All calls to show an `Alerter` should go through this service.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via `Alerter` Flooding:** (Severity: **Low**) - Prevents attackers from overwhelming the application with `Alerter` instances.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduction: **High**.  Directly addresses the threat of `Alerter`-based DoS.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "Rate limiting implemented for alerts triggered by network errors using a centralized `AlertService`.  Queueing and deduplication are *not* implemented."
    *   Or: "Not currently implemented."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "Need to implement rate limiting for alerts triggered by user actions in the `ProfileViewController`.  Implement queueing and deduplication in the `AlertService`."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Sensitive Data in `Alerter` Content](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_sensitive_data_in__alerter__content.md)

1.  **Review All `Alerter` Content:** Carefully examine *every* instance where `Alerter` is used and identify the data being displayed in its `title`, `text`, and `customView`.
2.  **Prohibit Sensitive Data:** Ensure that *no* sensitive information (passwords, API keys, PII, etc.) is ever displayed directly within an `Alerter`.  Use generic error messages or references to more detailed logs if necessary.
3. **Use Placeholders:** If you need to indicate that some data is missing or unavailable, use placeholders or generic messages instead of displaying partial or potentially sensitive information.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via `Alerter`:** (Severity: **High**) - Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data through the `Alerter` component.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduction: **High**.  Directly addresses the threat.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "Reviewed all `Alerter` usage.  Confirmed no sensitive data is displayed."
    *   Or: "Not currently implemented."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "Need to review alerts in the `PaymentViewController` to ensure no partial credit card details are shown."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Proper `Alerter` Callback Handling](./mitigation_strategies/proper__alerter__callback_handling.md)

1.  **Review `Alerter` Callbacks:** Examine all code that handles `Alerter` callbacks (button taps, dismissals, etc.).  These are the actions triggered by user interaction with the `Alerter`.
2.  **Implement Error Handling *Within* Callbacks:** Within each callback function, implement robust error handling using `do-catch` blocks. This prevents unexpected crashes or behavior if an error occurs during the callback's execution.
3.  **Avoid Blocking Operations in Callbacks:** Ensure that `Alerter` callbacks *do not* perform long-running or blocking operations on the main thread. This can freeze the UI. Use background threads or asynchronous operations if necessary.  This is crucial for responsiveness.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Improper `Alerter` Callback Handling:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Prevents unexpected application behavior or crashes due to errors in how `Alerter` callbacks are handled.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Improper Handling:** Risk reduction: **High**.  Ensures correct and predictable behavior.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "Error handling implemented in most callbacks.  Need to review for blocking operations."
    *   Or: "Not currently implemented."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "Need to add error handling to the callback for the 'Retry' button in the `NetworkErrorAlert`.  Need to move a long-running network operation in the `UpdateAlert` callback to a background thread."
