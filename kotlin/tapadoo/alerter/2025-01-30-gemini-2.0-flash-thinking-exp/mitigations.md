## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization for Alert Messages](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_for_alert_messages.md)

### 1. Input Sanitization for Alert Messages

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Sanitization for Alert Messages
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Alert Data Flow:** Trace the flow of data that becomes the content of `alerter` messages. Determine all points where external or untrusted data (user input, API responses, etc.) is incorporated into alert messages.
    2.  **Implement Sanitization Before `alerter`:**  Before passing any untrusted data to the `alerter` library to be displayed, apply appropriate sanitization or encoding.
        *   **For Text Alerts:**  If `alerter` is used for plain text alerts, ensure data is properly encoded to prevent interpretation as markup if that's a risk in your context (though less likely with plain text focused libraries). Focus on escaping special characters if needed for your platform.
        *   **If `alerter` Supports HTML (Check Library Documentation):** If `alerter` *does* allow HTML (which is less common for simple alert libraries, but verify), rigorously HTML-encode all untrusted data before embedding it in the alert message. Use platform-appropriate HTML encoding functions. **Ideally, avoid using HTML features of `alerter` if possible.**
    3.  **Test Sanitization with `alerter`:**  Test alert display with various inputs, including potentially malicious strings and edge cases, to confirm that sanitization is effective *in the context of how `alerter` renders alerts*. Ensure no unexpected behavior or rendering issues arise.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** High Severity - Prevents injection of malicious scripts into alert messages, which could be executed within the alert's context, potentially leading to user account compromise or data theft.
*   **Impact:** Significantly Reduces -  Directly addresses and minimizes the risk of XSS attacks originating from unsanitized content displayed via `alerter`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented - Sanitization is applied in some areas of the application for general data handling, but not specifically and consistently enforced *immediately before* passing data to `alerter` for display in alerts.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Systematic application of sanitization to *all* data sources used to construct `alerter` messages, implemented directly in the code sections that call the `alerter` library to display alerts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Plain Text Alert Messages (Restrict `alerter` to Text Only)](./mitigation_strategies/plain_text_alert_messages__restrict__alerter__to_text_only_.md)

### 2. Plain Text Alert Messages (Restrict `alerter` to Text Only)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Plain Text Alert Messages (Restrict `alerter` to Text Only)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Verify `alerter` Capabilities:** Review the documentation and capabilities of the `tapadoo/alerter` library. Confirm if it supports HTML or rich text formatting in alert messages.
    2.  **Restrict Usage to Plain Text:**  Configure or utilize `alerter` in a way that *only* allows plain text messages. Avoid using any features or options that might enable HTML or script execution within alerts.
    3.  **Code Review for Plain Text Enforcement:**  Establish a coding standard that mandates the use of plain text only for `alerter` messages. Conduct code reviews to ensure developers adhere to this standard and do not inadvertently introduce HTML or script elements.
    4.  **Alternative Formatting (If Needed):** If some formatting is desired in alerts, explore if `alerter` provides safe, non-HTML based styling options (e.g., using library-specific styling parameters). If not, evaluate if the formatting is essential or if plain text alerts are sufficient for security and usability.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** High Severity - By strictly limiting `alerter` to plain text, you eliminate the primary attack vector for XSS through alert messages, as HTML and JavaScript injection becomes impossible.
*   **Impact:** Significantly Reduces -  Completely removes the possibility of HTML/JavaScript injection via `alerter` messages, making XSS through this specific path impossible by design.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No - While the intent is often to use plain text, there isn't a strict policy or code enforcement to *guarantee* only plain text is used with `alerter`. Developers might occasionally use HTML for formatting within alerts.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Establish a clear policy and coding standard for plain text alerts. Refactor existing code to remove any HTML usage within `alerter` messages. Potentially configure `alerter` (if it has such options) to enforce plain text mode.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting for `alerter` Display](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_for__alerter__display.md)

### 3. Rate Limiting for `alerter` Display

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Rate Limiting for `alerter` Display
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Alert Rate Threshold:** Determine an acceptable rate of alert display for your application. This could be based on alerts per minute, per second, or another relevant time window. Consider typical application usage and user experience to set a reasonable limit.
    2.  **Implement `alerter` Alert Counter:** Create a mechanism to track the number of alerts displayed *specifically through the `alerter` library* within the defined time window. This counter should be associated with the `alerter` display logic.
    3.  **Rate Limit Check Before `alerter` Display:**  Before each call to display an alert using `alerter`, implement a check against the rate limit counter.
        *   **If Rate Limit Not Reached:** Proceed to display the alert using `alerter` and increment the counter.
        *   **If Rate Limit Reached:**  Implement a rate limiting action:
            *   **Queue `alerter` Alerts:**  Queue the alert request for later display when the rate limit allows.
            *   **Drop `alerter` Alerts:** Discard the alert request (potentially log the dropped alert for monitoring).
            *   **Throttle `alerter` Display:** Delay the display of subsequent alerts to stay within the defined rate.
    4.  **Configuration for `alerter` Rate Limit:** Make the rate limit parameters (threshold, time window) configurable, ideally through application settings, to allow for adjustments without code changes and to tailor the rate limit to different application environments or user needs.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Alert Flooding:** Medium Severity - Prevents malicious actors or faulty application logic from overwhelming the user interface and potentially application resources by triggering an excessive number of alerts through `alerter`.
*   **Impact:** Moderately Reduces -  Significantly reduces the impact of alert flooding DoS attacks specifically targeting the `alerter` functionality, maintaining application usability and responsiveness.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No - There is no rate limiting currently implemented that specifically controls the rate at which alerts are displayed using the `alerter` library.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implementation of rate limiting logic that is directly integrated with the application's alert display mechanism, specifically targeting calls to the `alerter` library. This would require modifying the code that triggers alerts to include rate limit checks *before* invoking `alerter`.
