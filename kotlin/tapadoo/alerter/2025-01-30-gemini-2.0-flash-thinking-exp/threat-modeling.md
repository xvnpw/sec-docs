# Threat Model Analysis for tapadoo/alerter

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into alert messages by exploiting vulnerabilities in how alert content is generated and displayed. The attacker manipulates input, backend data, or application logic to insert malicious code into alerts. When a user views the alert, the script executes in their browser.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, account takeover, data theft (credentials, personal information), website defacement, redirection to malicious websites, installation of malware. This is considered **Critical** if sensitive user data or critical application functionality is compromised.

**Affected Component:** Alert Message Rendering Module, Input Handling, Backend Data Processing.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all data used in alert messages.
* Use output encoding (HTML entity encoding) when displaying alerts.
* Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).
* Conduct regular security code reviews and penetration testing.

## Threat: [Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/client-side_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods the user's browser with a massive number of alerts, rendering the application unusable. This is achieved by repeatedly triggering client-side alert functions or manipulating server-side events to generate excessive alerts. The attacker exploits application logic flaws or injects malicious code to trigger alert storms.

**Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive, effectively denying user access and functionality. This is considered **High** if it significantly disrupts user workflows or critical application features.

**Affected Component:** Alert Triggering Mechanism (client-side and server-side), Alert Display Logic, User Interface rendering.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting on alert generation (client-side and server-side).
* Implement alert queuing or prioritization.
* Design the alert system to handle large alert volumes gracefully.
* Implement client-side throttling of alert display.
* Monitor alert generation rates for anomalies.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Sensitive Data in Alerts](./threats/information_disclosure_via_sensitive_data_in_alerts.md)

**Description:** Alert messages inadvertently reveal sensitive information to unauthorized users. This occurs when error messages, debugging information, or internal system details are included in alerts displayed to end-users. An attacker analyzes alert messages to gather information about the application's internals, vulnerabilities, or sensitive data.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data (internal configurations, database details, user data), leading to further attacks or privacy breaches. This is considered **High** if it exposes critical security information or sensitive user data.

**Affected Component:** Alert Message Generation Logic, Error Handling Modules, Logging Mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly review and sanitize all alert messages to prevent sensitive data leaks.
* Implement proper error handling to separate user-facing messages from detailed error logs.
* Avoid displaying stack traces, database connection strings, or internal system paths in user alerts.
* Implement role-based alert detail levels.

## Threat: [Clickjacking/UI Redressing on Alert UI](./threats/clickjackingui_redressing_on_alert_ui.md)

**Description:** An attacker overlays malicious UI elements on top of the alert dialog, tricking users into clicking unintended elements. This is possible if the alert UI lacks framing protection or if malicious elements can be positioned on top. Attackers use iframes or CSS manipulation to achieve this.

**Impact:** Users are tricked into performing unintended actions, such as granting permissions, initiating transactions, or revealing sensitive information. This is considered **High** if critical actions or sensitive information are involved.

**Affected Component:** Alert UI Rendering, User Interaction Handling.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement frame busting techniques.
* Utilize browser security features like `X-Frame-Options` or CSP `frame-ancestors`.
* Design alert UI to minimize clickjacking susceptibility (clear boundaries, avoid large clickable areas).
* Educate users about clickjacking risks.

## Threat: [Logic/Business Logic Flaws in Alert Handling leading to missed critical alerts](./threats/logicbusiness_logic_flaws_in_alert_handling_leading_to_missed_critical_alerts.md)

**Description:** Flaws in the logic for alert display can cause users to miss critical security alerts. Incorrect conditions for triggering alerts, improper prioritization, or errors in the alert management system can lead to critical alerts not being displayed or being missed among irrelevant alerts. An attacker might exploit these flaws to suppress critical security alerts.

**Impact:** Users miss critical security alerts, leading to delayed incident response or unnoticed security breaches. This is considered **High** if it directly impacts the detection and response to security threats.

**Affected Component:** Alert Triggering Logic, Alert Prioritization and Filtering Mechanisms, Alert Management System.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly test and review alert generation and display logic, especially for security-related alerts.
* Implement clear rules for triggering different alert types and priorities.
* Ensure correct implementation of alert priorities and alignment with security requirements.
* Implement logging and monitoring of alert system behavior to detect logic flaws.
* Regularly review and update alert logic based on security needs.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Alerter Library](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_alerter_library.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in the third-party alerter library are exploited. Attackers target known library vulnerabilities to compromise the application or user browsers. This is a supply chain security risk.

**Impact:** Application compromise, XSS, DoS, or other security issues depending on the vulnerability. This is considered **High** if the vulnerability is critical and exploitable in the application context.

**Affected Component:** Third-party Alerter Library, modules relying on the library.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update and patch alerter library and all dependencies.
* Monitor security advisories for alerter library vulnerabilities.
* Perform security assessments of third-party libraries before use.
* Use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools for dependency vulnerability management.
* Choose reputable, well-maintained alerter libraries.
