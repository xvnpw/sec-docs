# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Alerter, is an Android library designed to display visually appealing and customizable alerts within Android applications.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Enhance User Experience: Provide Android developers with a tool to create better user interfaces by replacing standard, less visually appealing Android alerts with more engaging and customizable alternatives.
  - Increase Developer Productivity: Offer a ready-to-use library that simplifies the implementation of custom alerts, saving developers time and effort compared to building such components from scratch.
  - Improve App Aesthetics: Enable developers to create alerts that better match their application's design and branding, leading to a more polished and professional look.
  - Community Engagement: Foster an open-source project that benefits the Android developer community and encourages contributions and improvements.

- Business Risks:
  - Adoption Risk: The library might not be widely adopted by Android developers if it doesn't meet their needs, is too complex to use, or has compatibility issues.
  - Maintenance Risk: Lack of ongoing maintenance and updates could lead to the library becoming outdated, incompatible with newer Android versions, or containing unresolved bugs.
  - Security Risk (Indirect): If the library introduces vulnerabilities into applications that use it, it could indirectly harm the reputation of the developers and businesses using the library. While a UI library is less likely to have direct security vulnerabilities, poor coding practices could still introduce issues.
  - Dependency Risk:  Reliance on external dependencies that become outdated or insecure could pose a risk to the library and applications using it.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Code Review - The project is open source on GitHub, allowing for community code review. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
  - security control: Open Source Licensing - Using an open-source license (likely MIT based on common practice for such libraries) allows for transparency and community scrutiny. (Implemented: LICENSE file in repository)

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Limited Formal Security Testing - As a small, open-source UI library, it's unlikely to undergo rigorous formal security testing or penetration testing. The primary reliance for security is on good coding practices and community review.
  - accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities - The library may depend on other Android libraries, and vulnerabilities in those dependencies could indirectly affect applications using Alerter. Dependency updates are assumed to be managed reactively rather than proactively with automated vulnerability scanning.
  - accepted risk: Input Validation - Input validation for alert messages and configurations is assumed to be basic and might not cover all potential injection vulnerabilities.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Dependency Scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address known vulnerabilities in the libraries Alerter depends on. This can be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline.
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the build process to automatically scan the Alerter codebase for potential security vulnerabilities and coding flaws.
  - security control: Input Validation Hardening -  Review and enhance input validation for all user-provided data, such as alert titles, messages, and button text, to prevent injection attacks (though less likely in a UI library, it's still good practice).
  - security control: Secure Build Pipeline - Implement a secure build pipeline to ensure the integrity and provenance of the library artifacts.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable. Alerter is a UI library and does not handle user authentication.
  - Authorization: Not applicable. Alerter is a UI library and does not handle user authorization.
  - Input Validation:
    - All user-provided input strings (e.g., alert title, message, button text) must be properly sanitized and validated to prevent potential injection vulnerabilities (e.g., cross-site scripting if alerts were to display web content, though unlikely in this context, or format string vulnerabilities).
    - Input parameters for customization options (e.g., colors, durations, animations) should be validated to ensure they are within expected ranges and of the correct type to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes.
  - Cryptography: Not applicable. Alerter is a UI library and is not expected to handle sensitive data or cryptographic operations. However, if future features involve handling any data that could be considered sensitive (even indirectly), appropriate encryption measures should be considered.

## DEPLOYMENT

Deployment for the Alerter library itself is not a traditional deployment to servers. Instead, it's a distribution and integration process. The library is built and published to a repository (like Maven Central or JCenter, though JCenter is deprecated, so likely Maven Central now or similar). Android application developers then include this library as a dependency in their Android projects. When they build their Android applications, the Alerter library is packaged within the application and deployed to end-user Android devices when users install the application from app stores (like Google Play Store) or other distribution channels.

Here's a simplified deployment diagram focusing on the library's distribution:

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Indirectly, the critical business process being supported is enhancing the user experience of Android applications that use the Alerter library. A well-functioning and reliable Alerter library contributes to a better user interface and overall app quality. If the library is faulty or insecure, it could negatively impact the user experience and potentially the reputation of applications using it.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Data handled by the Alerter library primarily consists of:
    - Alert messages (titles, text, button labels): Sensitivity depends on the content of the alerts displayed by the integrating application. In most cases, this data is likely to be of low to medium sensitivity. It's user-facing text intended for display. However, if alerts are used to display sensitive information (which is generally not recommended for UI alerts), the sensitivity would increase.
    - Configuration parameters (colors, animations, durations): These are typically non-sensitive configuration settings that control the visual appearance and behavior of alerts. Sensitivity is low.
  - The primary concern is the integrity and availability of the Alerter library itself, ensuring it functions as expected and does not introduce vulnerabilities into applications that use it. Confidentiality of data is less of a direct concern for the library itself, but input validation is important to prevent unintended behavior or potential injection issues if alert messages were to be misused.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the intended scope of the Alerter library? Are there plans to expand its features beyond basic alerts (e.g., more complex UI elements, data handling)?
  - Are there specific performance requirements for the library, especially regarding UI rendering and animations?
  - Are there any specific accessibility requirements that the library needs to meet?
  - What is the process for managing and updating dependencies of the Alerter library?
  - Are there any specific security concerns or requirements from the community of developers using or considering using Alerter?

  - BUSINESS POSTURE Assumptions:
    - The primary goal is to provide a useful and easy-to-use UI library for Android developers to enhance user experience.
    - Widespread adoption by the Android developer community is a key success metric.
    - Security is important, but the library is not intended to handle highly sensitive data directly.
  - SECURITY POSTURE Assumptions:
    - Standard Android development security best practices are generally followed.
    - Security relies primarily on code quality, community review, and basic input validation.
    - Formal security testing and proactive vulnerability management are not currently in place but are recommended for improvement.
  - DESIGN Assumptions:
    - The library is designed to be lightweight and have minimal dependencies.
    - The UI components used are standard Android UI elements.
    - The library is intended to be integrated into a wide range of Android applications with varying security requirements.
    - The build process currently relies on standard Android build tools (like Gradle) and can be enhanced with security checks.
