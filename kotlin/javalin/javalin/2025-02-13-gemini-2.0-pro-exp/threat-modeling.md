# Threat Model Analysis for javalin/javalin

## Threat: [Threat: Handler Chain Bypass](./threats/threat_handler_chain_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious request that exploits a misconfigured handler chain (before, after, main). They might send a request that triggers an early return in a `before` handler, bypassing subsequent authentication or authorization checks. Alternatively, they might exploit an exception in a handler to skip security-critical logic.  This is *specific* to Javalin's handler mechanism.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, data breaches, privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Component:** `beforeHandlers`, `afterHandlers`, `addHandler`, exception handlers (`exception()`).  These are core Javalin components.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the bypassed security controls).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict handler ordering and logic. Ensure that security checks are performed early and cannot be bypassed.
    *   Use a "fail-closed" approach: If a handler encounters an unexpected state or error, it should default to denying access.
    *   Thoroughly test all handler combinations, including edge cases and error scenarios.
    *   Log the execution flow through handlers to aid in debugging and identifying bypass attempts.
    *   Use specific path matching to avoid unintended handler execution.

## Threat: [Threat: Context Object Data Leakage](./threats/threat_context_object_data_leakage.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a crafted request that triggers an error or unexpected behavior. The application, due to improper handling of the Javalin `Context` object, inadvertently includes sensitive internal data (e.g., database connection strings, API keys, internal paths) in the response (e.g., in a custom error message or a response header). This is directly related to how Javalin exposes request/response data.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for further attacks based on the leaked information.
*   **Affected Component:** `Context` object (`ctx`), specifically methods like `ctx.result()`, `ctx.header()`, `ctx.json()`, and exception handling. These are core Javalin components for handling requests and responses.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize all data before adding it to the response using the `Context` object. Never directly expose internal data.
    *   Implement custom error handlers that return generic error messages without revealing sensitive information.
    *   Avoid storing sensitive data directly in the `Context` object. Use secure storage mechanisms.
    *   Log errors separately and securely, without including them in the response.

## Threat: [Threat: Malicious Plugin Exploitation](./threats/threat_malicious_plugin_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a *third-party Javalin plugin*. The plugin might have insecure code that allows for remote code execution, data manipulation, or other malicious actions. This is a risk *because* Javalin allows plugins.
*   **Impact:** Varies widely, but could range from data breaches to complete server compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Third-party Javalin plugins/extensions (`config.plugins.register()`). This is Javalin's plugin mechanism.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the plugin and the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly vet all third-party plugins before use. Examine source code, check for known vulnerabilities, and assess reputation.
    *   Keep plugins updated.
    *   Isolate plugins.
    *   Consider writing custom plugins instead.
    *   Monitor plugin activity.

## Threat: [Threat: WebSocket Authentication Bypass](./threats/threat_websocket_authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker establishes a WebSocket connection without proper authentication. The application, using *Javalin's WebSocket support*, fails to enforce authentication, allowing unauthorized message sending/receiving. This is specific to Javalin's WebSocket implementation.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to WebSocket-based functionality, data breaches, potential for real-time attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** Javalin WebSocket handlers (`ws()`, `wsBefore()`, `wsAfter()`). These are Javalin's WebSocket components.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust authentication for WebSocket connections, ideally reusing the same authentication mechanisms as the rest of the application (e.g., JWTs, session cookies).
    *   Validate authentication tokens or credentials within the `wsBefore` handler.
    *   Reject unauthenticated WebSocket connection attempts.

## Threat: [Threat: WebSocket Message Manipulation](./threats/threat_websocket_message_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts and modifies WebSocket messages. The application, using *Javalin's WebSocket support*, lacks message integrity checks, allowing injection of malicious data or alteration of legitimate messages. This is specific to how Javalin handles WebSocket messages.
*   **Impact:** Data manipulation, command injection, potential for real-time attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** Javalin WebSocket handlers (`ws()`), specifically message handling (`onMessage()`). This is Javalin's WebSocket message handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use secure WebSockets (wss://) to encrypt communication.
    *   Implement message signing or MAC (Message Authentication Code) to ensure message integrity.
    *   Validate and sanitize all incoming WebSocket messages before processing them.

## Threat: [Threat: Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH)](./threats/threat_cross-site_websocket_hijacking__cswsh_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker tricks a user's browser into establishing a WebSocket connection to the vulnerable application (using *Javalin's WebSocket support*) from a malicious website.
* **Impact:** The attacker can send messages to the server as if they were the authenticated user.
* **Affected Component:** Javalin WebSocket handlers (`ws()`).
* **Risk Severity:** High.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Validate the `Origin` header** in the WebSocket handshake within Javalin's `wsBefore` or similar handler.
    * **Use anti-CSRF tokens** for WebSocket connections.
    * **Consider using SameSite cookies**.
