# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a simple, performant, and flexible web framework for Java and Kotlin developers.
*   Minimize boilerplate code and maximize developer productivity.
*   Offer a modern, intuitive API that is easy to learn and use.
*   Maintain a small library footprint and fast startup time.
*   Support both blocking and non-blocking I/O models.
*   Provide good interoperability between Java and Kotlin.
*   Ensure the framework is well-documented and easy to contribute to.
*   Maintain a high level of test coverage.
*   Provide embedded web server.

Business Risks:

*   Security vulnerabilities in the framework could expose applications built with Javalin to attacks.
*   Performance bottlenecks in the framework could impact the scalability and responsiveness of applications.
*   Lack of features or flexibility could limit the adoption of the framework by developers with specific needs.
*   Poor documentation or lack of community support could hinder developer adoption and contribution.
*   Incompatibility with future Java or Kotlin versions could lead to maintenance issues.
*   Competition from other well-established web frameworks could limit Javalin's market share.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Input validation is performed on path parameters, query parameters, and headers. (Mentioned in documentation and evident in source code).
*   security control: The framework provides mechanisms for handling Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection (Mentioned in documentation).
*   security control: Support for secure cookies (Mentioned in documentation).
*   security control: The framework uses SLF4J for logging, allowing flexible configuration of logging levels and destinations. (Evident in source code and documentation).
*   security control: Regular updates and dependency management to address known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. (Evident in project maintenance practices).
*   security control: XSS protection for headers. (Mentioned in documentation).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The framework relies on the underlying Jetty server for many security features, such as TLS/SSL configuration and HTTP/2 support. Any vulnerabilities in Jetty could affect Javalin applications.
*   accepted risk: The framework does not provide built-in authentication or authorization mechanisms. Developers are responsible for implementing these features in their applications.
*   accepted risk: The framework does not enforce any specific security policies or coding standards. Developers are responsible for following secure coding practices.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Integrate with a static analysis tool (e.g., SonarQube, FindBugs, SpotBugs) to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the framework's codebase.
*   security control: Implement a comprehensive security testing strategy, including penetration testing and fuzzing, to identify and address unknown vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Provide detailed security documentation and guidelines for developers building applications with Javalin.
*   security control: Consider implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   security control: Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to enforce secure connections.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: The framework itself does not handle authentication. Applications built with Javalin must implement their own authentication mechanisms.
*   Authorization: The framework itself does not handle authorization. Applications built with Javalin must implement their own authorization mechanisms.
*   Input Validation:
    *   All user-provided input (path parameters, query parameters, headers, request bodies) must be validated to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Validation rules should be based on the expected data type and format.
    *   Invalid input should be rejected with appropriate error messages.
*   Cryptography:
    *   The framework should use secure cryptographic algorithms and protocols for handling sensitive data.
    *   Sensitive data, such as passwords, should be hashed using a strong, one-way hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
    *   Encryption keys should be managed securely.
*   Session Management:
    *   Secure session management is crucial.
    *   Session identifiers should be randomly generated and securely transmitted.
    *   Session timeouts should be configured appropriately.

2.  WAR to Application Server: Package the application as a WAR file and deploy it to a separate application server like Tomcat, WildFly, or a standalone Jetty instance.
3.  Cloud Platforms (PaaS): Deploy to cloud platforms like Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, or Azure App Service. These platforms typically handle scaling, load balancing, and other infrastructure concerns.
4.  Containers (Docker): Containerize the application using Docker and deploy it to a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer: The developer writes code and commits it to the Source Code Management system (Git).
2.  Local Machine: Developer uses IDE and build tools (Maven, Gradle) on their local machine to develop and test locally.
3.  Source Code Management (Git): The code repository stores the project's source code and tracks changes.
4.  CI Server (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.): A continuous integration server monitors the SCM system for changes. When a change is detected, it triggers a build.
5.  Build Script: The CI server executes a build script (e.g., Maven's pom.xml, Gradle's build.gradle).
6.  Compile Code: The build script compiles the source code into bytecode.
7.  Run Tests: The build script runs unit tests and integration tests.
8.  Static Analysis: A static analysis tool (e.g., SonarQube, SpotBugs) analyzes the code for potential bugs, vulnerabilities, and code quality issues.
9.  Dependency Scanning: A dependency scanning tool (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check) checks for known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
10. Package Application: If all steps are successful, the build script packages the application into an executable JAR file (or other deployment artifact).
11. Artifact Repository: The packaged application is published to an artifact repository (e.g., Maven Central, Nexus, Artifactory).

Security Controls:

*   security control: Source Code Management (Git): Access control to the repository, code reviews, branch protection rules.
*   security control: CI Server: Secure configuration of the CI server, access control, limited permissions for build agents.
*   security control: Static Analysis: Identification of potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
*   security control: Dependency Scanning: Identification of known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
*   security control: Build Script: Secure coding practices in the build script itself (e.g., avoiding hardcoded credentials).
*   security control: Artifact Repository: Access control, integrity checks, vulnerability scanning of artifacts.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Serving web requests: The primary function of Javalin is to serve web requests. Any disruption to this process would directly impact users.
*   Data processing: Javalin applications often handle and process data. The security and integrity of this data are critical.
*   Integration with external systems: Javalin applications may interact with databases, APIs, and other services. The security of these integrations is important.

Data Sensitivity:

*   User data: Javalin applications may handle user data, which could include personally identifiable information (PII), authentication credentials, and other sensitive data. The sensitivity of this data depends on the specific application.
*   Application data: Javalin applications may also handle application-specific data, which could have varying levels of sensitivity.
*   Configuration data: Configuration files may contain sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, and other secrets.
