# Attack Surface Analysis for javalin/javalin

## Attack Surface: [Overly Permissive Routing](./attack_surfaces/overly_permissive_routing.md)

*   **Description:**  Incorrectly configured routes, especially those using wildcards or insufficiently validated path parameters, can expose unintended functionality or data.  This is a *direct* consequence of how Javalin handles routing.
    *   **Javalin Contribution:** Javalin's flexible routing system, while powerful, makes it easy to define overly broad routes, increasing the risk of accidental exposure if not carefully managed. The framework *provides* the mechanism for this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A route `/admin/*` without proper authentication in a `before` filter grants access to all admin endpoints (Javalin's routing and filter system are directly involved).  A route `/files/:filename` without filename validation allows path traversal (e.g., `/files/../../etc/passwd`) â€“ again, directly using Javalin's path parameter handling.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, potential for complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if exposing administrative functionality or sensitive data) or **High** (if exposing less critical resources).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use the most specific routes possible. Avoid wildcards (`*`) unless absolutely necessary and carefully controlled *within Javalin's routing configuration*.
        *   Validate *all* path parameters rigorously within Javalin handlers or `before` filters.  Use regular expressions or other validation techniques to ensure they conform to expected formats.  Sanitize input to prevent injection attacks. This validation happens *within the Javalin context*.
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization using Javalin's `before` filters and `accessManager`.  Apply the principle of least privilege. These are *Javalin-provided mechanisms*.
        *   Regularly review and audit all route configurations *within Javalin*.

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated Input from `ctx` Object](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_input_from__ctx__object.md)

*   **Description:**  Treating data obtained from the Javalin `ctx` object (request context) as trusted without proper validation and sanitization. This is a direct result of how Javalin provides access to request data.
    *   **Javalin Contribution:** Javalin *provides* the `ctx` object as the primary interface for accessing request data.  The vulnerability arises from *misusing* this Javalin-provided object.
    *   **Example:** Using `ctx.formParam("username")` directly in a database query without escaping leads to SQL injection (the `ctx` object is the source of the unvalidated input).  Using `ctx.uploadedFile("file").content` without checking the file type or contents allows malicious file uploads (again, directly from Javalin's `ctx`). Using `ctx.header("Referer")` without validation.
    *   **Impact:**  A wide range of vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), file upload vulnerabilities, and more, depending on how the unvalidated input (obtained *from Javalin's `ctx`*) is used.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (for vulnerabilities like SQL injection) or **High** (for vulnerabilities like XSS).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   *Always* validate and sanitize *all* data obtained from the Javalin `ctx` object, including: `formParam`, `queryParam`, `pathParam`, `header`, `cookie`, `body`, `uploadedFile`. This is about *how you handle data from Javalin*.
        *   Use a reputable validation library to enforce data type and format constraints.
        *   Employ appropriate sanitization techniques based on the context (e.g., escaping for SQL queries, HTML encoding for output).
        *   For file uploads handled *through Javalin's `ctx`*, validate file type, size, and content.  Store uploaded files outside the web root and serve them through a controlled mechanism.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure `ctx.json()` Serialization](./attack_surfaces/insecure__ctx_json____serialization.md)

*   **Description:** Exposing sensitive data by directly serializing internal data models to JSON using Javalin's `ctx.json()` method.
    *   **Javalin Contribution:** Javalin *provides* the `ctx.json()` method, which, if misused, directly leads to the vulnerability. This is a Javalin-specific function.
    *   **Example:** Returning a complete user object with `ctx.json(user)` might include the password hash, API keys, or other private information. The vulnerability is a *direct* result of using `ctx.json()` improperly.
    *   **Impact:** Leakage of sensitive data, potentially leading to account compromise or other security breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) or view models that contain *only* the data intended for the client. Never directly serialize internal data models *using Javalin's `ctx.json()`*.
        *   Utilize a JSON serialization library with features for excluding specific fields or transforming data before serialization, *in conjunction with Javalin's `ctx.json()`*.

## Attack Surface: [WebSocket Vulnerabilities (if used, specifically related to Javalin's API)](./attack_surfaces/websocket_vulnerabilities__if_used__specifically_related_to_javalin's_api_.md)

*   **Description:** Security issues related to WebSocket connections, specifically how Javalin handles them: unvalidated messages, lack of authentication/authorization using Javalin's mechanisms, and Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) where Javalin's `Origin` header handling is crucial.
    *   **Javalin Contribution:** Javalin *provides* the WebSocket API (`ws`, `wsBefore`, `wsAfter`, `accessManager`), and the vulnerability arises from not using these features securely.
    *   **Example:** Accepting and processing arbitrary JSON messages from a WebSocket client without validation *within a Javalin `ws` handler*. Allowing unauthenticated WebSocket connections *without using Javalin's `wsBefore` or `accessManager`*. Failing to check the `Origin` header *using Javalin's `wsBefore`*.
    *   **Impact:** Varies, but can be high, including data breaches or even remote code execution if message handling is flawed.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Validate and sanitize *all* data received through WebSocket connections *within Javalin's WebSocket handlers*.
        *   Implement authentication and authorization for WebSocket connections using Javalin's `wsBefore` and `accessManager`, typically with tokens or session cookies. This is *directly using Javalin's features*.
        *   Verify the `Origin` header for WebSocket connections *using Javalin's `wsBefore` filter* to prevent CSWSH. This is a *Javalin-specific mitigation*.
