# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for javalin/javalin

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Javalin Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_javalin_configuration.md)

1.  **Disable `enableDevLogging()` in Production:**  Ensure `app.enableDevLogging()` is *never* called in production. Use conditional logic (e.g., an environment variable) to enable it only during development.  This prevents sensitive information leakage in logs.
2.  **Restrict CORS:** Use `app.enableCorsForOrigin("your-allowed-origin.com")` instead of `app.enableCorsForAllOrigins()`.  Specify *only* the origins that need to access your API.  If multiple origins are required, list them explicitly. This prevents Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and other cross-origin attacks.
3.  **Secure `accessManager()`:** If using `accessManager()`, define clear roles and permissions. Follow the principle of least privilege: grant only the *minimum* necessary permissions to each role. Thoroughly test *all* access control rules to prevent unauthorized access.
4.  **Customize Error Pages:** Create custom error pages using `app.error()`.  Avoid revealing server information or stack traces in error responses. Return generic error messages to the client. This prevents information disclosure.
5.  **Review `requestLogger()`:** If using `requestLogger()`, configure it to log *only* essential information.  *Never* log sensitive data (passwords, API keys, etc.). Use a secure logging framework and configure it properly (log rotation, secure storage).
6.  **`contextPath` and Virtual Host Validation (with Reverse Proxy Awareness):** If using a non-root `contextPath` or virtual hosts, ensure your *reverse proxy* (Nginx, Apache) is correctly configured. Javalin's routing interacts with the reverse proxy; misconfiguration can expose internal endpoints.
7.  **`ipWhitelistHandler()` Augmentation:** If using `ipWhitelistHandler()`, *always* combine it with other authentication/authorization.  IP whitelisting alone is insufficient (IPs can be spoofed).
8.  **WebJars Updates (if `enableWebjars()` is used):** If using `enableWebjars()`, treat WebJars as dependencies. Keep them updated and scan them for vulnerabilities, just like server-side dependencies. This mitigates client-side vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS) within the WebJars.
9. **Jetty Configuration (via `config.jetty`):** If you *are* customizing Jetty's configuration through Javalin's `config.jetty` access, thoroughly review Jetty's security documentation. Pay close attention to settings related to thread pools, connection limits, and request header sizes. Incorrect Jetty settings can lead to DoS vulnerabilities.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Leaking sensitive information via verbose logging, error messages, or server headers.
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (High Severity):** Attacks that trick a user's browser into making unintended requests.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Injection of malicious client-side scripts (via vulnerable WebJars).
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Access to restricted resources due to misconfigured `accessManager()` rules.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):**  Potentially through misconfigured Jetty settings (if customized).
    *   **Routing/Exposure Issues (Medium Severity):** Incorrect `contextPath` or virtual host handling, leading to unintended endpoint exposure.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced significantly (70-80%).
    *   **CSRF:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%) with proper CORS.
    *   **XSS (via WebJars):** Risk reduced moderately (50-60%).
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%) with a well-defined `accessManager()`.
    *   **DoS (Jetty):** Risk reduced if Jetty settings are carefully reviewed and secured.
    *   **Routing Issues:** Risk reduced significantly with correct reverse proxy and Javalin configuration.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical Example)
    *   `enableDevLogging()` is disabled in production via an environment variable.
    *   CORS is restricted to a specific origin.
    *   Basic `accessManager()` implementation with two roles.
    *   Nginx is used as a reverse proxy (but interaction with `contextPath` needs review).

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Hypothetical Example)
    *   Custom error pages are not fully implemented.
    *   `requestLogger()` logs too much information in production.
    *   `accessManager()` rules need more thorough testing.
    *   WebJars are enabled, but updates are not tracked.
    *   Jetty configuration (via `config.jetty`) has not been reviewed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure WebSocket Handler Implementation (if using WebSockets)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_websocket_handler_implementation__if_using_websockets_.md)

1.  **Authenticate Connections:** Implement authentication *before* establishing the WebSocket connection (e.g., using a token passed in the initial handshake, validated in `wsBefore()`).
2.  **Authorize Messages:** Validate and authorize *every* WebSocket message received in `wsMessage()`.  Don't assume messages are trustworthy after the connection is established.
3.  **Rate Limit Messages:** Implement rate limiting within `wsMessage()` to prevent denial-of-service attacks from a single connected client.
4.  **Input Validation (within `wsMessage()`):** Validate the *content* of all WebSocket messages.  Treat them as untrusted input, just like HTTP requests.
5.  **Error Handling (`wsError()`):** Implement robust error handling in `wsError()`.  Ensure that errors don't leak sensitive information or crash the application.
6. **Close Connections Properly (`wsClose()`):** Ensure that resources are released when a WebSocket connection is closed, both normally and abnormally.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):**  Access to WebSocket functionality without authentication.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):**  Overwhelming the server with WebSocket messages.
    *   **Data Exfiltration (High Severity):**  Sending sensitive data over unauthenticated or unauthorized WebSocket connections.
    *   **Command Injection (High Severity):**  If WebSocket messages are used to trigger server-side actions, injection attacks are possible.
    *   **Business Logic Errors (Variable Severity):** Flaws in the WebSocket handler logic.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%) with proper authentication.
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced moderately (60-70%) with rate limiting.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%) with authentication and authorization.
    *   **Command Injection:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%) with input validation.
    *   **Business Logic Errors:** Risk reduction depends on the specific logic and testing.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical - assuming WebSockets *are* used)
    *   Basic message handling in `wsMessage()`.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Hypothetical)
    *   No authentication for WebSocket connections.
    *   No authorization or validation of WebSocket messages.
    *   No rate limiting.
    *   Error handling in `wsError()` is minimal.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Stay Updated with Javalin Releases](./mitigation_strategies/stay_updated_with_javalin_releases.md)

1.  **Monitor Releases:** Regularly check the Javalin GitHub repository ([https://github.com/javalin/javalin](https://github.com/javalin/javalin)) for new releases.

3.  **Subscribe to Notifications:** Subscribe to GitHub notifications for the Javalin repository to receive alerts.
4.  **Test Updates:** Before upgrading Javalin in production, *thoroughly* test the new version in a staging environment. Check for regressions.

    *   **Javalin-Specific Vulnerabilities (Variable Severity):** Exploitation of vulnerabilities *within* the Javalin framework itself.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Javalin-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced significantly (90-100%) by staying updated.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical)
    *   The project uses a relatively recent Javalin version.
