## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Javalin's Request Handling Logic -> Path Traversal (High-Risk)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_javalin's_request_handling_logic_-_path_traversal__high-risk_.md)

*   **Critical Node:** **Path Traversal in `addStaticFiles` or similar functions**
*   **Description:**
    *   Javalin's functions for serving static files (`addStaticFiles`, `addStaticFilesFromResources`, etc.) can be vulnerable to path traversal if misconfigured.
    *   An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing sequences like `../` to escape the intended directory and access files outside the designated static file directory.
    *   This allows the attacker to potentially read arbitrary files on the server, including configuration files, source code, or other sensitive data.
*   **Example:**
    *   If static files are served from `/app/static`, an attacker might try a URL like `/static/../../config/secrets.txt` to access a file outside the `static` directory.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Configuration:** Use the most restrictive `Location` parameter possible (e.g., `Location.CLASSPATH`).
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize any user-provided input that influences file paths. Reject requests containing `../` or similar.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Javalin updated to benefit from any security patches related to path traversal.
    *   **Log Monitoring:** Monitor access logs for suspicious file access attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies Used by Javalin -> Vulnerable Jetty (High-Risk)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_used_by_javalin_-_vulnerable_jetty__high-risk_.md)

*   **Critical Node:** **Vulnerable Jetty (if used)**
*   **Description:**
    *   Javalin uses Jetty as its default embedded web server.
    *   If an outdated or vulnerable version of Jetty is used, the application inherits those vulnerabilities.
    *   Jetty vulnerabilities can range from denial-of-service to remote code execution, potentially giving an attacker complete control over the server.
*   **Example:**
    *   A known vulnerability in a specific Jetty version might allow an attacker to send a specially crafted request that crashes the server or executes arbitrary code.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to High (depends on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Skill Level:** Low to High (depends on the vulnerability)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Update Javalin:** Keep Javalin up-to-date, as new releases often bundle updated versions of Jetty.
    *   **Monitor Jetty Advisories:** Directly monitor Jetty's security advisories for any reported vulnerabilities.
    *   **Standalone Jetty (Optional):** Consider using a standalone, managed Jetty instance for more granular control over updates.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies Used by Javalin -> Vulnerable Other Dependency (High-Risk)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_used_by_javalin_-_vulnerable_other_dependency__high-risk_.md)

*   **Critical Node:** **Vulnerable Other Dependency (e.g., Jackson)**
*   **Description:**
    *   Javalin relies on various third-party libraries (e.g., Jackson for JSON processing).
    *   Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the application.
    *   Deserialization vulnerabilities (especially in libraries like Jackson) are particularly dangerous, as they can lead to remote code execution.
*   **Example:**
    *   If the application deserializes untrusted JSON data using a vulnerable version of Jackson, an attacker could craft a malicious JSON payload that executes arbitrary code when deserialized.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to High (depends on the vulnerability)
*   **Skill Level:** Low to High (depends on the vulnerability)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management tool (Maven, Gradle) to track and manage dependencies.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk.
    *   **Update Dependencies:** Update dependencies to the latest secure versions promptly.
    *   **Secure Deserialization:** Implement safeguards when deserializing untrusted data (e.g., whitelisting allowed classes for Jackson).
