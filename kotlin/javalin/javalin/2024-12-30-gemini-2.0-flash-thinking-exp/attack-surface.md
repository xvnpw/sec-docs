*   **Attack Surface: Path Traversal via Route Parameters**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate route parameters to access files or resources outside the intended directory on the server.
    *   **How Javalin Contributes:** Javalin's `ctx.pathParam()` and `ctx.splatParam()` methods allow developers to extract parts of the URL path. If these extracted values are directly used to construct file paths without proper sanitization, it creates a vulnerability.
    *   **Example:**
        ```java
        app.get("/files/{filepath}", ctx -> {
            File file = new File("uploads/" + ctx.pathParam("filepath")); // Vulnerable
            ctx.result(file.readAllBytes());
        });
        ```
        An attacker could access `/files/../../../../etc/passwd`.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential for code execution if attacker can upload and then access executable files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate the `filepath` parameter to prevent ".." sequences or absolute paths.
        *   **Whitelisting:**  Define a set of allowed file paths or patterns and only allow access to those.
        *   **Canonicalization:** Resolve the canonical path of the requested file and compare it to the intended base directory.
        *   **Avoid Direct File Access:** If possible, use an abstraction layer or a content management system to handle file access instead of directly constructing file paths from user input.

*   **Attack Surface: Deserialization Vulnerabilities via Request Body**
    *   **Description:** If the application deserializes data from the request body (e.g., JSON, XML) without proper safeguards, attackers can craft malicious payloads that, when deserialized, lead to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **How Javalin Contributes:** Javalin provides convenient methods like `ctx.bodyAsClass(MyClass.class)` for deserializing request bodies. If the underlying deserialization library (e.g., Jackson for JSON) has known vulnerabilities or if the application doesn't configure it securely, it's susceptible.
    *   **Example:**
        ```java
        app.post("/process", ctx -> {
            MyObject data = ctx.bodyAsClass(MyObject.class); // Potentially vulnerable if MyObject can be manipulated
            // ... process data ...
            ctx.result("Processed");
        });
        ```
        An attacker could send a malicious JSON payload that exploits a vulnerability in the deserialization process.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing attackers to gain full control of the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Deserialization Libraries Updated:** Regularly update Jackson or other deserialization libraries to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design your data classes (`MyObject` in the example) to minimize the potential for malicious manipulation during deserialization. Avoid complex object graphs or classes with potentially dangerous side effects in their constructors or setters.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate the deserialized object after it's created to ensure it conforms to expected values and constraints.
        *   **Consider Alternative Data Formats:** If possible, use simpler data formats or implement custom parsing logic to avoid the complexities of deserialization libraries.
        *   **Disable Polymorphic Deserialization (if not needed):**  Polymorphic deserialization can be a common source of vulnerabilities. If your application doesn't require it, disable it in the deserialization library's configuration.

*   **Attack Surface: Unsecured WebSocket Endpoints**
    *   **Description:** WebSocket endpoints that lack proper authentication and authorization can be accessed by unauthorized users, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.
    *   **How Javalin Contributes:** Javalin makes it easy to create WebSocket endpoints using `ws()`. If developers don't implement proper security measures within the WebSocket handler, it becomes an attack vector.
    *   **Example:**
        ```java
        app.ws("/chat", ws -> {
            ws.onConnect(ctx -> System.out.println("Client connected"));
            ws.onMessage(ctx, message -> System.out.println("Received: " + message)); // No authentication
        });
        ```
        Any user can connect to `/chat` and send messages.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to real-time data, potential for data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Authentication:** Implement authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of connecting clients (e.g., using JWTs or session cookies).
        *   **Authorization:**  Implement authorization checks to control what actions authenticated users are allowed to perform on the WebSocket.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate all messages received via the WebSocket to prevent injection attacks.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.

*   **Attack Surface: Serving Sensitive Static Files**
    *   **Description:**  Accidentally or intentionally placing sensitive files within the directory served by Javalin's static file handling can expose them to unauthorized access.
    *   **How Javalin Contributes:** Javalin's `staticFiles.add()` method makes it straightforward to serve static content. If the configured directory contains sensitive files, they become accessible.
    *   **Example:**
        ```java
        Javalin.create(config -> {
            config.staticFiles.add("/public"); // If /public contains .env files or database backups
        }).start(7000);
        ```
        An attacker could access `/public/.env` if it exists.
    *   **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or internal application details.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Careful Directory Selection:**  Only serve files from directories that are intended for public access.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Avoid placing sensitive files within the static file directory.
        *   **.htaccess or Similar:**  Use `.htaccess` (for Apache) or similar mechanisms to restrict access to specific files or file types within the static directory.
        *   **Regularly Review Static Content:** Periodically review the contents of the static file directory to ensure no sensitive files are inadvertently included.
