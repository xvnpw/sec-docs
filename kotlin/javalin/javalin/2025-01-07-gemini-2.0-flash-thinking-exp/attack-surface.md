# Attack Surface Analysis for javalin/javalin

## Attack Surface: [Input Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/input_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Lack of proper validation and sanitization of user-provided input (request parameters, headers, body).
    *   **How Javalin Contributes:** Javalin provides direct access to raw request data without enforcing any default validation or sanitization. Developers are responsible for implementing these measures.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a malicious SQL query in a request parameter intended for a database lookup. If not sanitized, this can lead to SQL injection.
    *   **Impact:**  SQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other injection-based attacks leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation using libraries like JSR 303 (Bean Validation) or manual checks.
        *   Sanitize input before using it in database queries or rendering in responses.
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Encode output appropriately based on the context (HTML encoding, URL encoding, etc.) to prevent XSS.

## Attack Surface: [Routing and Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/routing_and_path_traversal.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from how Javalin routes requests and handles file paths.
    *   **How Javalin Contributes:**  Incorrectly configured or overly permissive route patterns can allow unintended access. Using user input directly in file paths without validation can lead to path traversal.
    *   **Example:** A route defined as `/files/{filename}` allows an attacker to access arbitrary files on the server using a payload like `/files/../../../../etc/passwd`.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, directories, or functionalities. Potential for remote code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Define specific and restrictive route patterns. Avoid overly broad wildcards.
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize any user input used to construct file paths.
        *   Use absolute paths or canonicalization techniques to prevent path traversal.
        *   Implement access controls to restrict access to sensitive routes and resources.

## Attack Surface: [File Upload Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/file_upload_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Risks associated with allowing users to upload files to the server.
    *   **How Javalin Contributes:** Javalin provides mechanisms for handling file uploads, but the security of this process depends on the developer's implementation.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious executable file that is then accessible and potentially executed on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, storage of malware, denial of service (filling up disk space), or information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict file type validation based on content rather than just the file extension.
        *   Sanitize uploaded files to remove potentially malicious content.
        *   Store uploaded files outside the webroot or in a separate, isolated storage mechanism.
        *   Generate unique and unpredictable filenames for uploaded files.
        *   Implement file size limits.
