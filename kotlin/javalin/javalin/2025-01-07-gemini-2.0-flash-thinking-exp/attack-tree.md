## Attack Tree Path: [Request Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/request_manipulation.md)

This path encompasses attacks that exploit how the application processes incoming HTTP requests. Attackers aim to manipulate request components to achieve unauthorized actions or access.

* **Attack Vector: Parameter Tampering**
    * This involves modifying parameters within the request (path, query, or body) to influence application behavior.
    * **Path Parameter Injection [CRITICAL]:**
        * **How it works:** Attackers inject malicious or unexpected values into path parameters within the URL. If not properly sanitized, these values can be interpreted as code or commands, leading to execution of unintended code paths or access to restricted resources.
        * **Potential Impact:**  Bypassing authorization checks, accessing administrative functionalities, triggering unintended business logic, potentially leading to remote code execution in vulnerable scenarios.
    * **Query Parameter Injection [CRITICAL]:**
        * **How it works:** Attackers inject malicious or unexpected values into query parameters appended to the URL. These parameters are often used to filter data, control application flow, or pass information. Improper handling can lead to security vulnerabilities.
        * **Potential Impact:** Bypassing authentication or authorization, manipulating search filters to reveal sensitive data, altering application state, potentially leading to SQL injection if parameters are used in database queries without proper sanitization.
    * **Data Injection via Request Body [CRITICAL]:**
        * **How it works:** Attackers craft malicious payloads within the request body (e.g., JSON, form data). If the application doesn't properly validate and sanitize this data, it can be interpreted in unintended ways.
        * **Potential Impact:**  Injecting malicious scripts (if the data is rendered in a web page), manipulating business logic, potentially leading to command injection or other vulnerabilities depending on how the data is processed by the backend.

## Attack Tree Path: [Routing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/routing_vulnerabilities.md)

This path focuses on weaknesses in how the application's routes are defined and secured, allowing attackers to access unintended endpoints.

* **Attack Vector: Missing or Incorrect Route Security [CRITICAL]**
    * **How it works:**  Critical routes that require authentication or authorization are either not protected by middleware or have incorrectly configured middleware. This allows unauthorized users to access these endpoints directly.
    * **Potential Impact:** Gaining access to sensitive data, performing administrative actions without authorization, bypassing intended security controls, potentially leading to full application compromise.
* **Attack Vector: Path Traversal via Static Files [CRITICAL]**
    * **How it works:** If the application serves static files and is not configured securely, attackers can manipulate the requested file path to access files outside the designated static file directory.
    * **Potential Impact:** Accessing sensitive configuration files, application source code, database credentials, or other critical system files, potentially leading to full server compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Middleware Bypass or Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/middleware_bypass_or_exploitation.md)

This path targets vulnerabilities related to the application's middleware, which handles requests before they reach the main handlers.

* **Attack Vector: Incorrect Middleware Ordering [CRITICAL]**
    * **How it works:**  Security middleware (e.g., authentication, authorization) is placed after other middleware that might process the request in a way that bypasses the security checks.
    * **Potential Impact:** Security controls intended to protect the application are rendered ineffective, allowing attackers to bypass authentication, authorization, or other security measures.
* **Attack Vector: Vulnerabilities in Custom Middleware [CRITICAL]**
    * **How it works:**  Custom-developed middleware might contain security flaws due to coding errors or a lack of security awareness during development.
    * **Potential Impact:**  Depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom middleware, attackers could potentially bypass security checks, inject malicious code, cause denial of service, or gain access to sensitive information.
