# Threat Model Analysis for javalin/javalin

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Route Parameters](./threats/path_traversal_via_route_parameters.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates path parameters in a URL, such as using `../` sequences, to navigate outside the intended directory structure and access sensitive files or directories on the server's file system. This can happen if the application directly uses unsanitized path parameters provided by Javalin to construct file paths.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, including configuration files, source code, or user data. This can lead to information disclosure, data breaches, or further compromise of the system.

**Affected Javalin Component:** `ctx.pathParam()` function, Route handling mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all path parameters obtained using `ctx.pathParam()` before using them in file system operations.
*   Avoid directly using raw path parameters to construct file paths.
*   Use whitelisting or predefined allowed values for path parameters.
*   Implement proper access controls on the file system.

## Threat: [Route Overlapping Leading to Bypass](./threats/route_overlapping_leading_to_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits overlapping or ambiguous route definitions in the Javalin application. Due to Javalin's route matching order, a more general or less restrictive route defined earlier might intercept requests intended for a more specific and secure route defined later. This can bypass authentication or authorization checks associated with the intended route.

**Impact:** Bypassing authentication or authorization controls, leading to unauthorized access to protected resources or functionalities.

**Affected Javalin Component:** Route matching logic within Javalin's core.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully design and organize routes to avoid overlaps and ambiguities when defining routes using Javalin's API.
*   Use more specific route patterns where possible.
*   Be mindful of the order in which routes are defined.
*   Consider using route groups for better organization and clarity.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerability via Automatic Binding](./threats/deserialization_vulnerability_via_automatic_binding.md)

**Description:** If Javalin is configured to automatically deserialize request bodies (e.g., JSON or XML) into objects using features like `ctx.bodyAsClass()`, an attacker can craft malicious payloads containing code that gets executed during the deserialization process. This exploits vulnerabilities in the underlying deserialization libraries (like Jackson or Gson) that Javalin integrates with.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the application and potentially the underlying system. Denial of Service (DoS) can also be achieved through resource exhaustion.

**Affected Javalin Component:**  Automatic request body mapping (e.g., `ctx.bodyAsClass()`), potentially the underlying JSON/XML handling libraries integrated with Javalin.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid automatic deserialization of untrusted input when using Javalin's body mapping features.
*   If using automatic deserialization, configure the JSON/XML library to prevent deserialization of potentially harmful classes (e.g., using blocklists or allowlists).
*   Keep the deserialization library updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Implement custom deserialization logic with strict validation and sanitization of the input data.

## Threat: [Static File Serving Misconfiguration Leading to Sensitive File Exposure](./threats/static_file_serving_misconfiguration_leading_to_sensitive_file_exposure.md)

**Description:** If Javalin's static file handling, configured using `Javalin.staticfiles()`, is not configured correctly, it could inadvertently expose sensitive files or directories that should not be publicly accessible. This might include configuration files, source code, database credentials, or temporary files. An attacker can directly request these files via their URL.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive data, credentials, or intellectual property. This can facilitate further attacks or data breaches.

**Affected Javalin Component:** `Javalin.staticfiles()` configuration.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Explicitly define the directories from which static files are served using `Javalin.staticfiles()`.
*   Avoid serving the entire application root as static content.
*   Ensure that sensitive files are not located within the designated static file directories.
*   Implement proper access controls on the file system for the static file directories.
