## Deep Dive Analysis: Request Manipulation Attack Tree Path in Javalin Application

This analysis focuses on the "Request Manipulation" attack tree path for a Javalin application, providing a detailed breakdown of each attack vector, its potential impact, Javalin-specific considerations, and mitigation strategies.

**Overall Threat:** Attackers exploiting the way a Javalin application processes incoming HTTP requests to achieve unauthorized actions or access.

**Attack Tree Path: Request Manipulation**

This path highlights the vulnerabilities arising from insufficient validation and sanitization of data received through HTTP requests. Attackers aim to manipulate various components of the request to bypass security controls and potentially compromise the application.

**1. Attack Vector: Parameter Tampering**

This is a broad category encompassing the modification of request parameters to influence application behavior.

**1.1. Path Parameter Injection [CRITICAL]**

* **How it works:** Attackers manipulate path parameters within the URL. Javalin uses path parameters defined in routes (e.g., `/users/{userId}`). If the application doesn't properly validate and sanitize the `userId` value, attackers can inject malicious data.

    * **Example Attack Scenarios:**
        * **Accessing Restricted Resources:**  Imagine a route `/admin/delete/{itemId}`. An attacker could try `/admin/delete/1;DROP TABLE items;` hoping the application directly uses this unsanitized value in a database query.
        * **Bypassing Authorization:**  A route like `/users/{userId}/profile` might rely on the `userId` to determine access. An attacker could try `/users/admin/profile` hoping to gain access to another user's profile, especially if authorization isn't strictly enforced based on the authenticated user.
        * **Triggering Unintended Functionality:**  A route like `/report/{type}` might accept values like `daily`, `weekly`, etc. An attacker could try injecting values like `../../../../etc/passwd` if the application naively uses the `type` parameter to construct file paths.

* **Potential Impact:**
    * **Bypassing Authorization Checks:** Gaining access to resources or functionalities intended for other users or roles.
    * **Accessing Administrative Functionalities:**  Elevating privileges and performing administrative actions.
    * **Triggering Unintended Business Logic:**  Causing unexpected behavior or data corruption.
    * **Potentially Leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In extreme cases, if the injected path parameter is used in a way that allows command execution (e.g., constructing shell commands), it could lead to RCE.
    * **File Path Traversal:** Accessing files outside the intended directory structure.

* **Javalin-Specific Considerations:**
    * **`ctx.pathParam("parameterName")`:** Javalin provides this method to extract path parameters. Developers need to be mindful of the data type and potential malicious values retrieved.
    * **Route Definition:**  Carefully define routes to avoid ambiguity and potential for manipulation.
    * **No Built-in Sanitization:** Javalin itself doesn't automatically sanitize path parameters. This responsibility lies with the developer.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation rules for path parameters. Define expected data types, formats, and ranges. Use regular expressions or dedicated validation libraries.
    * **Whitelisting:**  If possible, define a whitelist of acceptable values for path parameters.
    * **Encoding:**  Properly encode path parameters before using them in sensitive operations (e.g., database queries, file system access).
    * **Authorization Checks:**  Always verify the authenticated user's permissions before granting access based on path parameters. Don't solely rely on the parameter value for authorization.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only the necessary permissions to users and functionalities.
    * **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Regularly assess the application for path parameter injection vulnerabilities.

**1.2. Query Parameter Injection [CRITICAL]**

* **How it works:** Attackers manipulate query parameters appended to the URL (e.g., `/search?keyword=malicious`). Javalin applications often use query parameters for filtering, searching, pagination, and controlling application flow.

    * **Example Attack Scenarios:**
        * **SQL Injection:** If query parameters are directly used in database queries without sanitization, attackers can inject malicious SQL code (e.g., `/products?category=electronics' OR '1'='1`).
        * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into query parameters that are later displayed on a web page without proper encoding (e.g., `/search?q=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`).
        * **Bypassing Authentication/Authorization:** Modifying parameters that control authentication or authorization logic (e.g., `/login?isAdmin=true`).
        * **Manipulating Search Filters:**  Injecting values to bypass search filters and reveal sensitive data.
        * **Altering Application State:**  Modifying parameters that control application behavior or data processing.

* **Potential Impact:**
    * **Bypassing Authentication or Authorization:** Gaining unauthorized access.
    * **Manipulating Search Filters to Reveal Sensitive Data:** Exposing confidential information.
    * **Altering Application State:** Causing unexpected behavior or data corruption.
    * **Potentially Leading to SQL Injection:** Compromising the database and potentially gaining access to sensitive data or executing arbitrary commands on the database server.
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Injecting malicious scripts that can be executed in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.

* **Javalin-Specific Considerations:**
    * **`ctx.queryParam("parameterName")`:** Javalin provides this method to retrieve query parameters.
    * **No Built-in Sanitization:** Similar to path parameters, Javalin doesn't automatically sanitize query parameters.
    * **Integration with ORM/Database Libraries:** Developers need to be extra cautious when using query parameters in conjunction with ORM libraries like Exposed or when constructing raw SQL queries.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation rules for query parameters, including data type, format, and allowed values.
    * **Sanitization:** Sanitize query parameters to remove or escape potentially harmful characters before using them in any operations.
    * **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:**  When interacting with databases, always use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. This separates the SQL code from the user-provided data.
    * **Output Encoding:** When displaying query parameter values on web pages, use appropriate output encoding (e.g., HTML escaping) to prevent XSS.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers to mitigate XSS attacks by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.
    * **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Specifically target query parameter injection vulnerabilities during security assessments.

**1.3. Data Injection via Request Body [CRITICAL]**

* **How it works:** Attackers craft malicious payloads within the request body, typically in formats like JSON or form data. If the application doesn't properly validate and sanitize this data, it can be interpreted in unintended ways.

    * **Example Attack Scenarios:**
        * **JSON Injection:** Injecting malicious JSON payloads that exploit vulnerabilities in how the application deserializes or processes JSON data. This can lead to various issues, including bypassing validation, manipulating object properties, or even triggering code execution in vulnerable deserialization libraries.
        * **Command Injection:** If data from the request body is used to construct system commands without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious commands (e.g.,  `{"name": "user", "command": "rm -rf /"}`).
        * **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** If the application processes XML data from the request body, attackers can inject malicious XML entities to access local files or internal network resources.
        * **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  Manipulating data in the request body to make the server send requests to unintended internal or external resources.
        * **Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities:** Injecting unexpected fields in the request body that are then inadvertently assigned to internal objects, potentially bypassing security checks or modifying sensitive data.

* **Potential Impact:**
    * **Injecting Malicious Scripts (if the data is rendered in a web page):** Leading to XSS vulnerabilities.
    * **Manipulating Business Logic:**  Altering the application's behavior or data processing flow.
    * **Potentially Leading to Command Injection:**  Executing arbitrary commands on the server.
    * **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:**  Exposing sensitive files or internal network information.
    * **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  Accessing internal resources or performing actions on behalf of the server.
    * **Data Corruption:**  Modifying data in unintended ways.

* **Javalin-Specific Considerations:**
    * **`ctx.body()`:** Provides access to the raw request body.
    * **`ctx.bodyAsClass(Class)`:**  Javalin's convenient way to deserialize JSON or other structured data into Java objects. This is a common point of vulnerability if not handled carefully.
    * **Jackson Integration:** Javalin often uses Jackson for JSON serialization/deserialization. Vulnerabilities in Jackson can be exploited through malicious JSON payloads.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Input Validation:** Implement robust validation for all data received in the request body. Define expected schemas, data types, and constraints.
    * **Schema Validation:** Use schema validation libraries (e.g., JSON Schema Validator) to ensure the request body conforms to the expected structure.
    * **Sanitization:** Sanitize request body data to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.
    * **Object Mapping Configuration:** Configure object mappers (like Jackson) to prevent deserialization of unexpected or malicious properties. Use annotations like `@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)` to ignore unknown fields.
    * **Disable Dangerous Features:** Disable potentially dangerous features in XML and JSON processing libraries (e.g., external entity resolution in XML parsers).
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Helps mitigate XSS if request body data is rendered on the client-side.
    * **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Focus on vulnerabilities related to request body data processing.

**Conclusion:**

The "Request Manipulation" attack tree path highlights the critical importance of secure coding practices when handling incoming HTTP requests in Javalin applications. Developers must be vigilant in validating and sanitizing all data received through path parameters, query parameters, and the request body. Failure to do so can lead to a wide range of security vulnerabilities, potentially compromising the application's integrity, confidentiality, and availability. A layered security approach, combining input validation, sanitization, secure coding practices, and regular security assessments, is crucial to mitigate these risks effectively.
