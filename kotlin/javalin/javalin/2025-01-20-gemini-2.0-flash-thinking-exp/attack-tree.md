## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Routing Logic -> Bypass Authentication/Authorization via Route Manipulation -> Exploit Inconsistent Route Matching [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_routing_logic_-_bypass_authenticationauthorization_via_route_manipulation_-_e_deb04cc1.md)

- Attack Vector: Attackers exploit the order in which Javalin evaluates routes or the behavior of wildcard routes. By crafting specific URLs, they can bypass intended authentication or authorization checks and access protected resources.
- Critical Node: Exploit Inconsistent Route Matching
    - Likelihood: Medium
    - Impact: Significant
    - Effort: Low
    - Skill Level: Beginner
    - Detection Difficulty: Moderate

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Input Handling -> Inject Malicious Data via Request Parameters -> Exploit Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Parameter Injection [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_input_handling_-_inject_malicious_data_via_request_parameters_-_exploit_serve_4f372c9c.md)

- Attack Vector: Attackers inject malicious URLs or hostnames into request parameters that are used by the application to make outbound requests. This allows them to force the server to make requests to internal or external resources, potentially exposing sensitive data or allowing further attacks.
- Critical Node: Exploit Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Parameter Injection
    - Likelihood: Medium
    - Impact: Significant
    - Effort: Medium
    - Skill Level: Intermediate
    - Detection Difficulty: Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Input Handling -> Inject Malicious Data via Request Parameters -> Exploit Command Injection via Parameter Injection [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_input_handling_-_inject_malicious_data_via_request_parameters_-_exploit_comma_8301dfb4.md)

- Attack Vector: Attackers inject malicious commands into request parameters that are used by the application to execute system commands. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Critical Node: Exploit Command Injection via Parameter Injection
    - Likelihood: Low
    - Impact: Critical
    - Effort: Medium
    - Skill Level: Intermediate
    - Detection Difficulty: Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Input Handling -> Exploit Data Binding Vulnerabilities -> Inject Malicious Data during Request Body Deserialization (e.g., JSON, XML) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_input_handling_-_exploit_data_binding_vulnerabilities_-_inject_malicious_data_0b8b36db.md)

- Attack Vector: Attackers craft malicious JSON or XML payloads in the request body that exploit vulnerabilities in the deserialization process. This can lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or other unexpected behavior.
- Critical Node: Inject Malicious Data during Request Body Deserialization (e.g., JSON, XML)
    - Likelihood: Medium
    - Impact: Significant
    - Effort: Medium
    - Skill Level: Intermediate
    - Detection Difficulty: Moderate

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit WebSocket Functionality -> Send Malicious WebSocket Messages -> Exploit Vulnerabilities in WebSocket Message Handling Logic [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_websocket_functionality_-_send_malicious_websocket_messages_-_exploit_vulnera_ca0ea369.md)

- Attack Vector: Attackers send specially crafted WebSocket messages that exploit vulnerabilities in how the application processes these messages. This can lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or even remote code execution.
- Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities in WebSocket Message Handling Logic
    - Likelihood: Medium
    - Impact: Significant
    - Effort: Medium
    - Skill Level: Intermediate
    - Detection Difficulty: Moderate

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit File Upload Handling -> Upload Malicious Files -> Upload Executable Files to Gain Remote Code Execution [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_file_upload_handling_-_upload_malicious_files_-_upload_executable_files_to_ga_e70349e1.md)

- Attack Vector: Attackers upload files containing malicious code (e.g., web shells) to the server. If the server does not properly validate and handle uploaded files, these malicious files can be executed, granting the attacker control over the server.
- Critical Node: Upload Executable Files to Gain Remote Code Execution
    - Likelihood: Medium
    - Impact: Critical
    - Effort: Low
    - Skill Level: Beginner
    - Detection Difficulty: Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Dependencies and Libraries -> Exploit Vulnerabilities in Javalin's Dependencies -> Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries (e.g., Jetty, Jackson) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_dependencies_and_libraries_-_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_javalin's_dependencie_a5c4c0b5.md)

- Attack Vector: Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in the libraries that Javalin depends on (e.g., Jetty for the web server functionality, Jackson for JSON processing). This can lead to a wide range of attacks, including remote code execution, depending on the specific vulnerability.
- Critical Node: Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries (e.g., Jetty, Jackson)
    - Likelihood: Medium
    - Impact: Critical
    - Effort: Variable
    - Skill Level: Variable
    - Detection Difficulty: Variable
