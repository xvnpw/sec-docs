# Threat Model Analysis for javalin/javalin

## Threat: [Route Parameter Injection](./threats/route_parameter_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates path parameters in a URL (e.g., `/users/:id`) to access unintended resources or trigger unexpected behavior. They might inject special characters, directory traversal sequences (`../`), or unexpected data types. This directly exploits how Javalin handles and extracts path parameters.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, potential file system access or modification if parameters are used in file operations, application crashes due to unexpected input.

**Affected Javalin Component:** Javalin's routing mechanism, specifically how it extracts and passes path parameters to handlers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all route parameters within the handler functions.
* Use regular expressions or predefined patterns to validate the format of path parameters.
* Avoid directly using path parameters in file system operations without thorough validation.
* Consider using UUIDs or other non-sequential identifiers where appropriate to make resource guessing harder.

## Threat: [Unintended Route Exposure (Development/Debug Routes)](./threats/unintended_route_exposure__developmentdebug_routes_.md)

**Description:** Development or debugging routes, which might expose sensitive information or allow administrative actions, are accidentally left enabled in production. Attackers can discover and exploit these routes. This is a direct consequence of how routes are defined and managed within Javalin.

**Impact:** Information disclosure (e.g., application logs, configuration details), unauthorized administrative actions, potential for further exploitation.

**Affected Javalin Component:** Javalin's routing mechanism, specifically the configuration and management of routes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement a clear separation between development and production configurations.
* Use environment variables or configuration files to manage route definitions based on the environment.
* Disable or remove all development/debugging routes before deploying to production.
* Implement authentication and authorization even for internal debugging routes.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via File Uploads (Javalin's Handling)](./threats/path_traversal_via_file_uploads__javalin's_handling_.md)

**Description:** When handling file uploads using Javalin's `UploadedFile` functionality, an attacker provides a malicious filename containing path traversal sequences (`../`) to write files to arbitrary locations on the server. This directly involves Javalin's API for handling file uploads.

**Impact:** Overwriting critical system files, uploading malicious executable files, gaining unauthorized access to the server's file system.

**Affected Javalin Component:** Javalin's `UploadedFile` handling within request contexts.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Sanitize and validate filenames received during file uploads.
* Extract the actual filename and avoid using the original path provided by the client.
* Store uploaded files in a designated directory and avoid using user-provided paths directly.
* Implement checks to prevent writing files outside the intended upload directory.

## Threat: [WebSocket Message Injection](./threats/websocket_message_injection.md)

**Description:** If WebSocket connections managed by Javalin are not properly authenticated or if input validation is lacking, attackers can inject malicious messages into the WebSocket stream, potentially affecting other connected clients or the server-side application state. This directly relates to Javalin's WebSocket implementation.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on other WebSocket clients, manipulation of application data, denial of service.

**Affected Javalin Component:** Javalin's WebSocket handling and message processing.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement authentication and authorization for WebSocket connections.
* Validate and sanitize all data received through WebSocket messages.
* Encode data before sending it to clients to prevent script injection.
* Consider using secure WebSocket protocols (WSS).
