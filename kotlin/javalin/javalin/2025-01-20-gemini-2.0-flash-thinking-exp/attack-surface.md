# Attack Surface Analysis for javalin/javalin

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Route Parameters](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_route_parameters.md)

*   **How Javalin Contributes:** Javalin's routing mechanism allows defining routes with parameters. If these parameters are used directly to access files or resources without proper validation, attackers can manipulate them to access unintended locations.
    *   **Example:** A route defined as `/files/{filename}`. An attacker could request `/files/../../../../etc/passwd` to access the system's password file.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files or resources on the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Input Validation: Sanitize and validate route parameters to ensure they conform to expected values and do not contain path traversal sequences (e.g., `..`).
        *   Whitelisting: Instead of blacklisting dangerous characters, whitelist allowed characters or patterns for file names.
        *   Canonicalization: Resolve the canonical path of the requested resource and compare it to the intended base directory.
        *   Avoid Direct File Access: If possible, avoid directly using route parameters to construct file paths. Use an index or database lookup instead.

## Attack Surface: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Route Definitions](./attack_surfaces/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__in_route_definitions.md)

*   **How Javalin Contributes:** Javalin allows using regular expressions in route definitions. Poorly written or overly complex regex can be vulnerable to ReDoS attacks, consuming excessive CPU resources.
    *   **Example:** A route defined with a vulnerable regex like `/data/([a-zA-Z]+)+c`. An attacker could send a long string like `/data/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac` to cause high CPU usage.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, impacting application availability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Careful Regex Design: Use simple and efficient regular expressions for route matching.
        *   Regex Analysis Tools: Utilize tools to analyze regex for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities.
        *   Limit Input Length: Implement input length limits for parts of the URL that match against complex regex.
        *   Consider Alternative Matching: If possible, use simpler string matching or parameter-based routing instead of complex regex.

## Attack Surface: [Improper Handling of Request Body](./attack_surfaces/improper_handling_of_request_body.md)

*   **How Javalin Contributes:** Javalin provides methods to access the request body as different data types (e.g., JSON, form data). If this data is not properly validated and sanitized before use, it can lead to various injection attacks.
    *   **Example:** An application accepting JSON data and directly using a field from the JSON to construct a database query without sanitization, leading to SQL injection.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, code execution, and other severe consequences depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Input Validation: Thoroughly validate all data received in the request body against expected types, formats, and ranges.
        *   Sanitization/Escaping: Sanitize or escape data before using it in sensitive operations like database queries or system commands.
        *   Use Prepared Statements: For database interactions, always use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement CSP to mitigate the impact of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities that might arise from unsanitized output based on request body data.

## Attack Surface: [Multipart Form Data Vulnerabilities (File Uploads)](./attack_surfaces/multipart_form_data_vulnerabilities__file_uploads_.md)

*   **How Javalin Contributes:** Javalin handles multipart form data, including file uploads. Improper handling of uploaded files can lead to various vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** An application allowing users to upload files without proper validation, enabling an attacker to upload a malicious executable that can then be accessed and executed on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, and other severe consequences.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   File Type Validation: Validate the file type based on its content (magic numbers) rather than just the file extension.
        *   File Size Limits: Enforce strict limits on the size of uploaded files to prevent denial of service.
        *   Secure File Storage: Store uploaded files outside the webroot and ensure they are not directly accessible.
        *   Rename Files: Rename uploaded files to prevent naming collisions and potential execution of malicious files.
        *   Virus Scanning: Integrate virus scanning for uploaded files.
        *   Permissions: Set appropriate permissions on the directory where uploaded files are stored.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Reflected Data](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_reflected_data.md)

*   **How Javalin Contributes:** If data from the request (e.g., query parameters) is directly included in the response without proper encoding, it can lead to reflected XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A Javalin route that displays a user's search query directly on the page without encoding. An attacker could craft a malicious link containing JavaScript in the query parameter.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of malicious scripts in the victim's browser, leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Output Encoding: Always encode data before displaying it in HTML. Use context-appropriate encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding for HTML content, JavaScript encoding for JavaScript strings).
        *   Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, reducing the impact of XSS attacks.
        *   Avoid Direct Reflection: Minimize the direct reflection of user-provided data in responses.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Input Validation on WebSocket Messages](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_input_validation_on_websocket_messages.md)

*   **How Javalin Contributes:** Javalin facilitates WebSocket communication. If messages received via WebSockets are not validated, they can be exploited for injection attacks or to trigger unexpected server-side behavior.
    *   **Example:** A WebSocket endpoint that processes commands received from clients. Without validation, an attacker could send a malicious command to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to request body vulnerabilities, this can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, or code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Input Validation: Thoroughly validate all data received via WebSocket messages.
        *   Sanitization/Escaping: Sanitize or escape data before using it in sensitive operations.
        *   Authentication and Authorization: Implement proper authentication and authorization for WebSocket connections to ensure only legitimate users can send messages.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Static File Requests](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_static_file_requests.md)

*   **How Javalin Contributes:** Javalin allows serving static files. If not configured securely, attackers might use path traversal techniques to access files outside the intended static directory.
    *   **Example:** An attacker requests `/static/../../../../etc/passwd` hoping to access the system's password file.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict Static File Directory: Carefully configure the directory from which static files are served and ensure it does not contain sensitive files.
        *   Disable Directory Listing: Disable directory listing for the static file directory.
        *   Canonicalization: Ensure that requested paths are canonicalized and stay within the allowed static file directory.
