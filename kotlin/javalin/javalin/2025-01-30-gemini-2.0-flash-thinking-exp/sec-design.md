# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Javalin aims to provide a simple, lightweight, and modern HTTP server framework for Java and Kotlin developers.
  - It prioritizes ease of use and developer productivity, enabling rapid development of web applications and APIs.
  - It targets developers who need a less opinionated and more flexible alternative to full-fledged Java EE application servers or frameworks like Spring Boot for simpler web applications.
  - The project's goal is to offer a performant and reliable framework that simplifies web development in Java and Kotlin.

- Business Risks:
  - Risk of vulnerabilities in the Javalin framework itself, which could impact applications built on top of it.
  - Risk of insecure coding practices by developers using Javalin, leading to vulnerabilities in their applications.
  - Risk of lack of adoption if the framework does not meet developer needs or if better alternatives emerge.
  - Risk of insufficient community support or maintenance, potentially leading to unaddressed security issues or lack of updates.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Dependency management using Maven/Gradle, allowing for updates to address security vulnerabilities in dependencies. (Implemented in: build.gradle.kts, pom.xml)
  - security control: Open source project with community review, potentially leading to faster identification and resolution of security issues. (Implemented in: GitHub repository - public visibility and contribution model)
  - security control: Standard Java security features and libraries can be utilized within Javalin applications. (Implemented in: Developer responsibility when building applications)
  - security control: HTTPS support for secure communication. (Implemented in: Developer responsibility when configuring server)

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on developers to implement security best practices in their applications built with Javalin.
  - accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to be discovered in Javalin framework itself.
  - accepted risk: Security of applications depends on the security of underlying Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and operating system.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the Javalin project's CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in the framework code.
  - security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices documentation for developers using Javalin to build secure applications.
  - security control: Encourage and facilitate security audits and penetration testing of Javalin framework by security experts.
  - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability reporting and response process for Javalin project.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Javalin should provide mechanisms for developers to easily implement various authentication methods (e.g., basic authentication, OAuth 2.0, JWT).
    - Requirement: Support for secure storage of credentials (e.g., using password hashing).
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Javalin should provide mechanisms for developers to implement fine-grained authorization controls to manage access to different parts of the application.
    - Requirement: Support for role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC).
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Javalin should encourage and facilitate input validation to prevent common vulnerabilities like injection attacks (SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
    - Requirement: Provide built-in mechanisms or recommendations for input sanitization and encoding.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Javalin should support and encourage the use of strong cryptography for protecting sensitive data in transit and at rest.
    - Requirement: Provide guidance on using secure cryptographic libraries and best practices.
    - Requirement: Support for TLS/SSL for secure communication over HTTPS.
