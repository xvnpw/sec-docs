# Threat Model Analysis for javalin/javalin

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Route Parameters](./threats/path_traversal_via_route_parameters.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates route parameters, which are then unsafely used to construct file paths within Javalin handlers. By injecting path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`), the attacker can bypass intended directory restrictions and access sensitive files outside the designated application directories. This is possible if Javalin application code directly uses `ctx.pathParam()` or `ctx.queryParam()` to build file paths without proper validation and sanitization.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server, including application code, configuration files, and user data. In severe cases, it can lead to Remote Code Execution if the attacker can access or modify executable files.
*   **Javalin Component Affected:** Javalin's routing mechanism, specifically parameter extraction functions like `ctx.pathParam()`, `ctx.queryParam()`, and handler code that performs file operations.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid constructing file paths directly from user-supplied route parameters.
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all route parameters used in file operations.
    *   Utilize secure file handling APIs and restrict file system permissions to the minimum necessary.
    *   Consider using a "chroot" jail or similar sandboxing techniques to limit file system access.

## Threat: [Injection through Unsanitized Input in Handlers](./threats/injection_through_unsanitized_input_in_handlers.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code or commands into input fields (path parameters, query parameters, request bodies) that are processed by Javalin handlers without proper sanitization. Javalin's ease of use might lead developers to directly use input values in sensitive operations (like database queries or system commands) without adequate security measures. This can result in SQL Injection, Command Injection, or other injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (via Command Injection), full database compromise (via SQL Injection), data breaches, data manipulation, and potential Denial of Service.
*   **Javalin Component Affected:** Javalin handlers (`Handler`, `Context`), input extraction methods (`ctx.pathParam()`, `ctx.queryParam()`, `ctx.body()`), and any code within handlers that processes user input and interacts with external systems (databases, OS commands, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user inputs within Javalin handlers.
    *   Use parameterized queries or ORM frameworks to prevent SQL Injection when interacting with databases.
    *   Avoid executing system commands based on user input. If absolutely necessary, sanitize and validate input rigorously and use safe command execution methods.
    *   Follow secure coding practices and the principle of least privilege.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass in Custom Middleware](./threats/authentication_bypass_in_custom_middleware.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker circumvents custom authentication middleware implemented using Javalin's `before()` handlers. If the middleware logic is flawed or contains vulnerabilities, attackers can manipulate requests to bypass authentication checks and gain unauthorized access to protected parts of the Javalin application. This could involve exploiting logic errors in the middleware's code, or weaknesses in how it handles authentication tokens or session management.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive application resources and functionalities, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, and account takeover.
*   **Javalin Component Affected:** Custom middleware (`Handler`) registered using `app.before()`, Javalin's request handling pipeline, and potentially session management mechanisms if implemented within Javalin.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly test and rigorously review custom authentication middleware code for logic errors and vulnerabilities.
    *   Prefer using well-established and security-audited authentication libraries or frameworks instead of writing custom authentication logic from scratch.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations to add layers of security.
    *   Adhere to secure authentication best practices, including secure session management, strong password policies, and protection against common authentication attacks.
    *   Conduct regular security code reviews and penetration testing specifically targeting authentication mechanisms.

## Threat: [Insecure CORS Configuration Leading to CSRF/XSS](./threats/insecure_cors_configuration_leading_to_csrfxss.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker exploits a weakly configured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy in a Javalin application. If CORS is misconfigured to be overly permissive (e.g., using wildcard origins or allowing credentials when they shouldn't be), an attacker can host malicious JavaScript on a different domain. This script can then make cross-origin requests to the Javalin application on behalf of a legitimate user, potentially leading to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) like attacks if combined with other vulnerabilities. While Javalin's CORS is a plugin, misusing it is a direct Javalin configuration issue.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks allowing unauthorized actions on behalf of users, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) like attacks if combined with other vulnerabilities, potentially leading to account takeover, data theft, and application defacement.
*   **Javalin Component Affected:** Javalin's CORS plugin (`JavalinConfig.plugins.enableCors()`) and related CORS configuration settings.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure CORS policies restrictively, allowing only explicitly trusted and necessary origins.
    *   Avoid using wildcard (`*`) for allowed origins in production environments.
    *   Carefully review and test CORS configurations to ensure they meet the application's security requirements and follow the principle of least privilege.
    *   When using credentials in CORS, ensure it is absolutely necessary and understand the security implications. Use specific origins instead of wildcards.

## Threat: [WebSocket Message Injection Leading to Command Execution](./threats/websocket_message_injection_leading_to_command_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits insufficient input validation of WebSocket messages within Javalin WebSocket handlers. If a Javalin application processes WebSocket messages and uses their content to perform actions, especially system-level operations, without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands within WebSocket messages. This can lead to Command Injection if the application executes these unsanitized commands on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, allowing the attacker to gain control of the server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and Denial of Service.
*   **Javalin Component Affected:** Javalin's WebSocket handlers (`WsHandler`, `WsContext`), and message processing logic within WebSocket endpoints, specifically when handling message content and interacting with the operating system or other backend systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for all data received through WebSocket messages, especially before using message content in any system-level operations.
    *   Avoid executing system commands or performing sensitive actions directly based on WebSocket message content.
    *   If system commands are necessary based on WebSocket input, use secure command execution methods and sanitize input with extreme caution.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege and minimize the actions performed based on WebSocket messages.
