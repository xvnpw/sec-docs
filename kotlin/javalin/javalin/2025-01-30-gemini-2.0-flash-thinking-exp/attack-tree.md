## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Javalin Application](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_javalin_application.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access, control, or causing significant damage to the Javalin application and its underlying systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_routing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Insecure Default Routes/Handlers [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Exposed Debug/Admin Endpoints (if accidentally left in production) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   Attackers directly access sensitive debug or administrative functionalities that should not be publicly accessible in production environments. This can lead to full application compromise, data breaches, or system takeover.
        *   **Default Error Pages revealing sensitive information [HIGH-RISK PATH]::**
            *   Default error pages often expose stack traces, internal paths, library versions, and other debugging information. Attackers can use this information for reconnaissance, identifying vulnerabilities, and crafting more targeted attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Body Parsing Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]::**
        *   **Exploiting vulnerabilities in underlying JSON/XML parsing libraries (Jackson, etc.) [HIGH-RISK PATH]::**
            *   Javalin relies on libraries like Jackson for parsing JSON and XML data. Known vulnerabilities in these libraries, such as deserialization flaws or buffer overflows, can be exploited to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Denial of Service (DoS).
        *   **Deserialization vulnerabilities (if using Javalin's object mapping features insecurely) [HIGH-RISK PATH]::**
            *   If Javalin's object mapping features are used to deserialize untrusted data without proper validation, attackers can manipulate serialized objects to inject malicious code, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Output Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_output_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Information Leakage in Responses [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]::**
        *   **Verbose Error Messages (revealing stack traces, internal paths, library versions) [HIGH-RISK PATH]::**
            *   Detailed error messages in responses can expose sensitive technical information about the application's internal workings, dependencies, and environment. This aids attackers in reconnaissance and vulnerability identification.
        *   **Insecure Headers (e.g., revealing server technology versions) [HIGH-RISK PATH]::**
            *   HTTP response headers can inadvertently reveal information about the server technology, framework versions, and other internal details. This information can be used by attackers to target known vulnerabilities specific to those technologies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration & Deployment Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_&_deployment_weaknesses.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Insecure Defaults [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]::**
        *   **Verbose logging enabled in production [HIGH-RISK PATH]::**
            *   Leaving verbose logging enabled in production can expose sensitive data in log files, such as user credentials, session tokens, or application secrets. Logs can also be targets for injection attacks.
        *   **Lack of default security headers (e.g., HSTS, X-Frame-Options) [HIGH-RISK PATH]::**
            *   Failing to configure security headers like HSTS, X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy, etc., leaves the application vulnerable to various client-side attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Insecure session management configuration (if using Javalin's session features) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   Misconfigurations in session management, such as using weak session IDs, insecure cookie settings, or lack of session timeouts, can lead to session hijacking, authentication bypass, and account takeover.
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]::**
        *   **Exploiting known vulnerabilities in Javalin's dependencies (Jetty, Jackson, SLF4J, etc.) [HIGH-RISK PATH]::**
            *   Javalin relies on external libraries. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities and are not updated, attackers can exploit them to compromise the application. This can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), or other impacts depending on the specific vulnerability.
        *   **Outdated Javalin version with known vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]::**
            *   Using an outdated version of Javalin itself that has known security vulnerabilities exposes the application to those flaws. Attackers can leverage publicly available exploits to compromise the application.
