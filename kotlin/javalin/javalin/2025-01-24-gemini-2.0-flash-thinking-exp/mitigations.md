# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for javalin/javalin

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Development Features in Production](./mitigation_strategies/disable_development_features_in_production.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Step 1:** Identify development-specific features enabled in your Javalin application configuration (e.g., detailed error pages, debug logging, auto-reloading).
    2.  **Step 2:** Configure Javalin using environment variables or configuration files to explicitly disable these features when the application is deployed to a production environment. Javalin allows different configurations based on environment.
    3.  **Step 3:** Verify in production that development features are disabled by observing error responses and logging behavior of your Javalin application.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure (Medium Severity)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure (Medium Impact)
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Debug logging is generally disabled in production, but detailed error pages might still be enabled in Javalin configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Explicitly configure Javalin to disable detailed error pages in production. Review all Javalin configuration settings related to development features and ensure they are disabled for production deployments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure HTTPS Properly](./mitigation_strategies/configure_https_properly.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Step 1:** Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate.
    2.  **Step 2:** Configure Javalin's `JavalinConfig` during application startup to enable HTTPS. This involves providing the certificate and private key paths to Javalin's `sslConfigurer` within the `Javalin.create` method.
    3.  **Step 3:** Enforce HTTPS redirection. Within your Javalin application, implement middleware or filters to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS endpoints.
    4.  **Step 4:** Implement HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) headers. Configure Javalin to add HSTS headers to responses using `app.before()` handler to ensure browsers always use HTTPS for your domain after the first successful HTTPS connection.
    5.  **Step 5:** Configure Jetty (Javalin's embedded server) through Javalin's configuration to use strong cipher suites and ensure TLS protocols are up-to-date.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity)
    *   Data Eavesdropping (High Severity)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Impact)
    *   Data Eavesdropping (High Impact)
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented. HTTPS is configured using Let's Encrypt and enforced through redirection within Javalin. HSTS is enabled via Javalin middleware.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Regularly review and update TLS configuration and cipher suites within Javalin's Jetty configuration to maintain strong security posture.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Exposed Headers](./mitigation_strategies/limit_exposed_headers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Step 1:** Review the default HTTP headers sent by Javalin and its underlying Jetty server. Identify headers that might expose server version information or other potentially sensitive details (e.g., `Server`, `X-Powered-By`).
    2.  **Step 2:** Configure Jetty through Javalin's `JavalinConfig` to suppress or modify these headers. Javalin allows access to Jetty's `Server` object for customization during startup.
    3.  **Step 3:** Test your Javalin application to verify that unnecessary headers are no longer exposed in responses.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure (Low Severity)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure (Low Impact)
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Default headers are likely being sent by Javalin/Jetty.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Configure Jetty via Javalin's `JavalinConfig` to suppress or modify unnecessary headers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure CORS Carefully](./mitigation_strategies/configure_cors_carefully.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Step 1:** Identify the legitimate origins that need to access resources served by your Javalin application.
    2.  **Step 2:** Configure Javalin's built-in CORS functionality using `JavalinConfig` and the `Javalin.create(config -> config.plugins.enableCors(...))` method. Explicitly define allowed origins, methods, and headers using a whitelist approach within Javalin's CORS configuration.
    3.  **Step 3:** Avoid using wildcard (`*`) for `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` in Javalin's CORS configuration unless absolutely necessary and fully understood. If wildcard is used, ensure `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` is not set to `true` in Javalin.
    4.  **Step 4:** Carefully configure other CORS headers like `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` within Javalin's CORS setup to only allow necessary methods and headers.
    5.  **Step 5:** Test CORS configuration thoroughly using browser developer tools or dedicated CORS testing tools to ensure Javalin's CORS implementation correctly allows legitimate cross-origin requests while blocking unauthorized ones.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium to High Severity)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Impact)
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. CORS is enabled in Javalin, but the allowed origins might be too broad or use wildcards in Javalin's configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Review and refine Javalin's CORS configuration to use a strict whitelist of allowed origins and avoid wildcards if possible.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate All User Inputs within Javalin Handlers](./mitigation_strategies/validate_all_user_inputs_within_javalin_handlers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Step 1:** For every Javalin handler (`ContextHandler`, `Handler`) that receives user input (from `ctx.pathParam()`, `ctx.queryParam()`, `ctx.header()`, `ctx.body()`, etc.), identify all input fields.
    2.  **Step 2:** Define validation rules for each input field based on expected data type, format, length, and allowed values.
    3.  **Step 3:** Implement input validation logic directly within your Javalin handlers using conditional statements, Javalin's built-in input handling and validation features (if available), or external validation libraries integrated into your handlers.
    4.  **Step 4:** If validation fails within a Javalin handler, use `ctx.status()` and `ctx.result()` to return appropriate error responses to the client (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request) with informative error messages.
    5.  **Step 5:** Sanitize inputs within Javalin handlers if necessary. For example, if expecting HTML input, sanitize it using a library before processing or storing it within the handler logic.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Injection Attacks (SQL Injection, Command Injection, etc.) (High Severity)
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium to High Severity)
    *   Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Injection Attacks (High Impact)
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Impact)
    *   Data Integrity Issues (Medium Impact)
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic input validation is present in some Javalin handlers, but not consistently applied across all input points.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement comprehensive input validation for all Javalin handlers and input fields. Standardize validation logic and error handling within handlers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Encode Outputs Properly within Javalin Handlers](./mitigation_strategies/encode_outputs_properly_within_javalin_handlers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Step 1:** Identify all points in your Javalin application's handlers where user-provided data or data from untrusted sources is included in responses, especially when rendering HTML, JSON, or other output formats using `ctx.result()`, `ctx.html()`, or templating engines integrated with Javalin.
    2.  **Step 2:** Choose appropriate output encoding methods based on the output format (e.g., HTML entity encoding for HTML, JSON string escaping for JSON).
    3.  **Step 3:** Use Javalin's templating engines (like Velocity, Freemarker, Thymeleaf) or encoding functions provided by libraries used within Javalin handlers to automatically encode data before rendering it in responses. If manually constructing responses using `ctx.result()` or `ctx.json()`, ensure proper encoding is applied using appropriate encoding functions.
    4.  **Step 4:** Regularly review Javalin handler code to ensure output encoding is consistently applied in all relevant locations.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium to High Severity)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Impact)
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Output encoding is used in some parts of the application, especially when using Javalin's templating engine integrations.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Ensure output encoding is consistently applied across all response generation points within Javalin handlers, including manual JSON responses and error messages set using `ctx.result()` or `ctx.json()`. Conduct code review of Javalin handlers to identify and fix any missing encoding instances.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Handle Path Parameters Securely in Javalin Routes and Handlers](./mitigation_strategies/handle_path_parameters_securely_in_javalin_routes_and_handlers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Step 1:** When defining Javalin routes with path parameters (e.g., `/users/{userId}`), identify how these parameters are used in associated Javalin handlers (e.g., accessing database records based on `userId`).
    2.  **Step 2:** Validate path parameters within Javalin handlers using `ctx.pathParam()` to ensure they conform to expected formats (e.g., integer, UUID) and do not contain malicious characters (e.g., path traversal sequences like `../`).
    3.  **Step 3:** Sanitize path parameters within Javalin handlers if necessary. Remove or replace potentially harmful characters before using them in further processing.
    4.  **Step 4:** Avoid directly using user-provided path parameters obtained via `ctx.pathParam()` to access files or resources on the server file system within Javalin handlers without proper validation and sanitization. Use parameterized queries or ORM features within handlers to access database records based on validated path parameters.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Path Traversal (Medium Severity)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Path Traversal (Medium Impact)
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic validation might be present for some path parameters within Javalin handlers, but not consistently applied.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement robust validation and sanitization for all path parameters used in Javalin routes and accessed within handlers. Review Javalin handler code to ensure path parameters are not directly used for file system access without proper security measures.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Secure Session Configuration in Javalin](./mitigation_strategies/use_secure_session_configuration_in_javalin.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Step 1:** Configure Javalin's session management during application startup within `JavalinConfig` to set the `httpOnly` flag for session cookies. This is typically done when configuring session handling in Javalin.
    2.  **Step 2:** Configure Javalin's session management to set the `secure` flag for session cookies. Ensure this setting is enabled in Javalin's session configuration to restrict cookie transmission to HTTPS.
    3.  **Step 3:** Configure an appropriate session timeout value within Javalin's session configuration to limit the duration of session validity. Javalin allows setting session timeouts.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) based Session Hijacking (Medium Severity)
    *   Session Hijacking over Unsecured Connections (High Severity)
    *   Session Fixation (Medium Severity)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) based Session Hijacking (Medium Impact)
    *   Session Hijacking over Unsecured Connections (High Impact)
    *   Session Fixation (Low Impact)
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `httpOnly` and `secure` flags are likely set by default in Javalin's session management, but explicit configuration verification within `JavalinConfig` is needed. Session timeout might be set to a long default value in Javalin.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Explicitly configure `httpOnly` and `secure` flags for session cookies in Javalin's `JavalinConfig`. Review and adjust session timeout to a more secure value within Javalin's session settings.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Consider External Session Stores with Javalin](./mitigation_strategies/consider_external_session_stores_with_javalin.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Step 1:** Evaluate the application's session management needs, especially in terms of scalability, reliability, and security when using Javalin.
    2.  **Step 2:** If in-memory sessions (Javalin's default) are insufficient or pose concerns, consider using an external session store like Redis, Memcached, or a database.
    3.  **Step 3:** Configure Javalin to use the chosen external session store. Javalin supports various session store implementations that can be configured within `JavalinConfig`.
    4.  **Step 4:** Secure the external session store itself, independently of Javalin.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Session Loss in Clustered Environments (Low to Medium Severity)
    *   Session Data Persistence Issues (Low to Medium Severity)
    *   Security Risks of In-Memory Storage (Low Severity)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Session Loss in Clustered Environments (Medium Impact)
    *   Session Data Persistence Issues (Medium Impact)
    *   Security Risks of In-Memory Storage (Low Impact)
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Javalin is likely using in-memory sessions by default.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Evaluate the need for external session stores based on application requirements when using Javalin and consider implementing Redis or a database-backed session store for improved scalability and potentially security, configuring this within Javalin's `JavalinConfig`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Custom Error Handlers in Javalin](./mitigation_strategies/implement_custom_error_handlers_in_javalin.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Step 1:** Define custom error handlers in Javalin using `app.error(statusCode, ctx -> { ... })` for different HTTP error codes (e.g., 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).
    2.  **Step 2:** Within custom Javalin error handlers, provide user-friendly error messages using `ctx.result()` that do not reveal sensitive information or internal application details.
    3.  **Step 3:** Log detailed error information (including stack traces) to secure server-side logs from within Javalin error handlers for debugging and monitoring purposes, but ensure this detailed information is not included in the `ctx.result()` responses sent to the client in production.
    4.  **Step 4:** Test error handling to ensure custom error pages are displayed by Javalin and sensitive information is not leaked in error responses.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure through Error Messages (Medium Severity)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure through Error Messages (Medium Impact)
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic custom error pages might be in place in Javalin, but they might still reveal too much information.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Refine custom error handlers in Javalin to ensure they provide minimal information to the client in production and log detailed error information securely server-side from within the handlers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting and Denial-of-Service (DoS) Prevention using Javalin Middleware](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_and_denial-of-service__dos__prevention_using_javalin_middleware.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Step 1:** Identify critical endpoints or functionalities in your Javalin application that are susceptible to brute-force attacks or DoS attacks (e.g., login endpoints, API endpoints).
    2.  **Step 2:** Implement rate limiting middleware in Javalin using `app.before()` to intercept requests before they reach handlers. This middleware should limit the number of requests from a single IP address or user within a specific time window. You can use libraries or custom implementations within Javalin middleware.
    3.  **Step 3:** Configure rate limiting thresholds in your Javalin middleware based on expected traffic patterns and application capacity.
    4.  **Step 4:** Implement appropriate responses within the Javalin rate limiting middleware when rate limits are exceeded (e.g., `ctx.status(429).result("Too Many Requests")`).
    5.  **Step 5:** Consider using more advanced DoS protection mechanisms in conjunction with Javalin's rate limiting, such as web application firewalls (WAFs) or cloud-based DoS mitigation services.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Brute-Force Attacks (Medium to High Severity)
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (High Severity)

    *   Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Impact)
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (Medium Impact)
    *   Resource Exhaustion (Medium Impact)
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. No rate limiting middleware is currently in place in Javalin.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement rate limiting middleware in Javalin for critical endpoints, especially login and API endpoints. Configure appropriate rate limits and response handling within the middleware.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Javalin Routes](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_javalin_routes.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Step 1:** Review all Javalin routes defined using `app.get()`, `app.post()`, etc.
    2.  **Step 2:** Define clear roles and permissions for different user groups or application functionalities that interact with Javalin routes.
    3.  **Step 3:** Design Javalin routes and handlers based on the principle of least privilege. Only create routes and functionalities that are absolutely necessary for each user role or function.
    4.  **Step 4:** Avoid creating overly permissive Javalin routes or handlers that grant access to more resources or functionalities than required.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access (Medium Severity)
    *   Lateral Movement (Medium Severity)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access (Medium Impact)
    *   Lateral Movement (Medium Impact)
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Javalin routes are generally designed for specific functionalities, but a formal review based on least privilege might be missing for the route definitions.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Conduct a route review based on the principle of least privilege for all Javalin routes. Identify and remove or restrict access to any unnecessary or overly permissive routes defined in Javalin.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Robust Authorization in Javalin Handlers and Middleware](./mitigation_strategies/implement_robust_authorization_in_javalin_handlers_and_middleware.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Step 1:** Define a clear authorization model for your application (e.g., RBAC, ABAC).
    2.  **Step 2:** Implement authorization checks in Javalin handlers or middleware (`app.before()`) to control access to routes and resources based on user roles, permissions, or attributes. Use `ctx.attribute()` or custom session/authentication mechanisms within Javalin to determine user identity and roles.
    3.  **Step 3:** Use Javalin's middleware (`app.before()`) to enforce authorization policies consistently across the application, checking authorization before handlers are executed.
    4.  **Step 4:** Test authorization logic thoroughly to ensure that access control is enforced correctly by Javalin middleware and handlers, and unauthorized users are denied access using `ctx.status(403).result("Unauthorized")` or similar responses within Javalin.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Broken Access Control (High Severity)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Broken Access Control (High Impact)
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic role-based authorization might be in place for some Javalin routes, but not consistently applied across the entire application. Authorization logic might be implemented directly within handlers instead of using Javalin middleware for consistent enforcement.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement a consistent and robust authorization framework using Javalin middleware (`app.before()`) or dedicated authorization libraries integrated with Javalin. Apply authorization checks to all relevant Javalin routes and resources using middleware. Standardize authorization logic and testing within Javalin.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure API Endpoints built with Javalin](./mitigation_strategies/secure_api_endpoints_built_with_javalin.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Step 1:** If building APIs with Javalin, identify all API endpoints defined as Javalin routes.
    2.  **Step 2:** Implement authentication for Javalin API endpoints. Use appropriate authentication mechanisms like API keys, OAuth 2.0, or JWT, and verify authentication within Javalin middleware or handlers using `ctx.header()`, `ctx.queryParam()`, or `ctx.body()` to extract credentials.
    3.  **Step 3:** Implement authorization for Javalin API endpoints using Javalin middleware or handlers. Control access to API endpoints based on client roles, permissions, or scopes, checking authorization after successful authentication within Javalin.
    4.  **Step 4:** Protect Javalin API endpoints against common API security vulnerabilities, including those listed previously, by applying input validation, output encoding, rate limiting, and robust authorization within Javalin.
    5.  **Step 5:** Follow API security best practices and guidelines (e.g., OWASP API Security Top 10) when designing and implementing Javalin APIs.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   API Security Vulnerabilities (High Severity)
*   **Impact:**
    *   API Security Vulnerabilities (High Impact)
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Javalin API endpoints might have basic authentication, but authorization might be lacking or inconsistent. Protection against other API security vulnerabilities within Javalin might not be fully implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement robust authentication and authorization for all Javalin API endpoints using middleware and handlers. Conduct a security review of Javalin API endpoints to identify and mitigate common API security vulnerabilities within the Javalin application. Follow API security best practices and guidelines when developing Javalin APIs.
