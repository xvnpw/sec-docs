# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, TranslationPlugin, aims to enhance developer productivity by providing seamless translation capabilities directly within their JetBrains IDE. By integrating translation services, developers can quickly understand code comments, documentation, and other text in various languages, reducing context switching and improving workflow efficiency.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Enhance developer productivity.
- Reduce language barriers for developers working with multilingual codebases or documentation.
- Provide a convenient and integrated translation solution within the IDE.
- Support multiple translation services to offer flexibility and choice to users.

Business Risks:
- Dependency on external translation services: Availability, reliability, and cost of third-party translation APIs.
- Data privacy concerns: Handling of text data sent to translation services.
- Plugin compatibility issues: Maintaining compatibility with different IDE versions and updates.
- Security vulnerabilities in the plugin itself, potentially exposing IDE or user data.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: HTTPS is used for communication with translation services (implicitly assumed as standard practice for API calls).
- security control: Plugin is distributed through JetBrains Marketplace (implies some level of vetting by JetBrains, although not a full security audit).

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on the security posture of third-party translation APIs.
- accepted risk: Potential exposure of translated text to third-party translation services (data privacy risk).

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement input validation to sanitize text before sending it to translation services to prevent injection attacks.
- security control: Consider offering users options to choose translation services with different privacy policies.
- security control: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
- security control: Implement logging and monitoring to detect and respond to potential security incidents.
- security control: Perform static and dynamic code analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities in the plugin code.
- security control: Consider code signing the plugin to ensure integrity and authenticity.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - Not applicable for the plugin itself as it doesn't have user accounts. Authentication to translation services is handled by the plugin using API keys or similar mechanisms, managed by the user.
- Authorization:
    - Not applicable for the plugin itself. Access to translation services is authorized by the user through their accounts with those services.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: The plugin must validate and sanitize input text before sending it to translation services to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity. This should include handling special characters and encoding.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Securely store and handle API keys or other sensitive credentials required for accessing translation services. Consider using the IDE's credential storage mechanisms if available.
    - Requirement: Ensure all communication with translation services is encrypted using HTTPS.

```

Build Process Description:
1. Developer commits code changes to the GitHub Repository.
2. GitHub Actions Workflow is triggered automatically on code commit (or pull request).
3. The CI workflow performs the following steps:
    - Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Runs a SAST scanner to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
    - Code Linting: Runs linters to enforce code quality and style guidelines.
    - Build Process: Compiles the plugin code, packages it into a distributable plugin artifact (e.g., ZIP file).
4. The built plugin artifact is then published to the JetBrains Marketplace, making it available for users to download and install.

Security Controls in Build Process:
- security control: Automated Build Process (GitHub Actions): Ensures consistent and repeatable builds, reduces manual errors.
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Identifies potential security vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
- security control: Code Linting: Improves code quality and reduces the likelihood of certain types of vulnerabilities.
- security control: Version Control (GitHub): Tracks code changes, facilitates collaboration, and provides auditability.
- security control: Code Review (Pull Requests): Encourages peer review of code changes before merging, improving code quality and security.
- security control: Secure artifact publishing to JetBrains Marketplace (HTTPS).
- security control: Consider signing the plugin artifact during the build process to ensure integrity and authenticity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Developer productivity enhancement through efficient translation.
- Maintaining developer trust in the plugin and the IDE ecosystem.

Data Sensitivity:
- Text being translated: Potentially sensitive code comments, documentation, or even code snippets. Sensitivity depends on the context of the project and the data being processed. Could range from low (public documentation) to high (proprietary code comments).
- API Keys for translation services: Highly sensitive credentials that must be protected.

Data Sensitivity Classification:
- Translated Text: Medium to High (context-dependent). Potential confidentiality risk if sensitive information is sent to third-party translation services.
- API Keys: High. Confidentiality and integrity risk. If compromised, could lead to unauthorized use of translation services and potentially data breaches.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What specific OCR service is being used? Is it cloud-based or local?
- How are API keys for translation services currently managed and stored?
- Are there any specific data privacy requirements or compliance regulations that need to be considered (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)?
- What is the intended user base for this plugin (internal company developers, public marketplace users)?
- Are there any existing security policies or guidelines within the organization (if applicable) that this plugin needs to adhere to?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to improve developer productivity. The plugin is intended for general use by developers using JetBrains IDEs.
- SECURITY POSTURE: HTTPS is used for all communication with external services. The plugin is intended to be distributed through the JetBrains Marketplace. No specific security audits have been performed yet.
- DESIGN: The plugin is a standard JetBrains IDE plugin. It interacts with external translation services via their public APIs. API keys are managed by the user. The build process is assumed to be using GitHub Actions or a similar CI/CD system.
