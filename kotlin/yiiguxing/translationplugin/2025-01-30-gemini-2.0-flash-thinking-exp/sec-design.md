# BUSINESS POSTURE

This translation plugin project aims to provide users with a seamless and efficient way to translate text within an application. The primary business goal is to enhance user experience and productivity by removing language barriers. This can be particularly valuable for applications used by a global user base or in multilingual environments.

Business priorities for this project are:
- Ease of integration: The plugin should be easy to integrate into existing applications with minimal effort.
- Accuracy and reliability: Translations provided by the plugin should be accurate and reliable to maintain user trust and avoid miscommunication.
- Performance: The plugin should perform translations quickly and efficiently without impacting the overall application performance.
- Cost-effectiveness: If the plugin relies on external translation services, it should be cost-effective to operate.

Key business risks associated with this project include:
- Data privacy breaches: If translation data, especially sensitive information, is not handled securely, it could lead to data breaches and reputational damage.
- Inaccurate translations: Poor quality translations can lead to user dissatisfaction, miscommunication, and potentially business errors.
- Service disruptions: Dependence on external translation services introduces a risk of service disruptions, impacting the plugin's availability.
- Integration issues: Difficulties in integrating the plugin with target applications can delay deployment and reduce its adoption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Source code hosted on GitHub. (Implemented: GitHub repository)
- security control: Open-source license (MIT License). (Implemented: LICENSE file in repository)

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security updates.
- accepted risk: Security of external translation services is assumed to be managed by the service providers.
- accepted risk: Security of the host application environment is assumed to be managed by the application owners.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement input validation to sanitize text before sending it to translation services to prevent injection attacks.
- security control: Securely manage any API keys or credentials required to access translation services, preferably using environment variables or a secrets management system.
- security control: Implement logging and monitoring to track plugin usage and identify potential security incidents.
- security control: Integrate automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) into the build process to identify vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
- security control: Establish a process for security vulnerability reporting and patching.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to the plugin itself, as authentication is expected to be handled by the host application. However, if the plugin requires access to secured translation services, API key authentication or similar mechanisms will be necessary.
- Authorization: Authorization is also primarily managed by the host application. The plugin should respect the authorization policies of the host application and not bypass them.
- Input validation: Input validation is crucial. The plugin must validate and sanitize the input text before sending it to translation services to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
- Cryptography: Cryptography may be required to protect API keys or other sensitive configuration data used by the plugin. Secure communication channels (HTTPS) should be used when interacting with external translation services.

    end
```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer makes code changes and commits them to the Source Code Repository (e.g., GitHub).
2. Code commit triggers the CI/CD Pipeline automatically.
3. Build Stage: Compiles the code, packages the plugin into a distributable artifact (e.g., a library or module).
4. Security Scan Stage: Performs static application security testing (SAST) and dependency scanning to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code and dependencies.
5. Test Stage: Executes unit tests and integration tests to ensure the plugin functions correctly.
6. Publish Stage: Publishes the build artifact (e.g., to an artifact repository or directly integrates into the Host Application's build process).
7. Build Artifact is stored in an Artifact Repository, ready for deployment or integration.

- security control: Automated CI/CD pipeline to ensure consistent and repeatable builds. (Implemented: CI/CD Pipeline)
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to identify code-level vulnerabilities. (Implemented: Security Scan Stage)
- security control: Dependency scanning to identify vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. (Implemented: Security Scan Stage)
- security control: Automated testing (unit and integration tests) to ensure code quality and prevent regressions. (Implemented: Test Stage)
- security control: Secure artifact repository to store build artifacts. (Implemented: Artifact Repository)
- security control: Access control to the CI/CD pipeline and artifact repository to prevent unauthorized modifications. (Implemented: CI/CD Pipeline, Artifact Repository)

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process:
- Accurate and reliable text translation for users of the Host Application.
- Maintaining user productivity and positive user experience by providing translation functionality.

Data to protect:
- Text submitted for translation: Sensitivity depends on the context of the Host Application and the type of text being translated. Could range from public information to sensitive business data or personal information.
- API keys or credentials for Translation Service API: Highly sensitive. If compromised, could lead to unauthorized usage and cost implications, or potentially data breaches if the API key grants access to more than just translation services.
- Plugin configuration data: May contain sensitive information depending on the configuration parameters.

Data sensitivity:
- Translated text: Potentially sensitive, depending on the application and use case. Assume moderate sensitivity for general business applications, high sensitivity for applications dealing with personal or confidential data.
- API keys: Highly sensitive.
- Plugin configuration: Potentially sensitive.
