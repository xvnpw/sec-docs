## Attack Tree Path: [1. Achieve RCE [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__achieve_rce__critical_.md)

*   **1.1 Exploit Plugin Vulnerabilities:**

    *   **1.1.1 Dependency Confusion/Hijacking [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker exploits the plugin's dependency resolution process to inject a malicious package with the same name as a legitimate dependency, but hosted on a public repository (e.g., npm, Maven Central). When the plugin is built or updated, the malicious package is downloaded and executed, leading to RCE.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

    *   **1.1.2 Vulnerable 3rd-Party Library Used by Plugin [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** The plugin uses a third-party library that contains a known vulnerability (e.g., a remote code execution flaw in a parsing library). The attacker exploits this vulnerability through the plugin, achieving RCE.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **1.2 Exploit Vulnerabilities in IDE Integration:**

    *   **1.2.1 Improper Handling of User Input [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** The plugin takes user input (e.g., text to translate, configuration settings) and uses it without proper sanitization or validation. This allows the attacker to inject malicious code (e.g., shell commands, script code) that is executed by the plugin or the IDE, leading to RCE.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **1.2.2 Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Plugin Settings [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** The plugin uses serialization/deserialization to store its settings. If the deserialization process is insecure, an attacker can craft a malicious serialized object that, when deserialized by the plugin, executes arbitrary code, leading to RCE.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

    *   **1.2.3 Path Traversal Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** If the plugin handles file paths based on user input, a path traversal vulnerability could allow an attacker to read or write arbitrary files on the system. By writing to specific locations (e.g., startup scripts, configuration files), the attacker can achieve code execution.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exfiltrate Sensitive Data [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exfiltrate_sensitive_data__critical_.md)

*   **2.1 Access Cached Translations/API Keys:**

    *   **2.1.1 Plugin Stores API Keys/Credentials Insecurely [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** The plugin stores API keys or other credentials in an insecure manner, such as plain text in configuration files, unencrypted storage, or easily accessible locations. An attacker who gains access to the developer's machine (through other means or by exploiting other vulnerabilities) can easily retrieve these keys.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

    *   **2.1.2 Plugin Exposes Sensitive Data via Logs/Error Messages [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** The plugin inadvertently logs sensitive information, such as API keys, translated text containing secrets, or other confidential data.  This information is then exposed in log files or error messages, which an attacker might be able to access.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
