## Attack Tree Path: [1. Attack Goal: Compromise Application Functionality and/or User Data via Malicious Chain Data [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__attack_goal_compromise_application_functionality_andor_user_data_via_malicious_chain_data__critic_1f40d428.md)

* **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker is to negatively impact applications using `ethereum-lists/chains` by exploiting vulnerabilities related to the chain data. Success means causing harm to the application's functionality, user data, or reputation.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. AND [1. Inject Malicious Chain Data into the List] [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__and__1__inject_malicious_chain_data_into_the_list___critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

* **Description:** This is a primary high-risk path where the attacker aims to directly modify the `ethereum-lists/chains` repository to include malicious data. This is highly impactful as it affects all applications using the updated list.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * Compromising repository infrastructure (see below).
    * Social engineering maintainers (see below).

## Attack Tree Path: [3. OR [1.1 Compromise Repository Infrastructure] [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__or__1_1_compromise_repository_infrastructure___critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

* **Description:**  This path focuses on attacking the infrastructure hosting the repository, specifically GitHub, to gain unauthorized write access and inject malicious data.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **1.1.1 Compromise GitHub Account with Write Access [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **1.1.1.1 Phishing Maintainers [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:**  Send deceptive emails, messages, or create fake login pages to trick maintainers into revealing their GitHub credentials (username and password, or 2FA codes).
            * **Impact:** Gain complete control over the maintainer's GitHub account, allowing direct modification of the repository.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. OR [1.2 Social Engineering/Compromise Maintainers] [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__or__1_2_social_engineeringcompromise_maintainers___critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

* **Description:** This path involves manipulating or deceiving maintainers into accepting malicious changes into the repository through legitimate channels like Pull Requests.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **1.2.1 Gain Trust and Submit Malicious Pull Request [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **1.2.1.2 Introduce Subtle Malicious Changes in PR [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** After building trust by contributing benign Pull Requests, introduce a new Pull Request containing subtle malicious changes to the chain data. These changes are designed to be overlooked during code review.
            * **Impact:** Inject malicious data into the list if the subtle changes are not detected during the review process.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. AND [2. Exploit Existing Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses in the List] [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/5__and__2__exploit_existing_vulnerabilitiesweaknesses_in_the_list___critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

* **Description:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses that might already exist in the `ethereum-lists/chains` data, or can be introduced with lower effort compared to repository compromise.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * Data Integrity Issues (see below).
    * Data Availability Issues (see below).

## Attack Tree Path: [6. OR [2.1 Data Integrity Issues] [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/6__or__2_1_data_integrity_issues___critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

* **Description:** This path exploits inaccuracies or malicious modifications in the data itself, focusing on corrupting the integrity of the chain data.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **2.1.2 Inject Malicious or Misleading RPC URLs [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **2.1.2.1 Phishing Attacks via Malicious RPC Endpoints [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Inject malicious RPC URLs into the chain data. Applications using this data will direct user connections to these malicious RPC endpoints. These fake RPCs can be designed to mimic legitimate chains and steal user credentials or private keys when users attempt transactions.
            * **Impact:** Phishing attacks, theft of user credentials and private keys, potential token drain.
        * **2.1.2.3 Denial of Service by Overloading Application with Malicious RPCs [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Inject a large number of malicious or non-functional RPC URLs. When applications attempt to connect to these RPCs, it can lead to resource exhaustion, timeouts, and denial of service for the application.
            * **Impact:** Application downtime, performance degradation, poor user experience.
    * **2.1.3 Inject Malicious or Misleading Explorer URLs [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **2.1.3.1 Phishing Attacks via Malicious Explorer Links [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Inject malicious Explorer URLs into the chain data. Applications displaying these links will direct users to fake explorer websites that mimic legitimate blockchain explorers. These fake explorers can be used to steal user credentials or trick users into revealing sensitive information.
            * **Impact:** Phishing attacks, credential theft, user deception.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. OR [2.2 Data Availability Issues] [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/7__or__2_2_data_availability_issues___critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

* **Description:** This path focuses on disrupting the availability of chain data by introducing non-functional or unreliable elements, primarily targeting RPC URLs.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **2.2.1 Introduce Non-Functional or Unreliable RPC URLs [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **2.2.1.1 Cause Application Downtime or Performance Degradation [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Inject non-functional or unreliable RPC URLs into the chain data. When applications attempt to use these RPCs, they will experience connection failures, timeouts, and slow responses.
            * **Impact:** Application downtime, performance degradation, poor user experience, and potential reputational damage.
