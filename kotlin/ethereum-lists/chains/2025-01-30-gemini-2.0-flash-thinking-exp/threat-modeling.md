# Threat Model Analysis for ethereum-lists/chains

## Threat: [Malicious Data Injection via Repository Compromise or Pull Request Poisoning](./threats/malicious_data_injection_via_repository_compromise_or_pull_request_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the `ethereum-lists/chains` repository or injects malicious data through a crafted pull request that bypasses review processes. The attacker's goal is to manipulate the chain data itself. This could involve:
    *   **Adding Fake Chains:** Introducing entirely fabricated blockchain networks with attacker-controlled RPC endpoints and misleading information to deceive users.
    *   **Modifying Existing Chain Data:** Altering details of legitimate chains, such as replacing official RPC URLs with malicious ones, changing explorer links to phishing sites, or subtly modifying chain IDs or currency symbols to cause confusion and errors.
    *   **Subverting Data Integrity:**  Disabling or circumventing any data integrity mechanisms (if present) to make malicious modifications harder to detect.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical Phishing Attacks:** Users are tricked into connecting to fake or attacker-controlled blockchain networks, believing they are interacting with legitimate chains. This can lead to the theft of private keys, funds, and sensitive information.
    *   **Critical Data Manipulation & Application Subversion:** Applications relying on the compromised data will function incorrectly, potentially leading to financial losses for users, incorrect transaction routing, and display of false or misleading information about blockchain networks.
    *   **Potential for Widespread Supply Chain Attack:** If many applications rely on this data source without sufficient validation, a single successful data injection can have a broad and significant impact across the ecosystem.
*   **Affected Component:** Chain Data (within the `ethereum-lists/chains` repository), Application's Data Fetching Module, Application's Core Logic that processes and utilizes chain data for critical functions (e.g., network connection, transaction routing, data display), User Interface elements displaying chain information and prompting user actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Data Integrity Checks:** If the repository provides any mechanisms for data integrity verification (e.g., cryptographic signatures, checksums, verifiable data structures), implement and enforce them rigorously. Verify the integrity of downloaded data before using it in the application.
    *   **Repository Source Verification & Pinning:**  Ensure the application *only* fetches data from the official and trusted `ethereum-lists/chains` repository on GitHub. Consider pinning to specific versions or commits of the repository to control updates and reduce the window of vulnerability from unexpected changes.
    *   **Comprehensive Code Review & Security Auditing:** Implement mandatory and thorough code review processes for all code that fetches, processes, and utilizes chain data. Conduct regular security audits of the application's data handling logic, focusing on vulnerabilities related to data integrity and injection.
    *   **Robust Input Sanitization & Validation (Defense in Depth):**  Even with repository integrity measures, implement strict sanitization and validation of *all* data received from the repository within the application. Do not blindly trust the data. Define and enforce strict schemas and whitelists for allowed values, especially for critical fields like RPC URLs, chain IDs, and currency symbols.
    *   **User Education & Transparency:** Educate users about the risks of connecting to untrusted networks and the importance of verifying chain information. Display chain details clearly and transparently within the application, allowing users to independently verify critical information against trusted sources. Implement clear warnings if data validation fails or discrepancies are detected.
    *   **Implement a "Chain Registry" Concept with Multiple Sources (Advanced):** For highly critical applications, consider moving away from relying solely on a single external data source. Implement a "chain registry" concept where the application aggregates chain data from multiple reputable and independent sources, performs cross-validation, and uses a consensus mechanism to determine the most trustworthy data. This significantly increases resilience against single-point-of-failure data injection attacks.
