## Attack Tree Path: [***Manipulate Data Source (HIGH RISK PATH)***](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_data_source__high_risk_path_.md)

**Goal:** To directly control the data within the `ethereum-lists/chains` repository.
*   **Impact:** This is a critical attack path as it allows the attacker to inject malicious data at the source, affecting all applications relying on the repository.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   ***Compromise GitHub Repository (Critical Node):***
        *   **Description:** Gaining unauthorized write access to the `ethereum-lists/chains` repository on GitHub.
        *   **Impact:** Complete control over the data, allowing for arbitrary modifications.
        *   **Mitigation:** Strong maintainer account security (MFA, strong passwords), regular security audits of the repository, and robust access controls.
    *   ***Compromise Maintainer Account (HIGH RISK PATH):***
        *   **Description:** Gaining access to a maintainer's GitHub account credentials.
        *   **Impact:** Ability to directly modify the repository.
        *   **Attack Methods:** Phishing attacks targeting maintainers, credential stuffing using leaked credentials, malware on maintainer's machines.
        *   **Mitigation:** Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA), educate maintainers about phishing, implement strong password policies, and ensure maintainer machines are secure.
    *   ***Submit Malicious Pull Request (HIGH RISK PATH):***
        *   **Description:** Submitting a pull request containing malicious changes that get merged into the main branch.
        *   **Impact:** Injection of malicious data into the repository.
        *   **Attack Methods:** Social engineering reviewers to approve malicious changes, exploiting a lack of expertise among reviewers, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in the CI/CD pipeline to automatically merge malicious code.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement a rigorous code review process, ensure reviewers have sufficient expertise, and secure the CI/CD pipeline.

## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept Data Delivery](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_data_delivery.md)

**Goal:** To intercept and modify the data as it's being transmitted from the repository to the application.
*   **Impact:** Allows the attacker to provide the application with malicious data without directly compromising the source repository.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   ***Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack (HIGH RISK PATH - Compromised User):***
        *   **Description:** Intercepting network traffic between the application and the GitHub repository (or CDN).
        *   **Impact:** Ability to modify the `chains` data before it reaches the application.
        *   **Attack Methods:**
            *   ***Compromise User's Machine (HIGH RISK NODE within MitM):*** Infecting the user's machine with malware that intercepts network traffic.
            *   Compromising network infrastructure (routers, DNS servers) to redirect traffic (less likely for direct GitHub access over HTTPS but possible for CDN).
        *   **Mitigation:** Ensure all data fetching is done over HTTPS, educate users about malware and phishing, encourage the use of endpoint security solutions, and implement network security best practices.
    *   

## Attack Tree Path: [***Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack (HIGH RISK PATH - Compromised User)***](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack__high_risk_path_-_compromised_user_.md)

***Compromise User's Machine (HIGH RISK NODE within MitM):*** Infecting the user's machine with malware that intercepts network traffic.
            *   Compromising network infrastructure (routers, DNS servers) to redirect traffic (less likely for direct GitHub access over HTTPS but possible for CDN).
        *   **Mitigation:** Ensure all data fetching is done over HTTPS, educate users about malware and phishing, encourage the use of endpoint security solutions, and implement network security best practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [***Exploit Application Logic with Malicious Data (HIGH RISK PATH)***](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application_logic_with_malicious_data__high_risk_path_.md)

**Goal:** To leverage vulnerabilities in how the application processes the data from `ethereum-lists/chains` to achieve malicious objectives.
*   **Impact:** Can lead to various forms of compromise, including phishing attacks, theft of private keys, and unintended interactions with malicious contracts.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   ***Malicious RPC URL (HIGH RISK PATH):***
        *   **Description:** The `chains` data contains `rpcUrls` for connecting to blockchain nodes. A malicious URL can be used for attacks.
        *   **Impact:**
            *   Phishing attacks by directing users to fake wallet interfaces.
            *   Stealing private keys if the application interacts with the RPC endpoint insecurely.
            *   Injecting malicious transactions on behalf of the user.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement strict validation of RPC URLs, warn users about potential risks, and ensure secure interaction with RPC endpoints.
    *   ***Malicious Contract Addresses/ABIs (HIGH RISK PATH):***
        *   **Description:** The `chains` data might contain contract addresses and Application Binary Interfaces (ABIs). Malicious entries can be exploited.
        *   **Impact:**
            *   Leading users to interact with attacker-controlled smart contracts, potentially leading to loss of funds or other malicious actions.
            *   Displaying incorrect information about contracts, misleading users.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement validation of contract addresses and ABIs, provide users with mechanisms to verify contract information, and potentially maintain a curated list of trusted contracts.
