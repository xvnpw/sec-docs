# Attack Surface Analysis for ethereum-lists/chains

## Attack Surface: [Data Poisoning at the Source](./attack_surfaces/data_poisoning_at_the_source.md)

**Description:** Malicious actors compromise the `ethereum-lists/chains` repository on GitHub, injecting incorrect or malicious chain data.

**How `chains` Contributes:** The application directly relies on the data within this repository to understand and interact with different blockchain networks. If this source is compromised, the application inherits the malicious data.

**Example:** A malicious actor gains control of a maintainer account and modifies the RPC URL for a popular chain to point to a phishing server designed to steal private keys.

**Impact:** Users interacting with the application might unknowingly connect to the malicious RPC endpoint, potentially leading to the theft of their funds or private keys. The application itself might malfunction due to incorrect chain parameters.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Implement integrity checks on the downloaded `chains` data (e.g., verify signatures if available, compare hashes against known good states).
    * Regularly monitor the `ethereum-lists/chains` repository for unexpected changes.
    * Consider forking the repository and maintaining a local, vetted copy with stricter access controls.
    * Implement a mechanism to fallback to known good data if inconsistencies are detected.
* **Users:** (Indirectly through application choice)
    * Choose applications that demonstrate a strong commitment to security and data integrity.

## Attack Surface: [Data Integrity Issues During Download/Storage](./attack_surfaces/data_integrity_issues_during_downloadstorage.md)

**Description:**  Data corruption occurs while downloading the `chains` data or storing it locally, leading to the application using incorrect information.

**How `chains` Contributes:** The application fetches and stores data from this external source. Vulnerabilities in the download or storage process can compromise the integrity of this crucial data.

**Example:** A man-in-the-middle attack intercepts the download of the `chains` data and injects modified information before it reaches the application.

**Impact:** The application might misinterpret chain IDs, use incorrect network parameters, or display wrong information to users, potentially leading to transaction errors or user confusion.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Use secure protocols (HTTPS) for downloading the `chains` data.
    * Implement checksum verification after downloading the data to ensure it hasn't been tampered with.
    * Secure the local storage of the `chains` data with appropriate file permissions and access controls.
* **Users:** (Indirectly through application choice)
    * Prefer applications that use secure download and storage practices.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Unexpected Data Content within Valid Schema](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_unexpected_data_content_within_valid_schema.md)

**Description:**  Malicious actors submit pull requests with subtly crafted, yet harmful, data within the existing schema of the `chains` repository.

**How `chains` Contributes:** The application trusts the data structure and format provided by the repository. Malicious content adhering to this structure can still cause harm.

**Example:** A pull request introduces a new chain entry with a legitimate-looking name but an RPC URL pointing to a malicious node that logs user interactions or attempts to steal credentials.

**Impact:** Users might unknowingly interact with malicious networks or services. The application's logic, even if correctly implemented, will operate on this flawed data, leading to incorrect or harmful actions.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Implement robust validation and sanitization of the `chains` data before using it in the application, even if it conforms to the expected schema.
    * Have a process for manually reviewing and vetting updates to the `ethereum-lists/chains` data before incorporating them into the application.
    * Consider using a curated and actively maintained fork of the repository with stricter review processes.
* **Users:** (Indirectly through application choice)
    * Favor applications that demonstrate careful vetting of external data sources.
