# Threat Model Analysis for ethereum-lists/chains

## Threat: [Malicious Data Injection into Repository](./threats/malicious_data_injection_into_repository.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Data Injection into Repository
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized write access to the `ethereum-lists/chains` repository (e.g., by compromising a maintainer account or exploiting a vulnerability in the repository's infrastructure). They then modify the JSON data to include incorrect or malicious information about blockchain networks. This could involve altering chain IDs, RPC endpoints, currency symbols, or adding entirely fake networks.
    *   **Impact:** Applications relying on this data could connect to the wrong blockchain network, potentially leading to users sending transactions to unintended recipients or losing funds. Incorrect currency symbols could mislead users. Fake networks could be used for phishing or other malicious activities.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire `chains` data structure within the repository.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls and multi-factor authentication for repository maintainers.
        *   Regularly audit the repository for unauthorized changes.
        *   Consider implementing a signing mechanism for the data, allowing applications to verify its authenticity.
        *   Applications should implement robust validation of the data received, cross-referencing with other reputable sources if possible.
        *   Monitor the repository's commit history for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack During Data Retrieval](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_during_data_retrieval.md)

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle Attack During Data Retrieval
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between the application and the GitHub repository (or a mirror) while the application is fetching the `chains` data. The attacker then injects malicious data, replacing the legitimate data with their own compromised version.
    *   **Impact:** The application receives and uses the attacker's manipulated data, leading to the same impacts as malicious data injection in the repository (connecting to wrong networks, incorrect information, etc.).
    *   **Affected Component:** The data retrieval process, specifically the network communication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Crucially, ensure HTTPS is used for fetching the data.** This encrypts the communication and makes it significantly harder for attackers to intercept and modify.
        *   Implement integrity checks on the downloaded data, such as verifying a checksum or signature if provided by the repository in the future.
        *   Consider using a trusted and verified mirror of the repository if direct access to GitHub is a concern.
