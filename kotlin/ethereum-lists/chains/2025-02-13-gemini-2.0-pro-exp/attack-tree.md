## Attack Tree Path: [1. Supply Chain Attack on `ethereum-lists/chains` Repository](./attack_tree_paths/1__supply_chain_attack_on__ethereum-listschains__repository.md)

*   **1.1. Compromise GitHub Account of Maintainer/Contributor [CRITICAL]:**
    *   *Description:* Gaining unauthorized access to a GitHub account with write permissions to the repository.
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium - Depends on the security practices of the maintainers.
    *   *Impact:* Very High - Allows complete control over the repository's contents.
    *   *Effort:* Low to Medium - Depends on the attack method (phishing is easier than malware).
    *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate to Advanced - Phishing can be intermediate; malware and session hijacking are more advanced.
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Hard - Detecting compromised accounts can be challenging without robust monitoring.
    *   *Sub-Steps:*
        *   1.1.1. *Phishing/Social Engineering:* Tricking the maintainer into revealing credentials.
        *   1.1.2. *Credential Stuffing/Password Reuse:* Using credentials leaked from other breaches.
        *   1.1.3. *Malware on Maintainer's Device:* Installing keyloggers or other malware to steal credentials.
        *   1.1.4. *Session Hijacking:* Stealing an active session token to bypass authentication.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Malicious Pull Request (PR) Accepted](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__malicious_pull_request__pr__accepted.md)

*   *Description:* Submitting a PR that contains malicious changes, disguised as legitimate updates.
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium - Depends on the rigor of the review process.
    *   *Impact:* Very High - Can introduce malicious chain data into the repository.
    *   *Effort:* Medium - Requires crafting a convincing PR and potentially social engineering.
    *   *Skill Level:* Advanced - Requires understanding of the codebase and how to obfuscate malicious changes.
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Very Hard - If the changes are well-obfuscated, detection is extremely difficult.
    *   *Sub-Steps:*
        *   1.2.1. *PR Appears Benign:* The attacker makes the changes look like legitimate updates or bug fixes.
        *   **1.2.2. Insufficient Review Process [CRITICAL]:** This is the key weakness that enables this attack.
            *   1.2.2.1. *Lack of Multiple Reviewers:* Only one reviewer increases the chance of a malicious PR slipping through.
            *   1.2.2.2. *Reviewers Lack Expertise:* Reviewers may not have the necessary knowledge to identify subtle malicious changes.
            *   1.2.2.3. *Automated Checks Bypassed:* The attacker finds ways to circumvent any automated security checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3. Direct Modification of Repository (If Access Gained)](./attack_tree_paths/1_3__direct_modification_of_repository__if_access_gained_.md)

*   *Description:* Directly modifying the repository files after gaining write access (e.g., through a compromised account).
    *   *Likelihood:* Low - Requires successful account compromise (1.1).
    *   *Impact:* Very High - Allows complete control over the repository's contents.
    *   *Effort:* Very Low - Once access is gained, modification is trivial.
    *   *Skill Level:* Novice - Basic file editing skills are sufficient.
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium - Changes will be visible in the commit history, but might be missed without careful monitoring.
    *   *Sub-Steps:*
        *   **1.3.1. Add Malicious Chain Data [CRITICAL]:** Adding entirely new, malicious chain entries.
        *   **1.3.2. Modify Existing Chain Data (e.g., RPC URL) [CRITICAL]:** Changing the details of existing chains to point to malicious endpoints.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Application's Handling of `chains` Data](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_application's_handling_of__chains__data.md)

*   **2.1. Insufficient Validation of Chain Data [CRITICAL]:**
    *   *Description:* The application does not adequately verify the integrity and authenticity of the chain data it retrieves.
    *   *Likelihood:* High - Many applications may not implement sufficient validation.
    *   *Impact:* Very High - Allows the application to be tricked into connecting to malicious blockchains.
    *   *Effort:* Very Low - The attacker doesn't need to do anything; the vulnerability is in the application's code.
    *   *Skill Level:* Novice - No attacker skill is required; this is an application vulnerability.
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Very Easy (if validation mechanisms were in place) / Very Hard (if no validation exists) - Depends on whether the application *should* be performing validation.
    *   *Sub-Steps:*
        *   **2.1.1. No Checksum/Hash Verification [CRITICAL]:** The application doesn't check if the downloaded data has been tampered with.  This is the *most critical* missing validation.
        *   **2.1.5. No Independent Verification of RPC URLs [CRITICAL]:** The application doesn't verify that the RPC URLs are legitimate and trustworthy.
            *   2.1.5.1. *No connection test:*  The application doesn't attempt to connect to the RPC URL to see if it's reachable and responsive.
            *   2.1.5.2. *No check against known good list:* The application doesn't compare the RPC URL against a list of known-good or known-bad endpoints.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2. Outdated `chains` Data](./attack_tree_paths/2_2__outdated__chains__data.md)

*   *Description:* The application uses an old version of the chain data, missing important updates or security fixes.
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium to High - Depends on the application's update mechanism.
    *   *Impact:* Medium - Could lead to using deprecated chains or missing information about malicious chains.
    *   *Effort:* Very Low - The attacker doesn't need to do anything.
    *   *Skill Level:* Novice - No attacker skill is required.
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy - Can be detected by checking the version of the chain data.
    *   *Sub-Steps:*
        *   2.2.1. *Application Doesn't Auto-Update:* The application has no mechanism to automatically update the chain data.
        *   2.2.2. *Infrequent Manual Updates:* The application relies on manual updates, which may be infrequent or forgotten.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Vulnerabilities in RPC Endpoints](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_rpc_endpoints.md)

*    **3.1. Malicious RPC Endpoint (Specified in `chains` Data)**
    *   *Description:* The `chains` data includes a URL for a malicious RPC endpoint controlled by the attacker.
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium - Depends on the success of a supply chain attack (1) or application misconfiguration.
    *   *Impact:* Very High - Allows the attacker to control the blockchain data the application receives.
    *   *Effort:* Medium - Requires setting up and maintaining a malicious RPC server.
    *   *Skill Level:* Advanced - Requires knowledge of blockchain technology and RPC protocols.
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Hard - Requires analyzing the behavior of the RPC endpoint.
    *   *Sub-Steps:*
        *   **3.1.1. Returns Incorrect Blockchain Data [CRITICAL]:** The malicious RPC endpoint provides false information to the application.
            *   3.1.1.1. *Fake Transaction Confirmations:*  The endpoint falsely reports that transactions have been confirmed.
            *   3.1.1.2. *Incorrect Balances:* The endpoint reports incorrect account balances.
            *   3.1.1.3. *Manipulated Smart Contract State:* The endpoint returns manipulated data about the state of smart contracts.
