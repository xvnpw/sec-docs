# Attack Surface Analysis for ethereum-lists/chains

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Chain Data Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_chain_data_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker modifies the `ethereum-lists/chains` data (or a mirrored source) to include incorrect or malicious information. This is the most direct and dangerous attack vector.

**How `chains` Contributes:** The repository *is* the source of truth for chain data. If compromised, the application receives poisoned data.

**Example:** An attacker changes the `rpc` URL for Ethereum Mainnet to point to a server they control. The application then sends transactions to this malicious node.

**Impact:**
    *   Loss of funds (theft).
    *   Exposure of private keys.
    *   Transaction censorship.
    *   False transaction confirmations.
    *   Application compromise.
    *   Denial of Service.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Data Validation:** Implement a rigid schema for chain data. Reject any data that doesn't conform. Validate URL formats with regular expressions.
    *   **Hardcoded ChainID Whitelist:** Maintain an internal, *hardcoded* list of known-good `chainId` values. Cross-reference against this list. This is the *strongest* defense against chain ID manipulation.
    *   **Multiple Data Sources:** Fetch chain data from multiple, independent sources (e.g., Chainlist.org, official chain documentation, a self-maintained list). Compare the data and flag discrepancies.
    *   **Runtime Monitoring:** Monitor RPC error rates, chain connectivity, and transaction failures. Alert on anomalies.
    *   **Secure Update Mechanism:** Implement a secure update process with manual review options and rollback capabilities. Never blindly trust updates.

## Attack Surface: [Reliance on Third-Party RPC Providers](./attack_surfaces/reliance_on_third-party_rpc_providers.md)

**Description:** The application relies on the security and availability of third-party RPC providers listed in the `ethereum-lists/chains` data.

**How `chains` Contributes:** The `rpc` URLs in the repository point to these third-party services.

**Example:** The application uses Infura as its primary RPC provider for Ethereum. If Infura is compromised or experiences an outage, the application is affected.

**Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (if the provider is unavailable).
    *   Data manipulation (if the provider is compromised).
    *   Potential privacy leaks (depending on the provider's policies).

**Risk Severity:** **High** (The application's security is directly tied to the security of external services)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Provider Redundancy:** Configure multiple RPC providers for each chain. Implement failover mechanisms.
    *   **Reputable Providers:** Choose well-known, reputable RPC providers with strong security practices.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and potential service disruption.
    *   **Self-Hosting (Advanced):** Run your own blockchain nodes to eliminate reliance on third parties (requires significant resources and expertise).
    *   **Monitoring:** Actively monitor the health and performance of the RPC providers.
