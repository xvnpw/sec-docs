# Attack Surface Analysis for ethereum-lists/chains

## Attack Surface: [Data Poisoning via Compromised Repository](./attack_surfaces/data_poisoning_via_compromised_repository.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious actors compromise the `ethereum-lists/chains` repository and inject false or malicious data.
    *   **How Chains Contributes:** The application directly relies on the data within the repository (e.g., chain IDs, RPC endpoints, contract addresses). If this data is tampered with, the application will use incorrect or malicious information.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies the RPC endpoint for a popular chain to point to a phishing server that steals users' private keys when they attempt to connect.
    *   **Impact:** Users could lose funds, interact with malicious contracts, or have their sensitive information compromised. The application's functionality and integrity are severely undermined.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust data validation on the data fetched from the repository. Verify critical fields like RPC URLs and contract addresses against known good sources or schemas.
        *   Monitor the `ethereum-lists/chains` repository for unexpected changes or commits. Subscribe to notifications and review updates.
        *   Consider using a forked and locally managed version of the repository, with stricter control over modifications.
        *   Implement checksum or signature verification for the data fetched from the repository if available.
        *   Educate users about the risks of connecting to untrusted networks or interacting with unknown contracts.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Compromise of the Repository](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_compromise_of_the_repository.md)

*   **Description:**  A vulnerability or malicious actor compromises the infrastructure or dependencies used by the `ethereum-lists/chains` repository maintainers, leading to the injection of malicious data without direct compromise of the repository itself on GitHub.
    *   **How Chains Contributes:** If the tools or processes used to generate or update the chain data are compromised, malicious data can be introduced into the repository, which the application will then consume.
    *   **Example:**  A build dependency used by the repository maintainers is compromised, and a script injects malicious RPC endpoints into the generated `chains.json` file.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to direct repository compromise, leading to users interacting with malicious services and potential loss of funds or data. This is harder to detect as the GitHub repository itself might appear legitimate.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay informed about the security practices and reputation of the `ethereum-lists/chains` project maintainers.
        *   If feasible, contribute to the project and participate in code reviews to increase scrutiny of changes.
        *   Implement strong data validation and integrity checks on the fetched data, as mentioned before, to detect anomalies regardless of the source.
        *   Consider using a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) approach to understand the dependencies of the repository's tooling (though this might be challenging for external repositories).

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Usage of RPC URLs from Chains Data](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_usage_of_rpc_urls_from_chains_data.md)

*   **Description:** The application directly uses the RPC URLs provided in the `ethereum-lists/chains` data without proper security considerations.
    *   **How Chains Contributes:** The repository provides a list of RPC endpoints for various chains. If these URLs are directly used without sanitization or security measures, the application could be vulnerable if a malicious URL is present (even if unintentional).
    *   **Example:** A compromised or malicious actor submits a pull request with an RPC URL that logs user IP addresses or attempts to inject malicious responses. If the application directly uses this URL, user privacy and security are at risk.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of user data, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks if the RPC endpoint is compromised, and the application might interact with unintended or malicious services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a mechanism to allow users to select or verify RPC endpoints, rather than blindly trusting the ones from the repository.
        *   Use reputable and well-vetted RPC providers or infrastructure where possible.
        *   Consider using libraries or frameworks that provide secure handling of RPC connections and responses.
        *   Implement checks to ensure RPC URLs adhere to expected formats and potentially cross-reference them with known good lists.
        *   Warn users about the risks of using untrusted RPC endpoints.
