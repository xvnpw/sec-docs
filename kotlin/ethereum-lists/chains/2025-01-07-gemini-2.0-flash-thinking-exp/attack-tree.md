## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Maintainer Account](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_maintainer_account.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the GitHub account of a maintainer of the `ethereum-lists/chains` repository. This could be achieved through phishing, credential stuffing, exploiting vulnerabilities in the maintainer's personal systems, or social engineering.
    **Impact:**  This is a critical node because it grants the attacker the ability to directly modify the official repository. This allows them to inject malicious data that will be distributed to all applications relying on the project, potentially causing widespread compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious RPC Endpoint (via Pull Request)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_rpc_endpoint__via_pull_request_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker submits a pull request to the `ethereum-lists/chains` repository that includes or modifies a chain's data to contain a malicious RPC endpoint. This endpoint is controlled by the attacker.
    **Impact:** This is critical because if an application uses this malicious RPC endpoint, it can be tricked into interacting with a fraudulent blockchain. This can lead to users' transactions being redirected to the attacker, resulting in financial loss, or the application performing unintended actions on the attacker's controlled network.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Malicious Code via Exploited Field (e.g., RPC URL)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_malicious_code_via_exploited_field__e_g___rpc_url_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An application, due to improper validation, directly uses data from the `ethereum-lists/chains` project, such as an RPC URL, in a way that allows for code execution. For example, if the application constructs a command using the RPC URL without sanitization, a malicious URL could inject arbitrary commands.
    **Impact:** This is a critical node because successful exploitation leads to the attacker gaining control over the application's execution environment. This can result in data breaches, system takeover, or further malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Redirect User Transactions to Malicious Networks](./attack_tree_paths/redirect_user_transactions_to_malicious_networks.md)

**Attack Vector:** An application uses a malicious RPC endpoint (injected into the chain data) to interact with a blockchain. This causes user transactions initiated through the application to be sent to the attacker's controlled network instead of the intended legitimate network.
    **Impact:** This is critical due to the direct financial impact on users. Their funds can be stolen or manipulated by the attacker through the fraudulent network.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Remote Code Execution (via JSON Parsing Vulnerability)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_remote_code_execution__via_json_parsing_vulnerability_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application uses a JSON parsing library with known vulnerabilities. An attacker crafts a specific malicious JSON payload within the chain data that exploits this vulnerability, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server or client running the application.
    **Impact:** This is a critical node as it grants the attacker complete control over the system running the application, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Directly Using User-Provided Chain IDs Without Validation](./attack_tree_paths/directly_using_user-provided_chain_ids_without_validation.md)

**Attack Vector:** An application allows users to specify a chain ID and directly uses this input to fetch data or interact with blockchain networks without proper validation against the data from `ethereum-lists/chains` or other trusted sources. An attacker could provide a malicious chain ID.
    **Impact:** This is critical because it allows attackers to force the application to interact with unintended or malicious blockchain networks. This can lead to users performing actions on the wrong chain, potentially losing funds or interacting with malicious contracts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Using Chain Data to Construct Security-Sensitive Commands](./attack_tree_paths/using_chain_data_to_construct_security-sensitive_commands.md)

**Attack Vector:** An application uses data from the `ethereum-lists/chains` project to construct commands that are executed on the underlying system. If this data is not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious commands through manipulated chain data.
    **Impact:** This is critical because it can lead to arbitrary command execution on the server or client, potentially allowing the attacker to gain control of the system, access sensitive data, or perform other malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Submit Malicious Pull Request -> Inject Malicious RPC Endpoint](./attack_tree_paths/submit_malicious_pull_request_-_inject_malicious_rpc_endpoint.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker submits a pull request to the `ethereum-lists/chains` repository containing a modification or addition of a chain with a malicious RPC endpoint. If this pull request is merged without sufficient scrutiny, applications using the updated data will be exposed.
    **Impact:** This path has a medium likelihood due to the relative ease of submitting pull requests and a high impact because a malicious RPC endpoint can directly lead to financial loss for users and compromise application functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Application's Data Processing](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_application's_data_processing.md)

**Attack Vector:** This is a broad category encompassing various vulnerabilities in how an application processes data from `ethereum-lists/chains`. This includes improper validation, insecure use of data in commands, and vulnerabilities in JSON parsing.
    **Impact:** This path is high-risk because it represents a collection of common application-level vulnerabilities that can be exploited with varying levels of effort and skill, leading to a range of impacts from denial of service to critical system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Improper Validation of Chain Data -> Application Trusts Unvalidated Data -> Execute Malicious Code via Exploited Field (e.g., RPC URL)](./attack_tree_paths/improper_validation_of_chain_data_-_application_trusts_unvalidated_data_-_execute_malicious_code_via_82750abb.md)

**Attack Vector:** An application fails to validate the data it receives from `ethereum-lists/chains`. Specifically, it trusts an RPC URL from the data and uses it in a way that allows for code execution (e.g., passing it to a system command).
    **Impact:** This path is high-risk due to the medium likelihood of such validation flaws in applications and the critical impact of achieving remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Improper Validation of Chain Data -> Application Trusts Unvalidated Data -> Redirect User Transactions to Malicious Networks](./attack_tree_paths/improper_validation_of_chain_data_-_application_trusts_unvalidated_data_-_redirect_user_transactions_050b7913.md)

**Attack Vector:** An application does not validate the RPC endpoint from the `ethereum-lists/chains` data and uses it to connect to a blockchain network for user transactions. If the RPC endpoint is malicious, user transactions will be sent to the attacker's network.
    **Impact:** This path is high-risk due to the medium likelihood of validation errors and the critical impact of financial loss for users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in JSON Parsing Library -> Craft Malicious JSON Payloads](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_json_parsing_library_-_craft_malicious_json_payloads.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application uses a JSON parsing library with known vulnerabilities. An attacker crafts a specific JSON payload within the chain data that exploits this vulnerability.
    **Impact:** This path is high-risk because while triggering remote code execution might be lower likelihood, causing a denial of service through crafted JSON is more probable and still has a significant impact on application availability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unsafe Usage of Chain Data in Critical Operations -> Directly Using User-Provided Chain IDs Without Validation](./attack_tree_paths/unsafe_usage_of_chain_data_in_critical_operations_-_directly_using_user-provided_chain_ids_without_v_b2cd9288.md)

**Attack Vector:** An application allows users to select a chain ID and directly uses this input without validating it against the data from `ethereum-lists/chains`. An attacker can provide a malicious chain ID.
    **Impact:** This path is high-risk due to the medium to high likelihood of applications allowing user input for chain selection and the high impact of users potentially interacting with unintended or malicious networks.
