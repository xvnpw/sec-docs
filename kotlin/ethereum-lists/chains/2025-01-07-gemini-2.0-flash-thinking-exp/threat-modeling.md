# Threat Model Analysis for ethereum-lists/chains

## Threat: [Compromised Upstream Data Injection](./threats/compromised_upstream_data_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the `ethereum-lists/chains` repository (e.g., through compromised maintainer accounts or vulnerabilities in GitHub's infrastructure) and injects malicious or incorrect chain data. This could involve modifying existing entries or adding entirely new, fabricated entries.

**Impact:** The application could display incorrect network information, leading users to connect to malicious or non-existent networks. This could result in loss of funds, exposure of private keys, or other security breaches.

**Affected Component:** The entire `chains` data structure (JSON files within the repository).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Verify the integrity of the fetched data using checksums or digital signatures if provided by the repository maintainers.
*   Pin a specific commit hash of the repository to ensure consistency and prevent unexpected changes from being incorporated.
*   Implement a mechanism to compare fetched data against a known good state or a curated subset of critical data.
*   Monitor the `ethereum-lists/chains` repository for unexpected changes or commits from unknown sources.

## Threat: [Introduction of Malicious Network Entries](./threats/introduction_of_malicious_network_entries.md)

**Description:** The `ethereum-lists/chains` data includes entries for malicious or scam networks that are designed to deceive users or steal their funds.

**Impact:** The application might present these malicious networks to users, potentially leading them to connect to these networks and lose funds or expose sensitive information.

**Affected Component:** The list of chain entries within the data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement a filtering mechanism to review and potentially exclude or flag suspicious network entries based on community feedback or internal analysis.
*   Provide users with warnings or disclaimers when displaying information about less common or unverified networks.
*   Allow users to customize their network lists or only display a curated set of trusted networks by default.
