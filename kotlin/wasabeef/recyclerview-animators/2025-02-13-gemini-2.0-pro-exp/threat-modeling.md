# Threat Model Analysis for wasabeef/recyclerview-animators

## Threat: [Excessive Animation Triggering (Denial of Service)](./threats/excessive_animation_triggering__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Threat:** Excessive Animation Triggering (Denial of Service)

    *   **Description:** While the application logic controls the *frequency* of updates, `recyclerview-animators` is directly responsible for executing the animations.  If the library has inefficiencies in how it handles rapid, successive animation requests (even if triggered by the application), it can contribute to the UI thread becoming overwhelmed, leading to a local denial-of-service (application freeze or ANR). This focuses on the library's internal handling of animation queuing and execution.
    *   **Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive, potentially crashing. User experience is severely degraded.
    *   **Affected Component:** `RecyclerView.Adapter` interactions *with* any of the animator classes (e.g., `SlideInLeftAnimator`, `FadeInAnimator`, etc.).  Specifically, the internal queuing and execution mechanisms within the animator classes when handling multiple, rapid calls to `notifyItemInserted`, `notifyItemRemoved`, etc. from the adapter. The library's handling of `ViewPropertyAnimator` instances and their lifecycle is crucial.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Library-Specific Optimizations (If Possible):** If contributing to the library, investigate internal optimizations for handling rapid animation requests. This might involve debouncing or throttling *within* the library itself (though this is generally the responsibility of the application).
        *   **Documentation:** The library's documentation should clearly warn about the potential for performance issues with rapid updates and recommend best practices (like using `DiffUtil` and debouncing/throttling on the application side).
        *   **Profiling (Library-Level):** Thoroughly profile the library's code to identify any bottlenecks in animation handling, especially when dealing with frequent updates.
        *   **Limit Concurrency (Internal):** Explore ways to limit the number of concurrent animations the library handles internally, perhaps using a queue or pool of `ViewPropertyAnimator` instances.

## Threat: [Inefficient Animation Abuse (Performance Degradation)](./threats/inefficient_animation_abuse__performance_degradation_.md)

* **Threat:** Inefficient Animation Abuse (Performance Degradation)
    *   **Description:** The library provides various animation types. Some are inherently more computationally expensive than others. If the library doesn't efficiently implement these complex animations, or if it allows for unbounded resource usage during animation execution, an attacker could (through application input manipulation) trigger these expensive animations on a large scale, leading to performance degradation. This focuses on the *implementation quality* of the animation logic within the library.
    *   **Impact:** Significant performance degradation, leading to a sluggish UI and potentially ANRs.
    *   **Affected Component:** The more complex animator classes (e.g., those involving multiple property changes, custom interpolators, or complex transformations). Specifically, the `animateAddImpl`, `animateRemoveImpl`, `animateMoveImpl`, and `animateChangeImpl` methods within these animator classes, and how they utilize `ViewPropertyAnimator`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Optimized Animation Implementations:** Ensure that all animator classes are implemented as efficiently as possible. Minimize unnecessary calculations, object allocations, and UI thread operations.
        *   **Benchmarking:** Create performance benchmarks for each animator class to identify and address performance bottlenecks.
        *   **Resource Limits (Internal):** Consider internal limits on animation complexity or duration to prevent runaway resource consumption. This is a delicate balance, as it could limit the library's expressiveness.
        *   **Documentation:** Clearly document the performance characteristics of each animator class, advising users on which animations are suitable for large lists or low-powered devices.
