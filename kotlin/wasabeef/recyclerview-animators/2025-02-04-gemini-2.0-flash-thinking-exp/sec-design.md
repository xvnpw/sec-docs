# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is an open-source Android library that provides a collection of RecyclerView ItemAnimators. The primary goal is to enhance the user interface and user experience of Android applications by offering visually appealing and customizable animations for RecyclerViews.

* Business Priorities:
    * Provide a useful and high-quality animation library for Android developers.
    * Maintain compatibility with a wide range of Android versions.
    * Ensure ease of integration and use for developers.
    * Foster an active open-source community around the library.
* Business Goals:
    * Increase adoption and usage of the library by Android developers.
    * Expand the collection of available animations and customization options.
    * Maintain the library's quality and address bug reports and feature requests.
* Business Risks:
    * Library vulnerabilities could be introduced, impacting applications that depend on it.
    * Lack of maintenance or community support could lead to the library becoming outdated or unusable.
    * Security vulnerabilities in the build or distribution process could compromise the library.

# SECURITY POSTURE

* Security Control: Repository hosted on GitHub, providing version control and access management. Implemented by: GitHub platform.
* Security Control: Open-source project, allowing for community review and potential security audits. Implemented by: Open-source nature of the project.
* Accepted Risk: Reliance on community contributions for identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities.
* Accepted Risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by the library.

Recommended Security Controls:
* Recommended Security Control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
* Recommended Security Control: Integrate static analysis security testing (SAST) tools into the build process to detect potential code-level vulnerabilities.
* Recommended Security Control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities.
* Recommended Security Control: Consider code signing for releases to ensure integrity and authenticity.

Security Requirements:
* Authentication: Not directly applicable to the library itself. Authentication is relevant for contributors to the repository (handled by GitHub).
* Authorization: Not directly applicable to the library itself. Authorization is relevant for managing access to the repository (handled by GitHub).
* Input Validation: While the library itself doesn't directly handle user input, it's important to ensure that the library's API is robust and handles unexpected or invalid input from developers using the library gracefully without causing crashes or unexpected behavior.
* Cryptography: Not directly applicable to this animation library. Cryptographic requirements might be relevant if the library were handling sensitive data, which is not the case here.

* Data to Protect:
    * Source code of the library: Sensitivity - Publicly available, but integrity is crucial to prevent malicious modifications.
    * Build artifacts (AAR, POM): Sensitivity - Publicly available, but integrity is crucial to prevent distribution of compromised libraries.
* Data Sensitivity: Publicly available code and artifacts, but integrity is paramount for supply chain security.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
* What is the current process for handling bug reports and security vulnerabilities?
* Are there any automated security checks currently in place in the build process (e.g., dependency scanning, SAST)?
* Is there a process for code signing releases?
* What are the criteria for accepting contributions, and is there any security review process for contributions?

Assumptions:
* The project is primarily maintained by the open-source community.
* The library is distributed through standard package repositories like Jitpack and Maven Central.
* The build process is automated using a CI system (likely GitHub Actions or similar).
* Security is considered important, but might not be the primary focus compared to functionality and ease of use.
* Developers using the library are responsible for the overall security of their Android applications.
