# Attack Surface Analysis for wasabeef/recyclerview-animators

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Excessive Animations](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_excessive_animations.md)

*   **Description:** Denial of Service (DoS) through Excessive Animations. An attacker can trigger a large number of simultaneous animations, overwhelming device resources.
    *   **How recyclerview-animators Contributes:** The library provides the animation mechanisms. By rapidly adding, removing, or moving items in the `RecyclerView`, the library initiates animations for each change, directly consuming resources.
    *   **Example:** A malicious actor manipulates the data source of the `RecyclerView` (e.g., through a compromised backend or by exploiting an input vulnerability) to rapidly add and remove hundreds of items in quick succession. This forces `recyclerview-animators` to trigger numerous resource-intensive animations concurrently.
    *   **Impact:** Application freezes, becomes unresponsive, potential for crashes due to excessive CPU and memory usage, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust rate limiting on actions that modify the `RecyclerView`'s data, preventing rapid and uncontrolled updates.
        *   Employ efficient data diffing algorithms to minimize the number of item changes that trigger animations.
        *   Consider implementing a "batch update" mechanism for large datasets to reduce the frequency of individual item animations.
        *   Monitor resource usage and implement safeguards or circuit breakers if animation load exceeds predefined thresholds.
