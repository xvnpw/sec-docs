# Threat Model Analysis for wasabeef/recyclerview-animators

## Threat: [Animation Overload leading to Denial of Service (Client-Side)](./threats/animation_overload_leading_to_denial_of_service__client-side_.md)

**Description:** An attacker, potentially through a compromised part of the application or by manipulating data sources, could trigger an excessive number of animations simultaneously or in rapid succession *using the functionalities provided by the `recyclerview-animators` library*. This could overwhelm the device's resources (CPU, GPU, memory) due to the animation processing handled by the library.

**Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive, freezes, or crashes, effectively denying service to the legitimate user. This can lead to frustration, data loss (if the app crashes during an operation), and a negative user experience.

**Affected Component:**  All animator classes within the library (e.g., `SlideInUpAnimator`, `FadeInAnimator`, etc.) are directly affected as they are responsible for performing the animations initiated and managed by the library.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement rate limiting on actions that trigger animations, preventing a flood of animation requests that the `recyclerview-animators` library would process.
*   Carefully control the number of items being animated simultaneously when using the library, especially with large datasets.
*   Avoid triggering animations *via the library's mechanisms* based on untrusted or easily manipulable input without proper validation.
*   Monitor application performance and resource usage to detect potential animation overload issues stemming from the library's usage.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack - Compromised Library Distribution](./threats/supply_chain_attack_-_compromised_library_distribution.md)

**Description:** There's a theoretical risk that the `recyclerview-animators` library's distribution channel (e.g., Maven Central) could be compromised, and a malicious version of the library could be distributed. Developers unknowingly including this compromised version would introduce malicious code *provided by the altered library* into their applications.

**Impact:**  The impact could be severe, ranging from data theft and unauthorized access to complete control over the application and potentially the user's device, *as the malicious code within the compromised library would execute within the application's context*.

**Affected Component:** The entire `recyclerview-animators` library as a dependency, as the malicious code could be injected into any part of it.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Verify the integrity of the library when including it in your project (e.g., using checksums or verifying signatures) to ensure you are using the legitimate `recyclerview-animators` library.
*   Use reputable dependency management tools and repositories for fetching the library.
*   Be cautious of using unofficial or untrusted sources for the `recyclerview-animators` library.
*   Implement security scanning tools that can detect potentially malicious code within the dependencies, including `recyclerview-animators`.
*   Stay informed about any security incidents related to software supply chains affecting libraries like `recyclerview-animators`.
