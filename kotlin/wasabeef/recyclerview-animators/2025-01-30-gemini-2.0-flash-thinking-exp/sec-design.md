# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project provides a library of RecyclerView item animators for Android applications. The primary business goal for developers using this library is to enhance the user interface of their Android applications by adding visually appealing animations to RecyclerViews, improving user engagement and the overall user experience. This can lead to increased user satisfaction, better app store ratings, and potentially higher user retention.

The most important business risks associated with using this library are:
- Risk of introducing bugs or performance issues into applications due to library defects.
- Risk of security vulnerabilities within the library that could be exploited in applications using it.
- Risk of license incompatibility if the library's license is not compatible with the application's license.
- Risk of dependency on an external, potentially unmaintained, library.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Open source nature of the library allows for community review and scrutiny of the code. Source code is publicly available on GitHub.
- security control: Widespread use of the library in various Android applications implies a degree of implicit testing and bug discovery by the community.
- accepted risk: Dependency on a third-party library introduces a potential supply chain risk.
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in the library code might exist and could be exploited.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement dependency scanning tools in the application's build pipeline to identify known vulnerabilities in the library and its dependencies.
- security control: Conduct license compliance checks to ensure the library's license is compatible with the application's license.
- security control: Regularly update the library to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
- security control: Perform code review of the library integration and usage within the application to ensure proper and secure implementation.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not applicable. This library does not handle user authentication. Authentication is the responsibility of the applications using this library.
- Authorization: Not applicable. This library does not handle user authorization. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications using this library.
- Input validation: Input validation is relevant for the parameters passed to the library's animation classes. Applications using this library should ensure that any data used to configure animations is properly validated to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes.
- Cryptography: Not applicable. This library does not handle cryptographic operations. Cryptography is the responsibility of the applications using this library if needed.

    style F fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

Build Process Description:

1. Android Developer: Developers write and modify the code for the RecyclerView Animators Library.
2. Code Changes: Code modifications are made by developers.
3. Version Control System (e.g., Git): Code changes are committed and pushed to a version control system like Git, hosted on platforms like GitHub.
4. Build Server (e.g., GitHub Actions, Local Machine): A build server or the developer's local machine is used to automate the build process. For open-source projects like this, GitHub Actions is commonly used for CI/CD.
5. Build Process (Gradle): Gradle, the standard build tool for Android projects, is used to compile the code, run tests, and package the library into an AAR (Android Archive) file.
6. Build Artifacts (AAR): The output of the build process is the AAR file, which contains the compiled library.
7. Maven Central / JCenter (Publish): The AAR file is published to a package repository like Maven Central or JCenter, making it available for Android developers to include in their projects.

Security Controls in Build Process:

- security control: Version Control System (Git): Tracks code changes, enabling audit trails and rollback capabilities. Helps in identifying the source of changes and potential security issues.
- security control: Build Automation (Gradle, GitHub Actions): Automates the build process, ensuring consistency and reducing manual errors. Allows for integration of security checks into the build pipeline.
- security control: Dependency Management (Gradle): Gradle manages project dependencies, but dependency scanning is a recommended additional security control to identify vulnerable dependencies.
- security control: Code Review: While not explicitly in the diagram, code review before merging changes into the main branch is a crucial security control to catch potential vulnerabilities and code quality issues.
- security control: Signing of Artifacts: Publishing to Maven Central/JCenter usually involves signing the artifacts to ensure integrity and authenticity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:
- Secure and reliable development of Android applications that utilize third-party libraries to enhance user interface and user experience.
- Maintaining the integrity and security of Android applications that depend on external libraries.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Android application code: Sensitive as it contains the application's logic and potentially business logic. Vulnerabilities in the library could indirectly expose application code to risks.
- User data within applications using the library: Indirectly relevant. If the library introduces vulnerabilities, it could potentially compromise the security of applications and the user data they handle. Sensitivity depends on the type of data the application processes (personal data, financial data, etc.).
