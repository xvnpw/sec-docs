# Threat Model Analysis for wasabeef/recyclerview-animators

## Threat: [Local Denial of Service (DoS) via Animation Overload (Misuse Scenario)](./threats/local_denial_of_service__dos__via_animation_overload__misuse_scenario_.md)

- **Description:** While not a vulnerability in the library code itself, developers *using* `recyclerview-animators` could unintentionally (or maliciously in a contrived scenario) create a situation where excessive or highly complex animations are triggered. This could be achieved by animating a very large number of items simultaneously, using extremely resource-intensive animations, or by continuously triggering animations in a loop. An attacker, if they could control data or actions that trigger these animations, could potentially exploit this to cause a local DoS.
    - **Impact:** The application becomes completely unresponsive or crashes. The device itself might become sluggish or unresponsive, potentially impacting other applications. Users are unable to use the application and may need to force-quit or restart their device. In extreme cases, repeated DoS could lead to data corruption or device instability.
    - **Affected Component:** `RecyclerView` integration, animation configuration, animation triggering logic within the application code, specifically how animations are set up and controlled when using `recyclerview-animators`.
    - **Risk Severity:** High (in extreme misuse scenarios, though generally Medium in typical usage if not carefully managed)
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Resource Management and Monitoring:** Developers must actively monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, GPU) when using animations, especially during development and testing. Implement safeguards to prevent animation overload.
        - **Animation Complexity Limits:**  Avoid using overly complex or resource-intensive animations, especially for large datasets. Choose animations that are performant and optimized for mobile devices.
        - **Input Validation and Rate Limiting (Indirect):** If animation triggers are based on external data or user input, implement validation and rate limiting to prevent malicious or accidental triggering of excessive animations.  This is more about application-level security design.
        - **Thorough Performance Testing:** Rigorously test animations on a range of devices, including low-end devices, under various load conditions to identify and address potential performance bottlenecks and DoS risks.
        - **Graceful Degradation and Error Handling:** Implement mechanisms to detect performance issues related to animations and gracefully degrade the animation experience or disable animations altogether under resource constraints to prevent a full DoS.
