### High and Critical Ktor-Specific Threats

This list contains high and critical severity threats that directly involve Ktor components.

*   **Threat:** Parameter Injection via Path Variables
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates path variables in a URL to inject malicious commands or data that are then processed by the application without proper sanitization. This could lead to command injection if the path variable is used in system calls or data manipulation if used in database queries.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data manipulation, privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected Ktor Component:** `ktor-server-core` - Routing DSL and Parameter Extraction.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all extracted path parameters.
        *   Avoid directly using path parameters in system calls or constructing dynamic commands.
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases.

*   **Threat:** Deserialization of Untrusted Data Leading to Remote Code Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends malicious serialized data (e.g., JSON, XML) to an endpoint that uses Ktor's content negotiation to deserialize it. Vulnerabilities in the underlying serialization libraries (like Jackson or kotlinx.serialization) *as used by Ktor's content negotiation* can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete compromise of the server.
    *   **Affected Ktor Component:** `ktor-server-content-negotiation` and underlying serialization libraries configured (e.g., `ktor-serialization-jackson`, `ktor-serialization-kotlinx-json`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep serialization libraries updated with the latest security patches.
        *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources if possible.
        *   Implement input validation on deserialized data *before and after deserialization*.
        *   Consider using safer serialization formats or sandboxing deserialization processes.

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Ktor's HttpClient
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the application into making requests to internal or external resources that the attacker controls. This is achieved by providing a malicious URL as input to a part of the application that uses Ktor's `HttpClient` to make outbound requests.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, port scanning of internal networks, potential compromise of other systems, exfiltration of sensitive data.
    *   **Affected Ktor Component:** `ktor-client-core` and specific client engines used (e.g., `ktor-client-cio`, `ktor-client-apache`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of URLs before using them with `HttpClient`.
        *   Use allow-lists for allowed destination hosts.
        *   Disable or restrict redirects if not strictly necessary.
        *   Consider using a dedicated proxy for outbound requests.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Ktor Plugins
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits security vulnerabilities present in third-party Ktor plugins that are integrated into the application. These vulnerabilities could range from cross-site scripting (XSS) to remote code execution, depending on the nature of the flaw in the plugin.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Ktor Component:** Any third-party plugin integrated into the Ktor application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the plugin and vulnerability. Can be Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully evaluate the security of third-party plugins before using them.
        *   Keep all plugins updated to the latest versions.
        *   Monitor for security advisories related to the plugins used.
        *   Consider the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to plugins.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data
    *   **Description:** Sensitive configuration data, such as API keys, database credentials, or secrets, is exposed due to insecure storage or handling. This could occur if configuration files are not properly protected or if sensitive information is hardcoded in the application. While not strictly a Ktor *vulnerability*, Ktor applications rely on configuration, and its mishandling can have severe consequences.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, compromise of other systems.
    *   **Affected Ktor Component:** Application configuration loading mechanisms, potentially involving external libraries or custom code *used within a Ktor application*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store sensitive configuration data securely using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions.
        *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in the application code.
        *   Ensure configuration files are not accessible from the web.
        *   Use appropriate file permissions to protect configuration files.
