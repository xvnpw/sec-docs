Ktor Application Threat Model: High-Risk Sub-Tree

Attacker's Goal: Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Ktor application by exploiting vulnerabilities within the Ktor framework itself (focusing on high-risk areas).

High-Risk Sub-Tree:

Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

* **High-Risk Path: Exploit Insecure Deserialization of Route Parameters**
    * **Critical Node: Exploit Insecure Deserialization of Route Parameters (Ktor Content Negotiation)**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft malicious input within route parameters that, when deserialized by Ktor's content negotiation mechanism, leads to the execution of arbitrary code on the server.
        * **Why High-Risk:** This allows for direct Remote Code Execution (RCE), granting the attacker complete control over the application and the server. The likelihood is medium due to potential developer errors, and the impact is critically high.

* **High-Risk Path: Exploit Serialization/Deserialization Issues**
    * **Critical Node: Insecure Deserialization**
        * **Attack Vector:** The application deserializes untrusted data without proper validation, allowing attackers to inject malicious objects.
        * **Critical Node: Vulnerable Deserialization Library (Jackson, Gson, etc.) leading to RCE**
            * **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in the underlying serialization libraries used by Ktor (like Jackson or Gson) by providing specially crafted payloads that trigger remote code execution during deserialization.
        * **Why High-Risk:** Insecure deserialization is a well-known and potent vulnerability. Exploiting it can lead to RCE, making it a critical threat. The likelihood is medium due to the prevalence of these vulnerabilities, and the impact is extremely high.

* **High-Risk Path: Exploit HTTP Client Vulnerabilities (If Application Uses Ktor Client)**
    * **Critical Node: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate user-controlled input that is used to construct URLs for the Ktor HTTP client. This allows them to force the application to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources.
        * **Critical Node: Force Application to Make Requests to Internal/External Resources**
            * **Attack Vector:** By controlling the destination of the application's outbound requests, attackers can potentially access internal services, leak sensitive information, or even pivot to further attacks within the internal network.
        * **Why High-Risk:** SSRF can have a significant impact, allowing attackers to bypass firewall restrictions and access internal resources. The likelihood is medium if developers don't implement proper URL validation, and the impact can be very high depending on the internal network and accessible resources.

* **High-Risk Path: Exploit Deployment-Related Vulnerabilities (Specific to Ktor Deployment)**
    * **Critical Node: Exposure of Sensitive Endpoints**
        * **Attack Vector:** Sensitive endpoints, such as actuator or management endpoints, are exposed without proper authentication or authorization.
        * **Critical Node: Unprotected Actuator/Management Endpoints (If Exposed)**
            * **Attack Vector:** Attackers can directly access these unprotected endpoints, gaining access to internal application information, metrics, and potentially even control over the application's functionality.
        * **Critical Node: Access Internal Application Information or Control Functionality**
            * **Attack Vector:** Successful exploitation of unprotected management endpoints can grant attackers full control over the application, allowing them to view sensitive data, modify configurations, or even shut down the application.
        * **Why High-Risk:** Exposing sensitive endpoints is a common deployment error with severe consequences. The likelihood is medium due to potential misconfigurations, and the impact is critically high as it can lead to complete application compromise.
