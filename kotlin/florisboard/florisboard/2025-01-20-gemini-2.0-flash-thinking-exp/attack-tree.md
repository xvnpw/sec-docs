## Attack Tree Path: [Keylogging Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/keylogging_sensitive_data.md)

*   Attack Vector: A compromised or malicious FlorisBoard captures all keystrokes entered by the user within the application. If the application displays sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or personal data, this information is recorded. The captured keystrokes are then transmitted to the attacker, allowing them to steal credentials or sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Input Injection leading to Command Injection](./attack_tree_paths/input_injection_leading_to_command_injection.md)

*   Attack Vector: An attacker crafts malicious input containing special characters or escape sequences that are not properly handled by FlorisBoard. This malicious input is passed to the application. If the application fails to sanitize or validate this input before processing it (e.g., using it in system commands), it can lead to command injection. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the application's underlying system, potentially gaining full control.

## Attack Tree Path: [MitM Attack leading to Malicious Data/Command Injection](./attack_tree_paths/mitm_attack_leading_to_malicious_datacommand_injection.md)

*   Attack Vector: FlorisBoard communicates with external servers (e.g., for updates or suggestions). If this communication is not secured using HTTPS and certificate pinning, an attacker can perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack. This allows them to intercept the communication and modify the data being exchanged. The attacker can inject malicious data or commands into the communication stream, which FlorisBoard or the application might then process, leading to compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Update Injection](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_update_injection.md)

*   Attack Vector: FlorisBoard has an update mechanism to receive new versions or data. If the attacker can compromise the update server or the communication channel used for updates, they can inject a malicious update. This update could contain malware, backdoors, or code designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the application or the device. Once installed, the malicious update can compromise the application's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Permission Abuse leading to Data Exfiltration](./attack_tree_paths/permission_abuse_leading_to_data_exfiltration.md)

*   Attack Vector: FlorisBoard requests and is granted excessive permissions, such as network access. If FlorisBoard is compromised, the attacker can leverage these permissions to exfiltrate sensitive data from the application. This could involve sending data to a remote server controlled by the attacker, bypassing the application's intended security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Integration leading to Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_integration_leading_to_exploitation.md)

*   Attack Vector: The application developers make the mistake of trusting data received from FlorisBoard without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker can manipulate FlorisBoard to send malicious data. Because the application trusts this data, it processes it without question, leading to unintended actions, data corruption, or other security vulnerabilities that the attacker can exploit.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via FlorisBoard](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_florisboard.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the starting point of all attack paths. Securing the application against compromise via FlorisBoard is the overarching objective.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This node represents a broad category of attacks that exploit how FlorisBoard and the application process user input. It's critical because input handling is a fundamental aspect of the interaction and a common source of vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [FlorisBoard captures keystrokes](./attack_tree_paths/florisboard_captures_keystrokes.md)

*   This is the foundational step for the keylogging attack. If keystroke capture can be prevented or the captured data secured, the keylogging attack path is effectively blocked.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application processes injected input without proper sanitization](./attack_tree_paths/application_processes_injected_input_without_proper_sanitization.md)

*   This node highlights a critical security flaw in the application. If the application properly sanitizes input, many injection-based attacks can be prevented.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Communication Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_communication_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This node represents a critical attack surface related to how FlorisBoard communicates with external entities. Securing this communication is vital to prevent MitM and malicious update attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [FlorisBoard has an update mechanism](./attack_tree_paths/florisboard_has_an_update_mechanism.md)

*   While not a vulnerability itself, the presence of an update mechanism is a critical point of potential attack if not secured properly. It's a gateway for injecting malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Integration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_integration_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This node emphasizes the importance of secure integration practices. Flaws in how the application interacts with FlorisBoard can create significant vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application interacts with FlorisBoard in an insecure manner](./attack_tree_paths/application_interacts_with_florisboard_in_an_insecure_manner.md)

*   This node pinpoints the root cause of integration-related vulnerabilities. Addressing insecure interaction patterns is crucial for preventing exploitation.
