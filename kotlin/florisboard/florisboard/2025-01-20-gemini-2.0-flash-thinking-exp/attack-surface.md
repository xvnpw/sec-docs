# Attack Surface Analysis for florisboard/florisboard

## Attack Surface: [Keylogging and Sensitive Data Capture](./attack_surfaces/keylogging_and_sensitive_data_capture.md)

**Description:** The keyboard captures all text input by the user, including potentially sensitive information like passwords, credit card details, and personal messages.
*   **How FlorisBoard Contributes:** FlorisBoard is the direct mechanism through which this input is captured. A compromised or malicious version of FlorisBoard could log this data without the user's knowledge or consent.
*   **Example:** A user enters their banking password using FlorisBoard. A compromised version of the keyboard logs this password and sends it to a remote server controlled by an attacker.
*   **Impact:**  Loss of sensitive credentials, financial loss, identity theft, privacy violation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement secure input fields that might restrict keyboard access for highly sensitive data (though this can impact usability).
        *   Utilize OS-level security features to protect sensitive data entry.
        *   Regularly update the integrated FlorisBoard library to the latest stable version with security patches.
        *   Consider code reviews and security audits of the integrated FlorisBoard component.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Only install FlorisBoard from trusted sources like the official GitHub repository or reputable app stores.
        *   Monitor the permissions granted to FlorisBoard and revoke unnecessary permissions.
        *   Keep the FlorisBoard application updated to the latest version.
        *   Use strong device security measures (e.g., strong PIN/password, biometric authentication).

## Attack Surface: [Clipboard Data Access](./attack_surfaces/clipboard_data_access.md)

**Description:** FlorisBoard likely has access to the system clipboard for features like copy-paste. This allows it to read and potentially modify data that the user has copied.
*   **How FlorisBoard Contributes:** FlorisBoard's functionality inherently requires access to the clipboard to provide copy-paste features. A compromised keyboard could silently monitor or modify clipboard content.
*   **Example:** A user copies a sensitive API key to their clipboard. A malicious FlorisBoard reads this key and sends it to an attacker. Alternatively, it could subtly replace the copied data with a malicious link or different information.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data, potential for phishing attacks or data manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Be mindful of how sensitive data is handled within the application and minimize reliance on the clipboard for transferring sensitive information.
        *   Educate users about the potential risks of copying sensitive data.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Be cautious about copying sensitive information.
        *   Avoid copying and pasting sensitive data when using untrusted or potentially compromised keyboards.
        *   Regularly clear the clipboard.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Granted Permissions](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_granted_permissions.md)

**Description:** FlorisBoard requires certain permissions to function (e.g., internet access for language packs, storage for user dictionaries). A compromised keyboard could abuse these permissions for malicious purposes.
*   **How FlorisBoard Contributes:** By requiring and being granted these permissions, FlorisBoard creates a pathway for potential abuse if it's compromised.
*   **Example:** A compromised FlorisBoard with internet access could exfiltrate logged keystrokes or other data to a remote server. A compromised FlorisBoard with storage access could read or modify files on the device.
*   **Impact:**  Data breaches, unauthorized network activity, potential for further malware installation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when requesting permissions for FlorisBoard. Only request necessary permissions.
        *   Clearly communicate to users why specific permissions are required.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Carefully review the permissions requested by FlorisBoard before installation.
        *   Revoke unnecessary permissions if the Android OS allows it without breaking core functionality.
        *   Monitor network activity and storage access if suspicious behavior is suspected.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Attacks](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_attacks.md)

**Description:** If the FlorisBoard repository or its build process is compromised, malicious code could be injected into the keyboard, affecting all applications using it.
*   **How FlorisBoard Contributes:**  As a direct dependency, a compromised FlorisBoard directly introduces malicious code into the application.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the FlorisBoard GitHub repository and injects code that logs keystrokes. Developers who integrate this compromised version of FlorisBoard unknowingly include the malicious code in their applications.
*   **Impact:**  Widespread compromise of applications using the affected FlorisBoard version, data breaches, malware distribution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Verify the integrity of the FlorisBoard library by checking checksums or using other verification methods.
        *   Be cautious about using development or unstable versions of FlorisBoard. Stick to stable releases.
        *   Monitor the FlorisBoard project for any signs of compromise or suspicious activity.
    *   **Users:** (Limited direct control)
        *   Prefer using applications that source their dependencies from reputable and well-maintained sources.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Update Process](./attack_surfaces/insecure_update_process.md)

**Description:** If FlorisBoard's update mechanism is not secure (e.g., lacking proper signature verification or using insecure protocols), attackers could potentially push malicious updates to users.
*   **How FlorisBoard Contributes:**  An insecure update mechanism provides a direct channel for attackers to distribute compromised versions of the keyboard.
*   **Example:** An attacker intercepts the update process and pushes a malicious version of FlorisBoard to users, which then logs their data.
*   **Impact:**  Installation of malware, data breaches, compromise of user devices.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** (Indirectly)
        *   Encourage the FlorisBoard development team to implement secure update mechanisms, including code signing and HTTPS for updates.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Ensure that the "Install from Unknown Sources" setting is disabled on their devices to prevent the installation of unauthorized applications.
        *   Only update FlorisBoard through trusted sources like the official app store or GitHub releases.
