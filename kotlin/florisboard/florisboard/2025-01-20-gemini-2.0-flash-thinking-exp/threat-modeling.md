# Threat Model Analysis for florisboard/florisboard

## Threat: [Malicious Keystroke Logging](./threats/malicious_keystroke_logging.md)

*   **Description:** A modified or fake version of FlorisBoard, if installed by the user, could log all keystrokes entered. This happens within the FlorisBoard application itself. The attacker, controlling the malicious FlorisBoard, collects this data.
    *   **Impact:** Severe privacy breach, financial loss due to stolen credentials, identity theft, compromise of application accounts.
    *   **Affected Component:** Input handling module, event listeners, potentially data storage within the malicious FlorisBoard variant.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **User:** Only download FlorisBoard from the official GitHub repository or trusted app stores (e.g., F-Droid). Verify the developer signature if possible. Regularly check for updates from official sources. Be wary of unofficial builds or APKs.

## Threat: [Clipboard Data Theft](./threats/clipboard_data_theft.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious FlorisBoard variant could monitor and record data copied to the clipboard. This action is performed by the malicious keyboard application. Attackers exploit this to steal sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Potential exposure of sensitive data, including credentials and personal information. Could lead to account compromise or financial loss.
    *   **Affected Component:** Clipboard access module, event listeners related to clipboard operations, potentially network communication modules in a malicious variant.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **User:** Be mindful of what information is copied to the clipboard. Avoid copying highly sensitive information unless absolutely necessary. Regularly clear the clipboard.

## Threat: [Input Field Manipulation](./threats/input_field_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** A compromised FlorisBoard could subtly alter the text being entered into input fields. This manipulation occurs within the keyboard application before the text is passed to the receiving application. An attacker might use this to inject malicious commands or change transaction details.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption within the application, unintended actions performed on behalf of the user, potential financial loss or security breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** Input processing module, text composition logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **User:** Carefully review the text entered before submitting forms or confirming actions. Be aware of any unexpected changes in the input field.

## Threat: [Abuse of Accessibility Features](./threats/abuse_of_accessibility_features.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious version of FlorisBoard could abuse accessibility services permissions granted to it by the user. This allows the malicious keyboard to gain broader access to the device and application data.
    *   **Impact:** Significant privacy breach, potential for unauthorized actions within the application, data exfiltration, and device compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Accessibility service integration, potentially core modules if accessibility permissions are misused to bypass security measures.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **User:** Grant accessibility permissions to FlorisBoard only if absolutely necessary and understand the implications. Monitor for unusual behavior after granting such permissions.

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration via Network Access (Malicious Variant)](./threats/data_exfiltration_via_network_access__malicious_variant_.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious or compromised version of FlorisBoard with network access could transmit collected data (keystrokes, clipboard content, etc.) to an attacker's server. This network communication is initiated and controlled by the malicious keyboard application.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, privacy breach, potential for identity theft or financial loss.
    *   **Affected Component:** Network communication modules (if present in a malicious variant), potentially data storage modules used to stage data before exfiltration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **User:** Monitor network activity on their device. Use network monitoring tools to identify unusual outbound connections. Be cautious about granting network permissions to keyboard applications from untrusted sources.

## Threat: [Compromised Update Mechanism](./threats/compromised_update_mechanism.md)

*   **Description:** If the update mechanism for FlorisBoard is compromised, attackers could push malicious updates to users. This involves the official or a compromised update process of FlorisBoard itself.
    *   **Impact:** Installation of malware, device compromise, data theft, loss of control over the device.
    *   **Affected Component:** Update mechanism, potentially the signing process for updates.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **User:** Ensure automatic updates are enabled (if desired) and that updates are sourced from trusted locations (e.g., official app stores). Verify the source of updates if manually installing.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** FlorisBoard relies on various third-party libraries. If these libraries contain security vulnerabilities, attackers could exploit them to compromise FlorisBoard. The vulnerability resides within a component used by FlorisBoard.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for various attacks depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** The specific third-party library with the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical to High).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer (FlorisBoard Team):** Regularly update dependencies to their latest secure versions. Conduct security audits and vulnerability scanning of dependencies. Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track dependencies.
