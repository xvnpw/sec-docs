## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Application processes injected input without proper sanitization

This document provides a deep analysis of the attack tree path "Application processes injected input without proper sanitization" within the context of the FlorisBoard application (https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard).

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the security risks associated with the FlorisBoard application processing injected input without proper sanitization. This includes:

*   Identifying potential attack vectors that exploit this vulnerability.
*   Analyzing the potential impact of successful exploitation.
*   Understanding the underlying causes and contributing factors.
*   Proposing mitigation strategies to address this security flaw.
*   Raising awareness among the development team about the importance of input sanitization.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack tree path: "Application processes injected input without proper sanitization."  The scope includes:

*   **Identifying potential input points:**  Where within FlorisBoard can external data be introduced?
*   **Analyzing potential injection types:** What kinds of malicious input could be injected?
*   **Evaluating potential impact:** What are the consequences of successful injection attacks?
*   **Considering the FlorisBoard architecture:** How does the application handle and process user input?
*   **Focusing on the absence of sanitization:**  What happens when input is not properly cleaned or validated?

This analysis does **not** include:

*   A full penetration test of the FlorisBoard application.
*   Analysis of other attack tree paths.
*   Detailed code review of the entire FlorisBoard codebase.
*   Specific implementation details of mitigation strategies (those will be high-level recommendations).

### 3. Methodology

The methodology for this deep analysis involves the following steps:

1. **Understanding the Attack Tree Node:**  Thoroughly analyze the description of the attack tree path to grasp the core security issue.
2. **Identifying Potential Input Vectors in FlorisBoard:**  Based on the application's functionality as a keyboard, identify potential areas where user input is processed. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   Text entered by the user.
    *   Custom dictionary entries.
    *   User settings and preferences.
    *   Input from external sources (if any, like clipboard integration).
3. **Analyzing Potential Injection Types:**  Consider various injection attacks that could be launched if input is not sanitized. This includes:
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into the application's UI.
    *   **SQL Injection:** Injecting malicious SQL queries if the application interacts with a database (less likely for a keyboard, but possible for features like custom dictionaries).
    *   **Command Injection:** Injecting operating system commands if the application executes external processes based on user input (unlikely but needs consideration).
    *   **Path Traversal:** Injecting paths to access unauthorized files or directories.
    *   **Code Injection:** Injecting and executing arbitrary code within the application's context.
4. **Evaluating Potential Impact:**  Assess the potential consequences of successful exploitation for each injection type. This includes:
    *   **Data Breach:**  Accessing sensitive user data (e.g., typed passwords, personal information).
    *   **Account Takeover:**  Gaining control of the user's application settings or potentially linked accounts.
    *   **Malware Distribution:**  Injecting scripts that redirect users to malicious websites or download malware.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:**  Gaining higher privileges within the application or the underlying system.
5. **Identifying Underlying Causes:**  Determine why the application might be vulnerable to this issue. This often stems from:
    *   Lack of input validation: Not checking if the input conforms to expected formats and constraints.
    *   Insufficient output encoding: Not properly escaping special characters before displaying user-provided data.
    *   Trusting user input: Assuming that all input is benign.
6. **Proposing Mitigation Strategies:**  Outline general security best practices to address the identified vulnerability.
7. **Documenting Findings:**  Compile the analysis into a clear and concise report.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Application processes injected input without proper sanitization

The attack tree path "Application processes injected input without proper sanitization" highlights a fundamental security weakness. Without proper sanitization, any data accepted by the FlorisBoard application from external sources becomes a potential entry point for malicious attacks.

**Potential Input Vectors in FlorisBoard:**

*   **Text Entered by the User:** This is the most obvious input vector. While the primary function is to input text, malicious users could try to inject special characters or escape sequences.
*   **Custom Dictionary Entries:** If FlorisBoard allows users to add custom words or phrases to a dictionary, this input needs careful sanitization. Malicious entries could contain scripts or commands.
*   **User Settings and Preferences:**  Settings related to themes, layouts, or other customizations might accept string values. If these are not sanitized, they could be exploited.
*   **Clipboard Integration (If Applicable):** If FlorisBoard interacts with the system clipboard, data pasted from the clipboard could be malicious.
*   **External Data Sources (Less Likely but Possible):**  If FlorisBoard integrates with any external services or data sources, the data received from these sources needs to be treated with caution.
