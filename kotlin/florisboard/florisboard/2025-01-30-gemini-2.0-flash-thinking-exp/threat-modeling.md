# Threat Model Analysis for florisboard/florisboard

## Threat: [Keystroke Logging and Data Exfiltration](./threats/keystroke_logging_and_data_exfiltration.md)

- **Description:** A malicious actor compromises Florisboard, either by distributing a modified version or exploiting vulnerabilities to inject malicious code. This allows the attacker to record all keystrokes entered by the user, capturing sensitive information like passwords, credit card details, and personal messages. The logged data is then exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled server, often through network requests initiated by the compromised keyboard.
- **Impact:** Data breach, severe privacy violation, identity theft, significant financial loss, and reputational damage for users and applications relying on Florisboard.
- **Florisboard Component Affected:** Input handling modules, potentially network communication modules (if maliciously added), and data storage mechanisms used for logging keystrokes. Core keyboard input processing logic is fundamentally affected.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Verify Florisboard Source:**  Download and use Florisboard only from official and verified sources like the GitHub repository. Building from source provides the highest assurance of integrity.
    - **Regular Code Audits:** Conduct thorough security audits of the Florisboard codebase, especially before integrating it into sensitive applications. Focus on input handling, data storage, and network communication (if any).
    - **Permissions Review:** Carefully examine Florisboard's requested permissions during installation. Ensure they are minimal and strictly necessary for keyboard functionality. Monitor network activity originating from the keyboard application.
    - **Input Sanitization (Application Side):** While Florisboard is the input source, applications should still implement robust input sanitization and validation to minimize the potential impact of malicious input, even if originating from a compromised keyboard.
    - **Regular Updates:** Keep Florisboard updated to the latest version. Apply security patches promptly to address known vulnerabilities.
    - **User Awareness:** Educate users about the inherent risks of using third-party keyboards and emphasize the importance of using official and trusted sources.

## Threat: [Input Injection Attacks](./threats/input_injection_attacks.md)

- **Description:** A compromised Florisboard is used to inject malicious input into other applications running on the user's device. This could involve sending crafted commands to the operating system or injecting malicious scripts into web views within other applications. The attacker manipulates the input events generated by the keyboard, potentially bypassing input validation mechanisms in target applications.
- **Impact:** Compromise of other applications, manipulation of data within other applications, unauthorized actions performed in other applications on behalf of the user, potentially leading to privilege escalation or cross-application attacks.
- **Florisboard Component Affected:** Input processing and dispatching modules responsible for sending input events to the operating system and other applications. Inter-process communication mechanisms used for input delivery are key components.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Robust Input Validation (Application Side - Crucial):** Applications must implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for *all* input sources, including keyboard input. Never assume input from any source is inherently safe.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege (Application Side):** Design applications to operate with the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the potential damage from successful input injection attacks.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP) (For web-based applications):** Implement and enforce a strict Content Security Policy to mitigate the risk of injected scripts executing in web views.
    - **Regular Updates:** Keep Florisboard updated to patch any vulnerabilities that could be exploited for input injection.
    - **Code Audits:** Focus security audits on input handling and output dispatching modules within Florisboard to identify potential injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Florisboard Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_florisboard_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** Attackers discover and exploit security vulnerabilities directly within Florisboard's code. These vulnerabilities could be buffer overflows, injection flaws, logic errors, or other software weaknesses. Successful exploitation can allow attackers to gain control of the Florisboard process, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or further compromise of the device and applications using Florisboard.
- **Impact:** Keyboard compromise, instability or denial of service of the keyboard, potential for further system compromise if vulnerabilities allow privilege escalation, data breach if vulnerabilities grant access to sensitive data within the keyboard's process or system resources.
- **Florisboard Component Affected:** Any component of Florisboard containing vulnerabilities. This could be in core input processing, language models, UI rendering, or any other module depending on the specific vulnerability.
- **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature and exploitability of the vulnerability)
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Regular Updates (Crucial):**  Apply security updates for Florisboard immediately upon release. Monitor security advisories and patch announcements from the Florisboard project.
    - **Proactive Vulnerability Scanning:** Utilize static and dynamic analysis tools to regularly scan Florisboard's codebase for potential vulnerabilities. Integrate security testing into the development lifecycle.
    - **Penetration Testing:** Conduct periodic penetration testing by security experts to identify exploitable vulnerabilities in a realistic usage scenario.
    - **Security-Focused Code Audits:** Prioritize regular security code audits by experienced security professionals. Focus on identifying and remediating potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
    - **Bug Bounty Program (For Florisboard project):** If feasible for the Florisboard project, consider implementing a bug bounty program to incentivize security researchers to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Lack of Updates and Unpatched Vulnerabilities](./threats/lack_of_updates_and_unpatched_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** The Florisboard project becomes inactive or slow to release security updates. This results in known security vulnerabilities within Florisboard remaining unpatched for extended periods. Attackers can then exploit these publicly known vulnerabilities to compromise applications using outdated and vulnerable versions of Florisboard.
- **Impact:** Keyboard compromise, application compromise, data breach, denial of service, exploitation of easily accessible and publicly documented vulnerabilities. Increased risk over time as vulnerabilities become more widely known and exploit tools are developed.
- **Florisboard Component Affected:** The entire Florisboard application becomes increasingly vulnerable as it remains unpatched. All components are potentially affected by unaddressed vulnerabilities.
- **Risk Severity:** High (over time, as vulnerabilities are discovered and remain unpatched)
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Regular Updates (Crucial):**  Maintain Florisboard at the latest stable version. Establish a process for consistently monitoring for and applying updates.
    - **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Actively monitor security advisories, vulnerability databases, and security mailing lists for reports of vulnerabilities affecting Florisboard and its dependencies.
    - **Community Engagement (For Florisboard project users):** If the official project becomes inactive, consider engaging with the Florisboard community to encourage updates or explore community-maintained forks with active security patching.
    - **Consider Alternatives (If updates cease):** If the Florisboard project becomes unmaintained and updates cease, seriously consider migrating to a more actively maintained and secure keyboard alternative to mitigate the growing risk of unpatched vulnerabilities.
