# Attack Surface Analysis for florisboard/florisboard

## Attack Surface: [Software Supply Chain Vulnerabilities (Third-Party Libraries)](./attack_surfaces/software_supply_chain_vulnerabilities__third-party_libraries_.md)

Description: Risks stemming from vulnerabilities within third-party libraries and dependencies incorporated into Florisboard. Exploitable flaws in these external components can indirectly compromise Florisboard's security.
*   **Florisboard Contribution:** Florisboard, like most software projects, relies on external libraries for various functionalities.  Introducing vulnerable dependencies directly increases Florisboard's attack surface.
*   **Example:** Florisboard includes an outdated version of a library used for image processing that contains a known remote code execution vulnerability. If Florisboard utilizes this library in a susceptible manner, attackers could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within Florisboard's process.
*   **Impact:** Potential for Remote Code Execution within Florisboard's process, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access to device resources accessible to Florisboard, and potentially complete compromise of the keyboard application's functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (Exploitation of dependency vulnerabilities can lead to significant security breaches, including RCE).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement a robust Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to meticulously track all third-party dependencies used in Florisboard.
        *   Integrate automated dependency scanning tools into the development pipeline to continuously monitor for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Establish a proactive dependency update policy, prioritizing timely updates to address security vulnerabilities in libraries.
        *   Conduct regular security audits focusing on dependency management and potential vulnerabilities introduced through external libraries.
        *   Favor well-maintained and reputable libraries with a strong security track record.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Update Mechanism (Future Consideration - High Potential Risk)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_update_mechanism__future_consideration_-_high_potential_risk_.md)

Description:  Potential critical vulnerabilities arising from a poorly implemented application update mechanism, should Florisboard choose to implement a direct update process outside of established app stores in the future.
*   **Florisboard Contribution:** If Florisboard developers decide to implement a custom update mechanism (e.g., downloading updates directly from a Florisboard server), insecure design and implementation will directly introduce a critical attack surface.
*   **Example:** Florisboard's update process fetches update packages over unencrypted HTTP and lacks proper digital signature verification. An attacker performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack on the network can inject a malicious update package disguised as a legitimate Florisboard update. Upon installation, this malicious update compromises the user's Florisboard application and potentially the device.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Remote Code Execution, complete compromise of the Florisboard application, potential for persistent malware installation, and full device compromise depending on the permissions and capabilities gained by the malicious update.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (Insecure update mechanisms are a prime target for attackers and can lead to widespread and severe compromise).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Strongly recommend leveraging established and secure application update mechanisms provided by app stores (like Google Play Store or F-Droid) instead of implementing a custom solution.**
        *   If a custom update mechanism is absolutely necessary:
            *   Enforce HTTPS for all update communication to prevent eavesdropping and MitM attacks.
            *   Implement robust code signing using strong cryptographic keys and rigorous signature verification for all update packages to guarantee authenticity and integrity.
            *   Conduct thorough security reviews and penetration testing of the update mechanism before deployment.
            *   Follow industry best practices for secure software updates.
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Primarily rely on official app stores (like Google Play Store or F-Droid) for Florisboard updates.** These stores provide a significantly more secure update distribution channel.
        *   Exercise extreme caution when considering sideloading updates from unofficial or untrusted sources. Verify the source's legitimacy and the integrity of the update package if sideloading is unavoidable.
