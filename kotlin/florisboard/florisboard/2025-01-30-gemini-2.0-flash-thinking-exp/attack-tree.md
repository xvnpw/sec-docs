## Attack Tree Path: [Attack Goal: Exfiltrate Sensitive Data from Application via FlorisBoard [CRITICAL NODE: PRIMARY GOAL]](./attack_tree_paths/attack_goal_exfiltrate_sensitive_data_from_application_via_florisboard__critical_node_primary_goal_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the attacker's ultimate objective. It drives all subsequent attack steps.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   The attacker aims to steal confidential information from the application.
    *   This data is assumed to be entered by the user via the FlorisBoard keyboard.
    *   Success means the attacker gains access to this sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit FlorisBoard Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE: ROOT CAUSE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_florisboard_vulnerabilities__critical_node_root_cause_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the overarching strategy. The attacker will target weaknesses within FlorisBoard itself to achieve their goal.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   The attacker focuses on vulnerabilities inherent in the FlorisBoard project.
    *   This could be malicious code injection, exploiting software flaws, or abusing intended features.
    *   Exploiting FlorisBoard is the chosen method to compromise the application's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Keylogging via Malicious FlorisBoard [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE: KEYLOGGING]](./attack_tree_paths/keylogging_via_malicious_florisboard__high_risk_path___critical_node_keylogging_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  This path involves distributing and using a modified version of FlorisBoard that secretly records user keystrokes.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Modified FlorisBoard with Keylogging Functionality [CRITICAL NODE: MALICIOUS KEYBOARD]:**
        *   The attacker creates a custom version of FlorisBoard.
        *   This modified version includes code to log all keystrokes entered by the user.
        *   The malicious keyboard is then distributed to potential victims.
    *   **FlorisBoard Granted Necessary Permissions (Input, Storage, Network) [CRITICAL NODE: PERMISSIONS]:**
        *   For keylogging to be effective, the malicious FlorisBoard needs specific permissions.
        *   *Input Permission:*  Essential to capture keystrokes.
        *   *Storage Permission:*  Allows storing the keystroke logs locally.
        *   *Network Permission:* Enables sending the logs to the attacker's server.
        *   Users often grant these permissions to keyboard applications without careful consideration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Permission Abuse [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE: PERMISSION ABUSE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_permission_abuse__high_risk_path___critical_node_permission_abuse_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on misusing permissions that FlorisBoard might legitimately request to access sensitive data.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Network Permission Abuse [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE: NETWORK ABUSE]:**
        *   **FlorisBoard Has Network Permission [CRITICAL NODE: NETWORK PERMISSION]:**
            *   FlorisBoard might request network permission for features like online dictionaries or cloud suggestions.
            *   A malicious or compromised FlorisBoard can abuse this permission.
        *   **Malicious FlorisBoard Exfiltrates Keystrokes/Data via Network [CRITICAL NODE: DATA EXFILTRATION]:**
            *   With network permission, a malicious FlorisBoard can directly transmit captured keystrokes or other data (like clipboard content) to an attacker-controlled server over the internet.
    *   **Clipboard Access Abuse [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE: CLIPBOARD ABUSE]:**
        *   **FlorisBoard Has Clipboard Access Permission [CRITICAL NODE: CLIPBOARD PERMISSION]:**
            *   Keyboards often request clipboard access for features like copy-paste suggestions.
            *   A malicious or compromised FlorisBoard can abuse this permission to monitor clipboard content.
        *   **FlorisBoard Monitors Clipboard for Sensitive Data [CRITICAL NODE: CLIPBOARD MONITORING]:**
            *   A malicious FlorisBoard can continuously monitor the system clipboard.
            *   If the user copies sensitive information (passwords, credit card details, etc.) to the clipboard, the keyboard can capture it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attack / Malicious FlorisBoard Distribution [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE: SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK]](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attack__malicious_florisboard_distribution__high_risk_path___critical_node_supply_chain_c631efd5.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path targets the distribution channels of FlorisBoard to inject malicious code into the software before it reaches users.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Compromised FlorisBoard Repository/Distribution Channel [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE: REPOSITORY COMPROMISE]:**
        *   **Attacker Compromises Official FlorisBoard GitHub/Release [CRITICAL NODE: GITHUB COMPROMISE]:**
            *   The attacker aims to gain unauthorized access to the official FlorisBoard GitHub repository or release infrastructure.
            *   If successful, they can inject malicious code directly into the legitimate source code or release binaries.
            *   This is a highly impactful attack as it compromises the trusted source.
    *   **Malicious Fork/Variant [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE: MALICIOUS FORK]:**
        *   The attacker creates a copy (fork) of the legitimate FlorisBoard project.
        *   They introduce malicious code (e.g., keylogger) into this fork.
        *   They then promote this malicious fork as if it were a legitimate or enhanced version of FlorisBoard, potentially tricking users into installing it instead of the official version.
