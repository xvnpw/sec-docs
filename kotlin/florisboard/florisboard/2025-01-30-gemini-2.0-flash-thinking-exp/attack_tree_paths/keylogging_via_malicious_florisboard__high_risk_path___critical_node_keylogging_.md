### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Keylogging via Malicious FlorisBoard

#### 4.1. Attack Vector: Distributing and Using a Modified FlorisBoard with Keylogging

The attack vector for this path is the distribution and subsequent use of a modified version of FlorisBoard that has been intentionally crafted to include keylogging functionality. This relies on tricking users into installing and using the malicious keyboard instead of the legitimate FlorisBoard application.

**Analysis:**

*   **Distribution is Key:** The success of this attack hinges on the attacker's ability to distribute the malicious FlorisBoard effectively.  This could be achieved through various methods:
    *   **Third-Party App Stores/Websites:**  Hosting the modified APK on unofficial app stores or websites that users might stumble upon or be directed to via phishing links.
    *   **Social Engineering/Phishing:**  Tricking users into downloading and installing the malicious APK through deceptive emails, messages, or social media posts, often impersonating legitimate sources or offering "enhanced" versions of FlorisBoard.
    *   **Pre-installation on compromised devices:** In more sophisticated scenarios, the malicious keyboard could be pre-installed on devices sold through compromised supply chains or via malware already present on the device.
*   **User Trust Exploitation:**  The attack leverages the trust users place in keyboard applications and the general practice of granting permissions to such apps for input and potentially storage. Users might be less suspicious of a keyboard app requesting these permissions compared to other types of applications.
*   **Open Source Nature (Paradoxically):** While FlorisBoard being open source is generally a security benefit, in this context, it also makes it easier for attackers to understand the codebase, modify it, and recompile a malicious version.

#### 4.2. Breakdown of Attack Path Nodes

##### 4.2.1. Modified FlorisBoard with Keylogging Functionality [CRITICAL NODE: MALICIOUS KEYBOARD]

*   **Description:** This node represents the core of the attack â€“ the creation and existence of a modified FlorisBoard application that includes keylogging capabilities.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Creating a Custom Version of FlorisBoard:**
        *   **Technical Feasibility:**  Highly feasible. FlorisBoard is open source, making the codebase readily available for modification. An attacker with Android development skills can easily clone the repository, set up a development environment, and modify the code.
        *   **Modification Process:** The attacker would need to:
            1.  Clone the FlorisBoard GitHub repository.
            2.  Study the codebase to identify suitable locations to inject keylogging code.  Likely candidates would be input handling classes or methods responsible for processing keystrokes.
            3.  Implement keylogging functionality. This would involve:
                *   Capturing keystroke events.
                *   Storing the captured keystrokes. This could be in memory initially, then written to a file or sent directly to a server.
                *   Potentially encoding or encrypting the logs to avoid easy detection.
                *   Implementing logic to periodically or event-triggeredly exfiltrate the logs.
            4.  Compile the modified FlorisBoard into an APK (Android Package Kit) file.
    *   **Including Code to Log Keystrokes:**
        *   **Technical Feasibility:**  Straightforward for a developer with Android experience. Android APIs provide access to input events, and standard programming techniques can be used for data storage and network communication.
        *   **Implementation Details:** Keylogging code could be implemented in various ways, from simple logging to more sophisticated techniques that capture context and timestamps. The attacker would need to decide:
            *   **What to log:** All keystrokes, specific input fields (e.g., passwords, credit card numbers), or specific applications.
            *   **How to store logs:** Locally on the device (requiring storage permission) or directly transmit them (requiring network permission).
            *   **When to transmit logs:** Periodically, on specific events, or when a network connection is available.
    *   **Distributing the Malicious Keyboard:** (Already discussed in Attack Vector section - 4.1)

##### 4.2.2. FlorisBoard Granted Necessary Permissions (Input, Storage, Network) [CRITICAL NODE: PERMISSIONS]

*   **Description:** This node highlights the crucial permissions required for the keylogging attack to be effective.  Without these permissions, the malicious keyboard would be severely limited in its ability to capture and exfiltrate data.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Input Permission (Essential):**
        *   **Necessity:** Absolutely essential. Without input permission, the keyboard cannot function as a keyboard at all, let alone capture keystrokes. Android's permission model requires explicit user consent for input method editors (IMEs) to function.
        *   **User Behavior:** Users *must* grant input permission for *any* keyboard app to work. This is a standard and expected permission request, making it less likely to raise suspicion.
    *   **Storage Permission (Highly Desirable):**
        *   **Necessity:** Not strictly essential for basic keylogging, but highly desirable for persistence and more robust data exfiltration. If logs are stored locally, they can be transmitted later even if network connectivity is intermittent.  It also allows for larger log storage before transmission.
        *   **User Behavior:**  While not always strictly necessary for keyboard apps, some keyboard apps *do* request storage permission for features like custom dictionaries, themes, or offline functionality.  Therefore, a user might grant this permission without excessive suspicion, especially if the malicious app mimics features that would justify storage access.
    *   **Network Permission (Crucial for Data Exfiltration):**
        *   **Necessity:** Crucial for the attacker to receive the captured keystrokes. Without network permission, the logs would remain on the victim's device, rendering the keylogging attack largely pointless unless the attacker has physical access to the device.
        *   **User Behavior:**  Keyboard apps *generally* do not require network permission.  Legitimate keyboard apps usually operate offline.  **Requesting network permission should be a significant red flag for users.** However, some users might grant this permission without fully understanding the implications, especially if the malicious app provides a deceptive justification (e.g., "for cloud sync of settings" or similar).  Less tech-savvy users might simply grant permissions without careful consideration.

#### 4.3. Risk Assessment

*   **Likelihood:**
    *   **Modified FlorisBoard Creation:** High. Technically very feasible due to open source nature and readily available Android development tools.
    *   **Distribution:** Medium to High.  Distribution through third-party channels and social engineering is a common attack vector.  Success depends on the attacker's skill in social engineering and reaching potential victims.
    *   **Permission Granting:** Medium. Input permission is guaranteed. Storage permission is plausible. Network permission is the most challenging to obtain without raising suspicion, but still possible, especially targeting less security-conscious users or through sophisticated social engineering.
    *   **Overall Likelihood of Path Success:** Medium to High.  While obtaining all necessary permissions, especially network, might be a hurdle, the overall attack path is realistically achievable.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Confidentiality:** Critical. Keylogging directly compromises the confidentiality of *all* text input by the user. This includes passwords, usernames, personal messages, financial information, sensitive documents, and more.
    *   **Integrity:** Low to Medium.  While the attack primarily targets confidentiality, it could indirectly impact integrity if the attacker uses the gained information to further compromise accounts or systems, potentially leading to data manipulation or unauthorized actions.
    *   **Availability:** Low.  The attack itself doesn't directly target availability of services or data. However, subsequent actions based on stolen credentials could lead to denial of service or account lockouts.
    *   **Overall Impact:** High to Critical. The potential compromise of highly sensitive information due to keylogging makes the impact of this attack path severe.

#### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies

##### 4.4.1. For FlorisBoard Development Team:

*   **Code Integrity and Tamper Detection:**
    *   **Code Signing and Verification:** Ensure the official FlorisBoard APK is properly signed and that users can easily verify the signature to confirm they are installing the genuine application. Provide clear instructions on how to verify the signature on the official website and distribution channels.
    *   **Integrity Checks:** Implement mechanisms within the FlorisBoard application itself to detect if it has been tampered with or modified. This could involve checksums or other integrity verification techniques.
*   **Official Distribution Channels:**
    *   **Focus on Secure and Official Channels:**  Emphasize and promote the use of official app stores (like Google Play Store, F-Droid) and the official FlorisBoard website for downloading the application.
    *   **Educate Users about Risks of Unofficial Sources:**  Clearly warn users against downloading FlorisBoard from unofficial or untrusted sources.
*   **Permission Minimization:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Strictly adhere to the principle of least privilege. Only request permissions that are absolutely necessary for the core functionality of FlorisBoard.  **Avoid requesting storage or network permissions unless absolutely essential and clearly justified to the user.** If these permissions are needed for optional features, make them truly optional and clearly explain why they are required.
*   **Transparency and Communication:**
    *   **Clearly Explain Permissions:** If certain permissions are necessary, provide clear and user-friendly explanations within the app and on the app store listing about why these permissions are needed and how they are used.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the FlorisBoard codebase to identify and address potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

##### 4.4.2. For Users:

*   **Download from Official Sources Only:**  **Crucially, only download FlorisBoard from trusted and official sources like the Google Play Store, F-Droid, or the official FlorisBoard website.**  Avoid downloading APKs from third-party websites or links shared through social media or email.
*   **Verify App Publisher/Developer:**  Before installing, carefully check the publisher/developer information in the app store to ensure it matches the official FlorisBoard project.
*   **Review Permissions Carefully:**  **Pay close attention to the permissions requested by *any* application, especially keyboard apps.** Be highly suspicious of keyboard apps requesting network or storage permissions unless you understand and trust the reason.  **Network permission for a keyboard app should be a major red flag.**
*   **Use Security Software:**  Consider using reputable mobile security software that can detect malicious applications and potentially warn about suspicious behavior.
*   **Keep Android and Apps Updated:**  Ensure your Android operating system and all installed applications, including FlorisBoard (if you use it), are kept up to date with the latest security patches.
*   **Be Cautious of Social Engineering:** Be wary of suspicious links, emails, or messages that promote downloading applications, especially if they promise enhanced features or are from unknown sources.

### 5. Conclusion

The "Keylogging via Malicious FlorisBoard" attack path represents a significant security risk due to its potential for widespread data compromise. While technically straightforward for an attacker to implement, its success relies heavily on social engineering and user behavior regarding app installation and permission granting.

Mitigation strategies should focus on both technical measures by the FlorisBoard development team to ensure code integrity and secure distribution, and user education to promote safe app installation practices and critical evaluation of permission requests.  **The most critical mitigation for users is to be extremely cautious about the source of applications they install and to carefully scrutinize requested permissions, especially network permission for keyboard applications.** For the FlorisBoard team, maintaining a strong focus on security, transparency, and user education is paramount to protect their users from this type of attack.
