# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for florisboard/florisboard

## Mitigation Strategy: [Verify Source and Build Integrity](./mitigation_strategies/verify_source_and_build_integrity.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Official Sources:** Locate the official FlorisBoard GitHub repository ([https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard](https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard)) and official distribution channels like F-Droid.
    2.  **Download from Official Sources:**  Download FlorisBoard source code or pre-built binaries *only* from these official sources. Avoid third-party websites or unofficial repositories.
    3.  **Build from Source (Recommended for Developers):** For maximum security, especially in sensitive applications, clone the official repository and build FlorisBoard from source code using the documented build process. This allows for code inspection.
    4.  **Verify Checksums/Signatures (If Available):** If official releases provide checksums (like SHA256) or digital signatures, download and use tools to verify the integrity of the downloaded files against these provided values. This confirms the files haven't been tampered with during download.
    5.  **Regularly Re-verify:** Periodically re-verify the source and build process, especially when updating FlorisBoard versions.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Supply Chain Vulnerabilities (High Severity): Mitigates the risk of using a compromised or backdoored version of FlorisBoard introduced through unofficial download sources or compromised build pipelines.
        *   Data Interception and Logging (Medium Severity): Reduces the risk of using a modified version that secretly logs keystrokes or transmits data.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: Significantly reduces the risk.
        *   Data Interception and Logging: Moderately reduces the risk (depends on the thoroughness of source code review if building from source).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented by FlorisBoard project by providing an open-source repository and F-Droid releases.
        *   Application developers need to actively choose official sources and perform verification steps.
