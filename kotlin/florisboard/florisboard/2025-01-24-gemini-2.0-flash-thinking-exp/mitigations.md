# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for florisboard/florisboard

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Florisboard Predictive Text and Learning for Sensitive Fields](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_florisboard_predictive_text_and_learning_for_sensitive_fields.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Identify Sensitive Input Fields:**  Determine which input fields in your application handle sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card details, personal identification numbers, or confidential data.
    *   **Step 2: Explore Florisboard Configuration:** Investigate if Florisboard provides APIs or configuration options to control predictive text and learning features on a per-input-field basis. Check Florisboard's documentation or source code for relevant settings.
    *   **Step 3: Implement Field-Specific Configuration (If Possible):** If Florisboard offers such configuration, implement logic in your application to disable or restrict predictive text and learning specifically for the identified sensitive input fields. This might involve using specific input types, attributes, or programmatically interacting with Florisboard (if APIs are available).
    *   **Step 4: User Guidance (If Configuration Limited):** If direct configuration is not feasible, provide clear guidance to users within your application (e.g., in help text or security tips) advising them to disable predictive text or learning features in Florisboard's settings *themselves* when entering sensitive information in your application.
    *   **Step 5: Alternative Input Methods (Consideration):** For extremely sensitive scenarios, consider offering alternative input methods that bypass Florisboard's predictive features entirely, such as a dedicated password input component or a one-time password (OTP) mechanism.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privacy Leakage of Sensitive Data (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of sensitive information being inadvertently stored or learned by Florisboard's predictive text engine, even if Florisboard's data handling is generally secure. This is especially relevant if a user's device is compromised or if there are unforeseen vulnerabilities in Florisboard's data storage.
    *   **Accidental Data Exposure (Low Severity):** Minimizes the chance of predictive text suggestions inadvertently displaying previously entered sensitive information in other contexts, although this is less likely with a well-designed keyboard.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Privacy Leakage of Sensitive Data: Moderately reduces risk by limiting the keyboard's learning of sensitive information.
    *   Accidental Data Exposure: Minimally reduces risk, primarily a usability improvement for sensitive data entry.

*   **Currently Implemented:**  Likely not implemented directly within the application code as it depends on Florisboard's configuration capabilities. User guidance might be partially implemented in help sections or privacy policies.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Application-level configuration to control Florisboard's features for specific input fields (if Florisboard API allows).
    *   Clear in-app user guidance and best practices for using Florisboard with sensitive data within the application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Pin Florisboard Version and Regular Update Reviews](./mitigation_strategies/pin_florisboard_version_and_regular_update_reviews.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Pin Specific Version:** In your project's dependency management system (e.g., Gradle for Android), explicitly specify a fixed version of Florisboard instead of using dynamic version ranges (like `latest` or `+`). This ensures consistent behavior and prevents unexpected updates.
    *   **Step 2: Establish Review Schedule:** Set up a recurring schedule (e.g., monthly or quarterly) to review for new Florisboard releases from the Florisboard GitHub repository.
    *   **Step 3: Monitor Release Notes and Security Advisories:**  When a new version is released, carefully examine the release notes and any associated security advisories from the Florisboard project on GitHub. Pay attention to bug fixes, security patches, and new features that might impact your application.
    *   **Step 4: Test New Versions in Staging:** Before updating to a new Florisboard version in your production application, thoroughly test it in a staging or testing environment. Verify compatibility, functionality, and ensure no new vulnerabilities or regressions are introduced.
    *   **Step 5: Controlled Rollout:** After successful testing, plan a controlled rollout of the updated Florisboard version to your production environment, potentially starting with a small subset of users to monitor for any unforeseen issues.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Florisboard (High to Medium Severity):** Mitigates the risk of using vulnerable versions of Florisboard that might contain security flaws. Regular updates ensure timely patching of known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior Changes (Medium Severity):** Prevents unexpected application behavior or compatibility issues that could arise from automatic, unreviewed Florisboard updates introducing breaking changes or new bugs.
    *   **Supply Chain Risks (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of unknowingly incorporating compromised or malicious versions of Florisboard if the upstream repository were to be compromised (though less likely with open-source and widely used projects, still a good practice).

*   **Impact:**
    *   Vulnerabilities in Florisboard: Significantly reduces risk by enabling timely patching.
    *   Unexpected Behavior Changes: Moderately reduces risk by allowing for testing and controlled updates.
    *   Supply Chain Risks: Minimally reduces risk, primarily a best practice for dependency management.

*   **Currently Implemented:**  Version pinning should be implemented in the project's dependency management configuration. Regular update reviews are likely not formally scheduled and might be ad-hoc.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formalized schedule and process for reviewing Florisboard updates from the GitHub repository.
    *   Documented procedure for testing and rolling out new Florisboard versions.
    *   Potentially missing automated tools or scripts to check for new Florisboard releases and security advisories on GitHub.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Security Scans of Florisboard Source Code and Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/security_scans_of_florisboard_source_code_and_dependencies.md)

    *   **Step 2: Integrate SAST Tools:** Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools into your development pipeline. These tools can analyze Florisboard's source code without executing it to identify potential security vulnerabilities like code injection flaws, buffer overflows, or insecure coding practices.
    *   **Step 3: Analyze Florisboard Source Code:** Regularly run SAST scans on the Florisboard source code, especially after pulling new versions from GitHub or before major releases of your application.
    *   **Step 4: Utilize SCA Tools:** Employ Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to analyze Florisboard's dependencies (if any are explicitly declared or used in its build process). SCA tools identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or components used by Florisboard.
    *   **Step 5: Vulnerability Database Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases (like CVE, NVD) to monitor for newly reported vulnerabilities related to Florisboard or its dependencies.
    *   **Step 6: Remediation and Reporting:** Establish a process to review and remediate any vulnerabilities identified by SAST or SCA tools or reported in security advisories. Document findings and remediation steps.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in Florisboard (High Severity):** Proactively identifies potential vulnerabilities in Florisboard's code *before* they are publicly known or exploited.
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (Medium to High Severity):** Detects and alerts to known vulnerabilities in any third-party libraries used by Florisboard, allowing for timely updates or mitigations.
    *   **Insecure Coding Practices (Medium Severity):** Identifies potential coding flaws that might not be immediate vulnerabilities but could become exploitable in the future or indicate a lower overall security posture.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in Florisboard: Moderately reduces risk by proactively identifying potential issues (SAST is not foolproof but adds a layer of defense).
    *   Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies: Significantly reduces risk by identifying and enabling remediation of known flaws.
    *   Insecure Coding Practices: Minimally to Moderately reduces risk by improving code quality and security awareness over time.

*   **Currently Implemented:**  Likely not systematically implemented specifically for Florisboard. General SAST/SCA might be used in the project for application code, but extending it to external dependencies like Florisboard requires specific setup.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Integration of SAST/SCA tools specifically to scan Florisboard's source code (obtained from GitHub) and dependencies as part of the build or CI/CD pipeline.
    *   Defined process for reviewing and acting upon security scan results for Florisboard.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitor Network Communication (Even if Designed Offline)](./mitigation_strategies/monitor_network_communication__even_if_designed_offline_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Network Traffic Analysis Tools:** Utilize network traffic analysis tools (like Wireshark, tcpdump, or Android's built-in network monitoring tools) to observe the network communication of applications using Florisboard.
    *   **Step 2: Baseline Monitoring:** Establish a baseline of expected network behavior when using Florisboard within your application in typical scenarios. This helps identify deviations later.
    *   **Step 3: Continuous Monitoring (Especially After Updates):** Regularly monitor network traffic, especially after updating Florisboard from GitHub or when using new features.
    *   **Step 4: Investigate Unexpected Communication:** If any network communication is observed from Florisboard (even though it's designed to be offline-first), thoroughly investigate the destination, protocol, and data being transmitted. Understand the purpose of this communication and verify against Florisboard's documented behavior and source code on GitHub.
    *   **Step 5: Network Policy Enforcement:** If network communication is not required for Florisboard's intended functionality within your application, implement network policies (e.g., firewall rules, app permissions restrictions) to block or restrict Florisboard's network access.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Communication (High Severity):** Detects and prevents potentially malicious network communication initiated by Florisboard if it were compromised or contained hidden malicious features (unlikely but a good defense-in-depth measure).
    *   **Data Exfiltration (Medium Severity):**  Identifies unexpected data transmission that could indicate unintended data leakage from Florisboard, even if not explicitly malicious.
    *   **Unintended Network Activity (Low Severity):**  Catches any legitimate but unnecessary network activity from Florisboard that might consume resources or raise privacy concerns.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Malicious Communication: Significantly reduces risk by detecting and potentially blocking unauthorized network activity.
    *   Data Exfiltration: Moderately reduces risk by identifying unexpected data transmission.
    *   Unintended Network Activity: Minimally reduces risk, primarily improves resource management and privacy posture.

*   **Currently Implemented:**  Likely not actively implemented as a specific mitigation for Florisboard. General network monitoring might be in place for the application as a whole, but not specifically focused on Florisboard's behavior.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Dedicated network monitoring and analysis specifically targeting Florisboard's network activity within the application's context.
    *   Automated alerts or reports for unexpected network communication from Florisboard.
    *   Network policies specifically tailored to restrict Florisboard's network access if not required.
