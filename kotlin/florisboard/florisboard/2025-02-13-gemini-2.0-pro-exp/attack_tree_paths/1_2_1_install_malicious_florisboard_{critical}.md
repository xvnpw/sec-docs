### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2.1 Install Malicious Florisboard

**2.1 Pre-conditions:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker must have physical possession of the target device.
*   **Unlocked Device:** The device must be unlocked (screen lock bypassed).  This is a critical pre-condition, significantly increasing the likelihood of the attack.
*   **"Unknown Sources" Enabled (Potentially):**  If the malicious APK is not obtained from a trusted app store (e.g., Google Play Store), the "Install apps from Unknown Sources" setting (or a similar setting depending on the Android version) must be enabled.  This is a significant security setting that users are often warned against enabling.  Alternatively, the attacker might exploit a vulnerability to bypass this restriction.
*   **Developer Options Enabled (Potentially):** While not strictly required for simple APK installation, enabling Developer Options and USB Debugging could provide the attacker with additional tools and access, making the attack easier or more potent.
*   **User Inattention/Trust:** The attacker may rely on social engineering or a moment of user inattention to perform the installation without raising suspicion.

**2.2 Attack Execution:**

1.  **Obtain Malicious APK:** The attacker obtains a pre-built malicious APK of Florisboard.  This could be downloaded from a malicious website, received via email, or transferred via a USB drive.  The APK is likely a modified version of the legitimate Florisboard, containing injected malicious code.
2.  **Transfer APK to Device (if necessary):** If the APK is not already on the device, the attacker transfers it (e.g., via USB, Bluetooth, or a file-sharing app).
3.  **Initiate Installation:** The attacker locates the APK file on the device and taps on it to initiate the installation process.
4.  **Bypass Security Warnings (if necessary):** If "Unknown Sources" is enabled, the user (or the attacker, if they have control) will likely see a warning about the risks of installing apps from untrusted sources.  The attacker must acknowledge and bypass this warning.
5.  **Grant Permissions:** During installation, the malicious app may request various permissions.  A legitimate keyboard app requires certain permissions (e.g., access to input methods), but the malicious version might request excessive or suspicious permissions (e.g., access to contacts, SMS messages, camera, microphone).  The attacker would need to grant these permissions.
6.  **Complete Installation:** The installation process completes, and the malicious Florisboard app is now installed on the device.
7.  **Set as Default Keyboard (Crucial):** The attacker navigates to the device's settings and sets the malicious Florisboard as the default keyboard. This is the critical step that enables the attacker to capture all keyboard input.
8.  **Hide the App (Optional):** The attacker might attempt to hide the app icon or disguise it to make it less noticeable to the user.

**2.3 Post-conditions:**

*   **Malicious Keyboard Active:** The malicious Florisboard is now the active keyboard, intercepting all user input.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** The malicious code within the app can now:
    *   **Keylogging:** Record every keystroke entered by the user, including passwords, usernames, credit card numbers, personal messages, and search queries.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Transmit the captured data to a remote server controlled by the attacker. This could be done via the internet (Wi-Fi or mobile data) or potentially through other channels (e.g., SMS, Bluetooth).
    *   **Clipboard Monitoring:** Access and exfiltrate data copied to the clipboard.
    *   **Screen Recording (Potentially):** Depending on the granted permissions and exploited vulnerabilities, the malicious app might even be able to record the screen, capturing even more sensitive information.
    *   **Install Additional Malware (Potentially):** The malicious keyboard could act as a dropper, downloading and installing other malware on the device.
    *   **Modify System Settings (Potentially):** With sufficient privileges, the malicious app could modify system settings, further compromising the device's security.
    *   **Perform Actions on Behalf of the User (Potentially):** The app could potentially simulate user input, sending messages, making calls, or interacting with other apps without the user's knowledge.

**2.4 Impact Analysis:**

The impact of this attack is **Very High**, as stated in the attack tree.  The consequences can be severe:

*   **Identity Theft:**  Stolen usernames, passwords, and personal information can be used for identity theft.
*   **Financial Loss:**  Stolen credit card numbers and banking credentials can lead to financial fraud.
*   **Privacy Violation:**  Sensitive personal messages, emails, and browsing history can be exposed.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Compromised accounts can be used to send spam, spread malware, or post inappropriate content.
*   **Device Compromise:**  The device can be completely taken over by the attacker, potentially leading to data loss, ransomware attacks, or use in botnets.

**2.5 Mitigation Strategies:**

**2.5.1 User-Level Mitigations:**

*   **Never Leave Devices Unattended and Unlocked:** This is the most fundamental security practice.  Always lock your device when not in use.
*   **Strong Lock Screen Security:** Use a strong PIN, password, or biometric authentication (fingerprint, face recognition) to protect your device.
*   **Disable "Unknown Sources":**  Keep the "Install apps from Unknown Sources" setting disabled unless absolutely necessary.  If you must enable it, do so only temporarily and be extremely cautious about the source of the APK.
*   **Be Wary of APKs from Untrusted Sources:**  Only download apps from trusted app stores like the Google Play Store.
*   **Review App Permissions:**  Carefully review the permissions requested by any app during installation.  Be suspicious of apps that request excessive or unnecessary permissions.
*   **Regularly Check Installed Apps:**  Periodically review the list of installed apps on your device and remove any unfamiliar or suspicious apps.
*   **Keep Your Device Updated:**  Install the latest Android security updates and app updates to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Use a Mobile Security Solution:**  Consider installing a reputable mobile security app that can detect and remove malware.
*   **Educate Yourself:**  Stay informed about the latest mobile security threats and best practices.

**2.5.2 Developer-Level Mitigations (for Legitimate Florisboard Developers):**

*   **Code Signing:**  Ensure that all releases of Florisboard are properly code-signed.  This helps users verify the authenticity of the app and prevents tampering.
*   **Obfuscation and Anti-Tampering Techniques:**  Use code obfuscation and anti-tampering techniques to make it more difficult for attackers to reverse-engineer and modify the APK.
*   **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP):**  Implement RASP techniques to detect and prevent malicious activity at runtime.  This could include checks for code integrity, debugger detection, and root detection.
*   **Secure Communication:**  Use HTTPS for all communication between the app and any backend servers.  Implement certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Minimize Permissions:**  Request only the minimum necessary permissions required for the app to function.  Avoid requesting unnecessary or sensitive permissions.
*   **Secure Data Storage:**  Store sensitive data securely, using encryption and appropriate access controls.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
*   **User Education:**  Provide clear and concise security guidance to users within the app and on the app's website.
*   **Consider Sandboxing (if feasible):** Explore the possibility of using sandboxing techniques to isolate the keyboard's functionality and limit the potential damage from a compromised keyboard. This is a complex undertaking.
* **Tamper Detection:** Implement mechanisms within the app to detect if it has been modified from its original, signed state. This could involve checking checksums or signatures at runtime. If tampering is detected, the app could refuse to run or alert the user.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Even though a keyboard's primary function is to handle input, carefully validate and sanitize any data received from external sources (e.g., configuration files, updates) to prevent injection attacks.

**2.6 Detection Methods:**

*   **Check Installed Apps:**  Manually review the list of installed apps and look for unfamiliar or suspicious entries.  Compare the installed version of Florisboard against the official version number.
*   **Monitor App Permissions:**  Check the permissions granted to Florisboard and other apps.  Look for any unusual or excessive permissions.
*   **Mobile Security Software:**  Use a reputable mobile security app to scan for malware.
*   **Network Monitoring:**  Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity, such as connections to unknown servers.
*   **Behavioral Analysis:**  Be aware of any unusual behavior on your device, such as unexpected battery drain, slow performance, or strange pop-ups.
*   **Check Keyboard Settings:** Verify that the default keyboard is the one you expect.
* **Digital Signature Verification:** If you obtain an APK, you can (and should) verify its digital signature against the known good signature of the Florisboard developers. This requires some technical knowledge but is a strong indicator of authenticity. Tools like `apksigner` (part of the Android SDK) can be used for this.

### 3. Conclusion
