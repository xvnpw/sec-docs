Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on the FlorisBoard application.

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Local Attack on FlorisBoard

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors associated with a *local attack* on a device running FlorisBoard.  We aim to identify specific actions an attacker with local access (physical or via another compromised app) could take to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data processed by FlorisBoard, or to leverage FlorisBoard to compromise other parts of the system.  This analysis will inform mitigation strategies and security recommendations.

**Scope:**

*   **Target Application:** FlorisBoard (https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard) -  We are specifically analyzing the open-source Android keyboard application.
*   **Attack Path:**  Local Attack (as defined in the provided attack tree). This means the attacker has:
    *   **Physical Access:**  Direct, hands-on access to the unlocked device.
    *   **OR**
    *   **Compromised Application Access:**  Control over another application already installed on the device, potentially with elevated privileges (but *not* necessarily root/superuser).
*   **Assets of Interest:**
    *   **User Input Data:**  Keystrokes, clipboard contents, personal dictionary entries, learned words, and any other data entered through FlorisBoard.
    *   **FlorisBoard Configuration:**  Settings, themes, layouts, and any stored preferences.
    *   **Device Resources:**  Access to other applications, files, network connections, or hardware features (microphone, camera) that FlorisBoard might interact with.
    *   **System Integrity:** Preventing the attacker from using FlorisBoard as a stepping stone to gain broader system access or escalate privileges.
* **Exclusions:**
    * Remote attacks (e.g., network-based exploits).
    * Supply chain attacks (e.g., compromising the FlorisBoard build process).
    * Social engineering attacks that trick the user into installing a malicious version of FlorisBoard.  (While local access might be *gained* through social engineering, the focus here is on what happens *after* that access is obtained).

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examining the FlorisBoard source code (from the provided GitHub repository) to identify potential vulnerabilities.  This will focus on areas like:
    *   Input validation and sanitization.
    *   Data storage and encryption practices.
    *   Inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms.
    *   Permission handling.
    *   Error handling and logging.
    *   Use of third-party libraries.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual):**  While we won't be performing live dynamic analysis in this document, we will *conceptually* describe how dynamic analysis techniques could be used. This includes:
    *   Using debugging tools (e.g., `adb`, Android Studio debugger) to observe FlorisBoard's behavior at runtime.
    *   Monitoring file system access, network activity, and system calls.
    *   Fuzzing input fields and APIs to identify unexpected behavior.
    *   Using security analysis tools (e.g., Drozer, Frida) to inspect and manipulate FlorisBoard's internal state.

3.  **Threat Modeling:**  Considering various attacker scenarios and motivations within the defined scope.  This will help us prioritize vulnerabilities and understand their potential impact.

4.  **Best Practice Review:**  Assessing FlorisBoard's adherence to Android security best practices and secure coding guidelines.

5.  **Documentation Review:** Examining any available documentation for FlorisBoard, including developer guides, security notes, and known issues.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path: Local Attack

Given the "Local Attack" path, we'll break down potential attack vectors into subcategories based on the *type* of local access:

#### 2.1 Physical Access (Unlocked Device)

If an attacker has physical access to an *unlocked* device running FlorisBoard, the attack surface is significantly larger.  The attacker can directly interact with the device and FlorisBoard.

*   **2.1.1 Direct Data Extraction:**

    *   **Objective:**  Steal sensitive data entered through FlorisBoard.
    *   **Techniques:**
        *   **Clipboard Monitoring:**  If FlorisBoard stores clipboard history (a common feature in keyboards), the attacker can directly access this history to retrieve previously copied text, potentially including passwords, credit card numbers, or other sensitive information.  *Code Review Focus:* Examine clipboard management code (`ClipboardManager` interactions, custom clipboard implementations).
        *   **Personal Dictionary/Learned Words Access:**  FlorisBoard likely stores a personal dictionary or learned words to improve typing suggestions.  An attacker could access this data to gain insights into the user's vocabulary, frequently used terms, and potentially even passwords if the user has inadvertently added them to the dictionary.  *Code Review Focus:*  Look for database files (e.g., SQLite) or shared preferences used to store this data.  Check for encryption at rest.
        *   **Configuration File Tampering:**  The attacker could modify FlorisBoard's configuration files to change settings, potentially enabling logging of keystrokes or redirecting input to a malicious application.  *Code Review Focus:*  Identify where configuration files are stored and how they are protected (file permissions, integrity checks).
        *   **Screen Recording/Screenshotting:**  While not directly exploiting FlorisBoard, the attacker could use screen recording or screenshotting tools to capture keystrokes as they are entered.  *Mitigation:*  Android's `FLAG_SECURE` can prevent screenshots/recording, but it's up to the *receiving* application to set this flag, not the keyboard.

*   **2.1.2  FlorisBoard Manipulation:**

    *   **Objective:**  Modify FlorisBoard's behavior to facilitate further attacks.
    *   **Techniques:**
        *   **Installing a Malicious Theme/Extension:**  If FlorisBoard supports custom themes or extensions, the attacker could install a malicious one that includes keylogging or data exfiltration capabilities.  *Code Review Focus:*  Examine the theme/extension loading mechanism for security vulnerabilities (e.g., insufficient validation of code signatures, lack of sandboxing).
        *   **Changing Keyboard Layout:**  The attacker could subtly modify the keyboard layout to trick the user into entering incorrect credentials, potentially capturing the correct ones in a log file.  *Code Review Focus:*  Check how layout changes are handled and whether they are persisted securely.
        *   **Disabling Security Features:**  If FlorisBoard has security features (e.g., incognito mode, clipboard clearing), the attacker could disable them to make data extraction easier.

*   **2.1.3  Leveraging FlorisBoard for Broader Access:**

    *   **Objective:**  Use FlorisBoard as a stepping stone to compromise other parts of the system.
    *   **Techniques:**
        *   **Exploiting IPC Vulnerabilities:**  If FlorisBoard communicates with other applications via Inter-Process Communication (IPC), the attacker could try to exploit vulnerabilities in the IPC mechanism to gain access to those applications.  *Code Review Focus:*  Examine `Intent` handling, `ContentProvider` implementations, and any custom IPC mechanisms.  Look for insecure data handling, permission bypasses, and injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **Accessibility Service Abuse:**  If FlorisBoard uses an Accessibility Service (for features like voice input or enhanced text manipulation), the attacker could potentially abuse this service to gain broader control over the device.  Accessibility Services have extensive permissions.  *Code Review Focus:*  Carefully examine the permissions requested by the Accessibility Service and how they are used.  Ensure that the service only performs the minimum necessary actions.

#### 2.2 Compromised Application Access

If the attacker controls another application on the device (but *not* necessarily with root access), the attack surface is more limited, but still significant.  The attacker can't directly interact with FlorisBoard's UI, but they can potentially interact with its underlying processes and data.

*   **2.2.1  Data Exfiltration via IPC:**

    *   **Objective:**  Steal data from FlorisBoard without direct UI access.
    *   **Techniques:**
        *   **Intent Spoofing/Injection:**  The attacker's application could send malicious `Intent`s to FlorisBoard, attempting to trigger unintended actions or extract data.  *Code Review Focus:*  Examine how FlorisBoard handles incoming `Intent`s.  Look for vulnerabilities like implicit `Intent` handling without proper validation, exported activities that should be private, and insecure data handling within `Intent` handlers.
        *   **ContentProvider Exploitation:**  If FlorisBoard exposes a `ContentProvider` (e.g., for sharing dictionary data), the attacker's application could try to query or modify this data without proper authorization.  *Code Review Focus:*  Examine the `ContentProvider` implementation for permission checks, SQL injection vulnerabilities, and path traversal vulnerabilities.
        *   **Custom IPC Exploitation:**  If FlorisBoard uses a custom IPC mechanism (e.g., shared memory, sockets), the attacker's application could try to interact with this mechanism directly.  *Code Review Focus:*  Examine the security of the custom IPC mechanism, including authentication, authorization, and data validation.

*   **2.2.2  Denial of Service (DoS):**

    *   **Objective:**  Prevent FlorisBoard from functioning correctly.
    *   **Techniques:**
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:**  The attacker's application could repeatedly send requests to FlorisBoard, consuming resources (CPU, memory) and making it unresponsive.
        *   **Crashing FlorisBoard:**  The attacker's application could send malformed data to FlorisBoard, triggering crashes or exceptions.  *Code Review Focus:*  Look for areas where FlorisBoard handles external input without proper validation or error handling.

*   **2.2.3  Configuration Tampering (Indirect):**

    *   **Objective:**  Modify FlorisBoard's configuration to facilitate future attacks.
    *   **Techniques:**
        *   **Shared Preferences Manipulation:**  If FlorisBoard stores configuration data in shared preferences that are not properly protected, the attacker's application could modify these preferences.  *Code Review Focus:*  Examine how shared preferences are used and whether they are set to `MODE_PRIVATE` or have other access controls.
        *   **File System Manipulation:**  If FlorisBoard stores configuration files in a location accessible to other applications (e.g., external storage), the attacker's application could modify these files.  *Code Review Focus:*  Examine where configuration files are stored and how they are protected (file permissions).

*   **2.2.4 Leveraging Accessibility Service (Indirect):**
    *   **Objective:**  Abuse FlorisBoard's Accessibility Service from another compromised application.
    *   **Techniques:**
        * If the attacker's application *also* has Accessibility Service permissions, it could potentially interact with or monitor FlorisBoard's Accessibility Service, although this is a complex and less likely scenario. Android's security model is designed to limit interactions between Accessibility Services.

### 3. Mitigation Strategies and Recommendations

Based on the above analysis, here are some general mitigation strategies and recommendations for the FlorisBoard developers:

*   **Data Encryption at Rest:**  Encrypt sensitive data stored by FlorisBoard, including personal dictionaries, learned words, and configuration files. Use strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256) and securely manage encryption keys.
*   **Secure Clipboard Management:**  Limit the amount of time clipboard data is stored.  Provide an option for users to clear the clipboard history.  Consider implementing a secure clipboard that is isolated from other applications.
*   **Strict Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input received from external sources (e.g., `Intent`s, `ContentProvider` queries, custom IPC messages).  Use a whitelist approach whenever possible.
*   **Secure IPC:**  Use explicit `Intent`s with proper component names.  Validate all data received via IPC.  Implement robust permission checks for `ContentProvider`s.  Avoid custom IPC mechanisms if possible; if necessary, ensure they are thoroughly secured.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Request only the minimum necessary permissions.  Carefully review the permissions required by the Accessibility Service and ensure they are justified.
*   **Sandboxing:**  If supporting themes or extensions, implement a robust sandboxing mechanism to isolate their code from the core FlorisBoard functionality.  Use code signing and verification to ensure the integrity of themes/extensions.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Management:** Keep third-party libraries up-to-date and regularly scan for known vulnerabilities.
* **File Permissions:** Use `MODE_PRIVATE` for shared preferences and internal files. Avoid storing sensitive data on external storage. If external storage *must* be used, encrypt the data.
* **FLAG_SECURE:** While not directly controllable by the keyboard, educate users and developers about the importance of using `FLAG_SECURE` in sensitive applications to prevent screen recording/screenshotting.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and avoid leaking sensitive information in error messages or logs.
* **User Education:** Provide clear and concise documentation about FlorisBoard's security features and how users can protect their data.

### 4. Conclusion

This deep analysis has explored the potential attack vectors associated with a local attack on FlorisBoard.  By understanding these threats and implementing appropriate mitigation strategies, the FlorisBoard developers can significantly enhance the security of their application and protect user data.  The most critical areas to focus on are secure data storage, robust IPC security, and careful management of permissions, especially those related to the Accessibility Service. Continuous security review and updates are essential to maintain a strong security posture.
