# Attack Surface Analysis for florisboard/florisboard

## Attack Surface: [1. Input Interception (Keylogging & Manipulation)](./attack_surfaces/1__input_interception__keylogging_&_manipulation_.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized recording or alteration of user input before it reaches the target application.
*   **FlorisBoard Contribution:** FlorisBoard is the *primary* component handling all text input. It sits between the user and the application, making it a perfect position for interception. This is inherent to its function as a keyboard.
*   **Example:** A compromised FlorisBoard version records all keystrokes and sends them to an attacker. Alternatively, it subtly changes a cryptocurrency address entered by the user to the attacker's address.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of all typed information (passwords, messages, searches), potential for financial loss, identity theft, or manipulation of application behavior.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (using FlorisBoard):**
        *   Use secure input fields (`inputType="textPassword"`) for sensitive data.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the *application* side, never trusting the keyboard.
        *   Consider end-to-end encryption for sensitive communications.
        *   Implement integrity checks on received data, if feasible.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Install FlorisBoard only from trusted sources (F-Droid, official GitHub releases).
        *   Be wary of suspicious keyboard behavior.
        *   Use a password manager with auto-fill.

## Attack Surface: [2. Malicious Extensions/Themes](./attack_surfaces/2__malicious_extensionsthemes.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in FlorisBoard extensions or themes to gain unauthorized access or control.
*   **FlorisBoard Contribution:** FlorisBoard's extensibility through extensions and themes creates a direct entry point for malicious code *within* the keyboard itself. This is a feature of Florisboard.
*   **Example:** A malicious extension requests broad permissions and uses them to access the user's contacts and send them to a remote server. A theme injects hidden input fields to capture keystrokes.
*   **Impact:** Varies widely, but can range from data theft to complete device compromise (depending on extension permissions and capabilities).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (of FlorisBoard):**
        *   Implement a strict permission model for extensions.
        *   Sandboxing of extensions.
        *   Code review of extensions (if a curated extension store is provided).
        *   Restrict theme capabilities.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Install extensions and themes *only* from trusted sources.
        *   Carefully review permissions requested by extensions.
        *   Be skeptical of extensions with excessive permissions.
        *   Regularly review and uninstall unused extensions.

## Attack Surface: [3. Vulnerabilities in FlorisBoard Code/Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/3__vulnerabilities_in_florisboard_codedependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of software bugs in FlorisBoard itself or its dependencies.
*   **FlorisBoard Contribution:** This is *directly* related to the code quality and security of FlorisBoard and the libraries it uses.  It's an inherent risk of using *any* software, but particularly critical for an input method.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in FlorisBoard's text processing logic could be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:** Can range from crashes to complete device compromise, depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (of FlorisBoard):**
        *   Follow secure coding practices.
        *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
        *   Use static and dynamic analysis tools.
        *   Keep dependencies up to date.
        *   Address reported vulnerabilities promptly.
    *   **Developers (using FlorisBoard):**
        *   Keep FlorisBoard updated.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Keep FlorisBoard updated.
        *   Use a reputable source for downloads.
