# Threat Model Analysis for florisboard/florisboard

## Threat: [Extension-Based Keylogging](./threats/extension-based_keylogging.md)

*   **Threat:** Extension-Based Keylogging

    *   **Description:** A user installs a malicious Florisboard extension (e.g., a theme or custom layout) that contains hidden keylogging functionality. The extension captures all keystrokes entered by the user and sends them to a remote server controlled by the attacker.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information (passwords, credit card numbers, private messages), identity theft, financial loss.
    *   **Affected Component:** Extension API, input event handling, potentially any component accessible to extensions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a strict permission model for extensions, limiting their access to input events and network communication.
        *   Require explicit user consent for extensions to access sensitive data or perform potentially dangerous actions.
        *   Sandboxing: Isolate extensions in separate processes or sandboxes to prevent them from interfering with each other or the core keyboard functionality.
        *   Code review and security auditing of extensions before they are made available to users.
        *   Provide a mechanism for users to easily review and manage installed extensions and their permissions.
        *   Implement a "safe mode" that disables all extensions.

## Threat: [Malicious Dictionary Injection](./threats/malicious_dictionary_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Dictionary Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises a dictionary update server or performs a man-in-the-middle attack during dictionary download. They inject a malicious dictionary containing crafted words or phrases designed to trigger vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows) in Florisboard's text processing or prediction engine, or to subtly alter user input.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution, denial of service, data corruption, subtle alteration of user input (e.g., changing a recipient's name in a message).
    *   **Affected Component:** `DictionaryManager`, dictionary loading/parsing functions, predictive text engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use HTTPS for all dictionary downloads.
        *   Implement strong cryptographic checksums (e.g., SHA-256) and signature verification for downloaded dictionaries.
        *   Validate dictionary content before use (e.g., check for unusual characters or patterns).
        *   Fuzz test the dictionary parsing and prediction engine with malformed input.
        *   Implement memory safety protections (e.g., ASLR, DEP).

## Threat: [Clipboard Data Exfiltration](./threats/clipboard_data_exfiltration.md)

*   **Threat:** Clipboard Data Exfiltration

    *   **Description:** A malicious extension or a vulnerability in Florisboard's clipboard handling logic allows unauthorized access to the system clipboard. The attacker can silently copy the contents of the clipboard and send it to a remote server.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information copied to the clipboard (passwords, URLs, personal data).
    *   **Affected Component:** Clipboard manager (`ClipboardManager` or similar), extension API.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict clipboard access to only when explicitly requested by the user (e.g., through a dedicated "paste" button).
        *   Implement a "clipboard history" feature that allows users to see what has been copied to the clipboard.
        *   Clear the clipboard automatically after a certain period of inactivity.
        *   Sandboxing of extensions to prevent unauthorized clipboard access.
        *   Audit clipboard access patterns for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Theme-Based UI Redressing](./threats/theme-based_ui_redressing.md)

*   **Threat:** Theme-Based UI Redressing

    *   **Description:** A malicious theme modifies the appearance of the keyboard to mimic a legitimate application or system dialog, tricking the user into entering sensitive information into a fake input field.
    *   **Impact:** Phishing, credential theft.
    *   **Affected Component:** Theme engine, UI rendering.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict the ability of themes to modify critical UI elements (e.g., system dialogs).
        *   Implement a clear visual distinction between the keyboard and other applications.
        *   Provide a mechanism for users to verify the authenticity of the keyboard UI.
        *   Code review and security auditing of themes.
        *   Sandboxing of the theme engine.
