# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for florisboard/florisboard

## Mitigation Strategy: [Clipboard Monitoring Control](./mitigation_strategies/clipboard_monitoring_control.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** User-Configurable Clipboard Monitoring with Enhanced Controls

**Description:**
1.  **Opt-in Feature:** Ensure clipboard monitoring is *disabled* by default.  Users must explicitly enable it in the settings *within FlorisBoard*.
2.  **Clear Warnings:**  When enabling, display a prominent warning dialog *within FlorisBoard's settings* explaining the privacy implications.
3.  **History Limit:** Implement a setting *in FlorisBoard* to limit the number of clipboard entries stored.
4.  **Time-to-Live (TTL):**  Add a setting *in FlorisBoard* for a TTL. Entries older than the TTL are automatically deleted *by FlorisBoard*.
5.  **Manual Clear:** Provide a button *in FlorisBoard's settings* to manually clear the entire clipboard history.
6.  **Clipboard Access Notification (API Level 33+):** *FlorisBoard* should use the `OnPrimaryClipChangedListener` (if targeting Android 13+) to trigger the system notification.
7.  **Sensitive Field Detection (Advanced/Optional):** *FlorisBoard* would need to implement logic using `InputMethodService` to *attempt* to detect sensitive fields and temporarily disable its own clipboard monitoring.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Clipboard Data Leakage (Severity: High):**  Accidental or malicious access to sensitive data copied to the clipboard, specifically while using FlorisBoard.
*   **Clipboard Hijacking (Severity: High):**  A malicious app replacing the clipboard contents.  Mitigation reduces FlorisBoard's contribution to the risk.
*   **Privacy Violation (Severity: Medium):**  Unintentional storage of personal information *by FlorisBoard*.

**Impact:**
*   **Clipboard Data Leakage:** Significantly reduced *within FlorisBoard's scope*.
*   **Clipboard Hijacking:**  Reduced; FlorisBoard's contribution to the risk window is minimized.
*   **Privacy Violation:**  Significantly reduced *regarding data handled by FlorisBoard*.

**Currently Implemented (Assumed/Likely):**
*   Basic clipboard history functionality likely exists *within FlorisBoard*.
*   Manual clear button may exist *within FlorisBoard*.

**Missing Implementation (Assumed/Likely):**
*   **Opt-in by default:**  Likely not implemented; needs to be changed *in FlorisBoard*.
*   **TTL Setting:**  Likely not implemented *in FlorisBoard*.
*   **Comprehensive Warnings:**  May be insufficient *within FlorisBoard's UI*.
*   **Clipboard Access Notification (API 33+):**  Needs to be implemented *in FlorisBoard*.
*   **Sensitive Field Detection:**  Almost certainly not implemented *in FlorisBoard*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Dictionary Management](./mitigation_strategies/secure_dictionary_management.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Local-First, User-Controlled, Encrypted Dictionaries (within FlorisBoard)

**Description:**
1.  **Local Storage:**  *FlorisBoard* must store user dictionaries exclusively on the device.
2.  **User Control:**  *FlorisBoard's settings* must provide options to disable learning, control per-language learning, clear dictionaries, and (ideally) view learned words.
3.  **Encryption:**  *FlorisBoard* must encrypt the user dictionary data at rest using a strong algorithm. The key should be handled securely (user password or Android Keystore).
4.  **Cloud Sync (Optional, Opt-in, E2EE):**  If offered *by FlorisBoard*, it *must* be opt-in and use end-to-end encryption.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Dictionary Data Leakage (Severity: Medium):**  Exposure of user typing patterns stored *by FlorisBoard*.
*   **Privacy Violation (Severity: Medium):**  Unintentional collection of sensitive words *by FlorisBoard*.
*   **Cloud Data Breach (Severity: High):**  Relevant only if *FlorisBoard* offers cloud sync; E2EE mitigates this.

**Impact:**
*   **Dictionary Data Leakage:**  Significantly reduced *for data handled by FlorisBoard*.
*   **Privacy Violation:**  Significantly reduced *within FlorisBoard's control*.
*   **Cloud Data Breach:**  Mitigated *if* E2EE is properly implemented *by FlorisBoard*.

**Currently Implemented (Assumed/Likely):**
*   Local dictionary storage is likely the primary method *within FlorisBoard*.
*   Some user controls may exist *in FlorisBoard*.

**Missing Implementation (Assumed/Likely):**
*   **Encryption at Rest:**  Likely not implemented *in FlorisBoard*.
*   **Fine-Grained Controls:**  The level of control *within FlorisBoard* may be insufficient.
*   **E2EE for Cloud Sync:**  If present, likely lacks E2EE *in FlorisBoard's implementation*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Validation (within FlorisBoard)](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_validation__within_florisboard_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Context-Aware Input Sanitization *within FlorisBoard*

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Input Points:**  Identify all places *within FlorisBoard's code* where user input is processed internally.
2.  **Contextual Sanitization:**  *FlorisBoard's code* must apply appropriate sanitization based on the context of each input point (text, numeric, regex, command arguments, etc.).
3.  **Theme Validation:** If *FlorisBoard* loads themes from external sources:
    *   **Checksum Verification:** *FlorisBoard* should verify theme file integrity.
    *   **Sandboxing (Ideal):** *FlorisBoard* should load and render themes in a sandboxed environment.
    *   **Input Validation:** *FlorisBoard* should validate all data within the theme file.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Code Injection (Severity: High):**  Malicious code injected *into FlorisBoard* itself.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: Medium/High):**  Relevant if *FlorisBoard* displays user input in a web view.
*   **Theme-Based Attacks (Severity: High):**  Malicious themes exploiting vulnerabilities *in FlorisBoard*.

**Impact:**
*   **Code Injection:**  Significantly reduced *within FlorisBoard*.
*   **XSS:**  Mitigated if relevant *to FlorisBoard's functionality*.
*   **Theme-Based Attacks:**  Reduced *within FlorisBoard's handling of themes*.

**Currently Implemented (Assumed/Likely):**
*   Some basic input validation may exist *in FlorisBoard*.

**Missing Implementation (Assumed/Likely):**
*   **Comprehensive Sanitization:**  Likely missing a systematic approach *throughout FlorisBoard's code*.
*   **Theme Sandboxing:**  Likely not implemented *in FlorisBoard*.
*   **Theme Checksum Verification:**  May not be implemented or robust enough *in FlorisBoard*.
