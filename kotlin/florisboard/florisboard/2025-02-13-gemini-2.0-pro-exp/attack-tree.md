## Attack Tree Path: [1. Local Attack](./attack_tree_paths/1__local_attack.md)

The attacker requires some form of local access to the device, either physically or through another compromised application.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Malicious Florisboard Fork/Build [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_malicious_florisboard_forkbuild__high_risk_.md)

The attacker creates a modified version of Florisboard containing malicious code. This modified version must then be installed on the target device, typically through social engineering or by exploiting another vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Keylogging {CRITICAL} [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_keylogging_{critical}__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The modified Florisboard logs all keystrokes entered by the user. This data is then typically exfiltrated to a server controlled by the attacker.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Requires the user to install the malicious fork.
*   **Impact:** Very High. Direct access to all typed information, including passwords, credit card numbers, and private messages.
*   **Effort:** Medium. Requires coding skills to modify Florisboard and implement data exfiltration.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate. Requires understanding of Android development, input handling, and network communication.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard. Network traffic analysis *might* reveal data exfiltration, but it could be obfuscated. Code review of the installed APK *could* reveal the malicious code, but users rarely do this.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Physical Access](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_physical_access.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Install Malicious Florisboard {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_install_malicious_florisboard_{critical}.md)

*    **Description:** Attacker with physical access to unlocked device installs malicious version of Florisboard.
*    **Likelihood:** Low. Requires physical access to the unlocked device and bypassing user security measures (e.g., disabling "Unknown Sources").
*    **Impact:** Very High. Full control over keyboard input.
*    **Effort:** Low. Just installing an APK.
*    **Skill Level:** Novice. Basic Android usage.
*    **Detection Difficulty:** Easy. Checking the installed app list would reveal the malicious app, assuming the user knows what to look for.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Compromised Dependencies [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_compromised_dependencies__high_risk_.md)

Florisboard, like any software project, relies on external libraries (dependencies). If one of these dependencies is compromised, it can introduce vulnerabilities into Florisboard itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1 Trojanized Dependency {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_trojanized_dependency_{critical}.md)

*   **Description:** A dependency is intentionally modified by its maintainer (or by an attacker who has compromised the maintainer's account or the dependency's repository) to include malicious code. This is a form of supply chain attack.
*   **Likelihood:** Very Low. Requires a malicious maintainer or a successful attack on a dependency's repository.  However, the *overall* likelihood of *any* dependency being compromised is higher, hence the "High Risk" designation for the parent node.
*   **Impact:** Very High. Complete control over the compromised dependency, and potentially Florisboard itself. This could lead to keylogging, code injection, or other malicious activities.
*   **Effort:** Very High. Requires significant resources, social engineering, or advanced hacking skills to compromise a dependency's repository or the maintainer's account.
*   **Skill Level:** Expert. Requires expertise in social engineering, supply chain attacks, and potentially vulnerability exploitation.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard. Requires constant monitoring of dependency repositories and their integrity.  Code audits of all dependencies are necessary, which is a significant undertaking.
