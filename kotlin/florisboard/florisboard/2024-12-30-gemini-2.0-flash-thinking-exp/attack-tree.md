Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

*   **Exploit FlorisBoard Vulnerability (Critical Node):**
    *   This represents the exploitation of any security flaw within the FlorisBoard application itself.
    *   Successful exploitation can lead to various high-impact outcomes, including RCE and data exfiltration.

*   **Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on User Device (Critical Node, Part of High-Risk Path):**
    *   Attackers aim to execute arbitrary code on the user's device through vulnerabilities in FlorisBoard.
    *   This grants them significant control over the device and potentially the application.

*   **Exfiltrate Sensitive Data from User Device (Critical Node, Part of High-Risk Path):**
    *   The goal is to steal sensitive information residing on the user's device.
    *   FlorisBoard, with its access to input and potentially accessibility services, can be a vector for this.

*   **Access Application Data via Accessibility Services Abuse (Part of High-Risk Path):**
    *   If FlorisBoard is granted excessive accessibility permissions, attackers can abuse these permissions to read data from other applications, including the target application.
        *   FlorisBoard gains excessive accessibility permissions: Users might unknowingly grant broad access.
        *   Leverage permissions to read application memory/storage: Using these permissions to extract sensitive data.

*   **Intercept and Exfiltrate Keystrokes (High-Risk Path):**
    *   A compromised FlorisBoard can be modified to record all keystrokes and send them to an attacker.
        *   Modify FlorisBoard to send keystrokes to attacker's server: Altering the keyboard's functionality to exfiltrate data.

*   **Access and Exfiltrate Clipboard Data (High-Risk Path):**
    *   FlorisBoard, like many keyboards, has access to the device's clipboard.
        *   Leverage clipboard access permissions to steal sensitive data: Monitoring and exfiltrating any data copied to the clipboard.

*   **Configuration and Integration Weaknesses (Critical Node):**
    *   This category covers vulnerabilities arising from how the application integrates with FlorisBoard.
    *   A key weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization.

*   **Application Does Not Properly Sanitize Input from FlorisBoard (High-Risk Path):**
    *   The application fails to adequately validate and sanitize input received from FlorisBoard.
        *   Application directly uses input from FlorisBoard in sensitive operations: Using unsanitized input in critical functions.
        *   Allows injection attacks (e.g., command injection, SQL injection if applicable):  Enabling attackers to inject malicious commands or queries through the keyboard input.
