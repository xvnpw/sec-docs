## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in FlorisBoard](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_florisboard.md)

This represents the broad category of attacks that exploit programming errors or design flaws within the FlorisBoard application itself. Successful exploitation can lead to various malicious outcomes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Injection](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection.md)

Attackers inject malicious code into FlorisBoard through vulnerable input points. This code can then be executed by the application, potentially granting the attacker control or access to sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Custom Dictionary](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_custom_dictionary.md)

Attackers craft malicious entries within custom dictionaries used by FlorisBoard. When the keyboard processes these entries, the malicious code is executed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Input Handling Logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_input_handling_logic.md)

Attackers leverage flaws in how FlorisBoard processes general user input, such as specific character sequences or unexpected data formats, to inject and execute malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Communication Channels -> Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Update Mechanism -> Inject Malicious Update Package](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_communication_channels_-_man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_update_mechanism_-_inject_malici_aa641bee.md)

Attackers intercept communication between FlorisBoard and its update server. They then inject a malicious update package, which, if installed, compromises the user's keyboard.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Communication Channels -> Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Update Mechanism -> Compromise Update Server](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_communication_channels_-_man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_update_mechanism_-_compromise_up_50ba43a9.md)

Attackers directly compromise the update server infrastructure. This allows them to distribute malicious updates to all users, leading to widespread compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attack](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attack.md)

Attackers compromise the development or distribution process of FlorisBoard, injecting malicious code before it reaches users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise FlorisBoard Repository -> Inject Malicious Code into Official Repository](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_florisboard_repository_-_inject_malicious_code_into_official_repository.md)

Attackers gain unauthorized access to the official FlorisBoard code repository (e.g., on GitHub) and directly insert malicious code into the source code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Build/Release Pipeline -> Inject Malicious Code During Build Process](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_buildrelease_pipeline_-_inject_malicious_code_during_build_process.md)

Attackers compromise the automated systems used to build and release FlorisBoard. They inject malicious code during the compilation or packaging stages.

## Attack Tree Path: [Distribute Maliciously Modified FlorisBoard](./attack_tree_paths/distribute_maliciously_modified_florisboard.md)

Attackers take a legitimate version of FlorisBoard, modify it with malicious code, and then distribute this compromised version to users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Through Unofficial App Stores](./attack_tree_paths/through_unofficial_app_stores.md)

Attackers upload the malicious FlorisBoard variant to third-party app stores, hoping users will download it instead of the official version.

## Attack Tree Path: [Through Phishing or Social Engineering](./attack_tree_paths/through_phishing_or_social_engineering.md)

Attackers trick users into downloading and installing the malicious FlorisBoard variant through deceptive emails, websites, or social media tactics.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Legitimate FlorisBoard Features for Malicious Purposes](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_legitimate_florisboard_features_for_malicious_purposes.md)

Attackers leverage the intended functionality of FlorisBoard to carry out malicious actions once the keyboard is compromised.

## Attack Tree Path: [Keylogging -> Access Keystrokes Before Application Processing -> Capture Sensitive Data (Passwords, API Keys, etc.)](./attack_tree_paths/keylogging_-_access_keystrokes_before_application_processing_-_capture_sensitive_data__passwords__ap_0492f3fb.md)

A compromised FlorisBoard can record all keystrokes entered by the user before they are processed by the application. This allows attackers to capture sensitive information like passwords, API keys, and personal data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering Targeting FlorisBoard Users -> Trick Users into Installing Malicious FlorisBoard Variants](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_targeting_florisboard_users_-_trick_users_into_installing_malicious_florisboard_v_a5267dc6.md)

Attackers use social engineering techniques to persuade users to install fake or compromised versions of FlorisBoard, often by mimicking official sources or promising additional features.
