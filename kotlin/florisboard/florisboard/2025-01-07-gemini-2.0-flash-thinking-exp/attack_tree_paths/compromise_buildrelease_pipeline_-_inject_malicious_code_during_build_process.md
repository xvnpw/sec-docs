**Prerequisites for the Attack:**

For attackers to successfully inject malicious code during the build process, they typically need to achieve one or more of the following:

* **Access to the Build Environment:** This is the primary target. Attackers need access to the servers, virtual machines, or containers where the build process takes place. This could be achieved through:
    * **Compromised Credentials:** Obtaining valid usernames and passwords for accounts with access to the build environment.
    * **Exploiting Vulnerabilities:** Leveraging vulnerabilities in the build tools, operating systems, or infrastructure components.
    * **Insider Threat:** A malicious or compromised insider with legitimate access.
    * **Supply Chain Compromise (Indirect):** Compromising a dependency or tool used in the build process, allowing them to inject malicious code indirectly.
* **Ability to Modify Build Scripts/Configurations:** Attackers need to be able to alter the scripts, configuration files, or build tools used to compile and package FlorisBoard.
* **Knowledge of the Build Process:** Understanding how the build process works is crucial for successfully injecting malicious code without causing obvious errors or disrupting the build.
* **Persistence Mechanisms:**  Attackers might try to establish persistence within the build environment to maintain access and potentially inject malicious code in future builds.

**Detailed Attack Vectors:**

Here are some specific ways attackers could inject malicious code during the build process:

* **Compromised Build Server:**
    * **Direct Access:** Gaining direct access to the build server and modifying the source code before compilation or injecting malicious code during the compilation process itself.
    * **Manipulating Build Scripts:** Modifying build scripts (e.g., `Gradle` files in Android development) to download and execute malicious payloads or include malicious libraries.
    * **Replacing Legitimate Tools:** Substituting legitimate build tools with trojanized versions that inject malicious code during their execution.
* **Compromised Version Control System (VCS) Integration:**
    * **Malicious Commits:** Injecting malicious code into the source code repository (e.g., GitHub) if the attacker gains access to developer accounts or exploits vulnerabilities in the VCS. This code would then be incorporated into the build.
    * **Compromised CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:** Modifying the CI/CD pipeline configuration (e.g., GitHub Actions workflows) to introduce malicious steps or dependencies during the build process.
* **Compromised Dependency Management:**
    * **Dependency Confusion Attack:** Uploading malicious packages with similar names to legitimate dependencies to public repositories, hoping the build process will mistakenly pull the malicious version.
    * **Compromised Private Repositories:** If FlorisBoard uses private dependency repositories, attackers could target these repositories to inject malicious code into dependencies.
* **Compromised Artifact Repository:**
    * **Replacing Legitimate Artifacts:** If pre-built components or libraries are used, attackers could replace these with malicious versions in the artifact repository.
* **Compromised Developer Workstations (Indirect):**
    * **Backdoored Development Tools:** If developer workstations are compromised, attackers could inject malicious code into the development environment, which could then be inadvertently included in the committed code.
* **Supply Chain Attacks on Build Tooling:**
    * **Compromising Build Tools:** Attackers could target the developers of the build tools themselves (e.g., Gradle plugins) to inject malicious code that affects all projects using those tools.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
