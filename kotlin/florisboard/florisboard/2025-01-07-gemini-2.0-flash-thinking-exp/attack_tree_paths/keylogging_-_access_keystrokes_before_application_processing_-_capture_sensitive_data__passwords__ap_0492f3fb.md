## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Keylogging on FlorisBoard

This analysis delves into the attack path "Keylogging -> Access Keystrokes Before Application Processing -> Capture Sensitive Data (Passwords, API Keys, etc.)" targeting FlorisBoard. We will examine the technical feasibility, potential impact, mitigation strategies, and detection methods from a cybersecurity perspective, aiming to provide actionable insights for the development team.

**Understanding the Attack Path:**

This attack path exploits the fundamental nature of a software keyboard. Before any application receives and processes user input, the keyboard application itself intercepts and handles the keystrokes. A compromised FlorisBoard, acting as a malicious keylogger, can leverage this position to record keystrokes *before* they reach the intended application. This bypasses any application-level security measures like input sanitization or encryption applied later in the processing pipeline.

**Detailed Analysis of Each Stage:**

**1. Keylogging:**

* **Mechanism:** A compromised FlorisBoard would need to implement code that actively listens for and records keystroke events. This could involve:
    * **Hooking into the Android Input Method Framework (IMF):** FlorisBoard, as an input method, interacts directly with the IMF. A malicious modification could intercept the `onKeyDown()` and `onKeyUp()` events for all keys pressed.
    * **Utilizing Accessibility Services (if granted):** While not strictly necessary for basic keylogging within the keyboard itself, a compromised FlorisBoard with accessibility permissions could gain even broader access to input events and screen content, potentially enhancing the keylogging capabilities.
    * **Custom Native Code:**  Attackers could introduce native code (e.g., using the Android NDK) to perform low-level keyboard event interception, potentially making detection more difficult.
* **Feasibility:**  Technically feasible. As the core function of a keyboard is to process keystrokes, modifying it to record these events is a logical step for an attacker. The Android IMF provides the necessary hooks for this functionality.
* **Challenges for the Attacker:**
    * **Initial Compromise:** The primary challenge is gaining the ability to inject malicious code into the FlorisBoard application. This could involve:
        * **Supply Chain Attack:** Compromising the official build process or repository.
        * **Malicious Update:** Distributing a compromised version through unofficial channels or exploiting vulnerabilities in the update mechanism.
        * **Local Device Compromise:** If the attacker has physical access or remote access to the user's device, they could sideload a modified version of FlorisBoard.
    * **Maintaining Persistence:** The malicious code needs to remain active even after device reboots or application updates (if not addressed by the attacker).

**2. Access Keystrokes Before Application Processing:**

* **Mechanism:** The compromised FlorisBoard, having intercepted the keystrokes, can store them in various ways:
    * **In-memory storage:** Temporarily storing keystrokes in the application's memory. This is less persistent but easier to implement initially.
    * **Local file storage:** Writing keystrokes to a file on the device's storage. This provides persistence but might be easier to detect.
    * **Remote exfiltration:** Sending the captured keystrokes to a remote server controlled by the attacker. This is the ultimate goal for the attacker but requires network access and a command-and-control infrastructure.
* **Feasibility:**  Highly feasible. Once keylogging is established, accessing the raw keystroke data before it's passed to other applications is the natural next step. The keyboard application has direct access to this information.
* **Challenges for the Attacker:**
    * **Data Management:**  Efficiently storing and managing potentially large volumes of keystroke data.
    * **Avoiding Detection:**  Storing data in a way that doesn't trigger security alerts or excessive resource usage.
    * **Exfiltration:** Securely and reliably transmitting the data without being intercepted or raising suspicion.

**3. Capture Sensitive Data (Passwords, API Keys, etc.):**

* **Mechanism:**  The attacker analyzes the captured keystroke logs to identify sensitive information. This could involve:
    * **Pattern Matching:** Searching for common password patterns, email addresses, website URLs, or keywords like "password," "API key," "secret," etc.
    * **Contextual Analysis:**  Identifying keystrokes entered within specific applications (e.g., banking apps, password managers, developer tools) to narrow down potential targets.
    * **Advanced Techniques:**  Using machine learning or other advanced techniques to analyze the keystroke patterns and identify sensitive data more effectively.
* **Feasibility:**  Highly likely to be successful. Users frequently type sensitive information on their devices. While not every keystroke will be valuable, the sheer volume of captured data increases the probability of capturing critical credentials.
* **Challenges for the Attacker:**
    * **Data Volume and Noise:**  Filtering out irrelevant keystrokes and focusing on valuable information.
    * **Encryption:** If the user is typing into an application that encrypts the input client-side (before the keyboard processes it), the captured keystrokes might be encrypted and unusable. However, this is less common for general text input.
    * **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** While keylogging can capture the primary password, it might not capture the 2FA code if it's generated on a separate device or through a different method. However, if the user types the 2FA code on the same keyboard, it can still be compromised.

**Potential Impact:**

The impact of a successful attack via this path can be severe:

* **Confidentiality Breach:**  Exposure of sensitive credentials like passwords, API keys, personal information, financial details, and private communications.
* **Account Takeover:** Attackers can use stolen credentials to access user accounts on various platforms, leading to financial loss, identity theft, and reputational damage.
* **Data Exfiltration:**  Access to sensitive data within applications, potentially leading to corporate espionage or privacy violations.
* **Malware Distribution:**  Compromised accounts can be used to spread malware to the user's contacts or within their organization.
* **Loss of Trust:**  Users may lose trust in the security and privacy of FlorisBoard and the Android ecosystem.

**Mitigation Strategies for the Development Team:**

To prevent this attack path, the FlorisBoard development team should implement the following security measures:

* **Secure Development Practices:**
    * **Code Reviews:** Rigorous peer review of all code changes to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    * **Static and Dynamic Analysis:** Employ automated tools to scan the codebase for security flaws.
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization (though less relevant before processing, still important for other areas):** While this attack bypasses application-level validation, robust input handling within FlorisBoard itself can prevent other types of vulnerabilities.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure the keyboard application only requests and uses necessary permissions.
* **Supply Chain Security:**
    * **Secure Build Environment:** Protect the build process from unauthorized access and modifications.
    * **Code Signing:** Digitally sign all releases to ensure authenticity and integrity.
    * **Dependency Management:** Carefully manage and audit third-party libraries and dependencies for vulnerabilities.
* **Protection Against Compromise:**
    * **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Proactively identify and address vulnerabilities.
    * **Secure Update Mechanism:** Implement a secure and reliable mechanism for delivering updates to users, preventing malicious updates.
    * **Integrity Checks:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of the installed FlorisBoard application, allowing users to detect if it has been tampered with.
* **User Education:**
    * **Inform users about the risks of sideloading applications from untrusted sources.**
    * **Encourage users to keep their devices and applications updated.**
* **Runtime Protections:**
    * **Consider implementing runtime integrity checks within the application to detect unauthorized modifications.**
    * **Utilize Android security features like SafetyNet Attestation to verify the integrity of the device environment.**

**Detection Strategies:**

While prevention is key, detecting a compromised FlorisBoard is also important:

* **Anomaly Detection:** Monitor the application's behavior for unusual activity, such as:
    * **Excessive resource usage (CPU, memory, network).**
    * **Unexplained network connections.**
    * **Suspicious file access or creation.**
    * **Unexpected permission requests.**
* **User Reports:** Encourage users to report any suspicious behavior they observe.
* **Security Scanners:**  Utilize mobile security scanners that can detect known malware signatures or suspicious behavior in installed applications.
* **Network Monitoring:**  For enterprise deployments, monitoring network traffic for unusual data exfiltration from devices running FlorisBoard.
* **Code Analysis:**  If a compromise is suspected, performing forensic analysis of the installed application's code.

**Assumptions:**

This analysis assumes:

* **The attacker's primary goal is to capture sensitive data for malicious purposes.**
* **The attacker has the technical skills to develop and deploy malicious code within the FlorisBoard application.**
