# Attack Surface Analysis for florisboard/florisboard

## Attack Surface: [Keystroke Logging and Data Exfiltration](./attack_surfaces/keystroke_logging_and_data_exfiltration.md)

**Description:** A compromised or malicious FlorisBoard could record keystrokes entered by the user within the application, potentially capturing sensitive information.

**How FlorisBoard Contributes:** As the active keyboard, FlorisBoard has direct access to all text input entered by the user.

**Example:** A malicious FlorisBoard logs usernames and passwords entered by the user in the application's login form and sends this data to a remote server.

**Impact:** Exposure of credentials, personal data, financial information, and other sensitive data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developer:**  Implement features like secure input fields that might restrict keyboard access or provide additional security layers. Consider using alternative input methods for sensitive data.
* **User:**  Use trusted keyboard applications from reputable sources. Regularly review the permissions granted to the keyboard. Be aware of potential phishing attempts that might trick you into using a malicious keyboard.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Update Mechanism](./attack_surfaces/insecure_update_mechanism.md)

**Description:** If FlorisBoard's update mechanism is insecure, an attacker could potentially push malicious updates to the user's device.

**How FlorisBoard Contributes:** The keyboard application is responsible for its own updates.

**Example:** An attacker compromises FlorisBoard's update server and pushes a malicious update containing spyware or other malware.

**Impact:** Installation of malware, data breaches, device compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developer (of FlorisBoard):** Implement secure update mechanisms with proper signing and verification of updates. Use HTTPS for update downloads.
* **User:** Enable automatic updates for FlorisBoard to receive security patches. Download the keyboard from official and trusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Accessibility Service Abuse (If Enabled)](./attack_surfaces/accessibility_service_abuse__if_enabled_.md)

**Description:** If the user grants FlorisBoard accessibility service permissions, a compromised keyboard could abuse these privileges to perform actions on behalf of the user or access sensitive information displayed on the screen.

**How FlorisBoard Contributes:**  Accessibility services grant broad access to the user interface.

**Example:** A malicious FlorisBoard with accessibility access could automatically approve permissions requests or interact with other applications without the user's explicit consent.

**Impact:** Unauthorized actions, data theft, privacy violations.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developer:**  Be mindful of how accessibility services might interact with the application and implement safeguards against potential abuse.
* **User:**  Grant accessibility service permissions only to trusted applications and understand the implications of granting such permissions. Avoid granting accessibility permissions to keyboard applications unless absolutely necessary for specific features.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Input Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_input_injection.md)

**Description:** The application receives untrusted text input from FlorisBoard, which could contain malicious payloads.

**How FlorisBoard Contributes:** FlorisBoard acts as the direct source of text input. A compromised or malicious keyboard can inject arbitrary strings.

**Example:** A malicious FlorisBoard injects a `<script>alert("XSS")</script>` string into a text field, which is then displayed by the application without proper sanitization, leading to Cross-Site Scripting.

**Impact:** Code execution within the user's browser (XSS), unauthorized database modifications (SQL Injection), execution of arbitrary commands on the server (Command Injection), access to sensitive files (Path Traversal).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developer:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data received from text fields. Use parameterized queries for database interactions. Employ context-aware output encoding when displaying user-provided content.
* **User:**  Be cautious about granting permissions to third-party keyboards. Regularly update the keyboard application.
