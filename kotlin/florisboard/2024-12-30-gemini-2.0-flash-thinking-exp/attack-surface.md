*   **Attack Surface:** Keylogging and Input Manipulation
    *   **Description:**  The keyboard captures all user input. Vulnerabilities can allow unauthorized access to this data or manipulation of the input before it reaches the application.
    *   **How FlorisBoard Contributes:** As the input method, FlorisBoard is the primary point of capture for keystrokes. Bugs or malicious code within FlorisBoard directly enable keylogging or input manipulation.
    *   **Example:** A compromised FlorisBoard could record usernames, passwords, credit card details, or sensitive messages entered by the user within the application. It could also inject malicious characters or commands into text fields.
    *   **Impact:**  Loss of sensitive user credentials, financial information theft, unauthorized access to accounts, data breaches, and potential command injection vulnerabilities within the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Thoroughly audit FlorisBoard's source code for potential vulnerabilities.
            *   Regularly update the integrated FlorisBoard version to benefit from security patches.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Only install FlorisBoard from trusted sources (e.g., official repositories).
            *   Keep FlorisBoard updated to the latest version.
            *   Be cautious about granting FlorisBoard unnecessary permissions.

*   **Attack Surface:** Data Exfiltration through Keyboard
    *   **Description:** A compromised keyboard could transmit captured keystrokes or other sensitive data to an external attacker.
    *   **How FlorisBoard Contributes:** If FlorisBoard has network access (either intentionally or due to a vulnerability), it could be used to send data outside the device.
    *   **Example:** A malicious version of FlorisBoard could silently send all typed text messages, emails, or login credentials to a remote server controlled by an attacker.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive user data, including personal information, financial details, and confidential communications.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Minimize the need for FlorisBoard to have network access. If required, ensure secure communication protocols (HTTPS) are used and the destination server is legitimate.
            *   Implement integrity checks to ensure the installed FlorisBoard hasn't been tampered with.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Review the permissions granted to FlorisBoard. Be wary of keyboards requesting unnecessary network access.

*   **Attack Surface:** Exploitation of Accessibility Services
    *   **Description:** Keyboards often utilize Android's Accessibility Services, which provide broad access to system events and UI elements. Vulnerabilities in the keyboard's implementation can be exploited.
    *   **How FlorisBoard Contributes:** If FlorisBoard's use of Accessibility Services is flawed, it could grant attackers unintended access to interact with other applications or system settings.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in FlorisBoard's accessibility service implementation could allow an attacker to simulate user interactions in other apps, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data theft.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized control over the device and other applications, data theft from other apps, potential for privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Carefully review and minimize the scope of Accessibility Services requested by FlorisBoard.
            *   Follow secure coding practices when implementing Accessibility Service functionalities.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Be cautious about granting Accessibility Service permissions to keyboards and other apps. Only grant them if absolutely necessary and from trusted sources.

*   **Attack Surface:** Supply Chain Compromise
    *   **Description:** The FlorisBoard project itself could be compromised, leading to malicious code being included in official releases.
    *   **How FlorisBoard Contributes:** If the FlorisBoard repository or build process is compromised, the resulting keyboard application will inherently be malicious.
    *   **Example:** Attackers could inject keylogging code or a backdoor into the FlorisBoard codebase, which would then be distributed to all users.
    *   **Impact:**  Widespread compromise of applications using FlorisBoard, massive data breaches, loss of user trust.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Stay informed about the security posture of the FlorisBoard project and its maintainers.
            *   Consider using code signing and verification mechanisms to ensure the integrity of the FlorisBoard binary.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Monitor the FlorisBoard project for any signs of compromise or suspicious activity.
            *   Prefer installing from well-established and reputable sources.
