Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces that directly involve MaterialFiles, focusing on high and critical severity issues:

*   **Attack Surface:** Path Traversal via File Operations
    *   **Description:** Attackers could manipulate file paths provided to MaterialFiles for operations like renaming, moving, or deleting files to access or modify files outside the intended directory.
    *   **How MaterialFiles Contributes:** If the application directly passes user-controlled input (e.g., through a file rename dialog) to MaterialFiles' underlying file operation logic without proper server-side validation, MaterialFiles will execute the operation with the provided path.
    *   **Example:** A user could enter "../../../etc/passwd" as the new name for a file, and if the backend doesn't validate this, MaterialFiles might attempt to rename a file in the system's root directory.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, modification or deletion of critical system files, potentially leading to system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict server-side validation and sanitization of all file paths received from the client before passing them to MaterialFiles or any file system operations. Use absolute paths or canonicalize paths to prevent traversal. Avoid directly using user input to construct file paths.

*   **Attack Surface:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious File Names
    *   **Description:** Attackers could upload or create files with names containing malicious JavaScript code. When MaterialFiles displays these file names without proper output encoding, the script could execute in the user's browser.
    *   **How MaterialFiles Contributes:** MaterialFiles is responsible for rendering the file names it receives from the backend. If the backend doesn't properly sanitize or encode these names, MaterialFiles will display them verbatim, potentially executing embedded scripts.
    *   **Example:** A file named `<script>alert("XSS")</script>.txt` is uploaded. When MaterialFiles renders the file list, the browser executes the script, displaying an alert.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the application, and other client-side attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust server-side output encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding) for all file names before sending them to the client for display in MaterialFiles. Ensure the backend sanitizes file names upon upload or creation to remove or neutralize potentially harmful characters.

*   **Attack Surface:** Client-Side Vulnerabilities in MaterialFiles Library
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities might exist within the JavaScript code of the MaterialFiles library itself. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary JavaScript within the user's browser when they interact with the file manager.
    *   **How MaterialFiles Contributes:** As a client-side library, any security flaws in MaterialFiles' code directly expose the application to client-side attacks.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in MaterialFiles' event handling could be exploited to trigger unintended actions or execute malicious code when a user clicks on a specific element in the file manager.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, data theft, unauthorized actions within the application, redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Regularly update the MaterialFiles library to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities. Conduct security reviews and static analysis of the MaterialFiles code if possible or rely on community security assessments. Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating some client-side attacks.
