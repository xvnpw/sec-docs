Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Mavericks, with high and critical risk severity:

* **Insecure State Management:**
    * **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from improper handling, storage, or transmission of the application's state managed by Mavericks, leading to exposure or manipulation of sensitive data.
    * **How Mavericks Contributes:** Mavericks centralizes application state, making it a prime target if not secured. Improper serialization, lack of encryption, or insufficient access controls on state data directly managed by Mavericks can be exploited.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to serialized Mavericks state stored locally (e.g., for debugging) containing sensitive user credentials in plaintext, directly due to how Mavericks handles state persistence.
    * **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive user information, potential for state manipulation leading to unauthorized actions and complete compromise of user accounts or application functionality.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Absolutely avoid storing sensitive data directly in the Mavericks state if at all possible.
            * If sensitive data is unavoidable, enforce robust encryption *before* it is managed by Mavericks within the state.
            * Implement secure, custom serialization mechanisms, explicitly avoiding default serialization for any part of the Mavericks state containing sensitive information.
            * Ensure stringent access controls are in place for any persistent storage of the Mavericks state, preventing unauthorized access to the underlying data structures managed by Mavericks.
            * Conduct regular security reviews of the Mavericks state structure and data flow to proactively identify potential exposure points and vulnerabilities related to Mavericks' state management.

* **Injection through MvRx `ViewEvents`:**
    * **Description:**  Attackers injecting malicious data through user interactions or external inputs that directly trigger `ViewEvents`, leading to unintended and potentially harmful state changes or actions within the Mavericks-managed application.
    * **How Mavericks Contributes:** `ViewEvents` are the fundamental mechanism within Mavericks for updating the application's state based on external stimuli. Insufficient validation of data passed through these events directly allows for malicious manipulation of the Mavericks state.
    * **Example:** A `ViewEvent` takes a user-provided string as input to update a text field in the Mavericks state. An attacker injects a malicious script tag within this string, which is then rendered by the UI because the Mavericks state was updated without sanitization, leading to a client-side XSS vulnerability.
    * **Impact:** Client-side scripting attacks (XSS) allowing for session hijacking, cookie theft, and redirection to malicious sites, directly resulting from the ability to manipulate the UI via the Mavericks state.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * **Mandatory and rigorous validation and sanitization of *all* data received through `ViewEvents` *before* it is used to update the Mavericks state.**
            * Employ context-aware output encoding when displaying data originating from the Mavericks state in the UI to prevent the execution of injected scripts.
            * Implement robust input validation on the UI side as a first line of defense to prevent malicious data from even reaching the `ViewEvent` handlers that interact with the Mavericks state.
            * Strongly consider using type-safe data structures and data transfer objects (DTOs) for `ViewEvent` parameters to limit the possibility of injecting unexpected data types that could be exploited.

* **Vulnerabilities in Custom MvRx Component Side Effects:**
    * **Description:** Security flaws introduced within the logic of custom MvRx components that handle side effects, leading to potentially severe consequences due to insecure operations triggered by Mavericks state changes.
    * **How Mavericks Contributes:** Mavericks provides the architecture for managing side effects triggered by state changes within custom components. If these side effects are implemented insecurely, the framework itself facilitates the execution of these vulnerable operations.
    * **Example:** A custom MvRx component, upon a specific state change, makes an API call using data directly from the Mavericks state without proper sanitization. An attacker manipulates the state to inject a malicious URL, leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability executed through the Mavericks component's side effect.
    * **Impact:** Server-side vulnerabilities such as SSRF, remote code execution, or unauthorized data access, all triggered by the ability to influence the Mavericks state and its associated side effects.
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature of the vulnerability and the impact of the side effect).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Adhere to strict secure coding practices when developing custom MvRx components, especially when handling side effects.
            * **Mandatory validation and sanitization of *all* input data used within side effects (e.g., API calls, database interactions) triggered by Mavericks state changes.**
            * Implement robust authorization checks *before* triggering any sensitive side effects from within Mavericks components.
            * Exercise extreme caution when managing asynchronous operations within Mavericks components, ensuring proper error handling and preventing race conditions that could lead to exploitable states.
            * Conduct thorough security code reviews and penetration testing specifically targeting the logic within custom MvRx components and their associated side effects.
