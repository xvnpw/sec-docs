# Attack Surface Analysis for oracle/helidon

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Files Exposure](./attack_surfaces/configuration_files_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information within Helidon configuration files (e.g., `application.yaml`, `application.properties`) is exposed to unauthorized access.
*   **Helidon Contribution:** Helidon *directly* uses configuration files as a primary mechanism for application settings, including security parameters, database credentials, and API keys. Misconfiguration or insecure deployment *directly* exposes these Helidon-managed files.
*   **Example:** A developer deploys a Helidon application and leaves the `application.yaml` file accessible via the web server, allowing an attacker to download it and retrieve database credentials configured for the Helidon application.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the database, unauthorized access to internal systems, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure File Storage:** Store Helidon configuration files outside the web server's document root.
    *   **Restrict Access:** Implement strict access controls to configuration files, limiting access to only authorized users and processes.
    *   **Externalized Configuration:** Utilize environment variables, HashiCorp Vault, or Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive data instead of storing them directly in Helidon configuration files.
    *   **Configuration Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data within Helidon configuration files if externalization is not fully feasible.

## Attack Surface: [Default Configurations](./attack_surfaces/default_configurations.md)

*   **Description:**  Using insecure default settings provided by Helidon or its underlying components without proper hardening.
*   **Helidon Contribution:** Helidon *directly* provides default configurations for ease of initial setup. These defaults, managed by Helidon, may not be suitable for production environments and can introduce vulnerabilities if left unchanged in a Helidon application.
*   **Example:** A developer deploys a Helidon application using the default HTTP port and without enabling TLS/SSL, relying on Helidon's default settings. An attacker can intercept unencrypted traffic to the Helidon application, potentially capturing sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Data interception, man-in-the-middle attacks, exposure of internal services, DoS attacks due to unoptimized settings.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Review and Harden Defaults:** Thoroughly review all default configurations provided by Helidon and its components (e.g., Netty, Micrometer) and harden them for production.
    *   **Follow Security Best Practices:** Adhere to security hardening guides and best practices specifically for Helidon applications.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Configure Helidon services with the minimum necessary permissions and access levels.

## Attack Surface: [Netty Version Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/netty_version_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting known security vulnerabilities in the specific version of Netty used by Helidon SE.
*   **Helidon Contribution:** Helidon SE *directly* embeds and relies on Netty as its web server. Vulnerabilities in Netty *directly* impact Helidon applications. Helidon's dependency management choices determine the Netty version used.
*   **Example:** A known vulnerability exists in the version of Netty bundled with a deployed Helidon application that allows for a Denial of Service attack. An attacker exploits this Netty vulnerability, causing the Helidon application to become unavailable.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, potential Remote Code Execution (in severe cases), Helidon application instability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific Netty vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly Update Helidon:** Keep the Helidon framework updated to the latest stable versions, which typically include updated and patched dependencies like Netty.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Implement dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Netty and other dependencies used by Helidon.
    *   **Security Monitoring:** Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for Netty and Helidon.

## Attack Surface: [Security Interceptors/Filters Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/security_interceptorsfilters_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured security interceptors or filters in Helidon leading to authorization bypasses or authentication flaws.
*   **Helidon Contribution:** Helidon *directly* provides security interceptors and filters as the framework's mechanism for implementing authentication and authorization. Misconfiguration of these *Helidon* components creates security gaps within the application.
*   **Example:** A developer incorrectly configures a *Helidon* security interceptor, failing to properly enforce authorization checks on a critical endpoint. An unauthenticated user can bypass the intended *Helidon* security and access sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Security Testing:** Conduct comprehensive security testing, including penetration testing and code reviews, specifically focusing on *Helidon's* security interceptor and filter configurations.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege in Authorization:** Implement authorization policies within *Helidon* based on the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Centralized Security Configuration:** Centralize *Helidon* security configuration and policies to ensure consistency and reduce misconfiguration.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews of *Helidon* security interceptor and filter configurations.

## Attack Surface: [JWT Implementation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/jwt_implementation_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting weaknesses in the JWT (JSON Web Token) implementation or configuration when used for authentication in Helidon applications.
*   **Helidon Contribution:** Helidon *directly* offers built-in support for JWT-based authentication as a framework feature. Vulnerabilities in *Helidon's* JWT handling or configuration can be exploited.
*   **Example:** A developer uses a weak secret key for signing JWTs in a *Helidon* application, relying on *Helidon's* JWT features. An attacker can compromise the secret key and forge valid JWTs to impersonate users within the *Helidon* application.
*   **Impact:** Authentication bypass, unauthorized access, account takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Secret Keys:** Use strong, randomly generated, and securely stored secret keys for JWT signing within *Helidon*.
    *   **Algorithm Selection:** Use robust and recommended JWT signing algorithms (e.g., RS256, ES256) supported by *Helidon* and avoid deprecated or weak algorithms.
    *   **JWT Validation:** Implement proper JWT validation using *Helidon's* JWT features, including signature verification, expiration checks, and audience/issuer validation.
