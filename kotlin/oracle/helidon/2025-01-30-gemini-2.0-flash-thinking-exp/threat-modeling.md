# Threat Model Analysis for oracle/helidon

## Threat: [Configuration Injection](./threats/configuration_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers could inject malicious configuration values into Helidon applications by manipulating external configuration sources (e.g., environment variables, system properties) if these are not properly sanitized by Helidon's configuration system. This could lead to arbitrary code execution within the application if the injected configuration is used in a vulnerable way, or to significant modification of application behavior leading to compromise.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary Code Execution, System Compromise, Denial of Service
    *   **Helidon Component Affected:** Configuration System, potentially application code that relies on configuration
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate all external configuration inputs *within the application code* as Helidon framework itself might not provide sufficient built-in sanitization for all use cases.
        *   Avoid directly using untrusted external input in configuration values that control critical application logic or resource access.
        *   Use parameterized configuration or templating mechanisms to prevent injection vulnerabilities in configuration processing.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization in application code that consumes configuration, especially when configuration values are used in sensitive operations.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Helidon Dependencies](./threats/vulnerable_helidon_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers could exploit known vulnerabilities in Helidon's dependencies (both direct and transitive) to compromise the application.  Helidon, like any framework, relies on external libraries. If vulnerabilities exist in these libraries, and are not promptly patched, attackers can leverage them for remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service attacks against applications built with Helidon.
    *   **Impact:** Various impacts depending on the vulnerability, including Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, Information Disclosure, Data Breach, System Compromise
    *   **Helidon Component Affected:** Dependency Management, potentially various Helidon modules depending on the vulnerable dependency
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly scan Helidon application dependencies for known vulnerabilities using Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools.
        *   Keep Helidon framework and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches and version upgrades.
        *   Utilize Helidon's Bill of Materials (BOM) to manage dependencies and ensure compatibility and security, but always verify BOM is up to date.
        *   Proactively monitor security advisories related to Helidon and its dependencies and apply patches promptly.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Authentication/Authorization](./threats/misconfigured_authenticationauthorization.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers could exploit misconfigurations in Helidon's security features (Authentication and Authorization modules) to bypass security controls and gain unauthorized access to protected resources and functionalities.  Incorrectly configured security policies, overly permissive access rules, or flaws in custom security implementations within Helidon can lead to significant security breaches.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized Access, Data Breach, Privilege Escalation, System Compromise
    *   **Helidon Component Affected:** Security Modules (e.g., Security, JWT, OAuth2), Application Security Configuration
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly understand and correctly configure Helidon's security features, paying close attention to documentation and best practices.
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization policies based on the principle of least privilege, ensuring only necessary access is granted.
        *   Regularly review and rigorously test security configurations, including access control rules and authentication mechanisms, to ensure they are effective and prevent bypasses.
        *   Utilize Helidon's built-in security providers and mechanisms where possible to reduce the risk of errors in custom security implementations.
        *   Implement automated security testing specifically for authentication and authorization flows within the Helidon application.

## Threat: [Bypass of Helidon Security Filters](./threats/bypass_of_helidon_security_filters.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers could discover and exploit vulnerabilities or logical flaws in Helidon's security filter implementation or routing mechanisms that allow them to circumvent security checks and access protected resources without proper authentication or authorization. This could be due to bugs within the Helidon framework itself or subtle misconfigurations that are not immediately obvious.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized Access, Data Breach, Privilege Escalation, System Compromise
    *   **Helidon Component Affected:** Security Filters, Routing Mechanism, WebServer
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Helidon framework updated to the latest version, ensuring timely application of security patches released by the Helidon project.
        *   Thoroughly test security filters and routing configurations, including negative testing and edge cases, to ensure they are correctly implemented and effectively prevent unauthorized access.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when implementing custom security filters or handlers, avoiding common security pitfalls.
        *   Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits, specifically targeting the security filter and routing mechanisms of the Helidon application, to identify potential bypass vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exposed Management Ports/Endpoints with Insecure JMX (if used)](./threats/exposed_management_portsendpoints_with_insecure_jmx__if_used_.md)

*   **Description:** If Helidon applications expose JMX (Java Management Extensions) for monitoring and management, and this JMX interface is not properly secured (e.g., exposed without authentication or with weak credentials), attackers could exploit it.  Unsecured JMX can allow remote code execution by attackers who can manipulate MBeans (Managed Beans) within the Java Virtual Machine. This is a critical vulnerability if JMX is exposed to untrusted networks.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, System Compromise, Data Breach, Denial of Service
    *   **Helidon Component Affected:** JMX Integration (if used), Management Features, WebServer
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if JMX is insecurely exposed)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strongly avoid exposing JMX to public or untrusted networks.** If JMX is necessary, restrict access to a dedicated management network or VPN accessible only to authorized administrators.
        *   **Implement robust authentication and authorization for JMX access.** Use strong passwords or certificate-based authentication and enforce role-based access control.
        *   If JMX is not strictly required for production monitoring, **disable JMX entirely** in production deployments to eliminate this attack vector.
        *   Regularly audit JMX configurations and access logs to ensure security controls are in place and effective.
        *   Consider using alternative, more secure monitoring and management solutions instead of relying on JMX, especially in internet-facing applications.
