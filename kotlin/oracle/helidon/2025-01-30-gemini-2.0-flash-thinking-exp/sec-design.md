# BUSINESS POSTURE

Helidon is a cloud-native, open-source framework for building microservices and cloud applications in Java. It is designed to be lightweight, fast, and efficient, enabling developers to create applications that are easy to deploy and scale in modern cloud environments. The primary business goal of Helidon is to simplify and accelerate the development of microservices by providing a set of libraries and tools that are optimized for cloud-native architectures.

Business priorities for projects using Helidon would typically include:
- Rapid application development and deployment to meet market demands.
- Efficient resource utilization and cost optimization in cloud environments.
- Scalability and resilience of applications to handle varying workloads.
- Maintainability and ease of updates for long-term application lifecycle.

Key business risks associated with using Helidon and similar frameworks include:
- Complexity of microservices architecture leading to development and operational challenges.
- Security vulnerabilities in the framework or applications built on it, potentially leading to data breaches or service disruptions.
- Vendor lock-in if relying heavily on specific Helidon features or Oracle Cloud integrations.
- Performance bottlenecks if applications are not properly designed and optimized for Helidon.
- Operational risks associated with deploying and managing distributed microservices in cloud environments.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for the Helidon project and applications built with it:
- security control: Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) - assumed to be in place, including code reviews, testing, and security considerations during design and development. (Location: General software development best practices)
- security control: Dependency Management - using Maven or Gradle to manage dependencies, allowing for updates and vulnerability patching of libraries. (Location: Build files - pom.xml, build.gradle)
- security control: Input Validation - developers are expected to implement input validation within their applications using Helidon APIs or standard Java libraries. (Location: Application code)
- security control: Authentication and Authorization - Helidon provides APIs and integrations for implementing authentication and authorization in applications. (Location: Helidon Security documentation and libraries)
- security control: Cryptography - Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) is available for cryptographic operations within Helidon applications. (Location: Java standard library, Helidon documentation for secure communication)
- accepted risk: Open Source Dependencies - reliance on open-source libraries introduces potential vulnerabilities that need to be managed through dependency scanning and updates.
- accepted risk: Developer Security Awareness - security of applications depends on the security knowledge and practices of developers using Helidon.

Recommended security controls to implement for projects using Helidon:
- recommended security control: Automated Security Scanning - integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities in code and deployed applications.
- recommended security control: Dependency Vulnerability Scanning - automate scanning of project dependencies for known vulnerabilities and ensure timely updates.
- recommended security control: Security Hardening - follow security hardening guidelines for Helidon applications and deployment environments, including secure configuration and least privilege principles.
- recommended security control: Security Training - provide security training for developers on secure coding practices, common vulnerabilities, and Helidon security features.
- recommended security control: Penetration Testing - conduct regular penetration testing of deployed applications to identify and address security weaknesses.

Security requirements for projects using Helidon:
- Authentication:
  - Requirement: Securely authenticate users or services accessing Helidon applications.
  - Requirement: Support various authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, JWT, and basic authentication.
  - Requirement: Centralized authentication service for microservices architecture.

  - Requirement: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) mechanisms.
  - Requirement: Policy enforcement points to ensure consistent authorization across services.
- Input Validation:
  - Requirement: Validate all inputs to Helidon applications to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
  - Requirement: Use appropriate validation techniques for different input types (e.g., data type validation, format validation, range validation).
  - Requirement: Sanitize user inputs before processing or storing them.
- Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Protect sensitive data in transit and at rest using strong encryption algorithms.
  - Requirement: Securely manage cryptographic keys and certificates.
  - Requirement: Implement HTTPS for all communication channels to ensure confidentiality and integrity.
  - Requirement: Consider encryption for sensitive data stored in databases or configuration files.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes protected by Helidon applications:
- This depends entirely on the specific applications built using Helidon. Examples could include:
    - E-commerce transactions processing.
    - Financial data processing.
    - Customer data management.
    - Critical infrastructure control systems.

Data being protected and its sensitivity:
- Again, this is application-specific. Data sensitivity can range from public information to highly confidential data, such as:
    - Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
    - Financial data (credit card numbers, bank account details).
    - Protected Health Information (PHI).
    - Intellectual property.
    - Business secrets.

The sensitivity of data and criticality of business processes will determine the required level of security controls for applications built with Helidon. Applications handling highly sensitive data or supporting critical business processes will require more stringent security measures across all layers (application, infrastructure, and build pipeline).
