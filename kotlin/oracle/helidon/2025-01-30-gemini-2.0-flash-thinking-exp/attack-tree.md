## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Helidon Framework Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_helidon_framework_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Vulnerability in Core Helidon SE/MP [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Code Injection (e.g., RCE via deserialization, template injection) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting malicious input to exploit injection points within Helidon's core framework. This could involve insecure deserialization, template injection flaws, or other code execution vulnerabilities.
        *   **Risk Assessment:**
            *   Likelihood: Low (Framework vulnerabilities are less frequent but possible)
            *   Impact: Critical (Full system compromise, complete control over the application and potentially the server)
            *   Effort: High (Requires deep understanding of the Helidon framework, vulnerability research, and exploit development)
            *   Skill Level: High (Expertise in vulnerability research, exploit development, and framework internals)
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (Exploitation might be subtle, but post-exploit activity can be detected with proper monitoring)

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Helidon Misconfiguration [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/2___high_risk_path__exploit_helidon_misconfiguration__critical_node_.md)

*   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Insecure Security Configuration:**
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Weak Authentication/Authorization Schemes:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weak or default credentials, brute-forcing authentication, or bypassing poorly implemented authorization checks.
        *   **Risk Assessment:**
            *   Likelihood: Medium to High (Common misconfiguration, especially with default settings or rushed deployments)
            *   Impact: High (Unauthorized access to protected resources, data breaches, account compromise)
            *   Effort: Low to Medium (Brute-force tools are readily available, default credentials are often public knowledge)
            *   Skill Level: Low to Medium (Basic understanding of authentication and authorization, use of common security tools)
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (Brute-force attempts can be logged, but weak authentication schemes themselves are harder to detect passively)
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Permissive CORS Policy:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting overly permissive CORS configurations to launch cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or access sensitive data from unauthorized origins.
        *   **Risk Assessment:**
            *   Likelihood: Medium (Misconfiguration possible, especially during development or when not fully understanding CORS)
            *   Impact: Medium (XSS attacks, data theft, session hijacking, client-side vulnerabilities)
            *   Effort: Low (Basic web attack techniques, browser developer tools)
            *   Skill Level: Low to Medium (Understanding of CORS and XSS vulnerabilities)
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (CORS misconfigurations might be missed in initial testing, XSS detection depends on monitoring and input validation)
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Disabled Security Features (e.g., missing security headers, disabled input validation):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting the absence of security controls like missing security headers (e.g., `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`) or disabled input validation to conduct various attacks.
        *   **Risk Assessment:**
            *   Likelihood: Medium (Oversight in configuration, especially during rapid development or lack of security awareness)
            *   Impact: Medium to High (Increased vulnerability to XSS, clickjacking, injection attacks, depending on the missing feature)
            *   Effort: Low (Identifying missing headers or features is relatively easy using browser tools or security scanners)
            *   Skill Level: Low (Basic security knowledge, familiarity with web security best practices)
            *   Detection Difficulty: Low (Security scanners can easily detect missing headers, input validation issues are harder to assess externally)

*   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Insecure Deployment Environment Configuration (related to Helidon setup):**
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Exposed Management Endpoints (Helidon specific management features):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Accessing and exploiting unprotected Helidon management endpoints (e.g., for metrics, health checks, configuration) to gain control over the application or extract sensitive information.
        *   **Risk Assessment:**
            *   Likelihood: Medium (Management endpoints are sometimes overlooked during security hardening or mistakenly left unprotected)
            *   Impact: High (Full control over application configuration, potential for data breaches, service disruption, or further attacks)
            *   Effort: Low to Medium (Discovering endpoints might require some reconnaissance, exploiting default credentials or lack of authentication is often straightforward)
            *   Skill Level: Low to Medium (Basic web request knowledge, understanding of management interfaces and common security misconfigurations)
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (Access attempts might be logged, but passively detecting unprotected endpoints is harder without active scanning)

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Helidon Dependency Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/3___high_risk_path__exploit_helidon_dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Outdated Helidon Version with Known Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities present in an outdated version of the Helidon framework itself.
        *   **Risk Assessment:**
            *   Likelihood: Medium (Organizations sometimes lag behind on updates due to various reasons like compatibility concerns or lack of patching processes)
            *   Impact: Varies (Depends on the specific CVEs present in the outdated version, could range from information disclosure to remote code execution)
            *   Effort: Low (Identifying the application's Helidon version is usually easy, and CVE databases are publicly accessible)
            *   Skill Level: Low (Basic security knowledge, ability to use CVE databases and identify software versions)
            *   Detection Difficulty: Low (Version information is often exposed in headers or easily discoverable, making it simple to check against known CVEs)

*   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Vulnerable Third-Party Libraries Used by Helidon (Transitive Dependencies):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party libraries that Helidon depends on, including transitive dependencies (libraries that Helidon's direct dependencies rely on).
        *   **Risk Assessment:**
            *   Likelihood: Medium (Transitive dependencies are often overlooked in security assessments, and vulnerabilities in third-party libraries are common)
            *   Impact: Varies (Depends on the vulnerability and the function of the vulnerable library, could range from denial of service to remote code execution)
            *   Effort: Medium (Requires using dependency scanning tools to analyze the dependency tree and identify vulnerable libraries)
            *   Skill Level: Medium (Using security tools, understanding dependency management concepts, and interpreting vulnerability reports)
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (Dependency scanning tools can detect these vulnerabilities, but it requires proactive scanning and integration into development workflows)
