# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for oracle/helidon

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicitly Configure Helidon Security Module](./mitigation_strategies/explicitly_configure_helidon_security_module.md)

### Description:
*   Step 1: Review the default Helidon security configuration. Understand that relying on defaults is insecure.
*   Step 2: Define authentication mechanisms in `security.yaml` or programmatically using Helidon Security APIs. Choose appropriate mechanisms like Basic Authentication, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), or OAuth 2.0 based on application needs and Helidon's supported providers.
*   Step 3: Implement authorization policies using Helidon's role-based access control features. Define roles and permissions in `security.yaml` or programmatically. Use Helidon security annotations like `@RolesAllowed`, `@PermitAll`, `@DenyAll` or programmatic security checks provided by Helidon Security to control access to resources and endpoints.
*   Step 4: Test authentication and authorization thoroughly using Helidon's testing utilities or standard testing frameworks. Ensure only authenticated and authorized users can access protected resources as defined in Helidon security configuration.
*   Step 5: Regularly review and update Helidon security configurations (`security.yaml` or programmatic setup) as application requirements evolve and new Helidon security features are released.

### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   Unauthorized Access (Severity: High) - Attackers gaining access to sensitive data or functionality due to misconfigured or missing Helidon security.
*   Privilege Escalation (Severity: High) - Authorized users gaining access to resources or functionalities beyond their intended permissions due to improperly defined Helidon roles and policies.
*   Data Breach (Severity: High) - Unauthorized access facilitated by weak Helidon security configuration leading to the exposure or exfiltration of sensitive data.
*   Account Takeover (Severity: High) - Attackers compromising user accounts due to weak or missing authentication mechanisms configured within Helidon Security.

### Impact:
*   Unauthorized Access: Significantly Reduces
*   Privilege Escalation: Significantly Reduces
*   Data Breach: Significantly Reduces
*   Account Takeover: Significantly Reduces

### Currently Implemented:
*   Partially implemented in `security.yaml`. Basic Authentication is configured for administrative endpoints using Helidon Security. Role-based access control is defined for a few core functionalities using Helidon Security annotations.

### Missing Implementation:
*   Fine-grained authorization policies using Helidon Security are not fully defined for all application features. OAuth 2.0 integration using Helidon Security providers is missing for external user authentication. Authorization checks using Helidon Security APIs are not consistently applied across all endpoints.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Helidon BOM (Bill of Materials) for Dependency Management](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_helidon_bom__bill_of_materials__for_dependency_management.md)

### Description:
*   Step 1: In your project's `pom.xml` (Maven) or `build.gradle` (Gradle), import the Helidon BOM dependency management provided by Oracle. This ensures consistent and compatible versions of Helidon libraries and their direct dependencies.
*   Step 2: Regularly update the Helidon BOM version to the latest stable release provided by Oracle. This pulls in updated and patched versions of Helidon libraries and their managed dependencies, including security fixes.
*   Step 3: Leverage the dependency management capabilities of Maven or Gradle in conjunction with the Helidon BOM to manage all project dependencies, ensuring compatibility with Helidon and reducing dependency conflicts.

### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   Dependency Vulnerabilities (Severity: High to Critical) - Exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated or insecure dependencies used by Helidon, which can be mitigated by using the BOM to manage versions and updates.
*   Supply Chain Attacks (Severity: Medium to High) - Reduced risk of compromised dependencies due to using versions managed and tested within the Helidon BOM.
*   Dependency Conflicts (Severity: Low to Medium) -  Using the BOM helps prevent dependency conflicts that could indirectly lead to instability or unexpected behavior, potentially exploitable.

### Impact:
*   Dependency Vulnerabilities: Significantly Reduces
*   Supply Chain Attacks: Moderately Reduces (BOM improves dependency management but doesn't eliminate all supply chain risks)
*   Dependency Conflicts: Moderately Reduces

### Currently Implemented:
*   Helidon BOM is used in `pom.xml`. Dependency management is in place using Maven and the Helidon BOM.

### Missing Implementation:
*   While BOM is used, the project doesn't consistently update to the latest Helidon BOM releases, potentially missing out on security patches and dependency updates managed by the BOM.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Helidon Configuration Management](./mitigation_strategies/secure_helidon_configuration_management.md)

### Description:
*   Step 1: Externalize all application configuration from the code using Helidon's configuration system. Utilize Helidon's configuration sources like `application.yaml`, environment variables, or integration with configuration servers supported by Helidon.
*   Step 2: Secure configuration files and sources used by Helidon. Implement access controls to prevent unauthorized modification of configuration files loaded by Helidon. For sensitive configuration (secrets), use dedicated secret management solutions integrated with Helidon configuration, or leverage Helidon's built-in secret support if available.
*   Step 3: Avoid storing sensitive information directly in Helidon configuration files. Use environment variables or secret management solutions that Helidon can access for passwords, API keys, etc.
*   Step 4: Implement configuration validation using Helidon's configuration validation features at application startup to catch misconfigurations early. Define custom validators within Helidon configuration to enforce expected configuration values and formats.
*   Step 5: Restrict access to Helidon's configuration endpoints like `/config` (if enabled) in production environments. Control access using Helidon Security or disable the endpoint entirely if not necessary in production deployments.

### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   Exposure of Sensitive Information (Severity: High) - Accidental or intentional exposure of sensitive configuration data like passwords or API keys managed by Helidon configuration.
*   Configuration Tampering (Severity: High) - Unauthorized modification of configuration loaded by Helidon leading to application malfunction or security breaches.
*   Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium) -  Exposure of configuration details through Helidon's `/config` endpoint to unauthorized users.

### Impact:
*   Exposure of Sensitive Information: Significantly Reduces
*   Configuration Tampering: Significantly Reduces
*   Information Disclosure: Moderately Reduces (depends on endpoint exposure and access control)

### Currently Implemented:
*   Configuration is externalized using `application.yaml` and loaded by Helidon. Environment variables are used for database credentials, accessed through Helidon configuration.

### Missing Implementation:
*   Dedicated secret management solution integrated with Helidon configuration is not implemented. Sensitive configuration is still partially managed through environment variables without robust access control within the Helidon configuration context. Configuration validation using Helidon's features is basic and not comprehensive. Access to `/config` endpoint is not restricted in non-production environments using Helidon Security.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Secure Logging and Monitoring with Helidon](./mitigation_strategies/implement_secure_logging_and_monitoring_with_helidon.md)

### Description:
*   Step 1: Sanitize log data generated by Helidon applications. Avoid logging sensitive information like passwords, API keys, PII in logs produced by Helidon components or application code. Implement logging filters or masking techniques within the logging framework used by Helidon (e.g., Logback, JUL).
*   Step 2: Configure secure log storage for logs generated by Helidon. Protect log files from unauthorized access and modification. Use appropriate permissions and encryption if necessary for log files generated by Helidon.
*   Step 3: Implement centralized logging and monitoring for Helidon applications. Use tools that can aggregate and analyze logs generated by Helidon, enabling security event and anomaly detection. Helidon integrates with standard logging frameworks that can facilitate centralized logging.
*   Step 4: Set up alerts for suspicious activities, error patterns, and security-related events detected in logs generated by Helidon applications. Configure monitoring systems to trigger alerts based on log analysis.
*   Step 5: Regularly review logs generated by Helidon for security incidents and perform security audits based on log data collected from Helidon applications.

### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   Information Leakage through Logs (Severity: Medium to High) - Accidental logging of sensitive data by Helidon components or application code leading to exposure.
*   Delayed Incident Detection (Severity: Medium to High) - Lack of proper logging and monitoring of Helidon applications hindering timely detection of security incidents.
*   Insufficient Security Auditing (Severity: Medium) - Inadequate logging from Helidon preventing effective security audits and incident investigation.

### Impact:
*   Information Leakage through Logs: Moderately Reduces (depends on log sanitization effectiveness within Helidon logging configuration)
*   Delayed Incident Detection: Significantly Reduces
*   Insufficient Security Auditing: Significantly Reduces

### Currently Implemented:
*   Basic logging is configured using Helidon's default logging configuration. Logs are stored locally on the server.

### Missing Implementation:
*   Log sanitization is not implemented within the Helidon logging configuration. Centralized logging and monitoring solution for Helidon logs is missing. No security alerts are configured based on log data from Helidon applications. Secure log storage and access controls are not fully implemented for Helidon logs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Follow Helidon Security Best Practices and Guidelines](./mitigation_strategies/follow_helidon_security_best_practices_and_guidelines.md)

### Description:
*   Step 1: Regularly consult the official Helidon documentation and security guides provided by Oracle for recommended security practices specific to the framework.
*   Step 2: Stay informed about Helidon security advisories and announcements released by Oracle. Subscribe to Helidon security mailing lists or monitor official channels for security updates.

*   Outdated Framework Vulnerabilities (Severity: High to Critical) - Exploiting known vulnerabilities in older versions of Helidon framework that are addressed in newer releases and security patches.
*   Improper Usage of Helidon Security Features (Severity: Medium to High) - Incorrect or insecure implementation of Helidon security mechanisms due to misunderstanding or lack of adherence to best practices.

### Impact:
*   Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities: Moderately Reduces
*   Outdated Framework Vulnerabilities: Significantly Reduces
*   Improper Usage of Helidon Security Features: Moderately Reduces

### Currently Implemented:
*   Developers generally refer to Helidon documentation, but a systematic approach to following Helidon security best practices and guidelines is not fully established.

### Missing Implementation:
*   A formal process for regularly reviewing and implementing Helidon security best practices is missing.  Proactive monitoring of Helidon security advisories and announcements is not consistently performed. Security training specific to Helidon framework for development teams is not in place.
