# Helidon Application Threat Model - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Objective:** Compromise Helidon Application

## High-Risk Sub-Tree:

*   **CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities**
    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Expose Sensitive Information via Configuration**
        *   **CRITICAL NODE: Read Unprotected Configuration Files**
            *   Access Configuration Files with Default Permissions (L: M, I: H, E: L, S: B, DD: L) **HIGH-RISK STEP**
        *   **CRITICAL NODE: Access Configuration Endpoints Without Authentication**
    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Manipulate Configuration for Malicious Purposes**
        *   **CRITICAL NODE: Modify Configuration via Unprotected Management Endpoints**
*   **CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Helidon Security Feature Weaknesses**
    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Bypass Authentication Mechanisms**
        *   **CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Default Credentials**
            *   Use Default Credentials for Helidon Security Features (L: M, I: H, E: L, S: B, DD: L) **HIGH-RISK STEP**
*   **CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Helidon Libraries/Dependencies**
    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Helidon Core Libraries**
    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries Used by Helidon**

## Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

### 1. Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)

*   This node represents a significant point of weakness due to the potential for misconfigurations. Successful exploitation here can lead to information disclosure or the ability to manipulate the application's behavior.

    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Expose Sensitive Information via Configuration**
        *   This path focuses on attackers gaining access to sensitive data stored within configuration files or exposed through configuration endpoints.
            *   **CRITICAL NODE: Read Unprotected Configuration Files**
                *   Attackers directly access configuration files due to weak file permissions or path traversal vulnerabilities.
                    *   **HIGH-RISK STEP: Access Configuration Files with Default Permissions:**  Configuration files are left with default, overly permissive access rights, allowing unauthorized reading.
            *   **CRITICAL NODE: Access Configuration Endpoints Without Authentication:** Helidon's metrics or health check endpoints, which may expose configuration details, are accessible without proper authentication.

    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Manipulate Configuration for Malicious Purposes**
        *   This path involves attackers altering the application's configuration to inject malicious settings or disable security controls.
            *   **CRITICAL NODE: Modify Configuration via Unprotected Management Endpoints:** Helidon's management API or JMX interface is not properly secured, allowing attackers to remotely modify the application's configuration.

### 2. Exploit Helidon Security Feature Weaknesses (CRITICAL NODE)

*   This node highlights vulnerabilities in Helidon's authentication and authorization mechanisms, which can allow attackers to bypass security controls.

    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Bypass Authentication Mechanisms**
        *   This path focuses on attackers circumventing the application's login or authentication process.
            *   **CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Default Credentials:**
                *   Attackers use default usernames and passwords that were not changed after deployment.
                    *   **HIGH-RISK STEP: Use Default Credentials for Helidon Security Features:** Attackers successfully authenticate using well-known default credentials for Helidon's security features.

### 3. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Helidon Libraries/Dependencies (CRITICAL NODE)

*   This node represents the risk posed by vulnerabilities in Helidon's own code or the third-party libraries it relies on.

    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Helidon Core Libraries:**
        *   Attackers leverage publicly disclosed security flaws within the core Helidon framework itself.

    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries Used by Helidon:**
        *   Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in the external libraries that Helidon depends on.
