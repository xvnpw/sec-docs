Strict Configuration Validation (Helidon-Centric)**\n\n*   **Description:**\n    1.  **Programmatic Validation with `Config` API:** Use Helidon's `io.helidon.config.Config` API to access configuration values programmatically.  Write custom validation code (using Java's validation API, regular expressions, or other checks) to ensure that each value meets predefined constraints.  This validation should occur *before* the configuration is used to initialize any Helidon components.  Example:\n        ```java\n        Config config = Config.create();\n        String dbUrl = config.get("db.url").asString().orElseThrow(() -> new IllegalArgumentException(\"db.url is required\"));\n        // Validate dbUrl format (e.g., using a regular expression)\n        if (!dbUrl.matches(\"jdbc:mysql://.*\")) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid db.url format\");\n        }\n        ```\n    2.  **MicroProfile Config Source Priority:** Leverage Helidon's implementation of MicroProfile Config and its `ConfigSource` interface. Create custom `ConfigSource` implementations to prioritize secure sources (e.g., environment variables managed by Kubernetes, a secure configuration server) over less secure sources (e.g., files in the repository).  Register these `ConfigSource` instances with appropriate ordinal values to control the priority.\n    3. **Configuration Encryption:** Utilize Helidon's built-in support for encrypted configuration properties. Encrypt sensitive values within your configuration files using Helidon's encryption tools. Helidon will automatically decrypt these values when they are accessed through the `Config` API.\n\n*   **Threats Mitigated:**\n    *   **Configuration Injection (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious configuration values that could disable Helidon's security features, expose sensitive data, or alter application behavior.\n    *   **Insecure Defaults (Medium Severity):** Ensures that default configuration values within Helidon or its components are secure and do not introduce vulnerabilities.\n    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Prevents misconfigurations of Helidon's security providers that could grant excessive privileges.\n    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive configuration data managed by Helidon.\n\n*   **Impact:** (Same as previous, but focused on Helidon-related aspects)\n    *   **Configuration Injection:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%).\n    *   **Insecure Defaults:** Risk reduced completely (100%) if Helidon defaults are validated or overridden.\n    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced significantly (70-80%).\n    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced significantly (70-80%).\n\n*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical example)\n    *   Basic programmatic validation using `Config` API for a few key properties.\n\n*   **Missing Implementation:**\n    *   Comprehensive programmatic validation for *all* Helidon-related configuration properties.\n    *   Custom `ConfigSource` implementations for prioritizing secure sources.\n    *   Utilization of Helidon's configuration encryption feature."

Secure Helidon Security Provider Configuration**\n\n*   **Description:**\n    1.  **Proper Provider Configuration (Helidon API):** Use Helidon's security API (`io.helidon.security`) to configure your chosen security provider (JWT, OIDC, etc.).  Follow Helidon's documentation *precisely* for each provider.  Avoid manual configuration or workarounds.\n    2.  **Strong Key Management (JWT with Helidon):** If using JWT, use Helidon's APIs to manage keys securely.  For example, use Helidon's `JwkKeys` to load keys from a JWK Set (JWKS) endpoint or a local JWK file.  *Do not* hardcode keys.  Integrate with a key management service through Helidon's configuration system.\n    3.  **RBAC/ABAC with Helidon:** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) using Helidon's security framework.  Define roles and permissions using Helidon's annotations (e.g., `@Authenticated`, `@RolesAllowed`) or programmatic APIs.\n    4. **Helidon Security Context:** Utilize Helidon's `SecurityContext` to access information about the authenticated user and their roles within your application logic. This allows for fine-grained authorization checks.\n\n*   **Threats Mitigated:**\n    *   **Authentication Bypass (High Severity):** Prevents bypass due to misconfiguration of Helidon's security providers.\n    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized access through Helidon's RBAC/ABAC implementation.\n    *   **Token Hijacking (High Severity):** (Indirectly, through proper key management using Helidon's APIs)\n\n*   **Impact:** (Focused on Helidon's security framework)\n    *   **Authentication Bypass:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%).\n    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced significantly (70-80%).\n    *   **Token Hijacking:** Risk reduced moderately (40-60%).\n\n*   **Currently Implemented:**\n    *   JWT authentication is configured using Helidon's security API.\n    *   Basic RBAC is implemented using Helidon's `@RolesAllowed` annotation.\n\n*   **Missing Implementation:**\n    *   Integration with a key management service through Helidon's configuration.\n    *   Full utilization of Helidon's `SecurityContext` for fine-grained authorization."

This is typically done through Helidon's configuration.\n    2.  **Authentication/Authorization with Helidon Security:** Integrate Helidon's security framework (`io.helidon.security`) to authenticate and authorize WebSocket connections.  Use the same security providers and mechanisms (JWT, OIDC, etc.) that you use for HTTP requests.  Helidon's security context can be used within WebSocket endpoints.\n    3. **Helidon WebSocket API for Input Validation:** Use Helidon's WebSocket API (`io.helidon.webserver.websocket`) to access and validate incoming messages. Implement validation logic within your WebSocket endpoint's message handling methods.\n    4. **Helidon Configuration for Timeouts:** Configure Helidon's WebSocket server settings (through configuration) to set appropriate timeouts for idle connections and message processing.\n\n*   **Threats Mitigated:** (Same as before, but focused on Helidon's implementation)\n    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity):** WSS with Helidon prevents eavesdropping.\n    *   **Authentication Bypass (High Severity):** Helidon's security integration prevents unauthorized access.\n    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Helidon's security framework enforces authorization.\n    *   **Data Injection (High Severity):** Input validation using Helidon's WebSocket API.\n    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Helidon's configuration for timeouts.\n\n*   **Impact:** (Same as before, focused on Helidon)\n    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Risk reduced significantly (90%).\n    *   **Authentication Bypass:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%).\n    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced significantly (70-80%).\n    *   **Data Injection:** Risk reduced significantly (70-80%).\n    *   **Denial-of-Service:** Risk reduced moderately (50-70%).\n\n*   **Currently Implemented:**\n    *   WSS is enabled through Helidon's configuration.\n\n*   **Missing Implementation:**\n    *   Integration of Helidon's security framework for WebSocket authentication/authorization.\n    *   Input validation using Helidon's WebSocket API.\n    *   Configuration of timeouts using Helidon's settings."
