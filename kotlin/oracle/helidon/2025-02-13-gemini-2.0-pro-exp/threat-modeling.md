# Threat Model Analysis for oracle/helidon

## Threat: [Bypass Authentication via Misconfigured Security Provider](./threats/bypass_authentication_via_misconfigured_security_provider.md)

*   **Threat:**  Bypass Authentication via Misconfigured Security Provider

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious request that exploits a misconfiguration in the Helidon security provider.  They might provide an invalid JWT token that is incorrectly accepted due to a missing or flawed validation rule in `JwtProvider`, or exploit a misconfigured role mapping in `OidcProvider` to gain unauthorized access. The attacker actively probes the security configuration for weaknesses.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to protected resources, data breaches, potential for complete system compromise if administrative endpoints are exposed.
    *   **Helidon Component Affected:**  `helidon-security` (MP and SE), specifically the configured security providers (e.g., `JwtProvider`, `OidcProvider`, `HttpBasicAuthProvider`), configuration files (`application.yaml`, `microprofile-config.properties`), and any custom security implementations *within Helidon's security framework*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Configuration Validation:** Use schema validation for configuration files. Implement unit and integration tests that *specifically* target the Helidon security provider configuration, testing various valid and *invalid* inputs, including edge cases and known attack vectors.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Enforce the principle of least privilege within Helidon's role-based access control. Avoid overly permissive configurations.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the Helidon security configuration, focusing on provider settings and role mappings.
        *   **Secret Management:** Use a secure secret management system for sensitive configuration values used by Helidon security providers.

*   **Threat:**  Denial of Service via Reactive Stream Mismanagement (Helidon SE)

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests or a specially crafted request designed to overwhelm Helidon SE's reactive stream processing. This exploits missing backpressure handling, unbounded queues, or inefficient stream processing *within Helidon's WebServer*. The attacker aims to exhaust server resources.
    *   **Impact:**  Application becomes unresponsive, services become unavailable, potential for complete system outage.
    *   **Helidon Component Affected:**  `helidon-webserver` (SE), specifically the reactive stream processing logic *within the server's request handling pipeline*. This includes the use of `Flow.Publisher`, `Flow.Subscriber`, and related reactive operators *as part of the Helidon WebServer implementation*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Backpressure Implementation:** Implement proper backpressure handling in all reactive streams *used by the Helidon WebServer*. Use operators like `limitRate`, `buffer`, or custom backpressure strategies.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Set limits on the size of buffers, queues, and other resources used in Helidon's reactive stream processing.
        *   **Timeout Handling:** Implement timeouts for all operations within Helidon's reactive streams to prevent indefinite blocking.
        *   **Load Testing:** Conduct thorough load testing, specifically targeting Helidon's WebServer, to identify potential bottlenecks and resource exhaustion vulnerabilities. Simulate DoS attack scenarios.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution via Vulnerable Helidon Dependency](./threats/remote_code_execution_via_vulnerable_helidon_dependency.md)

*   **Threat:**  Remote Code Execution via Vulnerable Helidon Dependency

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability *in a Helidon-provided library or Helidon itself* to execute arbitrary code on the server. The attacker leverages a publicly disclosed exploit or a zero-day vulnerability specific to a Helidon component.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise, data exfiltration, ability to install malware, potential for lateral movement.
    *   **Helidon Component Affected:**  Any *Helidon-provided* module or library (e.g., `helidon-webserver`, `helidon-security`, `helidon-config`, etc.). This threat is specific to vulnerabilities *within Helidon's codebase or its direct, managed dependencies*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use a dependency scanning tool, focusing on Helidon and its *declared* dependencies. Integrate this into your CI/CD pipeline.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Helidon and all its *official* dependencies updated to the latest stable versions. Subscribe to security advisories *specifically for Helidon*.
        *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Continuously monitor for newly discovered vulnerabilities in Helidon and its *managed* dependencies.

## Threat: [Object Injection via Unsafe Deserialization in Helidon Media](./threats/object_injection_via_unsafe_deserialization_in_helidon_media.md)

* **Threat:** Object Injection via Unsafe Deserialization in Helidon Media

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a crafted request containing serialized data (JSON or XML) that, when deserialized by *Helidon's media support libraries*, leads to object instantiation or code execution. This exploits vulnerabilities in Helidon's handling of untrusted input during deserialization.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, data corruption, potential for complete system compromise.
    *   **Helidon Component Affected:** `helidon-media-jsonp`, `helidon-media-jsonb`, `helidon-media-jackson` (MP and SE). Specifically, the use of these libraries to deserialize *untrusted* input.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Untrusted Deserialization:** Minimize or eliminate deserialization of data from untrusted sources using Helidon's media libraries.
        *   **Whitelist Approach:** If deserialization is unavoidable, use a strict whitelist approach to restrict the types of objects that Helidon's libraries can deserialize.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate the structure and content of the serialized data *before* it is processed by Helidon's deserialization mechanisms.
        *   **Security Manager:** Consider using a Java Security Manager to restrict the permissions of objects deserialized by Helidon.

## Threat: [gRPC Service Exploitation within Helidon](./threats/grpc_service_exploitation_within_helidon.md)

* **Threat:** gRPC Service Exploitation within Helidon

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends malicious gRPC requests to exploit vulnerabilities in the service implementation *running within Helidon's gRPC server*. This could involve sending invalid input, overflowing buffers, or exploiting logic flaws in the service methods *exposed through Helidon*.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Helidon Component Affected:** `helidon-grpc-server` (MP and SE), and the specific gRPC service implementations *hosted by Helidon*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Robust Input Validation:** Implement thorough input validation for all gRPC service methods *within the Helidon context*. Use Protobuf's validation features.
        *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Use Helidon's security features to authenticate and authorize access to gRPC services *managed by Helidon*.
        *   **TLS Encryption:** Use TLS for all gRPC communication handled by `helidon-grpc-server`.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting within Helidon to prevent denial-of-service attacks targeting gRPC services.

## Threat: [Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) in Helidon](./threats/cross-site_websocket_hijacking__cswsh__in_helidon.md)

* **Threat:** Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) in Helidon

    *   **Description:** An attacker tricks a user's browser into establishing a WebSocket connection to the Helidon application from a malicious site, exploiting Helidon's WebSocket handling. The attacker can then send/receive messages, potentially accessing sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, impersonation of the user.
    *   **Helidon Component Affected:** `helidon-webserver` (SE) and `helidon-websocket` (MP), specifically the WebSocket endpoint configuration and handling of the `Origin` header *within Helidon's implementation*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Origin Validation:** Strictly validate the `Origin` header of incoming WebSocket connection requests *within Helidon's WebSocket handling*. Only allow connections from trusted origins, configured within Helidon.
        *   **CSRF Protection:** Implement CSRF protection for WebSocket connections established with Helidon, using tokens or other authentication.
