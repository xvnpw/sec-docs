# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for oracle/helidon

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicit Security Provider Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/explicit_security_provider_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Providers in `application.yaml` (or Programmatically):**  Create a dedicated section in your `application.yaml` (or equivalent programmatic configuration) to define each Helidon security provider.  This is *crucial* for Helidon's security model.  Example:
        ```yaml
        security:
          providers:
            - jwt:
                atn-token:
                  header: "Authorization"
                  scheme: "Bearer"
                jwk:
                  url: "https://your-jwks-provider.com/.well-known/jwks.json"
                roles-attribute: "roles" # Attribute containing user roles
            - http-basic-auth: # Example, only if needed and configured securely
                realm: "My Application"
                users: # NEVER use cleartext in production! Use Helidon's password encryption.
                  - login: "user1"
                    password: "{ENCRYPTED}..." # Use Helidon's config encryption
                    roles: ["user"]
        ```
    2.  **Define Roles and Permissions (within Helidon's context):**  Clearly define roles and their associated permissions, leveraging Helidon's role mapping capabilities. This often involves using Helidon's `SecurityContext`.
    3.  **Apply Security to Endpoints (using Helidon APIs):** Use Helidon's security annotations (e.g., `@Authenticated`, `@Authorized`, `@RolesAllowed`) or programmatic checks using `SecurityContext` to enforce security on specific endpoints or methods.  This is *directly* using Helidon's security features.  Example:
        ```java
        @Path("/secured")
        @Authenticated // Helidon annotation
        public class SecuredResource {

            @GET
            @Path("/admin")
            @Authorized(roles = {"admin"}) // Helidon annotation
            public String adminOnly() {
                return "Admin access granted!";
            }

            @GET
            @Path("/user")
            public String userAccess(@Context SecurityContext securityContext) { // Helidon's SecurityContext
                if (securityContext.isUserInRole("user")) {
                    return "User access granted!";
                } else {
                    return "Access denied!";
                }
            }
        }
        ```
    4.  **Test Security Configuration (using Helidon's testing support):**  Write unit and integration tests using Helidon's testing framework (e.g., `HelidonTest`) to verify that the security configuration is working as expected. This ensures your Helidon-specific security setup is correct.
    5. **Disable unused providers:** Comment out or remove configuration for providers that are not in use within the Helidon configuration.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass (Severity: Critical):**  Directly related to Helidon's authentication mechanisms.
    *   **Authorization Bypass (Severity: Critical):**  Directly related to Helidon's authorization mechanisms.
    *   **Weak Authentication (Severity: High):**  Controlled by the choice of Helidon security providers and their configuration.
    *   **Configuration Errors (Severity: High):**  Specific to Helidon's security configuration.
    *   **Default Credential Usage (Severity: Critical):**  Avoid Helidon's default security settings if they are not secure enough.

*   **Impact:** (Same as before, but now focused on Helidon-specific aspects)
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** Risk reduced significantly (90-100%).
    *   **Authorization Bypass:** Risk reduced significantly (90-100%).
    *   **Weak Authentication:** Risk reduced significantly (70-90%).
    *   **Configuration Errors:** Risk reduced moderately (50-70%).
    *   **Default Credential Usage:** Risk reduced completely (100%).

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Authentication with JWT is implemented using Helidon's `JwtAuthenticationProvider`. Authorization is partially implemented using Helidon's `@Authorized` annotations.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive RBAC using Helidon's features is not fully implemented across all resources.
    *   Unit/integration tests specifically for Helidon's security features are incomplete.
    *   Formalized review process for Helidon's security configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Netty Web Server Configuration (via Helidon)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_netty_web_server_configuration__via_helidon_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Helidon Release Notes:**  Before each Helidon upgrade, check for security updates related to Netty *as managed by Helidon*.
    2.  **Configure Request Limits in `application.yaml` (Helidon's config):**  Set limits on request headers, body size, and connection timeouts *using Helidon's configuration mechanism*.  This is *not* general Netty advice, but Helidon-specific configuration. Example:
        ```yaml
        server:
          port: 8080
          max-header-size: 8192 # bytes - Controlled by Helidon
          max-request-payload-size: 10MB # Controlled by Helidon
          read-timeout: 30s # Controlled by Helidon
          write-timeout: 30s # Controlled by Helidon
          idle-timeout: 60s # Controlled by Helidon
        ```
    3.  **Disable Unnecessary Helidon WebServer Features:**  If certain Helidon WebServer features (e.g., specific codecs or handlers exposed *through Helidon*) are not required, disable them in the Helidon configuration.
    4.  **Review Custom Helidon Handlers:**  If you have implemented any custom Helidon handlers (that interact with Netty), review them for vulnerabilities. This is specific to handlers written *for Helidon*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) (Severity: High):**  Mitigated through Helidon's configuration of Netty.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: High):**  Mitigated through Helidon's configuration of Netty.
    *   **HTTP/2-Specific Attacks (Severity: Medium):**  If Helidon allows disabling HTTP/2, this is relevant.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Custom Helidon Handlers (Severity: Variable):**  Specific to handlers written for Helidon.

*   **Impact:** (Same as before, but focused on Helidon's control over Netty)
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced significantly (70-90%).
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced significantly (70-90%).
    *   **HTTP/2 Attacks:** Risk reduced completely (100%) if disabled via Helidon.
    *   **Custom Handler Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduction depends on the review.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Basic request limits are configured in Helidon's `application.yaml`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Timeout configurations are not explicitly set within Helidon's configuration.
    *   Review of custom Helidon handlers (if any) is not documented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure MicroProfile Fault Tolerance (using Helidon's implementation)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_microprofile_fault_tolerance__using_helidon's_implementation_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Fault Tolerance Annotations (Helidon/MP):** Use MicroProfile Fault Tolerance annotations *provided by Helidon* (e.g., `@Retry`, `@CircuitBreaker`, `@Timeout`) on methods.  Configure the parameters carefully *within the context of Helidon's implementation*. Example:
        ```java
        @Retry(maxRetries = 3, delay = 1, delayUnit = ChronoUnit.SECONDS) // Helidon's MP implementation
        @Timeout(value = 5, unit = ChronoUnit.SECONDS) // Helidon's MP implementation
        public String getDataFromExternalService() {
            // ... code that might fail ...
        }
        ```
    2.  **Set Realistic Timeouts (using Helidon's MP):**  Use `@Timeout` (Helidon's implementation) to prevent operations from hanging.
    3.  **Configure Retries Judiciously (using Helidon's MP):**  Use `@Retry` (Helidon's implementation) appropriately.
    4.  **Use Circuit Breakers (using Helidon's MP):**  Use `@CircuitBreaker` (Helidon's implementation) to prevent cascading failures.
    5.  **Monitor Fault Tolerance Metrics (using Helidon's MP Metrics):**  Use Helidon's built-in metrics (exposed via MicroProfile Metrics, *a Helidon feature*) to monitor fault tolerance.
    6.  **Test Failure Scenarios (using Helidon's testing support):** Write tests using Helidon's testing framework to verify fault tolerance.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):**  Helidon's fault tolerance can help mitigate some DoS scenarios.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: Medium):**  Controlled by Helidon's fault tolerance configuration.
    *   **Application Instability (Severity: Medium):**  Improved by Helidon's fault tolerance.

*   **Impact:** (Same as before, but focused on Helidon's implementation)
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced moderately (40-60%).
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced significantly (60-80%).
    *   **Application Instability:** Risk reduced significantly (70-90%).

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. `@Retry` and `@Timeout` (Helidon's implementation) are used in some service classes.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `@CircuitBreaker` (Helidon's implementation) is not used consistently.
    *   Monitoring of Helidon's fault tolerance metrics is not fully integrated.
    *   Comprehensive testing using Helidon's testing framework is lacking.

    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) (Severity: High):**  Rate limiting, potentially using Helidon features.

*   **Impact:** (Same as before, but focused on Helidon)
    *   **MitM Attacks:** Risk reduced significantly (90-100%).
    *   **Authentication/Authorization Bypass:** Risk reduced significantly (90-100%).
    *   **Data Injection:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%).
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced moderately (50-70%).

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Applicable (gRPC is not currently used).

*   **Missing Implementation:** All aspects, if gRPC were to be used *through Helidon*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration Management (using Helidon's Config)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_management__using_helidon's_config_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** List all sensitive data.
    2.  **Choose External Configuration Source (supported by Helidon):** Select a source *supported by Helidon's Config component* (environment variables, config servers, Vault - if Helidon has a connector).
    3.  **Configure Helidon's Config:**  Use the `config` section in `application.yaml` (or programmatic configuration) to tell Helidon *how to read from the external source*. This is *key* - it's using Helidon's Config API.
    4.  **Remove Secrets from Code:** Replace hardcoded secrets with references that Helidon's Config can resolve.
    5. **Use Helidon Config Encryption:** If storing any sensitive data within Helidon configuration files, use Helidon built-in encryption support.
        ```yaml
          my-secret-value: "{ENCRYPTED}..."
        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Credential Exposure (Severity: Critical):**  Addressed by using Helidon's Config correctly.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: Critical):**  Indirectly addressed by securing configuration.
    *   **Configuration Errors (Severity: High):**  Centralized configuration *using Helidon's Config* reduces errors.

    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%).
    *   **Configuration Errors:** Risk reduced moderately (50-70%).

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Environment variables are used via Helidon's Config.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A dedicated secrets management solution integrated with Helidon's Config is not used.
    *   Helidon Config Encryption is not consistently applied.
