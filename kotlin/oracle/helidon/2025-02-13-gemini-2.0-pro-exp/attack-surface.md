# Attack Surface Analysis for oracle/helidon

## Attack Surface: [Unpatched Netty Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/unpatched_netty_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the Netty web server, which underlies Helidon.
*   **Helidon Contribution:** Helidon directly uses Netty as its HTTP server, making it susceptible to *any* Netty vulnerabilities.  This is a direct dependency.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a recently disclosed Netty CVE related to HTTP/2 header handling, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition or, in a worse-case scenario, remote code execution (RCE).
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, potential remote code execution (RCE) in severe cases, data breaches (depending on the specific vulnerability).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific Netty vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Continuously monitor Helidon releases and CVE databases for Netty-related vulnerabilities.  Immediately apply updates that address Netty security issues.  Configure Helidon to use the latest supported Netty version. This is the *most critical* mitigation.
    *   **Users/Operators:**  Ensure the Helidon application is running on a supported platform and that all system-level dependencies are up-to-date.  Implement a robust patching process.  Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to provide an additional layer of defense (but this is *secondary* to patching).

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured HTTP/2](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_http2.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect or insecure configuration of Helidon's HTTP/2 support, leading to protocol-level attacks.
*   **Helidon Contribution:** Helidon provides configuration options for HTTP/2 *within the Helidon framework*.  Incorrect settings within Helidon's configuration are the direct cause.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses an "HPACK bombing" attack (sending excessively large or complex header compression tables) to exhaust server resources, leading to a DoS. This exploits Helidon's handling of HTTP/2.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, potential application instability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Carefully review Helidon's HTTP/2 configuration documentation.  Use the most restrictive settings possible while still meeting application requirements.  Specifically, set limits on header sizes, concurrent streams, and other relevant parameters *within Helidon's configuration files or code*.
    *   **Users/Operators:**  Monitor server resource usage for signs of HTTP/2-related attacks. While rate limiting at the network level can help, the primary mitigation is correct Helidon configuration.

## Attack Surface: [MicroProfile Config Secrets Exposure](./attack_surfaces/microprofile_config_secrets_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive configuration data managed by Helidon's MicroProfile Config implementation being exposed due to insecure configuration sources *used by Helidon*.
*   **Helidon Contribution:** Helidon implements MicroProfile Config and *defines how it reads configuration*. The vulnerability arises from how Helidon is configured to access secrets.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the server's environment variables, and Helidon is configured to read database credentials from those environment variables, leading to a database breach.  The core issue is Helidon's configuration.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive systems, complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  *Never* store secrets directly in the application code or configuration files that Helidon reads.  Use a dedicated secrets management solution (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.).  Integrate Helidon with the chosen secrets management solution *using Helidon's configuration mechanisms*.  This is a Helidon-specific configuration task.
    *   **Users/Operators:** While securing the environment is important, the *primary* mitigation is to configure Helidon to *not* read secrets from insecure sources.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Helidon Security](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_helidon_security.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect or incomplete configuration of *Helidon's own security features* (authentication, authorization, identity propagation), leading to unauthorized access.
*   **Helidon Contribution:** This is entirely within Helidon Security. The vulnerability stems from misusing or misconfiguring Helidon's security APIs and components.
*   **Example:** An attacker bypasses authentication due to a misconfigured JWT provider or an incorrect role mapping *within Helidon's security configuration*.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, data breaches, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Thoroughly understand Helidon Security's documentation and configuration options.  Use well-defined security providers (JWT, OIDC) and configure them correctly *within Helidon*.  Implement strong password policies and multi-factor authentication where appropriate.  Test the Helidon Security configuration extensively.  Follow the principle of least privilege *within the Helidon security context*.
    *   **Users/Operators:** Regularly audit the Helidon security configuration. This is a configuration audit specific to Helidon.
