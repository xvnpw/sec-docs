## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

* **CRITICAL NODE: Access Sensitive Configuration Data:**
        * Attackers aim to read configuration files (e.g., `application.yaml`, `microprofile-config.properties`) containing sensitive information.
            * Exploit Path Traversal to Access Files: Attackers leverage vulnerabilities in file handling to access files outside the intended directories.
            * Leverage Misconfigured Access Controls: Attackers exploit overly permissive file permissions to directly read configuration files.
    * **CRITICAL NODE: Leverage Sensitive Data for Exploitation:**
        * Once sensitive data is accessed, attackers use it for further malicious activities.
            * **HIGH-RISK PATH: Obtain Database Credentials:**
                * Attackers retrieve database credentials from configuration.
                    * **CRITICAL NODE: Use Credentials to Access/Modify Data:** Attackers use the obtained credentials to directly access and manipulate the database.
            * **HIGH-RISK PATH: Retrieve API Keys/Secrets:**
                * Attackers retrieve API keys or secrets for external services from configuration.
                    * **CRITICAL NODE: Use Keys to Access External Services:** Attackers use the obtained keys to access and potentially compromise external services.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Manipulate Configuration Sources](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_manipulate_configuration_sources.md)

* **CRITICAL NODE: Inject Malicious Configuration via External Sources (e.g., Config Maps in Kubernetes):**
        * Attackers compromise external configuration sources (like Kubernetes Config Maps) to inject malicious configuration settings that can alter application behavior or introduce vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Leverage Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_leverage_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

* Inject Malicious Payloads via Helidon's Input Handling: Attackers inject malicious serialized objects into the application's input streams, leading to code execution upon deserialization.
