# Attack Surface Analysis for oracle/helidon

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Configuration Data](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_configuration_data.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive configuration data, such as database credentials, API keys, or internal service locations, might be exposed if configuration files are not properly secured.
    *   **How Helidon Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Helidon uses configuration files (e.g., `application.yaml`, `microprofile-config.properties`) and environment variables. If these files are included in the deployment artifact without proper access controls or if environment variables are exposed, sensitive information can be compromised. Helidon's configuration loading mechanisms make these files a direct source of application settings.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could gain access to a deployed JAR file or container image and extract the `application.yaml` file containing database credentials, allowing them to access the database directly.
    *   **Impact:** Data Breach, Unauthorized Access to Resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict Access:** Ensure configuration files are not included in the final deployment artifact or are placed in protected directories with restricted access.
        *   **Externalized Configuration:** Utilize Helidon's support for externalized configuration (e.g., environment variables, configuration servers) to avoid storing sensitive data directly in files.
        *   **Secret Management:** Use dedicated secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) and integrate them with Helidon to securely manage and access sensitive configuration values. Avoid hardcoding secrets.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Security Providers](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_security_providers.md)

*   **Description:** Helidon allows integration with various security providers (e.g., JWT, Basic Auth). Incorrect configuration of these providers can lead to authentication bypasses or authorization flaws.
    *   **How Helidon Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Helidon provides APIs and configuration options (via its security modules) to integrate with security providers. Misconfiguration in these Helidon-specific settings directly weakens the application's authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   **Example:**  Incorrectly configured JWT validation within Helidon could allow an attacker to forge JWT tokens and gain unauthorized access. A misconfigured Basic Auth setup within Helidon might use default or weak credentials, or not enforce proper credential storage.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized Access, Privilege Escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the scope of the misconfiguration and the sensitivity of the protected resources).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Follow Security Best Practices:** Adhere to the recommended security practices for the chosen authentication and authorization mechanisms *as they are implemented within Helidon*.
        *   **Secure Key Management:** Properly manage and protect private keys used for JWT signing or other cryptographic operations, utilizing Helidon's configuration options for key loading.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the security provider configurations within the Helidon application.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Configure authorization rules within Helidon to grant only the necessary permissions to users and roles.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configurations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configurations.md)

*   **Description:** Helidon might have default configurations for its features that are less secure than recommended for production environments.
    *   **How Helidon Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Helidon provides default settings for various components and functionalities. If developers do not explicitly override these defaults with more secure options through Helidon's configuration mechanisms, the application might be vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** Default settings for CORS within Helidon might be overly permissive, allowing requests from any origin. Default error handling in Helidon might reveal too much information about the application's internal structure or errors.
    *   **Impact:** Various, depending on the specific insecure default. Could range from information disclosure and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities to more severe issues.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific default).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Review Default Configurations:** Thoroughly review Helidon's default configurations for all relevant modules and override them with secure values appropriate for the application's environment using Helidon's configuration system.
        *   **Security Hardening:** Implement security hardening measures specifically targeting Helidon's configuration options as part of the deployment process.
        *   **Use Secure Templates/Starters:** Utilize secure project templates or starter kits for Helidon that incorporate secure default configurations from the outset.
