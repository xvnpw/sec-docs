**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Prepared By:** AI Architecture Expert

## 1. Project Overview

Helidon is a modern, lightweight, and fast set of Java libraries for developing microservices and cloud-native applications. It provides two distinct programming models to cater to different development preferences and project requirements:

*   **Helidon SE (Standard Edition):** A reactive programming model offering a functional and lightweight approach to building microservices. It emphasizes speed, efficiency, and direct control over the underlying infrastructure.
*   **Helidon MP (MicroProfile):** An implementation of the Eclipse MicroProfile specification, providing a standards-based approach to microservices development using familiar annotations and APIs.

This document details the architectural design of the Helidon project, focusing on its key components, their interactions, and relevant security considerations. This design will serve as the basis for subsequent threat modeling activities.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

The primary goals of the Helidon project are to:

*   **Boost Developer Productivity:** Offer intuitive and efficient APIs for building microservices in Java.
*   **Achieve High Performance and Efficiency:** Provide a lightweight runtime environment with minimal resource overhead.
*   **Ensure Standards Compliance (for Helidon MP):**  Fully implement the Eclipse MicroProfile specification.
*   **Facilitate Cloud-Native Development:** Design for easy deployment, scaling, and management in cloud environments.
*   **Offer Flexibility in Programming Models:** Provide a choice between reactive (SE) and standards-based (MP) approaches.

## 3. Target Audience

The intended audience for Helidon includes:

*   Java developers building and deploying microservices.
*   Teams seeking lightweight and high-performance microservices frameworks.
*   Organizations adopting cloud-native architectures and practices.
*   Developers who prefer reactive programming models (Helidon SE).
*   Developers who prefer standards-based microservices development using MicroProfile (Helidon MP).

## 4. High-Level Architecture

Helidon's architecture is designed with modularity and separation of concerns in mind. Both Helidon SE and MP share some foundational components, while MP builds upon the SE core.

## 6. Data Flow

The typical data flow within a Helidon application involves the following steps:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant WebServer
    participant Router
    participant Handler
    participant Service Layer
    participant Data Store

    Client->>WebServer: Incoming HTTP Request
    WebServer->>Router: Route Request based on configuration
    Router->>Handler: Invoke the appropriate Handler
    Handler->>Service Layer: Delegate business logic processing
    Service Layer->>Data Store: Access and manipulate data (if required)
    Data Store-->>Service Layer: Return data (if any)
    Service Layer-->>Handler: Prepare the HTTP Response
    Handler-->>WebServer: Send HTTP Response
    WebServer-->>Client: HTTP Response
```

**Explanation:**

1. A **Client** sends an HTTP request to the Helidon application.
2. The **WebServer** (Netty) receives the incoming request.
3. The **Router** analyzes the request (e.g., URL path, HTTP method) and determines the appropriate **Handler** to process it.
4. The **Router** invokes the selected **Handler**.
5. The **Handler** often delegates the core business logic processing to a **Service Layer**.
6. The **Service Layer** may interact with a **Data Store** (e.g., database, external API) to retrieve or persist data.
7. The **Data Store** returns the requested data (if any) to the **Service Layer**.
8. The **Service Layer** processes the data and prepares the response.
9. The **Handler** constructs the HTTP response based on the processed data.
10. The **WebServer** sends the HTTP response back to the **Client**.

## 7. Technology Stack

Helidon utilizes the following key technologies:

*   **Primary Programming Language:** Java
*   **Helidon SE Core:** Custom-built, reactive framework.
*   **Helidon MP Implementation:** Weld (for CDI), Jersey (for JAX-RS), implementations of Eclipse MicroProfile specifications.
*   **Underlying Web Server:** Netty (non-blocking I/O).
*   **Configuration Management:**  Custom built with support for various formats.
*   **Metrics:** Custom built with integration for Micrometer.

## 9. Security Considerations (High-Level)

Security is a crucial aspect of Helidon. Key considerations include:

*   **Authentication Mechanisms:**
    *   Support for various authentication methods like Basic Authentication, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and JWT.
    *   Pluggable authentication providers allowing integration with different identity providers.
*   **Authorization Controls:**
    *   Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for managing user permissions.
    *   Mechanisms for defining and enforcing access policies to protect sensitive resources.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   Importance of validating and sanitizing all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
    *   Utilizing appropriate libraries and techniques for input validation.
*   **Output Encoding:**
    *   Ensuring proper encoding of output data to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    *   Using context-aware encoding based on the output destination.
*   **Dependency Management Security:**
    *   Regularly scanning dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check.
    *   Keeping dependencies up-to-date with security patches.
*   **Secure Configuration Practices:**
    *   Avoiding hardcoding sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys) in configuration files.
    *   Utilizing environment variables or secure vaults for managing secrets.
*   **Transport Layer Security (TLS):**
    *   Enforcing HTTPS for all communication to encrypt data in transit.
    *   Properly configuring TLS certificates and settings.
*   **Rate Limiting and Throttling:**
    *   Implementing rate limiting to protect against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
    *   Throttling requests from specific sources or users to prevent abuse.
*   **Logging and Auditing:**
    *   Comprehensive logging of security-related events (e.g., authentication attempts, authorization failures).
    *   Regularly reviewing audit logs for suspicious activity.
*   **CORS Configuration:**
    *   Properly configuring Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies to control which domains can access the application's resources.

These security considerations will be further analyzed and elaborated upon during the threat modeling process to identify potential vulnerabilities and develop mitigation strategies.

## 10. Assumptions and Constraints
