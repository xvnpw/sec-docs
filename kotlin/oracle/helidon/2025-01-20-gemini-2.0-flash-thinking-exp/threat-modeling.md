# Threat Model Analysis for oracle/helidon

## Threat: [Configuration Injection](./threats/configuration_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate external configuration sources (e.g., environment variables, command-line arguments) to inject malicious configuration values. This could involve overwriting legitimate settings with harmful ones, potentially altering application behavior or granting unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, application malfunction due to altered behavior.

**Affected Component:** Helidon Configuration API, specifically how it reads and processes configuration from external sources (`ConfigSource` implementations).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict validation and sanitization of all configuration inputs.
*   Avoid directly using external configuration values in sensitive operations without thorough checks.
*   Utilize Helidon's configuration API securely, potentially leveraging features for secure configuration handling.
*   Employ the principle of least privilege when granting access to modify configuration sources.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive information (e.g., database credentials, API keys) that is inadvertently exposed through Helidon's configuration system. This could occur via logging, error messages, or unsecured configuration endpoints. An attacker might monitor logs or attempt to access configuration endpoints if they are not properly protected.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to backend systems or external services, compromise of other systems using the exposed credentials.

**Affected Component:** Helidon Logging framework, Configuration API, potentially MicroProfile Metrics or Health Check endpoints if they expose configuration details.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid storing sensitive data directly in configuration files or environment variables.
*   Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets) and integrate them with Helidon's configuration.
*   Review logging configurations to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information.
*   Secure any configuration endpoints that allow viewing or modifying configuration.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in MicroProfile Implementations](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_microprofile_implementations.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities within the specific MicroProfile specifications implemented by Helidon (e.g., JAX-RS, CDI, Fault Tolerance). This could involve sending crafted requests or exploiting injection points within these implementations.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, depending on the specific vulnerability in the MicroProfile implementation.

**Affected Component:** Specific Helidon modules implementing MicroProfile specifications (e.g., `helidon-microprofile-jaxrs`, `helidon-microprofile-cdi`, `helidon-microprofile-fault-tolerance`).

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Stay updated with Helidon releases and security advisories to patch known vulnerabilities in MicroProfile implementations.
*   Monitor for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the specific MicroProfile specifications being used.
*   Follow secure coding practices when utilizing MicroProfile features to avoid introducing vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Use of MicroProfile Security Features](./threats/insecure_use_of_microprofile_security_features.md)

**Description:** An attacker could bypass authentication or authorization checks due to incorrect implementation or configuration of MicroProfile security features within Helidon (e.g., JWT authentication, authorization policies). This might involve forging tokens or exploiting weaknesses in the validation process.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, data manipulation, privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** Helidon Security module, specifically the parts implementing MicroProfile security specifications (e.g., JWT support).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly understand and correctly implement MicroProfile security specifications.
*   Validate JWT tokens properly, ensuring signature verification and expiration checks.
*   Define and enforce robust authorization policies based on roles or claims.
*   Regularly review and test security configurations.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Helidon WebServer](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_helidon_webserver.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit potential vulnerabilities within Helidon's underlying Netty-based web server implementation. This could involve sending specially crafted HTTP requests to trigger bugs or security flaws in the server.

**Impact:** Denial of service, remote code execution, information disclosure, depending on the specific vulnerability in the web server.

**Affected Component:** `helidon-webserver` module.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Helidon updated to benefit from security patches in the web server component.
*   Follow secure coding practices when handling HTTP requests and responses within the application.
*   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web server attacks.

## Threat: [Helidon Security Module Vulnerabilities](./threats/helidon_security_module_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker could bypass authentication or authorization if there are vulnerabilities within Helidon's own security module. This could involve exploiting flaws in the authentication mechanisms or authorization checks provided by Helidon.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** `helidon-security` module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Stay updated with Helidon releases and security advisories related to the security module.
*   Thoroughly test security configurations and integrations.
*   Follow security best practices when configuring and using Helidon's security features.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries that Helidon depends on. This could involve leveraging publicly known exploits for those specific library versions.

**Impact:** A wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerable dependency, including remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Various Helidon modules that rely on the vulnerable dependency.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk.
*   Keep dependencies updated to their latest secure versions.
*   Monitor security advisories for vulnerabilities in the libraries used by Helidon.
*   Consider using dependency management tools to automate vulnerability scanning and updates.
