# Attack Surface Analysis for oracle/helidon

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Injection/Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/configuration_injectionmanipulation.md)

- **Description:** Helidon applications rely on configuration sources (e.g., `application.yaml`, environment variables). If these sources are not properly secured or if external configuration sources are used without validation, attackers might inject malicious configurations.
    - **How Helidon Contributes:** Helidon's configuration loading mechanism reads from various sources. If these sources are writable by an attacker or if external sources are untrusted, malicious configurations can be injected.
    - **Example:** An attacker could modify an external configuration file to change database connection details, redirecting the application to a malicious database server. They could also inject environment variables to alter application behavior.
    - **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the application, data breaches, denial of service, execution of arbitrary code.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Secure Configuration Sources:** Protect configuration files with appropriate file system permissions.
        - **Restrict Access to Environment Variables:** Limit who can set environment variables in the deployment environment.
        - **Validate External Configuration:** If using external configuration sources, implement strict validation and sanitization of loaded values.
        - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary permissions to access configuration sources.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Custom Security Interceptors/Filters](./attack_surfaces/insecure_custom_security_interceptorsfilters.md)

- **Description:** Developers might implement custom security interceptors or filters using Helidon's security APIs. If these are implemented incorrectly, they can introduce vulnerabilities or bypass intended security measures.
    - **How Helidon Contributes:** Helidon provides the framework for implementing custom security logic. Flaws in this custom code directly impact the application's security.
    - **Example:** A custom authentication filter might incorrectly handle authentication tokens, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication. An authorization filter might have logic flaws, granting unauthorized access to resources.
    - **Impact:** Authentication bypass, authorization bypass, information disclosure, privilege escalation.
    - **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the flaw).
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Thorough Code Review:** Conduct rigorous code reviews of all custom security interceptors and filters.
        - **Security Testing:** Perform thorough security testing, including penetration testing, of the implemented security logic.
        - **Follow Security Best Practices:** Adhere to established security principles and best practices when implementing custom security logic.
        - **Leverage Built-in Helidon Security Features:** Prefer using Helidon's built-in security features and annotations where possible, as they are likely to be more robust.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Helidon Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_helidon_dependencies.md)

- **Description:** Helidon relies on various third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the application.
    - **How Helidon Contributes:** Helidon includes these dependencies in its distribution. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies become part of the application's attack surface.
    - **Example:** A vulnerability in a logging library used by Helidon could allow an attacker to inject malicious code via log messages.
    - **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, denial of service, and information disclosure.
    - **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical).
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep Helidon and all its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        - **Dependency Scanning:** Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies.
        - **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories related to Helidon and its dependencies.
