## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers target weaknesses in how the Helidon application manages its configuration. This often involves accessing sensitive information stored in configuration files or environment variables, which can directly lead to compromise.
* **Critical Node: Access Sensitive Configuration Data:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to directly access configuration files (like `application.yaml`) or environment variables where sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, and internal service URLs might be stored.
    * **Critical Node: Read application.yaml with sensitive credentials:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to read the `application.yaml` file, either through direct file access if the application server is compromised or through vulnerabilities that expose file contents. This file often contains sensitive credentials.
    * **Critical Node: Access environment variables containing secrets:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers try to access the environment variables in which the Helidon application is running. Developers sometimes store secrets directly in environment variables, making them a target for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Security Feature Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_security_feature_weaknesses.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers focus on bypassing or exploiting flaws in the security features implemented within the Helidon application. This includes authentication, authorization, and input validation mechanisms.
* **Critical Node: Bypass Authentication Mechanisms:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to circumvent the authentication process to gain unauthorized access to the application.
    * **Critical Node: Exploit weaknesses in custom authentication providers:**
        * **Attack Vector:** If the application uses custom-built authentication logic, attackers will look for flaws in its implementation that allow them to bypass authentication checks.
    * **Critical Node: Exploit vulnerabilities in supported authentication standards (e.g., JWT implementation flaws):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Even when using standard authentication protocols like JWT, vulnerabilities in the implementation or configuration can be exploited to forge tokens or bypass verification.
* **Critical Node: Bypass Authorization Mechanisms:**
    * **Attack Vector:** After (or sometimes without) authenticating, attackers try to bypass authorization checks to access resources or functionalities they are not permitted to use.
* **Critical Node: Exploit Input Validation Issues:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers provide malicious input to the application to trigger unintended behavior or gain unauthorized access.
    * **Critical Node: Inject malicious code through improperly validated request parameters (e.g., NoSQL injection if using Helidon DB Client):**
        * **Attack Vector:** If the application uses user-provided input in database queries without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious code (like NoSQL queries) to manipulate the database or gain access to sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers target known security vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries (dependencies) used by the Helidon application.
* **Critical Node: Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify vulnerable dependencies and then attempt to exploit those vulnerabilities to compromise the application.
    * **Critical Node: Leverage public exploits for identified vulnerable libraries:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Once a vulnerable dependency is identified, attackers often use publicly available exploit code to take advantage of the flaw.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default Credentials or Settings](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_credentials_or_settings.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to use default usernames and passwords or exploit insecure default configurations that were not changed after deployment. This can provide immediate access to the application or its underlying infrastructure.
