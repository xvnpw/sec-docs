### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Timber

Here's an updated threat list focusing on high and critical severity threats that directly involve the Timber logging library:

*   **Threat:** Accidental Logging of Sensitive Data
    *   **Description:** Developers inadvertently use Timber's logging methods (`Timber.d()`, `Timber.e()`, etc.) to log sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys, personal data) directly into the log messages. An attacker gaining access to these logs can then retrieve this sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, compliance violations, reputational damage, potential for further attacks using the exposed credentials or data.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `Timber.d()`, `Timber.e()`, `Timber.w()`, `Timber.i()`, `Timber.v()`: The core logging methods where sensitive data might be passed as arguments.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the data logged).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict code review processes to identify and prevent logging of sensitive data.
        *   Utilize static analysis tools to detect potential logging of sensitive information.
        *   Educate developers on secure logging practices and the risks of exposing sensitive data in logs.
        *   Implement data masking or redaction techniques *before* passing data to Timber's logging methods.
        *   Avoid logging raw user input directly; sanitize or log only necessary, non-sensitive parts.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Logging of Sensitive Data in Custom Trees
    *   **Description:** Developers create custom `Tree` implementations (using `Timber.plant(new CustomTree())`) that are designed to log specific data, but these implementations lack proper security considerations and inadvertently log sensitive information to insecure locations or in an insecure manner. An attacker gaining access to these logs can retrieve the sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, compliance violations, reputational damage, potential for further attacks using the exposed credentials or data.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Custom `Tree` implementations: The specific code within custom `Tree` classes that handles logging logic.
        *   `Timber.plant()`: The method used to register these potentially insecure custom `Tree` implementations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the data logged and the security of the logging destination).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test custom `Tree` implementations for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Ensure custom `Tree` implementations adhere to secure logging practices.
        *   Implement secure storage and transmission mechanisms within custom `Tree` implementations if they log to external locations.
        *   Restrict the ability to plant custom `Tree` implementations to authorized personnel or processes.
