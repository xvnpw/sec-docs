# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for appintro/appintro

## Mitigation Strategy: [Thoroughly Review Intro Content](./mitigation_strategies/thoroughly_review_intro_content.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Content Inventory (AppIntro Specific):** List all text, images, videos, and any other media used within the AppIntro slides *specifically defined for the AppIntro implementation*.
    2.  **Sensitive Data Scan (AppIntro Content):** Manually or automatically scan all content *used in AppIntro slides* for potential sensitive information like API keys, secrets, internal URLs, PII, or development-specific details.
    3.  **Contextual Review (AppIntro Usage):** Evaluate each piece of content *within the AppIntro context*. Ensure the information presented in the intro flow is necessary, appropriate, and does not inadvertently expose sensitive details *through the onboarding process*.
    4.  **Version Control (AppIntro Resources):** Store intro content *resources (layouts, drawables, strings used in AppIntro)* in version control (e.g., Git) to track changes and facilitate review processes.
    5.  **Regular Audits (AppIntro Content Updates):** Periodically review intro content, especially after application updates or changes in sensitive data handling *that might affect information presented in the AppIntro*, to ensure continued compliance and security.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Accidental exposure of sensitive data (API keys, secrets, PII) within the application's *AppIntro screens*.
    *   **Internal Information Leakage (Medium Severity):**  Exposure of internal URLs, development environment details, or non-public information *through the AppIntro flow* that could aid attackers.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** High Impact - Significantly reduces the risk of accidental exposure of sensitive data in *AppIntro content*.
    *   **Internal Information Leakage:** Medium Impact - Reduces the risk of leaking internal details *via AppIntro* that could be exploited by attackers.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented.
    *   Intro content is stored in `res/drawable` and `res/layout` folders within the Android project and is under Git version control.
    *   Manual review of *AppIntro content* is performed during feature development, but a dedicated sensitive data scan *specifically for AppIntro content* is not routinely conducted.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
