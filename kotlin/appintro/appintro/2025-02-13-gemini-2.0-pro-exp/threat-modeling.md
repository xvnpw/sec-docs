# Threat Model Analysis for appintro/appintro

## Threat: [Code Execution via AppIntro (Extremely Unlikely)](./threats/code_execution_via_appintro__extremely_unlikely_.md)

*   **Description:** A severe vulnerability exists in `AppIntro`'s core code (or a default component it uses) that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by manipulating slide content *in a way that exploits a flaw in the library itself*. This is distinct from simply putting malicious code in a custom view; this would require a bug in `AppIntro`'s handling of, for example, slide transitions, animations, or data binding (if it were used in an unconventional way). This is *not* about putting secrets in resources, but about exploiting a bug in the library's *code*.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application, potential for data theft, malware installation, and even device compromise. This is the worst-case scenario.
    *   **Affected Component:** The core `AppIntroFragment`, `AppIntro`, or `AppIntroBase` classes, or potentially the default views used for slide display (e.g., if a vulnerability existed in how `ImageView` or `TextView` are used *specifically within the library's internal logic*). This would likely involve a flaw in how the library handles transitions, animations, or data binding.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `AppIntro` library updated to the latest version. This is the *most crucial* mitigation, as it ensures you have any security patches.
        *   Avoid using highly customized or complex logic within AppIntro slides that might interact with the library in unexpected ways. Stick to the standard usage patterns.
        *   If you *must* use custom views, ensure they are thoroughly security-audited and follow secure coding practices. The vulnerability would likely be *within AppIntro*, but a custom view could be the *trigger*.
        *   Rely on Android's built-in security mechanisms (sandboxing, permissions) to limit the impact of any potential vulnerability.
        *   Regular security audits and penetration testing of the *entire application* are essential, even if the vulnerability is in a library.

## Threat: [Sensitive Information Leakage (via a vulnerability in AppIntro)](./threats/sensitive_information_leakage__via_a_vulnerability_in_appintro_.md)

* **Description:** A vulnerability in AppIntro allows an attacker to access internal data of AppIntro, e.g. by exploiting a vulnerability in a custom view's rendering logic, or a flaw in how AppIntro handles user input.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potentially leading to unauthorized access to backend systems, further attacks, or compromise of user data.
    * **Affected Component:** Potentially any part of the `AppIntro` library, but most likely a custom view used within a slide or a vulnerability in the core `AppIntroFragment` or `AppIntro` classes.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `AppIntro` library updated to the latest version to receive security patches.
        *   Avoid using custom views within AppIntro slides unless absolutely necessary. If custom views are required, ensure they are thoroughly security-audited and follow secure coding practices.
        *   Avoid any form of user input within AppIntro slides unless strictly necessary and properly sanitized.
        *   Rely on Android's built-in security mechanisms (sandboxing, permissions) to limit the impact of any potential vulnerability.
        *   Perform regular security audits and penetration testing of the entire application.
