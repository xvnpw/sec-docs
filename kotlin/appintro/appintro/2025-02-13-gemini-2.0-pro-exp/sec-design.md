# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide an easy-to-use and customizable library for creating app introductions (onboarding screens) for Android applications.
*   Simplify the development process for app developers by offering a pre-built solution for a common UI pattern.
*   Maintain a lightweight and performant library to minimize the impact on the host application's size and speed.
*   Offer sufficient customization options to allow developers to match the app intro to their app's branding and style.
*   Ensure compatibility with a wide range of Android versions.
*   Provide good documentation and support to the user community.

Business Risks:

*   Low adoption rate due to lack of awareness or competition from similar libraries.
*   Negative user reviews due to bugs, lack of features, or poor performance.
*   Inability to maintain the library and keep it up-to-date with the latest Android versions and best practices.
*   Security vulnerabilities that could be exploited in applications using the library.
*   Compatibility issues with other libraries or specific device configurations.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: The library itself does not handle sensitive data directly. It primarily deals with UI elements and user navigation. (Implicit in the nature of the library)
*   security control: The library does not make network requests. (Implicit in the nature of the library)
*   security control: The library does not store any data persistently. (Implicit in the nature of the library)
*   security control: Proguard/R8 rules are provided for code shrinking and obfuscation. (Mentioned in the README)

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The library relies on the host application to handle any sensitive data or user authentication.
*   accepted risk: The library's functionality is limited to UI presentation, and any security vulnerabilities in the host application are outside the library's scope.
*   accepted risk: The library does not implement specific input validation beyond what is provided by the Android framework for standard UI components.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a robust testing strategy, including unit and UI tests, to identify and fix potential bugs that could lead to unexpected behavior.
*   security control: Regularly update dependencies to address any known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
*   security control: Conduct static code analysis (e.g., using Android Lint or FindBugs) to identify potential security issues and code quality problems.
*   security control: Consider adding a Content Security Policy (CSP) if the library uses WebViews (although this is unlikely given the library's purpose).

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not applicable, as the library does not handle user authentication.
*   Authorization: Not applicable, as the library does not manage user roles or permissions.
*   Input Validation: The library should rely on the standard Android UI components and their built-in input validation mechanisms. Any custom views or input handling should include appropriate validation to prevent issues like injection vulnerabilities.
*   Cryptography: Not applicable, as the library does not handle sensitive data requiring encryption.

*   security control: **Secure Build Environment:** The build server (GitHub Actions) provides a secure and isolated environment for building the library.
*   security control: **Dependency Scanning:** (Recommended) Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Providing a seamless and user-friendly onboarding experience for Android applications.

Data Protection:

*   The library itself does not handle any sensitive data. The host application is responsible for protecting any user data. Therefore, there is no data sensitivity classification needed for the library itself.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) that the host application must adhere to, which might indirectly impact the library's usage? (Although the library doesn't handle data, compliance of the host app is relevant.)
*   Are there any plans to add features that might involve handling user data or making network requests in the future?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a functional and easy-to-use library, with security being a secondary but important consideration.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The host application is responsible for the overall security of the user experience, including data protection and authentication. The library is assumed to be used in a secure manner within the host application.
*   DESIGN: The library's design is simple and focused on UI presentation. It does not interact with external systems or services beyond the Android OS. The provided deployment model via Maven Central/JitPack is the most common and will be used.
