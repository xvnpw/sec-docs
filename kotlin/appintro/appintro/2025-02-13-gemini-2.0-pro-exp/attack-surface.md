# Attack Surface Analysis for appintro/appintro

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection (via severely flawed custom slide implementation)](./attack_surfaces/code_injection__via_severely_flawed_custom_slide_implementation_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into the application through a vulnerability in a *custom* slide implementation provided by the application developer, leveraging `AppIntro`'s extensibility.
*   **AppIntro Contribution:** `AppIntro` provides the *mechanism* (custom slide implementations) that, if implemented extremely poorly by the application developer, could allow for code injection.  This is *not* a vulnerability in `AppIntro` itself, but in the application's code that *uses* `AppIntro`.
*   **Example:** A developer creates a custom slide that takes user input from an *untrusted source* (e.g., a deep link parameter, a broadcast receiver) and directly injects this input into a `TextView` or other UI element *without any sanitization or escaping*.  This is a classic XSS vulnerability, but facilitated by the custom slide mechanism.  The attacker could inject HTML/JavaScript that would then be executed.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the application's context, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application and access to user data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (Requires a severely flawed custom slide implementation and an external vector to provide malicious input).  Could be considered Critical in some scenarios, depending on the application's permissions and the injected code.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Strict Input Sanitization:**  *Never* directly display user input from untrusted sources without rigorous sanitization and output encoding.  Use a well-vetted HTML sanitizer library if displaying HTML.  Prefer whitelisting to blacklisting.
        *   **Avoid Untrusted Input:**  Do not accept user input for display within intro slides from untrusted sources (e.g., external intents, broadcast receivers) unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
        *   **Code Review:**  Thoroughly review all custom slide implementations for potential injection vulnerabilities.  Use static analysis tools to identify potential issues.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application only requests the necessary permissions.
    *   **User:**
        *   Avoid installing apps from untrusted sources.
        *   Be cautious of apps that request excessive permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Bypassing Restrictions (Intro Skip/Done) - *If* intro contains critical security setup.](./attack_surfaces/bypassing_restrictions__intro_skipdone__-_if_intro_contains_critical_security_setup.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker bypasses the intro sequence, which, in this *specific* and *unusual* scenario, is used to perform *critical* security setup (e.g., setting up a mandatory encryption key, accepting legally binding terms of service that are *essential* for secure operation).
*   **AppIntro Contribution:** `AppIntro` provides the "Skip" and "Done" functionality, and the application's logic around these actions is crucial.
*   **Example:** The application uses the intro sequence to *mandatorily* set up a device-specific encryption key, and bypassing the intro means the key is not set, leaving data vulnerable. This is a *highly unusual* use of an intro sequence.  A more common (but still medium-risk) example is bypassing legally binding terms.
*   **Impact:**  Compromised security due to incomplete setup, potential legal ramifications. The severity depends entirely on what is being bypassed. If it's *critical* security setup, the impact is high.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (Only if the intro is used for *critical* security setup, which is not a typical use case).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Do Not Use Intro for Critical Setup:**  Avoid using the intro sequence for *essential* security setup.  Use a dedicated, more robust mechanism for such tasks.
        *   **Secure State Management:**  Use secure, tamper-proof methods to track whether the critical setup (if, for some reason, it *must* be part of the intro) has been completed.  Do not rely on simple preferences.
        *   **Intent Filtering:**  Protect any intents that could be used to bypass the intro.
    *   **User:**
        *   Avoid rooting or jailbreaking your device.
