## Attack Tree Path: [1. Manipulate Slide Content/Behavior [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__manipulate_slide_contentbehavior__high-risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This is a high-risk area because it focuses on injecting malicious code into the AppIntro slides, which can lead to various attacks, including data theft and session hijacking. The attacker aims to control what is displayed to the user and potentially execute arbitrary code in the user's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Inject Malicious Code into Slide Content (If AppIntro allows arbitrary HTML/JS) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_inject_malicious_code_into_slide_content__if_appintro_allows_arbitrary_htmljs___high-risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:**  This focuses on the core vulnerability of allowing unsanitized user input to be rendered within the AppIntro slides.  If the library doesn't properly sanitize input, attackers can inject malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Exploit Lack of Input Sanitization in Slide Text/Images [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_exploit_lack_of_input_sanitization_in_slide_textimages__critical_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This is the *critical* vulnerability that enables the injection attacks.  If input isn't sanitized, everything else falls apart.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1 Craft XSS payload in slide description (if displayed as HTML). [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1_craft_xss_payload_in_slide_description__if_displayed_as_html____high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts a malicious JavaScript payload and inserts it into the text description of a slide. If AppIntro renders this description as HTML without proper sanitization, the JavaScript will execute when the slide is displayed.
*   **Likelihood:** High (if no sanitization) / Low (with proper sanitization)
*   **Impact:** High (data theft, session hijacking)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (can be detected by security tools/audits)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.2 Inject malicious JavaScript via a crafted image URL (if images are loaded without proper validation). [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_2_inject_malicious_javascript_via_a_crafted_image_url__if_images_are_loaded_without_proper_val_48b744ee.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides a URL to a seemingly harmless image, but the URL actually points to a malicious script or exploits a vulnerability in the image loading process.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on image loading implementation)
*   **Impact:** High (data theft, session hijacking)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (can be detected by network monitoring/CSP violations)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Manipulate Slide Resources (if loaded from external sources)](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_manipulate_slide_resources__if_loaded_from_external_sources_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1 Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack to replace legitimate slide resources (images, videos) with malicious ones. [HIGH-RISK] (if HTTPS is not enforced)](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_to_replace_legitimate_slide_resources__images__videos__with_ma_526f8a5e.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker intercepts the network traffic between the app and the server hosting the slide resources (images, videos).  They replace the legitimate resources with malicious ones, potentially injecting malicious code or displaying inappropriate content.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (if HTTPS and certificate pinning are used) / High (without HTTPS)
*   **Impact:** High (can inject malicious content, compromise user data)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (can be detected by network monitoring)

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Bypass AppIntro Entirely (Data Access/Functionality) [HIGH-RISK] (if AppIntro is used for security-critical functions)](./attack_tree_paths/3__bypass_appintro_entirely__data_accessfunctionality___high-risk___if_appintro_is_used_for_security_7fcc730d.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This high-risk area focuses on scenarios where the attacker completely bypasses the AppIntro flow, potentially gaining access to features or data that should be protected.  This is *especially* dangerous if AppIntro is incorrectly used as a primary security mechanism.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Exploit Improper Integration with Application Logic [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_exploit_improper_integration_with_application_logic__critical_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This highlights the *critical* flaw of relying on AppIntro for security.  Proper application logic should *not* solely depend on AppIntro being completed.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1 If AppIntro is used for onboarding or feature gating, find ways to bypass the checks that determine if AppIntro should be shown. [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1_if_appintro_is_used_for_onboarding_or_feature_gating__find_ways_to_bypass_the_checks_that_dete_8893779d.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker finds a way to circumvent the application's logic that determines whether AppIntro should be displayed.  This could involve modifying the app's code, manipulating shared preferences, or exploiting flaws in the logic.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on how AppIntro is integrated)
*   **Impact:** High (can access restricted features/data)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires understanding of app logic)
