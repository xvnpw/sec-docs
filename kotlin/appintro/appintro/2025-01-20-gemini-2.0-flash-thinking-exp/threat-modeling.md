# Threat Model Analysis for appintro/appintro

## Threat: [Logic Bugs Leading to Bypassing Intro and Security Implications](./threats/logic_bugs_leading_to_bypassing_intro_and_security_implications.md)

**Description:**
- An attacker could exploit logic flaws within the `appintro/appintro` library's code to manipulate the intended flow of the introduction.
- This could involve triggering specific sequences of actions or inputs that cause the library to skip crucial slides or prematurely complete the introduction process.
- If the introduction is intended to present security disclaimers, obtain necessary user consent, or configure initial security settings, bypassing it could have significant security implications.

**Impact:**
- Bypassing security measures or important information intended for the user.
- Leaving the application in an insecure or unconfigured state.
- Potential for further exploitation if the bypassed steps were crucial for security.

**Affected Component:**
- `ViewPager` (for slide transitions and navigation logic), `IndicatorController` (for navigation state), `ISlidePolicy` interface and its implementations (for determining if a slide can be moved away from), and the core logic within the `AppIntro` activity/fragment responsible for managing the introduction flow.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Keep Library Updated:** Ensure the `appintro/appintro` library is updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes that may address such logic flaws.
- **Thorough Testing:** Implement comprehensive UI and integration tests specifically targeting the introduction flow, including attempts to bypass slides or complete the intro prematurely through unexpected interactions.
- **Review Library Source Code (if necessary):** For critical applications, consider reviewing the relevant parts of the `appintro/appintro` library's source code to understand its internal logic and identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [State Management Vulnerabilities Leading to Insecure State Transitions](./threats/state_management_vulnerabilities_leading_to_insecure_state_transitions.md)

**Description:**
- An attacker might be able to manipulate the internal state of the `appintro/appintro` library in a way that leads to insecure state transitions or an inconsistent application state.
- This could involve influencing how the library tracks the current slide, whether the introduction has been completed, or other internal flags that control its behavior.
- By manipulating this state, an attacker could potentially bypass intended restrictions or trigger unintended actions.

**Impact:**
- Bypassing intended workflows or security checks that rely on the correct state of the introduction.
- Inconsistent application behavior, potentially leading to unexpected vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:**
- Internal state variables and methods within the `AppIntro` activity/fragment and related classes responsible for managing the introduction's state (e.g., variables tracking the current slide index, completion status).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Follow Library Guidelines:** Adhere strictly to the recommended practices and lifecycle methods provided by the `appintro/appintro` library for managing its state. Avoid direct and unsupported manipulation of internal state.
- **Stateless Design (where possible):** Design the application logic that follows the introduction to be as stateless as possible, minimizing reliance on the specific internal state of the `AppIntro` component after it has completed.
- **Input Validation (Indirectly):** While not direct input, ensure that any external factors that might influence the AppIntro's state (though less common) are validated to prevent unexpected state changes.
