```


## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Content Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_content_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious content into AppIntro slides.
*   **AppIntro Involvement:** AppIntro renders the provided content, executing any embedded scripts or displaying malicious links.
*   **Impact:**  Potential for complete compromise of the user's session, leading to actions on behalf of the user, data theft, and redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement strict input validation and output encoding/escaping for all content. Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP). Securely handle dynamic content and custom layouts.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Inject Malicious Scripts (XSS)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__inject_malicious_scripts__xss_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Injecting JavaScript code into AppIntro slides that will be executed in the user's browser.
*   **AppIntro Involvement:** AppIntro's rendering engine executes the injected JavaScript.
*   **Impact:** Steal user credentials, redirect users to malicious sites, perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Mitigation:**  Thoroughly sanitize all input before rendering it in AppIntro. Use appropriate encoding techniques. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Via Dynamically Loaded Content](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__via_dynamically_loaded_content.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Malicious scripts are injected through content loaded dynamically into AppIntro slides from sources like servers or local storage.
*   **AppIntro Involvement:** AppIntro renders the dynamically loaded content, including any malicious scripts.
*   **Impact:** Steal user credentials, redirect users to malicious sites, perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement strict input validation and output encoding/escaping for all dynamically loaded content. Use Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Via Misconfigured Custom Layouts](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__via_misconfigured_custom_layouts.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  XSS vulnerabilities are introduced due to improper handling of user-provided or dynamic data within custom AppIntro layouts.
*   **AppIntro Involvement:** AppIntro uses the provided custom layout, and if it contains unsanitized user data, it can be exploited.
*   **Impact:** Steal user credentials, redirect users to malicious sites, perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Mitigation:** Ensure all custom layouts properly sanitize any dynamic data. Avoid using `WebView` for rendering if possible, or carefully manage its security settings.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Manipulate or Bypass AppIntro's Intended Flow](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__manipulate_or_bypass_appintro's_intended_flow.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers alter the intended onboarding process, potentially injecting malicious content or misleading users.
*   **AppIntro Involvement:** Exploiting weaknesses in how AppIntro handles configuration or navigation.
*   **Impact:** Display misleading information, inject malicious content, alter the intended onboarding process.
*   **Mitigation:** Secure the source of AppIntro configuration data using HTTPS and authentication. Implement integrity checks. Avoid relying solely on client-side checks for onboarding flow.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Intercept or Modify Configuration Data](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__intercept_or_modify_configuration_data.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Attackers intercept and modify AppIntro's configuration data if it's fetched insecurely.
*   **AppIntro Involvement:** AppIntro relies on the configuration data to function correctly.
*   **Impact:** Display misleading information, inject malicious content, alter the intended onboarding process.
*   **Mitigation:** Secure the source of AppIntro configuration data (HTTPS, authentication). Implement integrity checks to verify the data hasn't been tampered with.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Misconfigurations or Outdated Versions of AppIntro](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_misconfigurations_or_outdated_versions_of_appintro.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Utilizing known vulnerabilities in outdated versions of the AppIntro library.
*   **AppIntro Involvement:** The vulnerability resides within the AppIntro library itself.
*   **Impact:** Can lead to various forms of compromise depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation:** Regularly update the AppIntro library to the latest stable version. Monitor security advisories for known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Using Outdated AppIntro Version with Known Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__using_outdated_appintro_version_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting publicly known security flaws present in older versions of the AppIntro library.
*   **AppIntro Involvement:** The application uses a vulnerable version of the library.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can leverage these vulnerabilities to compromise the application in various ways.
*   **Mitigation:** Regularly update the AppIntro library to the latest stable version. Monitor security advisories for known vulnerabilities.
