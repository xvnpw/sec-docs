# Attack Surface Analysis for appintro/appintro

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Content Injection in Slides](./attack_surfaces/malicious_content_injection_in_slides.md)

**Description:** The application displays content within the AppIntro slides, which can be customized. If this content is sourced from an untrusted origin or not properly sanitized, malicious scripts or content can be injected.

**How AppIntro Contributes:** AppIntro provides the framework for displaying this content, including support for text, images, and even WebViews in custom slides. It's the application's responsibility to populate this content securely.

**Example:** An attacker could compromise a remote server providing intro slide content, injecting malicious JavaScript into a `WebView` slide. This script could then steal session tokens or perform actions on behalf of the user within the application's context.

**Impact:**  Potentially full compromise of the user's session, data theft, or unauthorized actions within the application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Content Source Control:** Ensure all content displayed in AppIntro slides originates from trusted and controlled sources.
* **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize any dynamic content before displaying it in AppIntro, especially if it originates from user input or external sources.
* **Disable JavaScript in WebViews (if not needed):** If `WebView` slides are used but JavaScript is not required, disable it to prevent script injection attacks.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement and enforce a strong CSP for any WebViews used within AppIntro slides to restrict the sources from which scripts and other resources can be loaded.
