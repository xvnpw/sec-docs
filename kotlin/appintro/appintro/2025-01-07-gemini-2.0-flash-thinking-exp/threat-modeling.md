# Threat Model Analysis for appintro/appintro

## Threat: [Malicious Content Injection via Custom Slide Text](./threats/malicious_content_injection_via_custom_slide_text.md)

**Description:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious content, such as phishing links or deceptive text, into the AppIntro slides if the application leverages AppIntro's customization features to dynamically load text content from untrusted sources for the slides. This directly involves how AppIntro renders the text provided to it.

**Impact:** Users could be tricked into clicking malicious links, revealing sensitive information, or performing unintended actions within or outside the application.

**Affected Component:** `AppIntro` library's slide content rendering mechanism, specifically how text is displayed in `SlidePage`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid loading dynamic text content for AppIntro slides from untrusted sources.
* If dynamic content is necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization before passing it to AppIntro.
* Consider using static resources for the majority of AppIntro text content.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Hardcoded Secrets in AppIntro Content](./threats/information_disclosure_via_hardcoded_secrets_in_appintro_content.md)

**Description:** Developers might inadvertently include sensitive information, such as API keys, internal identifiers, or configuration details, within the text or images directly used by the `AppIntro` library for displaying slides. This makes the secrets directly accessible if an attacker inspects the application's resources.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potentially leading to unauthorized access to backend systems, data breaches, or other security compromises.

**Affected Component:** Application's resource files (strings, drawables) directly used by the `AppIntro` library for displaying slide content.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid hardcoding any sensitive information within the application's resources used by AppIntro.
* Retrieve sensitive data from secure storage or backend systems at runtime and avoid displaying them directly in the intro.
* Regularly review the content of AppIntro slides for any accidental inclusion of sensitive information.
