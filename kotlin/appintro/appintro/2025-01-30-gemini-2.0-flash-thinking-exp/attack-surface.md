# Attack Surface Analysis for appintro/appintro

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Custom Slide Implementations (WebView/Custom Layouts)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_custom_slide_implementations__webviewcustom_layouts_.md)

*   **Description:** Developers utilizing AppIntro's custom slide feature with `WebView` or complex custom layouts can introduce vulnerabilities. This arises from the flexibility AppIntro provides, allowing integration of potentially insecure components within the onboarding flow. If not implemented with robust security measures, these custom slides can become entry points for attacks.
*   **AppIntro Contribution:** AppIntro's core design encourages and facilitates the creation of custom slides to enhance the onboarding experience. This direct feature of AppIntro enables the inclusion of components like `WebView` and custom layouts, which, if misused or implemented without security awareness, directly contribute to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** A developer embeds a `WebView` in an AppIntro slide to load dynamic onboarding content. If the source of this content is compromised or the content itself is not properly sanitized, malicious JavaScript can be injected and executed within the `WebView` context. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to phishing sites, all initiated through the AppIntro onboarding flow.
*   **Impact:** Data theft, account compromise, unauthorized actions within the application, potential for arbitrary code execution within the `WebView` context, and disruption of the intended onboarding process leading to user frustration or application abandonment.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Minimize `WebView` Usage:**  Avoid using `WebView` in AppIntro custom slides unless absolutely necessary for core onboarding functionality. Consider alternative approaches using native Android UI components for displaying onboarding information.
        *   **Strict `WebView` Security:** If `WebView` is unavoidable, implement rigorous security measures:
            *   Disable JavaScript execution by default (`setJavaScriptEnabled(false)`) and only enable it if absolutely essential and with extreme caution.
            *   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the `WebView` can load content and execute scripts.
            *   Sanitize and validate all content loaded into the `WebView`, especially if it originates from external or untrusted sources.
            *   Ensure proper error handling and prevent the `WebView` from displaying sensitive error information.
        *   **Secure Custom Layout Design:** When using custom layouts, adhere to UI security best practices to prevent vulnerabilities like clickjacking or UI redressing. Avoid displaying sensitive information directly in onboarding slides if possible.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security reviews of custom slide implementations, especially those involving `WebView` or complex layouts, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities introduced through AppIntro customization.
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Keep Applications Updated:** Ensure the application using AppIntro is updated to the latest version. Developers may release updates to address security vulnerabilities found in custom slide implementations.
        *   **Be Cautious of Unusual Onboarding:** If the onboarding process within an application using AppIntro seems overly complex, requests unusual permissions, or displays suspicious web content within the onboarding flow, exercise caution and consider the application's overall trustworthiness.
