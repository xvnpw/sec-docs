    *   Impact: Medium to High (depending on what intro gates)
    *   Effort: Low to Medium
    *   Skill Level: Low to Medium
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium to High (if purely client-side)
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   Ensure robust and reliable checks for intro completion.

    *   Avoid client-side only checks for critical access control.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2. Client-Side Storage Manipulation (If AppIntro relies on client-side storage for state) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2__client-side_storage_manipulation__if_appintro_relies_on_client-side_storage_for_state___high_ri_473f82d1.md)

*   **Description:** If the application or AppIntro uses client-side storage (like LocalStorage or Cookies in browsers) to store the intro completion state, attackers can directly manipulate this storage.
*   **Risk Metrics:**
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Medium to High (if bypassing security checks)
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Low
    *   Detection Difficulty: High (without server-side validation)
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   Avoid relying solely on client-side storage for critical security decisions.
    *   Implement server-side validation to verify intro completion status.
    *   If client-side storage is used, consider security measures like encryption or integrity checks (though server-side validation is preferred).

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1. Modify LocalStorage/Cookies (Browser-based apps) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_1__modify_localstoragecookies__browser-based_apps___high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)
