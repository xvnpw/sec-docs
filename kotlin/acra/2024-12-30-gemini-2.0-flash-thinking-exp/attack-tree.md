Threat Model for Application Using Acra: High-Risk Sub-Tree

Objective: Compromise application data protected by Acra by exploiting weaknesses within Acra itself.

High-Risk Sub-Tree:

* Compromise Application Data via Acra Exploitation **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    * Bypass Acra Protection **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
        * Direct Database Access (L: Medium, I: High, E: Low, S: Low, D: Low) **[CRITICAL NODE]**
            * Exploit Application Vulnerability Allowing Direct DB Access (L: Medium, I: High, E: Medium, S: Medium, D: Low) **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
                * SQL Injection bypassing Acra (L: Medium, I: High, E: Medium, S: Medium, D: Low) **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
    * Compromise Acra Server (L: Low, I: Critical, E: High, S: High, D: Medium) **[CRITICAL NODE]** **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
        * Gain Unauthorized Access to Acra Server (L: Low, I: Critical, E: High, S: High, D: Medium) **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
            * Exploit OS-Level Vulnerabilities on Acra Server (L: Low, I: Critical, E: Medium, S: Medium, D: Medium) **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
                * Remote Code Execution on Acra Server (L: Low, I: Critical, E: High, S: High, D: Medium) **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
            * Compromise Acra Server Configuration (L: Low, I: Critical, E: Medium, S: Medium, D: Medium) **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
                * Access Configuration Files with Sensitive Data (L: Low, I: Critical, E: Low, S: Low, D: Low) **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
        * Compromise Acra Master Key (L: Low, I: Critical, E: High, S: High, D: Medium) **[CRITICAL NODE]** **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
            * Exploit Key Storage Vulnerabilities (L: Low, I: Critical, E: Medium, S: Medium, D: Medium) **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
                * Insecure File Permissions (L: Low, I: Critical, E: Low, S: Low, D: Low) **[HIGH RISK PATH]**

Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

* **Compromise Application Data via Acra Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This represents the successful achievement of the attacker's objective, resulting in unauthorized access to or manipulation of data protected by Acra.

* **Bypass Acra Protection [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * This path encompasses techniques that allow an attacker to access or modify data without going through Acra's encryption and decryption mechanisms.

* **Direct Database Access [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This critical node signifies a situation where the attacker can interact directly with the database, bypassing Acra entirely.

* **Exploit Application Vulnerability Allowing Direct DB Access [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * This path involves leveraging vulnerabilities within the application code that permit direct database interaction, circumventing Acra's protection.
        * **SQL Injection bypassing Acra [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * An attacker injects malicious SQL code into application inputs that are then executed directly against the database, bypassing Acra's encryption. This can lead to data extraction, modification, or deletion.

* **Compromise Acra Server [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * This critical node and high-risk path involve gaining control over the Acra server, which manages encryption and decryption. This grants the attacker significant power over protected data.

* **Gain Unauthorized Access to Acra Server [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * This path focuses on methods to gain unauthorized entry into the Acra server.
        * **Exploit OS-Level Vulnerabilities on Acra Server [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * This involves exploiting weaknesses in the operating system running the Acra server.
                * **Remote Code Execution on Acra Server [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                    * An attacker exploits a vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the Acra server, granting them complete control.
        * **Compromise Acra Server Configuration [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * This involves manipulating or exploiting weaknesses in the Acra server's configuration.
                * **Access Configuration Files with Sensitive Data [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                    * Attackers gain access to configuration files that may contain sensitive information like database credentials or internal secrets, which can be used for further attacks.

* **Compromise Acra Master Key [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * This critical node and high-risk path involve obtaining the Acra master key, which is used to encrypt and decrypt data. Possessing this key allows the attacker to decrypt all protected data.
        * **Exploit Key Storage Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in how the master key is stored.
                * **Insecure File Permissions [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                    * The master key file has overly permissive access rights, allowing unauthorized users to read it.
