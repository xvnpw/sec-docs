# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for acra/acra

## Mitigation Strategy: [Mutual TLS (mTLS) Authentication between AcraConnector and AcraServer](./mitigation_strategies/mutual_tls__mtls__authentication_between_acraconnector_and_acraserver.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Step 1: Certificate Generation:** Generate TLS certificates for both AcraConnector and AcraServer. Use a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) or a self-signed CA for internal use.
    2.  **Step 2: AcraServer Configuration:** Configure AcraServer to *require* client certificate authentication. Specify the path to the CA certificate for verifying client certificates in AcraServer's configuration.
    3.  **Step 3: AcraConnector Configuration:** Configure AcraConnector to *present* its certificate to AcraServer during TLS handshake. Specify the paths to the connector's certificate and private key in AcraConnector's configuration.
    4.  **Step 4: Enable mTLS in Acra:** Enable mTLS in Acra's communication configuration, typically by setting configuration flags or environment variables for both AcraConnector and AcraServer.
    5.  **Step 5: Verification:** Test the connection between AcraConnector and AcraServer to confirm mTLS is active. Verify that connections without valid client certificates are rejected by AcraServer, confirming mutual authentication.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to AcraServer (High Severity):** Without mTLS, any network entity could attempt to connect to AcraServer. mTLS restricts access to only AcraConnectors with valid certificates, preventing unauthorized access attempts *specifically to AcraServer*.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Acra Communication (High Severity):** Without mTLS, communication between AcraConnector and AcraServer is vulnerable to interception. mTLS encrypts this communication channel and mutually authenticates endpoints, preventing MITM attacks *targeting Acra's internal communication*.
    *   **Spoofing of AcraConnector (Medium Severity):** An attacker compromising a network system might try to impersonate AcraConnector. mTLS makes spoofing harder by requiring a valid certificate, adding an authentication layer *specific to Acra's component interaction*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to AcraServer:** High risk reduction. mTLS effectively blocks unauthorized connections *at the AcraServer level*.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Acra Communication:** High risk reduction. mTLS provides strong encryption and mutual authentication for *Acra's communication channels*.
    *   **Spoofing of AcraConnector:** Medium risk reduction. mTLS adds a significant authentication barrier against connector spoofing *within the Acra ecosystem*.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. TLS encryption is used for Acra communication, but mutual TLS (client certificate authentication) is not enforced *within the Acra setup*.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Full mTLS implementation by configuring AcraServer to require client certificates and AcraConnectors to provide them. This involves certificate management and configuration changes *within Acra's components*.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Key Management for AcraTranslator Decryption Keys](./mitigation_strategies/secure_key_management_for_acratranslator_decryption_keys.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Step 1: Integrate with KMS:** Integrate AcraTranslator with a dedicated Key Management System (KMS) like HashiCorp Vault, AWS KMS, or Azure Key Vault. Avoid storing decryption keys directly within AcraTranslator's configuration or local storage.
    2.  **Step 2: Key Storage in KMS:** Generate or import Acra decryption keys into the KMS. Leverage the KMS's security features for key storage, including encryption and access controls.
    3.  **Step 3: AcraTranslator Authentication to KMS:** Configure AcraTranslator to authenticate to the KMS using secure methods (e.g., API keys, IAM roles, service accounts). Ensure robust and regularly rotated authentication credentials *for AcraTranslator's access to the KMS*.
    4.  **Step 4: Key Retrieval from KMS in AcraTranslator:** Modify AcraTranslator to retrieve decryption keys from the KMS at startup or on-demand via KMS APIs, instead of loading them from local files or environment variables. *This changes how AcraTranslator obtains its keys*.
    5.  **Step 5: KMS Access Control Policies:** Implement strict access control policies within the KMS to limit access to Acra decryption keys. Only authorized AcraTranslator instances or service accounts should be permitted to retrieve these keys. *This is about controlling access to Acra's decryption keys*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Decryption Key Compromise in AcraTranslator Environment (Critical Severity):** Storing decryption keys insecurely in AcraTranslator makes them vulnerable if the AcraTranslator server is compromised. KMS integration significantly reduces this risk *specifically for Acra's decryption keys*.
    *   **Unauthorized Decryption via AcraTranslator (High Severity):**  Lack of access control to decryption keys could allow unauthorized decryption. KMS access control policies mitigate this threat by controlling *who and what can use Acra's decryption keys*.
    *   **Insider Threats Targeting Acra Decryption Keys (Medium Severity):** Local key storage increases insider threat risks. KMS centralizes key management and improves auditing and control *over Acra's sensitive decryption keys*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Decryption Key Compromise in AcraTranslator Environment:** High risk reduction. KMS provides a hardened environment for *Acra decryption key* storage.
    *   **Unauthorized Decryption via AcraTranslator:** High risk reduction. KMS access control enforces least privilege for *access to Acra decryption keys*.
    *   **Insider Threats Targeting Acra Decryption Keys:** Medium risk reduction. KMS improves auditability and control *over Acra key management*.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Decryption keys are currently stored as environment variables or configuration files on the AcraTranslator server, which is less secure than KMS *for Acra's key management*.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Full integration with a KMS for secure storage, retrieval, and access control of decryption keys *used by AcraTranslator*. This requires development within AcraTranslator and KMS configuration.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization in AcraConnector](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_in_acraconnector.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Step 1: Identify AcraConnector Input Points:** Identify all points where AcraConnector receives input, specifically data intended for encryption and commands for AcraServer. *Focus on AcraConnector's role as an input point*.
    2.  **Step 2: Define Validation Rules for Acra Data:** Define strict validation rules for all input data processed by AcraConnector. This includes data type, format, length, and allowed characters for data intended for encryption and commands for AcraServer. *Rules should be specific to the data Acra handles*.
    3.  **Step 3: Implement Input Validation in AcraConnector:** Implement input validation logic within AcraConnector's code. Reject invalid input and log rejections for monitoring. *This is about modifying AcraConnector's behavior*.
    4.  **Step 4: Output Sanitization (if applicable in AcraConnector):** If AcraConnector outputs data (less common), sanitize outputs to prevent injection vulnerabilities in downstream systems. *Consider output sanitization within AcraConnector's context*.
    5.  **Step 5: Regular Review of Acra Input Validation:** Regularly review and update input validation rules as the application and Acra usage evolve. *Maintain Acra-specific input validation rules*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks Targeting AcraServer (SQL Injection, Command Injection) (High Severity):** Unsanitized input forwarded by AcraConnector to AcraServer could lead to injection attacks *targeting AcraServer through AcraConnector*. Input validation in AcraConnector prevents malicious payloads from reaching AcraServer.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks via AcraConnector (Medium Severity):** Malicious input to AcraConnector could cause crashes or unresponsiveness in AcraConnector or AcraServer. Input validation in AcraConnector can prevent processing of malicious inputs *before they impact Acra components*.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues in Acra-Encrypted Data (Medium Severity):** Invalid input data could lead to data corruption in encrypted data. Input validation in AcraConnector ensures only valid data is encrypted and processed *by Acra*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks Targeting AcraServer:** High risk reduction. Input validation in AcraConnector is a key defense against injection vulnerabilities *targeting AcraServer*.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks via AcraConnector:** Medium risk reduction. Input validation in AcraConnector can filter some DoS attacks *aimed at Acra components*.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues in Acra-Encrypted Data:** Medium risk reduction. Input validation in AcraConnector helps maintain data integrity *within the Acra-protected system*.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic input validation might exist in AcraConnector, but a comprehensive and consistent strategy is missing *specifically within AcraConnector*.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Systematic input validation across all input points in AcraConnector. This includes defining rules, implementing validation logic in AcraConnector code, and regular reviews *focused on AcraConnector's role*.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Step 1: Monitor Acra Updates:** Subscribe to Acra project's security mailing lists, release notes, and GitHub repository to track new releases, security updates, and vulnerability disclosures *specifically for Acra*.
    2.  **Step 2: Vulnerability Scanning for Acra Components:** Implement regular vulnerability scanning of AcraServer, AcraConnector, AcraTranslator, and their dependencies. Use tools to identify known vulnerabilities *in Acra and its ecosystem*.
    3.  **Step 3: Acra Patch Management Process:** Establish a patch management process for Acra components, including testing updates in staging before production and a rollback plan. *This process is specifically for Acra updates*.
    4.  **Step 4: Timely Acra Patch Application:** Apply security patches and updates for Acra components promptly after testing. Prioritize patching critical vulnerabilities *identified in Acra*.
    5.  **Step 5: Acra Dependency Updates:** Regularly update Acra's dependencies to address vulnerabilities in libraries used by Acra. *Focus on dependencies of Acra components*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Acra (High Severity):** Unpatched vulnerabilities in Acra components can be exploited. Regular patching mitigates this risk *specifically for Acra vulnerabilities*.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits Targeting Acra (Medium Severity):** While patching can't prevent zero-days, keeping Acra updated reduces the attack surface and makes exploitation harder *even for unknown vulnerabilities in Acra*.
    *   **Compliance Violations Related to Acra Security (Varying Severity):** Security compliance standards often require regular patching. Failure to patch Acra can lead to violations *related to Acra's security posture*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Acra:** High risk reduction. Patching directly addresses known vulnerabilities *within Acra*.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits Targeting Acra:** Medium risk reduction. Updated Acra is generally more resilient *against various attacks, including potential zero-days*.
    *   **Compliance Violations Related to Acra Security:** High risk reduction. Regular patching helps meet compliance requirements *related to Acra's security*.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Awareness exists, but a formal, consistent process for monitoring, testing, and applying security updates for Acra components is lacking. *Specifically for Acra components*.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Formal patch management process, automated vulnerability scanning for Acra components and dependencies, and monitoring for Acra security announcements. This includes defining procedures and tools *specifically for Acra security updates*.
