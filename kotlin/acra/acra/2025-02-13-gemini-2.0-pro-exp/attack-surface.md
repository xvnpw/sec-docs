# Attack Surface Analysis for acra/acra

## Attack Surface: [AcraServer Compromise](./attack_surfaces/acraserver_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains full control over the AcraServer host machine.
*   **How Acra Contributes:** AcraServer is a critical component handling encryption/decryption; its compromise exposes all data in transit and potentially keys. This is *directly* an Acra concern.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the AcraServer's operating system or a dependency to gain shell access.
*   **Impact:** Complete data breach, potential data modification, lateral movement to other systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Hardening:** Use a minimal, hardened operating system for the AcraServer host. Apply all security patches promptly.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate AcraServer in a dedicated network segment with strict firewall rules.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run AcraServer with the lowest possible privileges.
    *   **Monitoring:** Implement IDS/IPS and monitor AcraServer logs.
    *   **Authentication:** Use strong authentication to access the AcraServer host.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.

## Attack Surface: [Key Management Weaknesses (Related to Acra's Key Usage)](./attack_surfaces/key_management_weaknesses__related_to_acra's_key_usage_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities related to how Acra *uses* and interacts with keys, even if a secure KMS is used. This focuses on Acra's specific handling, not the general security of the KMS itself.
*   **How Acra Contributes:** Acra's internal logic for key selection, rotation (if handled by Acra), and usage within cryptographic operations is a direct Acra concern.  Even with a secure KMS, incorrect *usage* by Acra is a vulnerability.
*   **Example:** Acra is misconfigured to use the same key for all data, or a predictable key derivation process is used within Acra.  Or, Acra fails to properly validate key metadata received from the KMS.
*   **Impact:** Complete data breach if the misused keys are compromised or cryptanalysis is successful.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Correct Configuration:**  Ensure Acra is configured to use keys according to best practices (e.g., per-field encryption, proper key identifiers).  Follow Acra's documentation meticulously.
    *   **Key Rotation (if managed by Acra):** If Acra handles key rotation internally (rather than delegating entirely to the KMS), ensure the rotation process is robust and secure.
    *   **Code Review (Acra Core):**  For advanced deployments, consider reviewing Acra's source code (if feasible) to understand its key handling logic.
    *   **Auditing (Acra Logs):**  Enable and monitor Acra's logs for any key-related errors or warnings.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) against AcraServer/AcraTranslator](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__against_acraserveracratranslator.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker overwhelms AcraServer or AcraTranslator with requests.
*   **How Acra Contributes:** These are *Acra-specific* components; their vulnerability to DoS is a direct Acra concern.
*   **Example:** An attacker floods AcraServer with connection requests.
*   **Impact:** Application downtime.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on AcraServer and AcraTranslator.
    *   **Connection Limits:** Configure connection pooling limits.
    *   **Load Balancing:** Deploy multiple instances behind a load balancer.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor resource usage and set alerts.
    *   **DDoS Protection:** Consider a DDoS mitigation service.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Acra's TLS Configuration)](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks__acra's_tls_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:** Interception due to *Acra's* TLS misconfiguration (between app and AcraServer, or AcraServer and database).
*   **How Acra Contributes:** Acra's specific TLS configuration settings and certificate handling are a direct Acra responsibility.
*   **Example:** AcraServer uses weak ciphers or doesn't validate certificates.
*   **Impact:** Data interception and potential modification.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong TLS Configuration:** Enforce strong TLS ciphers and protocols.
    *   **Certificate Validation:** Ensure proper certificate validation.
    *   **Mutual TLS (mTLS):** Use mTLS where possible.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit TLS configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Within Acra Components)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__within_acra_components_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in libraries *directly used by* AcraServer, AcraConnector, or AcraTranslator.
*   **How Acra Contributes:** These are vulnerabilities *within* Acra's components, making them a direct Acra concern.
*   **Example:** A vulnerable cryptographic library used by AcraServer is exploited.
*   **Impact:** Varies; could be DoS to RCE, depending on the specific vulnerability within the dependency.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical, depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use SCA tools to identify vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Acra components and dependencies updated.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Monitor for security advisories.
    *   **Vendor Patches:** Apply patches promptly.
