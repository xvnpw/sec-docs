## Attack Tree Path: [A. Compromise Acra Server/Reader](./attack_tree_paths/a__compromise_acra_serverreader.md)

*   **A1: Vulnerability in AcraServer/Reader Code [HR]:**
    *   **Description:** Exploit a software vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, format string vulnerability, injection flaw, deserialization vulnerability) in the AcraServer or AcraReader code itself. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, potentially gaining access to cryptographic keys or disrupting the decryption process.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced/Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium/Hard

*   **A2: Compromise Host System [HR]:**
    *   **Description:** Gain access to the underlying operating system where AcraServer/Reader is running. This is a prerequisite for many other attacks, providing a foothold to further compromise Acra components.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium/High
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate/Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [B. Compromise Acra Storage](./attack_tree_paths/b__compromise_acra_storage.md)

*   **B1: Unauthorized Access to Encrypted Data Storage [HR]:**
    *   **Description:** Gain direct access to the storage where Acra stores encrypted data (Acrastructs). While the data is encrypted, this access could allow for data deletion, modification (leading to integrity issues), or reconnaissance for further attacks.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium
    *   **Effort:** Low/Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **B2: Unauthorized Access to Key Storage (Poisoning) [CN, HR]:**
    *   **Description:** Gain access to the storage where Acra stores its cryptographic keys (the keystore). This is the most critical attack vector.  If successful, the attacker can decrypt all data protected by Acra or inject malicious data.  Poisoning refers to modifying or replacing legitimate keys with attacker-controlled keys.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** High/Very High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced/Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard/Very Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [D. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) during Key/Data Exchange](./attack_tree_paths/d__man-in-the-middle__mitm__during_keydata_exchange.md)

*   **D2: TLS Misconfiguration (AcraServer/Reader/Connector) [HR]:**
    *   **Description:** Acra relies on TLS for secure communication. Misconfigured TLS (e.g., weak ciphers, expired certificates, untrusted CAs) can allow an attacker to intercept and decrypt traffic between Acra components (AcraServer, AcraReader, AcraConnector, and the client application). This is a classic MITM attack enabled by weak TLS settings.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low/Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
