# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for acra/acra

## Mitigation Strategy: [Hardware Security Module (HSM) Integration with Acra](./mitigation_strategies/hardware_security_module__hsm__integration_with_acra.md)

**Description:**
1.  **HSM Selection:** Choose a FIPS 140-2 Level 3 (or higher) certified HSM compatible with Acra.
2.  **HSM Setup:** Install and configure the HSM.
3.  **Acra Configuration:** Configure AcraServer/AcraTranslator to use the HSM via Acra's configuration parameters (e.g., `hsm_api`, `hsm_keys_db`).  Specify the HSM connection details and key identifiers.
4.  **Key Generation/Import:** Generate master decryption keys *within* the HSM or securely import them, ensuring the key never exists in plaintext outside the HSM.
5.  **Testing:** Test the Acra-HSM integration thoroughly, verifying key accessibility and decryption functionality.
6.  **Monitoring:** Monitor the HSM's health and performance, setting up alerts for errors or security events.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Mutual TLS (mTLS) Authentication for Acra Components](./mitigation_strategies/mutual_tls__mtls__authentication_for_acra_components.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Certificate Authority (CA):** Establish a dedicated CA for Acra components.
2.  **Certificate Generation:** Generate unique client and server certificates for each Acra component (AcraServer, AcraTranslator, AcraConnector/AcraWriter instances).
3.  **Certificate Distribution:** Securely distribute certificates.
4.  **Acra Configuration:** Configure AcraServer/AcraTranslator to *require* client certificates. Configure AcraConnector/AcraWriter to present client certificates. Use Acra configuration parameters (e.g., `tls_cert`, `tls_key`, `tls_ca`, `tls_auth_type=mutual`).
5.  **TLS Configuration:** Use strong TLS cipher suites and protocols (e.g., TLS 1.3). Disable weak ciphers.
6.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the mTLS setup.
7.  **Certificate Revocation:** Implement certificate revocation (CRLs or OCSP).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** *High Severity*. Prevents interception/modification of communication.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** *High Severity*. Only authorized components can communicate.
    *   **Impersonation Attacks:** *High Severity*. Prevents impersonation of Acra components.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Very Low*.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Very Low*.
    *   **Impersonation Attacks:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Very Low*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Acra Configuration Hardening](./mitigation_strategies/acra_configuration_hardening.md)

**Description:**
1. **Disable Unused Features:** Review the Acra configuration files (for AcraServer, AcraTranslator, AcraConnector/Writer) and disable any features that are not absolutely necessary for your use case.  For example, if you are only using Acra for decryption, disable any encryption-related functionality.
2. **Secure Configuration Storage:** Protect the Acra configuration files themselves from unauthorized access and modification.  Use appropriate file permissions and consider storing them in a secure location, potentially managed by a secrets management solution.
3. **Audit Logging (Acra-Specific):** Enable detailed audit logging *within Acra* using its built-in logging capabilities.  Log successful and failed decryption attempts, key access events, and any configuration changes. Configure Acra to send these logs to a centralized, secure logging server.
4. **Parameter Validation:**  Review all Acra configuration parameters and ensure they are set to secure and appropriate values.  For example, ensure that TLS settings are strong, connection timeouts are reasonable, and any resource limits are properly configured.
5. **Regular Review:** Periodically review the Acra configuration files to ensure they remain secure and aligned with your security policies.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Configuration Errors:** *Medium Severity*. Reduces the risk of misconfiguration that could weaken security.
    * **Unauthorized Access (via Configuration):** *Medium Severity*. Protects against attackers modifying the configuration to gain access.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** *Medium Severity*. Proper configuration of resource limits and timeouts can help mitigate DoS attacks.
    * **Information Disclosure:** *Medium Severity*. Secure configuration and logging can prevent sensitive information from being leaked.

* **Impact:**
    * **Configuration Errors:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.
    * **Unauthorized Access (via Configuration):** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.
    * **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.

* **Currently Implemented:** Basic configuration is in place, with some logging enabled.

* **Missing Implementation:**  Unused features are not systematically disabled. Configuration files are not stored in a dedicated secrets management solution.  Comprehensive Acra-specific audit logging is not fully configured.  Regular configuration reviews are not formalized.
