# Threat Model Analysis for acra/acra

## Threat: [AcraServer Compromise](./threats/acraserver_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in AcraServer's authentication mechanism, such as a weak password policy or a bypass flaw, to gain unauthorized access to the AcraServer instance. They might then attempt to extract encryption keys from memory or configuration, or directly intercept and decrypt data flowing through the server.

**Impact:** Exposure of all encrypted data stored in the database, allowing the attacker to read sensitive information. Potential for data manipulation or deletion if the attacker gains control over decryption processes. Complete compromise of the security provided by Acra.

**Affected Component:** AcraServer (authentication module, key management functions, data processing pipeline)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strong authentication mechanisms for AcraServer, including multi-factor authentication.
*   Regularly update AcraServer to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Enforce the principle of least privilege for access control to the AcraServer instance.
*   Implement robust intrusion detection and prevention systems around the AcraServer.
*   Regularly audit AcraServer configurations and access logs.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) against AcraServer](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__against_acraserver.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods AcraServer with a large number of invalid or malicious requests, exhausting its resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth). This prevents legitimate application requests from being processed, effectively making the application unable to access the database.

**Impact:** Application downtime and unavailability. Inability for users to access data or perform operations relying on the database. Potential financial losses and reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** AcraServer (request processing module, network interface)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement rate limiting on incoming requests to AcraServer.
*   Deploy AcraServer behind a Web Application Firewall (WAF) or a load balancer with DDoS protection capabilities.
*   Optimize AcraServer resource allocation and configuration to handle expected traffic spikes.
*   Implement monitoring and alerting for unusual traffic patterns to AcraServer.

## Threat: [AcraConnector Compromise](./threats/acraconnector_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the AcraConnector, potentially through a software flaw or by gaining access to the host machine where it's running. They might then intercept encrypted data being sent to AcraServer or manipulate data before encryption.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data before it is encrypted, if interception occurs. Potential for data corruption or manipulation if the attacker can modify data before encryption. Compromise of the application server if the attacker gains control of the AcraConnector host.

**Affected Component:** AcraConnector (data interception and processing module, network communication)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Regularly update AcraConnector to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Secure the host machine where AcraConnector is running, following security best practices.
*   Implement network segmentation to isolate the application server and AcraConnector.
*   Use secure communication channels (e.g., TLS) between the application and AcraConnector.
*   Monitor AcraConnector logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Key Exposure through Storage Compromise](./threats/key_exposure_through_storage_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the storage location of Acra's encryption keys, whether it's the file system, a dedicated key management system, or a hardware security module (HSM). They can then extract the keys and use them to decrypt the protected data.

**Impact:** Complete exposure of all encrypted data. The attacker can decrypt and read any information protected by the compromised keys.

**Affected Component:** Acra Key Management (key storage mechanism, access control)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Store encryption keys securely, using strong access controls and encryption at rest for the key storage itself.
*   Consider using hardware security modules (HSMs) for enhanced key protection.
*   Implement strict access control policies for key storage locations.
*   Regularly audit access to key storage.
*   Implement key rotation policies to limit the impact of a potential key compromise.

## Threat: [Improper Use of Acra Libraries in Application Code](./threats/improper_use_of_acra_libraries_in_application_code.md)

**Description:** Developers integrate Acra libraries into the application code incorrectly, such as failing to encrypt sensitive data before sending it to the database, or storing decrypted data insecurely after retrieval.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data due to improper handling. The security provided by Acra can be bypassed if not used correctly.

**Affected Component:** Acra Client Libraries (encryption/decryption functions), Application Code

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Provide thorough training to developers on the correct usage of Acra libraries.
*   Implement code reviews to identify and correct improper Acra integration.
*   Establish clear guidelines and best practices for handling sensitive data within the application.
*   Utilize static analysis tools to detect potential misuse of Acra libraries.
