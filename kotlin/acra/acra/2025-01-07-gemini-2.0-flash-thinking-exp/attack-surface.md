# Attack Surface Analysis for acra/acra

## Attack Surface: [Master Key Compromise](./attack_surfaces/master_key_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** The master keys used by Acra to encrypt and decrypt data are exposed or stolen.
    *   **How Acra Contributes:** Acra's core security relies on the confidentiality and integrity of these master keys. If compromised, the entire security scheme is broken. Acra's key generation, storage, and access control mechanisms are the primary factors here.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the server where AcraServer stores its master keys due to weak access controls or a vulnerability in the server's operating system. They then retrieve the master key file.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of all data protected by Acra. Attackers can decrypt all stored and transmitted sensitive information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) or secure key vaults with strong access controls to store master keys.
        *   Restrict access to master keys to only the necessary processes and personnel (Principle of Least Privilege).
        *   Implement a robust key rotation policy to limit the impact of a potential key compromise.
        *   Ensure Acra uses cryptographically secure random number generators for key generation.
        *   Conduct regular audits of key management practices and infrastructure.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) on Acra Communication Channels](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__on_acra_communication_channels.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between Acra components (e.g., application to AcraConnector, AcraConnector to AcraServer) and potentially decrypts or modifies the data.
    *   **How Acra Contributes:** Acra introduces communication channels that, if not properly secured, can become targets for MITM attacks. The security of these channels depends on the configuration and usage of TLS/mTLS.
    *   **Example:** An application communicates with AcraConnector over an unsecured network connection. An attacker intercepts this traffic and, lacking proper encryption, reads the sensitive data being sent for encryption or decryption.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data in transit. Potential for attackers to modify requests and responses, leading to data corruption or unauthorized actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Mandatory use of TLS (Transport Layer Security) or mutual TLS (mTLS) for all communication between Acra components and the application.
        *   Implement proper certificate management practices, including using trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) and regularly rotating certificates.
        *   Isolate Acra components within secure network segments to limit potential attack vectors.
        *   Implement network monitoring to detect suspicious activity and potential MITM attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Acra Components](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_acra_components.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws (bugs, design weaknesses) exist within the AcraServer, AcraConnector, or AcraTranslator code, allowing attackers to exploit them.
    *   **How Acra Contributes:** As a software suite, Acra itself is susceptible to vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are specific to Acra's codebase and functionality.
    *   **Example:** A remote code execution vulnerability is discovered in AcraServer. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain arbitrary code execution on the server hosting AcraServer.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the affected Acra component, potentially leading to data breaches, denial of service, or further exploitation of the application and its infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Acra components to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of Acra deployments to identify potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Ensure the Acra development team follows secure coding practices to minimize the introduction of new vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement automated vulnerability scanning tools to proactively identify potential weaknesses in Acra components.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfiguration of Acra Components](./attack_surfaces/misconfiguration_of_acra_components.md)

*   **Description:** Acra components are configured in a way that weakens their security posture, making them susceptible to attacks.
    *   **How Acra Contributes:** Acra's security relies on proper configuration. Incorrect settings can negate the intended security benefits.
    *   **Example:** AcraServer is configured with weak or default passwords for internal authentication, allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access to its management interface.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of Acra components, potential data breaches, and circumvention of intended security measures.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Adhere to Acra's recommended security configuration guidelines and best practices.
        *   Configure Acra components with the minimum necessary permissions (Principle of Least Privilege).
        *   Use strong, unique passwords for all Acra component authentication and consider multi-factor authentication where applicable.
        *   Periodically review Acra configurations to ensure they align with security best practices and organizational policies.
        *   Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to manage Acra deployments, ensuring consistent and secure configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Acra relies on third-party libraries and components that contain known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Acra Contributes:** Acra's security is indirectly affected by the security of its dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited through Acra.
    *   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a widely used library that Acra depends on. An attacker exploits this vulnerability through Acra to compromise the system.
    *   **Impact:** Potential compromise of Acra components, leading to data breaches or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly scan Acra's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using software composition analysis (SCA) tools.
        *   Promptly update Acra's dependencies to patched versions that address known vulnerabilities.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases to stay informed about potential risks in Acra's dependencies.
        *   Evaluate and potentially replace vulnerable dependencies with more secure alternatives if feasible.
