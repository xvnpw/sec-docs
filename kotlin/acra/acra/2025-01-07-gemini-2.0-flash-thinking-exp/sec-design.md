## 1. Introduction

This document provides an enhanced design overview of the Acra Data Protection Suite, an open-source, multi-layered database security platform. Acra is designed to protect sensitive data at the application level and within the database infrastructure, focusing on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This document serves as a foundational resource for subsequent threat modeling exercises, detailing the core components, their interactions, data flows, and deployment considerations with a security-centric perspective.

## 2. Project Goals

The primary goals of the Acra project are to:

* **Provide robust data-at-rest and data-in-transit protection:** Employ encryption to secure sensitive data both when stored in databases and during transmission between applications and databases.
* **Offer versatile and granular encryption strategies:** Support a range of encryption methodologies, including symmetric and asymmetric encryption, allowing for tailored security measures based on specific data sensitivity and application requirements.
* **Implement dynamic data masking and redaction capabilities:** Enable real-time masking or redaction of sensitive data elements based on user roles, permissions, or predefined security policies, ensuring data privacy and compliance.
* **Streamline and secure cryptographic key lifecycle management:** Provide integrated mechanisms for the secure generation, storage, distribution, and rotation of encryption keys, minimizing the risk of key compromise.
* **Facilitate comprehensive audit logging and proactive intrusion detection:** Monitor database access patterns, identify anomalous activities, and generate detailed audit trails for security analysis and compliance reporting.
* **Ensure seamless integration with existing application and database ecosystems:** Minimize integration friction by offering flexible deployment options and compatibility with common database systems and application frameworks.

## 3. System Architecture

Acra's architecture is modular, comprising several interacting components that collaboratively enforce data protection policies. The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture and key interactions:

## 5. Deployment Scenarios

Acra offers flexible deployment options to suit various architectural patterns and infrastructure requirements. Common deployment scenarios include:

* **Network Proxy Deployment (Acra Server):** Acra Server is deployed as a network proxy intercepting all communication between applications and databases. This is a common approach for centralized security enforcement.
    * **Characteristics:** Centralized encryption and decryption, easier integration with existing applications without code changes, potential single point of failure if not properly configured for high availability.
* **Direct Integration with Acra Translator:** Acra Translator is integrated directly into the application code as a library. This enables client-side encryption and decryption, reducing the load on Acra Server and providing end-to-end encryption.
    * **Characteristics:** Distributed encryption and decryption, improved performance for high-throughput applications, requires application code changes for integration.
* **Sidecar Container Deployment (Kubernetes/Containers):** Acra Server is deployed as a sidecar container alongside the application container within a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes. This provides isolation and simplifies management in containerized environments.
    * **Characteristics:**  Isolated security context, simplified deployment and management in containerized environments, leverages container orchestration features for scalability and resilience.
* **Hybrid Deployment:** A combination of network proxy and direct integration, where some applications utilize Acra Server as a proxy while others integrate Acra Translator directly. This allows for a tailored approach based on specific application needs and security requirements.
    * **Characteristics:**  Flexibility in choosing the optimal deployment model for different applications, potentially more complex to manage.

## 6. Security Considerations

Security is paramount in Acra's design. Key security considerations include:

* **Robust Key Management:** Acra Keeper is the cornerstone of security, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of encryption keys. Secure storage, access control, and key rotation are critical aspects.
* **Mutual Authentication:** Secure and authenticated communication between Acra components (Server, Translator, Keeper) is essential to prevent unauthorized access and man-in-the-middle attacks. TLS with mutual authentication can be employed.
* **Least Privilege Principle:**  Components should operate with the minimum necessary permissions. For example, Acra Server should only have the permissions required to encrypt and decrypt data, not to modify database schemas.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Acra Censor plays a crucial role in preventing SQL injection attacks by validating and sanitizing incoming SQL queries.
* **Audit Logging and Monitoring:** Comprehensive audit logs provide visibility into data access patterns and security events, enabling detection of suspicious activity and facilitating security investigations.
* **Secure Configuration Management:**  Configuration files and settings for Acra components must be securely stored and managed to prevent unauthorized modification.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Periodic security assessments are necessary to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the Acra implementation.
* **Protection Against Side-Channel Attacks:**  Consideration should be given to potential side-channel attacks, such as timing attacks, and mitigation strategies implemented where necessary.

## 7. Technology Stack

* **Primary Programming Language:** Go (for core components like Acra Server, Keeper, and Censor).
* **Programming Language (Acra Translator):** Go (with potential for other language bindings in the future).
* **Supported Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, and potentially others.
* **Cryptography Libraries:** Standard Go cryptography libraries (e.g., `crypto/tls`, `crypto/aes`).
* **Communication Protocols:** gRPC (for internal communication between components), potentially HTTPS for external access.
* **Configuration Management:** YAML files, environment variables.
* **Logging Framework:** Standard logging libraries, potentially integrated with centralized logging systems.
* **Key Storage:**  Filesystem (for development/testing), potentially integration with secure key stores, HSMs, or cloud KMS for production.

## 8. Future Considerations

* **Enhanced Integration with Cloud-Native Technologies:** Deeper integration with cloud platforms and services, such as managed Kubernetes offerings and serverless functions.
* **Advanced Threat Detection and Response Capabilities:**  Expanding Acra Censor's capabilities to detect and respond to more sophisticated database attacks.
* **Support for Homomorphic Encryption or Secure Enclaves:** Exploring the integration of advanced cryptographic techniques to enable computation on encrypted data.
* **Improved Key Management Automation:**  Developing more sophisticated tools and workflows for automated key rotation and lifecycle management.
* **Granular Data Access Control Policies:**  Implementing more fine-grained control over data access based on user attributes, data sensitivity, and context.
* **Simplified Deployment and Management Tools:**  Creating user-friendly interfaces and tools for easier deployment, configuration, and monitoring of Acra.
