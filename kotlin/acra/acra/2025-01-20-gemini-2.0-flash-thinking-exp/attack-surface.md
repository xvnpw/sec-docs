# Attack Surface Analysis for acra/acra

## Attack Surface: [Network Exposure of Acra Server](./attack_surfaces/network_exposure_of_acra_server.md)

*   **Description:** The Acra Server listens on a network port for connections from applications requiring data encryption or decryption. If this port is exposed to untrusted networks, it becomes a potential entry point for attackers.
    *   **How Acra Contributes:** Acra introduces a new network service that needs to be secured. This service handles sensitive cryptographic operations and key material.
    *   **Example:** An attacker scans open ports and finds the Acra Server port exposed. They attempt to connect and exploit potential vulnerabilities in the Acra Server's network handling or authentication mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to decryption capabilities, potential compromise of encryption keys, denial of service against the Acra Server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the Acra Server is only accessible from trusted networks (e.g., using firewalls, network segmentation).
        *   Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for secure communication between applications and the Acra Server.
        *   Use strong authentication mechanisms for applications connecting to the Acra Server.
        *   Regularly review and update firewall rules to restrict access.

## Attack Surface: [Compromise of Acra Server Authentication Credentials](./attack_surfaces/compromise_of_acra_server_authentication_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Applications authenticate with the Acra Server to request encryption or decryption services. If these authentication credentials (e.g., API keys, tokens) are compromised, attackers can impersonate legitimate applications.
    *   **How Acra Contributes:** Acra introduces a new authentication layer between applications and the database, requiring secure management of these credentials.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to an application's configuration file containing the Acra Server authentication credentials. They can then use these credentials to decrypt data they shouldn't have access to.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized decryption of sensitive data, potential data breaches, ability to manipulate encrypted data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store Acra Server authentication credentials securely (e.g., using secrets management tools, environment variables, not directly in code).
        *   Implement strong access controls for accessing and managing these credentials.
        *   Regularly rotate authentication credentials.
        *   Monitor access to Acra Server and alert on suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Acra Server Code](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_acra_server_code.md)

    *   **How Acra Contributes:** Acra introduces a new software component into the infrastructure, which becomes a potential target for exploitation.
    *   **Example:** A zero-day vulnerability is discovered in the Acra Server's request handling logic. An attacker sends a specially crafted request that allows them to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Acra Server, including access to encryption keys and the ability to decrypt all protected data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Acra Server updated to the latest version with security patches.
        *   Implement a robust vulnerability management program.
        *   Consider using static and dynamic code analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow secure coding practices during any custom development or extensions.

## Attack Surface: [Compromise of Acra Master Keys](./attack_surfaces/compromise_of_acra_master_keys.md)

*   **Description:** The Acra Server relies on master keys for encrypting and decrypting data encryption keys. If these master keys are compromised, the entire data protection scheme is broken.
    *   **How Acra Contributes:** Acra introduces the concept of master keys, which become a high-value target for attackers.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the server where Acra's master keys are stored (e.g., due to weak file permissions or a server compromise).
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of all data protected by Acra, allowing attackers to decrypt all sensitive information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store master keys securely using a dedicated Key Management System (KMS) or hardware security module (HSM).
        *   Implement strict access controls for accessing and managing master keys.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access to key material.
        *   Regularly rotate master keys according to security best practices.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration of Acra Components](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_of_acra_components.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfigurations in Acra Server, Translator, or WebConfig can weaken security and create exploitable vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Acra Contributes:** Acra introduces configuration options that, if not set correctly, can lead to security weaknesses.
    *   **Example:** The Acra Server is configured to use a weak encryption algorithm or has insecure default settings enabled.
    *   **Impact:** Reduced effectiveness of encryption, potential for data breaches, unauthorized access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow Acra's security best practices and hardening guides during installation and configuration.
        *   Regularly review Acra's configuration settings to ensure they align with security policies.
        *   Use secure defaults and avoid insecure configurations.
        *   Implement configuration management tools to enforce consistent and secure configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Network Exposure of Acra Translator](./attack_surfaces/network_exposure_of_acra_translator.md)

*   **Description:** The Acra Translator sits between the application and the database, intercepting and potentially modifying database queries. If its port is exposed, attackers could try to bypass Acra Server or manipulate database traffic.
    *   **How Acra Contributes:** Acra introduces another network component that needs to be secured, potentially adding complexity to network security.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Acra Translator port and attempts to send malicious SQL queries directly to the database, bypassing Acra Server's encryption.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for SQL injection attacks bypassing Acra's protection, unauthorized access to the database, data manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the Acra Translator is only accessible from trusted networks (typically the application server).
        *   Implement network segmentation to isolate the Translator.
        *   Use strong authentication and authorization for connections to the Translator.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Acra Translator Code](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_acra_translator_code.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to the Acra Server, the Acra Translator code may contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
    *   **How Acra Contributes:** Acra introduces another software component that becomes a potential target for exploitation.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in the Acra Translator's query parsing logic allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL commands.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for SQL injection attacks, unauthorized access to the database, compromise of the Translator itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Acra Translator updated to the latest version with security patches.
        *   Implement a robust vulnerability management program.
