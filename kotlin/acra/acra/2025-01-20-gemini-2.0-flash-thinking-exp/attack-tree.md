## Attack Tree Path: [Decrypt Acra-Protected Data [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/decrypt_acra-protected_data__high_risk_path_.md)

This represents the core goal of an attacker targeting data protected by Acra. Any successful path within this branch directly leads to the compromise of sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit AcraServer Vulnerabilities ***[CRITICAL NODE]*** [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_acraserver_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Known CVEs in AcraServer [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers leverage publicly known vulnerabilities in AcraServer for which exploits may be readily available. This can allow them to bypass authentication, execute arbitrary code, or directly access decrypted data.
* **Exploit Insecure AcraServer Configuration [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * **Weak Authentication/Authorization to AcraServer [HIGH RISK PATH]:**  If AcraServer's access controls are weak, attackers can gain unauthorized access to its functionalities, potentially leading to decryption or manipulation of data.
    * **Insecure TLS Configuration for AcraServer Communication [HIGH RISK PATH]:**  Weak or improperly configured TLS can allow attackers to perform Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, intercepting and potentially modifying communication between the application and AcraServer.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Acra Master Key ***[CRITICAL NODE]*** [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_acra_master_key__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Key Storage Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * **Weak File System Permissions on Key Storage [HIGH RISK PATH]:** If the master key is stored with insufficient file system permissions, an attacker who gains access to the server can read the key file.
    * **Unencrypted Key Storage [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Storing the master key without encryption at rest makes it vulnerable if an attacker gains access to the storage medium.
* **Social Engineering/Phishing for Key Access [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers can use social engineering tactics or phishing campaigns to trick individuals with access to the master key into revealing it.
* **Insider Threat - Malicious Key Access [HIGH RISK PATH]:**  A malicious insider with legitimate access to the master key can intentionally compromise it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit AcraConnector Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_acraconnector_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Known CVEs in AcraConnector [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Similar to AcraServer, attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in AcraConnector to intercept, modify, or inject malicious data into the communication stream.
* **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on AcraConnector Communication [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * **Intercept and Modify Communication to Inject Malicious Data [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers intercept communication between the application and AcraConnector to alter data being encrypted or decrypted.
* **Steal Authentication Credentials for AcraConnector [HIGH RISK PATH]:** If the credentials used by the application to authenticate to AcraConnector are compromised, attackers can impersonate the application and send malicious requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Acra Protection Entirely ***[CRITICAL NODE]*** [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_acra_protection_entirely__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Application Logic Before Acra Encryption [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * **SQL Injection before Data Encryption ***[CRITICAL NODE]*** [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into the application's queries before the data is encrypted by Acra, allowing them to directly access or manipulate the database.
* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Application Logic After Acra Decryption [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * **SQL Injection after Data Decryption ***[CRITICAL NODE]*** [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into the application's queries after the data has been decrypted by Acra, allowing them to directly access or manipulate the database with decrypted data.
* **Compromise Application Server to Access Decrypted Data in Memory [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * **Exploit Web Application Vulnerabilities (e.g., RCE) [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the web application to gain remote code execution on the server. This allows them to access memory where decrypted data might be present.
