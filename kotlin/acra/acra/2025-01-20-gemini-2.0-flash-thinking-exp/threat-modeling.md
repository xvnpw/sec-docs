# Threat Model Analysis for acra/acra

## Threat: [AcraMasterKey Compromise](./threats/acramasterkey_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the AcraMasterKey through methods like exploiting vulnerabilities in key storage, social engineering, or insider threats. They can then use this key to decrypt all data protected by Acra.
*   **Impact:** Complete data breach, exposure of all sensitive information protected by Acra, potential for data manipulation and misuse.
*   **Affected Component:** AcraServer's core encryption/decryption module, specifically the functions handling AcraMasterKey usage.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust key management practices.
    *   Store the AcraMasterKey in a Hardware Security Module (HSM).
    *   Enforce strict access control to the key storage.
    *   Implement key rotation procedures.
    *   Regularly audit key management processes.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to AcraServer API](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_acraserver_api.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits weak authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain access to AcraServer's API endpoints. This allows them to perform actions like requesting decryption of data they shouldn't have access to, or potentially manipulating AcraServer's configuration.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data decryption, potential for data exfiltration, disruption of Acra's functionality, manipulation of security settings.
*   **Affected Component:** AcraServer's API endpoints and authentication/authorization modules.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., mutual TLS, API keys with proper rotation).
    *   Enforce strict authorization policies based on the principle of least privilege.
    *   Regularly audit API access logs.
    *   Secure network communication channels (TLS).

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in AcraServer's Cryptographic Implementations](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_acraserver's_cryptographic_implementations.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a flaw in AcraServer's implementation of cryptographic algorithms, potentially allowing them to bypass encryption or decrypt data without the correct keys.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, exposure of sensitive information, undermining the security provided by Acra.
*   **Affected Component:** AcraServer's cryptographic modules and libraries.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep AcraServer updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Follow secure coding practices during Acra's development.
    *   Consider third-party security audits of Acra's codebase.
    *   Utilize well-vetted and standard cryptographic libraries.

## Threat: [Zone Key Compromise](./threats/zone_key_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a specific Zone key used by AcraTranslator. This allows them to decrypt data associated with that particular Zone.
*   **Impact:** Breach of data associated with the compromised Zone, potential for unauthorized access and manipulation of that data.
*   **Affected Component:** AcraTranslator's key management module and decryption functions specific to Zones.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure storage of Zone keys.
    *   Implement strict access control to Zone keys.
    *   Consider rotating Zone keys periodically.
    *   Utilize separate key storage mechanisms for different Zones based on sensitivity.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to AcraTranslator](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_acratranslator.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the AcraTranslator instance, potentially allowing them to intercept and decrypt data flowing through it or manipulate its configuration.
*   **Impact:** Data interception and decryption, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks, disruption of data flow, manipulation of decryption processes.
*   **Affected Component:** AcraTranslator's network listener and authentication/authorization modules.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms for accessing AcraTranslator.
    *   Secure network communication channels between the application and AcraTranslator (TLS).
    *   Enforce network segmentation to restrict access to AcraTranslator.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in AcraTranslator's Decryption Logic](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_acratranslator's_decryption_logic.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a flaw in AcraTranslator's decryption process, potentially leading to incorrect decryption, data corruption, or even the ability to bypass encryption under certain conditions.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, failure to decrypt data correctly, potential for data exposure if decryption is bypassed.
*   **Affected Component:** AcraTranslator's decryption modules and functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep AcraTranslator updated to the latest version.
    *   Thoroughly test decryption processes after any updates or configuration changes.
    *   Follow secure coding practices during Acra's development.

## Threat: [Bypassing AcraCensor's Security Policies](./threats/bypassing_acracensor's_security_policies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL queries or other data access requests that manage to circumvent AcraCensor's defined security policies, allowing them to perform unauthorized actions on the underlying database.
*   **Impact:** SQL injection attacks, unauthorized data access, data manipulation, potential for privilege escalation within the database.
*   **Affected Component:** AcraCensor's SQL parsing and policy enforcement engine.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly define and test AcraCensor policies.
    *   Regularly review and update AcraCensor policies to cover new attack vectors.
    *   Combine AcraCensor with other security measures like parameterized queries in the application code.
    *   Monitor AcraCensor logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in AcraCensor's SQL Parsing Logic](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_acracensor's_sql_parsing_logic.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits flaws in AcraCensor's ability to correctly parse and understand SQL queries, allowing them to inject malicious code that AcraCensor fails to detect.
*   **Impact:**  Bypassing security policies, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities and unauthorized database access.
*   **Affected Component:** AcraCensor's SQL parser.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep AcraCensor updated to the latest version.
    *   Contribute to or review AcraCensor's parsing rules and logic.
    *   Report any identified parsing vulnerabilities to the Acra development team.
