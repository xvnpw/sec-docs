# BUSINESS POSTURE

Acra is a database security suite designed to protect sensitive data and ensure data privacy. It aims to address the growing need for robust database security in the face of increasing cyber threats and stringent data protection regulations.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Protect sensitive data stored in databases from unauthorized access and breaches.
- Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, and others.
- Provide a comprehensive and easy-to-integrate security solution for databases.
- Minimize the impact of data breaches by employing encryption and data masking techniques.
- Offer tools for monitoring and detecting security incidents related to database access.

Most Important Business Risks:
- Data Breaches: Unauthorized access and exfiltration of sensitive data from databases, leading to financial losses, reputational damage, and regulatory fines.
- Compliance Violations: Failure to meet data privacy regulations, resulting in legal penalties and loss of customer trust.
- Operational Disruption: Security incidents or misconfigurations that disrupt database availability and business operations.
- Integration Complexity: Difficulties in integrating Acra with existing database infrastructure and applications, leading to delays and increased costs.
- Performance Overhead: Introduction of latency and performance degradation due to encryption and security processing.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Encryption of data at rest and in transit using strong cryptographic algorithms. Implemented within Acra Server, Translator, and Connector components. Described in documentation and code.
- security control: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for managing access to Acra components and functionalities. Implemented within Acra Server and Web UI. Described in documentation.
- security control: Audit logging of security-related events and actions. Implemented within Acra Server and other components. Described in documentation.
- security control: Data masking and tokenization capabilities to protect sensitive data in non-production environments. Implemented within Acra Translator. Described in documentation.
- security control: Intrusion detection system (AcraCensor) to monitor and block suspicious database queries. Implemented as a separate component. Described in documentation.
- security control: Secure software development lifecycle practices are likely followed, given the project's focus on security, although specific details are not explicitly provided in the repository. Assumed based on project nature.
- security control: Dependency management using tools like Go modules to manage and track project dependencies. Evident from `go.mod` and `go.sum` files in the repository.

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Complexity of deployment and configuration in diverse environments. Mitigation is provided through documentation and examples, but some complexity remains.
- accepted risk: Performance impact of encryption and security processing. Mitigation is provided through performance optimization and configurable security levels, but some overhead is inherent.
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies. Mitigation is through dependency scanning and updates, but zero-day vulnerabilities remain a risk.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities early in the development process.
- security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits by external security experts to identify and address security weaknesses.
- security control: Implement a vulnerability management process to track, prioritize, and remediate identified vulnerabilities in Acra and its dependencies.
- security control: Enhance incident response plan specifically for Acra deployments, including procedures for handling security alerts and data breaches.
- security control: Provide security training for developers and operators on secure coding practices and secure configuration of Acra.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - requirement: Acra components must authenticate clients and users securely.
    - requirement: Support for strong authentication mechanisms such as API keys, TLS client certificates, and potentially integration with external identity providers.
    - requirement: Secure storage and management of authentication credentials.
- Authorization:
    - requirement: Implement fine-grained authorization controls to restrict access to Acra functionalities and data based on roles and permissions.
    - requirement: Principle of least privilege should be enforced throughout the system.
    - requirement: Authorization decisions should be consistently applied across all components.
- Input Validation:
    - requirement: All inputs to Acra components, including API requests, configuration parameters, and database queries, must be thoroughly validated to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
    - requirement: Use of parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
    - requirement: Input validation should be performed at multiple layers of the system.
- Cryptography:
    - requirement: Use strong and industry-standard cryptographic algorithms for encryption, hashing, and digital signatures.
    - requirement: Secure key management practices, including secure key generation, storage, rotation, and destruction.
    - requirement: Proper handling of cryptographic keys and secrets to prevent leakage or compromise.

        [CodeRepository]
    end
    subgraph "CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)"
        [SourceCodeCheckout]
        [BuildProcess]
        [SecurityScanners]

    SecurityScanners -->> ArtifactRepository : Publish Build Artifacts (Containers, Binaries)

    style CICDPipelineGitHubActions fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer commits code changes to the Code Repository (e.g., GitHub).
2. Code commit triggers the CI/CD pipeline, which is assumed to be GitHub Actions based on common practices for GitHub repositories.
3. Source Code Checkout step retrieves the latest code from the repository.
4. Build Process step compiles the code, builds binaries, and creates container images. This step should include:
    - Dependency resolution and management (using Go modules).
    - Compilation of Go code.
    - Container image building using Dockerfiles.
5. Security Scanners step performs automated security checks:
    - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools to scan source code for vulnerabilities.
    - Linters to enforce code quality and security best practices.
    - Dependency vulnerability scanning to identify vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
6. Artifact Repository step publishes the build artifacts:
    - Container images are pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, private registry).
    - Binaries and other artifacts are stored in an artifact repository.

Security Controls in Build Process:
- security control: Secure Code Repository (e.g., GitHub) with access controls and audit logging.
