# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for acra/acra

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Deployment Environment for AcraServer](./mitigation_strategies/secure_deployment_environment_for_acraserver.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Minimal Operating System for AcraServer Host:** Select a minimal OS distribution (e.g., Alpine Linux, CoreOS) specifically for the AcraServer host to reduce the attack surface relevant to AcraServer's operation.
    2.  **Disable Unnecessary Services on AcraServer Host:** Disable or remove any services not strictly required for AcraServer's operation on the host OS, minimizing potential vulnerabilities exploitable to reach AcraServer.
    3.  **Apply OS-Level Hardening to AcraServer Host:** Implement operating system-level hardening measures on the AcraServer host, specifically focusing on securing the environment where AcraServer operates. This includes firewalling and security modules.
    4.  **Network Segmentation for AcraServer:** Deploy AcraServer within a dedicated, isolated network segment to limit the blast radius if other systems are compromised and to control network access to AcraServer itself.
    5.  **Restrict Network Access to AcraServer:** Configure network firewalls to strictly control inbound and outbound network traffic to and from AcraServer, allowing only necessary connections from authorized AcraConnectors and monitoring systems.
    6.  **Containerization or Virtualization for AcraServer:** Deploy AcraServer within a container or VM to isolate it and its dependencies, adding a layer of security specific to the AcraServer instance.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Operating System Vulnerabilities Exploited to Reach AcraServer (High Severity):** Exploitation of OS vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access *specifically to AcraServer* and its sensitive components (keys, data).
    *   **Lateral Movement to AcraServer (Medium Severity):** Hardening AcraServer's environment makes lateral movement *to AcraServer* more difficult after compromising other systems.
    *   **Exploitation of Unnecessary Services on AcraServer Host (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from using vulnerabilities in unrelated services on the host to compromise *AcraServer*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Operating System Vulnerabilities Exploited to Reach AcraServer: Significantly reduces the risk of direct compromise of AcraServer via OS vulnerabilities.
    *   Lateral Movement to AcraServer: Moderately reduces the risk of attackers reaching AcraServer after initial compromise elsewhere.
    *   Exploitation of Unnecessary Services on AcraServer Host: Significantly reduces the attack surface directly related to the AcraServer host.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. AcraServer is in a Docker container and dedicated network segment. Basic firewall rules are in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:** OS-level hardening *within the AcraServer container image* and more granular firewall rules for AcraServer are needed. SELinux/AppArmor enforcement for the container is missing.
