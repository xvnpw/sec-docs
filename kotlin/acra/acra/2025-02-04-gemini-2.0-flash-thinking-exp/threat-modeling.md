# Threat Model Analysis for acra/acra

## Threat: [Acra Server Key Compromise](./threats/acra_server_key_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Acra Server's master key or zone keys. This could be achieved through exploiting vulnerabilities in key storage, insecure key management practices, insider threats, or attacks on the Acra Server infrastructure. Once compromised, the attacker can decrypt all data protected by these keys, including historical data if keys are not properly rotated and old keys are still accessible.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Complete loss of confidentiality for all data protected by the compromised keys.  Data can be decrypted, modified, or exfiltrated without authorization.  Reputational damage, legal and regulatory repercussions due to data breach.
*   **Affected Acra Component:** Acra Server (Key Storage, Key Management Module)
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Key Storage:** Utilize secure key storage solutions like Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) or Key Management Systems (KMS) as recommended by Acra.
    *   **Access Control:** Implement strict access control policies for key storage and Acra Server infrastructure, limiting access to only authorized personnel and systems.
    *   **Key Rotation:** Implement regular key rotation as per Acra's recommendations to minimize the impact of a potential key compromise.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the key management infrastructure and Acra Server to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
