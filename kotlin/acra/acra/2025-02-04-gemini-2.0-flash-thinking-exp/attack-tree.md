```

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Protected Data [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/access_protected_data__critical_node_.md)

This is the root goal and therefore inherently critical. Success means complete compromise of data protection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Acra Protection [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_acra_protection__critical_node_.md)

Bypassing Acra directly negates its purpose. Any successful path under this node is considered high-risk as it circumvents the intended security mechanism.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Acra Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_acra_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**Reasoning:**  Directly targeting vulnerabilities within Acra components is a high-risk path because it aims to undermine the security at its core.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **Injection Flaws (e.g., Command Injection, Path Traversal) in Acra Components [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: High
        *   Effort: Medium
        *   Skill Level: Medium
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
        *   **Breakdown:** Injection flaws are common web application vulnerabilities and can potentially exist in Acra components if not carefully developed. Successful exploitation can lead to system compromise and data access.
    *   **Configuration Vulnerabilities in Acra Deployment [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Weak or Default Configuration of AcraServer/Translator/Censor [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   Likelihood: Medium-High

            *   Effort: Low
            *   Skill Level: Low-Medium
            *   Detection Difficulty: Low-Medium
            *   **Breakdown:**  Using default or weak configurations is a common mistake. It can weaken security significantly and make other attacks easier.
        *   **Insecure Network Configuration exposing Acra Components [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: Medium (Escalates to High when combined with other weaknesses)
            *   Effort: Low
            *   Skill Level: Low-Medium
            *   Detection Difficulty: Low
            *   **Breakdown:** Exposing Acra components to unnecessary networks or using insecure network protocols increases the attack surface and risk of compromise.
        *   **Misconfigured Access Control Policies in AcraCensor [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: Medium-High
            *   Effort: Medium
            *   Skill Level: Medium
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
            *   **Breakdown:**  Incorrectly configured access control policies in AcraCensor can allow unauthorized access to protected data or bypass intended security restrictions.
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities in Acra Components [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Outdated or Vulnerable Libraries used by AcraServer/Translator/Censor [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Low-Medium
            *   Skill Level: Medium
            *   Detection Difficulty: Low-Medium
            *   **Breakdown:**  Using outdated or vulnerable dependencies is a common security risk. Exploiting known vulnerabilities in these libraries can lead to code execution and data compromise within Acra components.
        *   **Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (e.g., via CVEs) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Low-Medium
            *   Skill Level: Medium
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
            *   **Breakdown:**  If vulnerable dependencies are identified, publicly available exploits (CVEs) can often be used to compromise the system with relatively low effort.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Acra Infrastructure [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_acra_infrastructure__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

**Reasoning:**  Compromising the infrastructure hosting Acra components is a direct and effective way to bypass Acra's protection. If the attacker controls the infrastructure, they can potentially access decrypted data and keys.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **Compromise AcraServer Host [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Exploit OS Vulnerabilities on AcraServer Host [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Medium
            *   Skill Level: Medium-High
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
            *   **Breakdown:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system of the AcraServer host can grant the attacker full control of the server, including access to decrypted data and encryption keys residing in memory or on disk.
        *   **Weak Access Controls to AcraServer Host (e.g., SSH, RDP) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   Likelihood: Medium-High
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Low-Medium
            *   Skill Level: Low-Medium
            *   Detection Difficulty: Low-Medium
            *   **Breakdown:** Weak passwords, exposed management interfaces (SSH, RDP), or misconfigured firewalls can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the AcraServer host.
        *   **Social Engineering to gain access to AcraServer Host credentials [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Low-Medium
            *   Skill Level: Low-Medium
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
            *   **Breakdown:** Social engineering tactics, such as phishing or pretexting, can be used to trick authorized personnel into revealing credentials for the AcraServer host.
    *   **Compromise AcraTranslator Host (if deployed separately) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Exploit OS Vulnerabilities on AcraTranslator Host [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** (Similar estimations to AcraServer Host)
        *   **Weak Access Controls to AcraTranslator Host [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** (Similar estimations to AcraServer Host)
        *   **Breakdown:**  Compromising the AcraTranslator host, while potentially slightly less critical than AcraServer, can still provide access to encrypted data in transit and potentially facilitate further attacks.
    *   **Compromise AcraCensor Host (if deployed separately) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Exploit OS Vulnerabilities on AcraCensor Host [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** (Similar estimations to AcraServer Host, but impact might be lower)
        *   **Weak Access Controls to AcraCensor Host [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** (Similar estimations to AcraServer Host, but impact might be lower)
        *   **Breakdown:** Compromising the AcraCensor host can allow attackers to bypass access control policies and potentially manipulate or access protected data, although the direct impact might be lower if it doesn't handle decryption directly.
    *   **Compromise Key Management System (KMS) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in KMS Software/Hardware [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   Likelihood: Low-Medium
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Medium-High
            *   Skill Level: High
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium-High
            *   **Breakdown:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the KMS software or hardware is a direct path to obtaining decryption keys, leading to a complete bypass of Acra's protection.
        *   **Weak Access Controls to KMS [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Low-Medium
            *   Skill Level: Medium
            *   Detection Difficulty: Low-Medium
            *   **Breakdown:**  Weak access controls to the KMS, such as default passwords or misconfigured permissions, can allow unauthorized access and key extraction.
        *   **Insecure Key Storage in KMS [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   Likelihood: Low-Medium
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Medium
            *   Skill Level: Medium-High
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium-High
            *   **Breakdown:**  If the KMS itself stores keys insecurely (e.g., unencrypted at rest), attackers gaining access to the KMS storage can directly steal the keys.
        *   **Insider Threat at KMS Level [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   Likelihood: Low-Medium
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Low (Legitimate access abuse)
            *   Skill Level: Low-Medium
            *   Detection Difficulty: High
            *   **Breakdown:**  Malicious insiders with legitimate access to the KMS pose a significant threat, as they can easily extract keys without needing to exploit external vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Obtain Decryption Keys [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/obtain_decryption_keys__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

**Reasoning:** Obtaining the decryption keys is the most direct and devastating attack. If the attacker has the keys, Acra's protection is completely bypassed.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **Steal Keys from Key Storage [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **File System Access to Key Storage [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Weak File Permissions on Key Storage Directory [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   Likelihood: Medium
                *   Impact: High
                *   Effort: Low
                *   Skill Level: Low
                *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
                *   **Breakdown:**  If keys are stored on the file system with weak permissions, attackers gaining basic system access can easily read and steal the key files.
        *   **Memory Dump of AcraServer/Translator/Application [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Exploiting Memory Dump Vulnerabilities (e.g., Core Dumps) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   Likelihood: Low-Medium
                *   Impact: High
                *   Effort: Medium
                *   Skill Level: Medium
                *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
                *   **Breakdown:**  Keys might be present in memory during runtime. If attackers can trigger or obtain memory dumps (e.g., core dumps), they might be able to extract keys from the memory image.
    *   **Network Interception of Key Exchange (Less likely with proper TLS) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack during Key Exchange (if insecure TLS or no TLS) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   Likelihood: Low-Medium (If TLS is weak or missing)
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Medium
            *   Skill Level: Medium
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
            *   **Breakdown:**  If TLS is not properly implemented or uses weak configurations during key exchange, attackers can perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks to intercept and steal the keys during transmission.
