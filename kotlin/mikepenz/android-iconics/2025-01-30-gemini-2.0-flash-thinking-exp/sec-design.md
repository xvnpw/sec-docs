# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - The primary goal of the android-iconics project is to provide Android developers with a convenient and efficient way to integrate icon fonts into their applications.
  - This aims to improve the visual appeal and user experience of Android applications by simplifying the use of vector icons.
  - The project prioritizes ease of use, flexibility in icon font selection, and seamless integration into the Android development workflow.

- Business Risks:
  - Supply Chain Risks: As a library consumed by other projects, any compromise in the android-iconics library could propagate to dependent applications, posing a supply chain risk. This includes risks related to compromised dependencies or malicious code injection into the library itself.
  - Availability Risks: If the library becomes unavailable or unusable due to unforeseen issues (e.g., repository compromise, critical bugs), developers relying on it may face disruptions in their development process and application updates.
  - Reputational Risk: Security vulnerabilities or malicious code found in the library could damage the reputation of the project and potentially impact the trust of developers using it.
  - Maintainability Risk: Lack of active maintenance and updates could lead to the library becoming outdated, incompatible with newer Android versions, or vulnerable to newly discovered security threats.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Code Review - The project is hosted on GitHub and is open source, allowing for community review of the code. This can help identify potential security vulnerabilities and improve code quality. Implemented: GitHub Repository.
  - security control: Version Control - The project uses Git for version control, providing traceability of changes and the ability to revert to previous versions if necessary. Implemented: GitHub Repository.
  - security control: Dependency Management - The project uses Gradle for dependency management, allowing for controlled inclusion of external libraries. Implemented: build.gradle files.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on Third-Party Icon Fonts - The library depends on external icon font files, which are not directly controlled by the project. The security and licensing of these external fonts are implicitly accepted risks.
  - accepted risk: Open Source Vulnerabilities - As an open-source project, vulnerabilities might be discovered and publicly disclosed before a fix is available. The risk of exploitation during this window is implicitly accepted.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Dependency Scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies.
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the build process to automatically scan the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Generation - Generate SBOM for each release to provide transparency into the components included in the library, aiding in vulnerability management for consumers.
  - security control: Code Signing - Sign the released artifacts (e.g., AAR files) to ensure integrity and authenticity, allowing consumers to verify that the library has not been tampered with.
  - security control: Regular Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits of the codebase and build process to proactively identify and address potential security weaknesses.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable - The library itself does not handle user authentication as it is a client-side library.
  - Authorization: Not applicable - The library does not enforce authorization as it operates within the context of the application using it.
  - Input Validation:
    - The library should validate any input it receives, such as icon names or font paths, to prevent unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities.
    - Input validation should be implemented to ensure that only expected and safe values are processed.
    - Validation should occur at the point of input to prevent issues from propagating through the library.
  - Cryptography: Not applicable - The library is not expected to perform cryptographic operations. If cryptography were to be introduced, it would require careful design and implementation to ensure security.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Distribution of the android-iconics library to Android developers is the most critical business process. Ensuring the library is available, functional, and secure is paramount for its continued adoption and use.
  - Maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the library is also critical, as compromised library versions could negatively impact applications that depend on it.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Library Source Code: Sensitivity - Publicly available, but integrity and confidentiality during development are important to prevent unauthorized modifications before release.
  - Build Artifacts (AAR files): Sensitivity - Publicly available, but integrity and authenticity are critical to ensure developers are using legitimate and untampered versions of the library.
  - Build Environment and CI/CD Pipeline Configurations: Sensitivity - Confidential. These configurations contain sensitive information like build processes, secrets, and access credentials. Compromise could lead to supply chain attacks.
  - Developer Credentials and Access Keys: Sensitivity - Confidential. Necessary for accessing and managing the repository, CI/CD pipeline, and publishing artifacts. Compromise could lead to unauthorized modifications and malicious releases.
