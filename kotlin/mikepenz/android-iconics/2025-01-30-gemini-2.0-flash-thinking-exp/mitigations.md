## Mitigation Strategy: [Bundle and Verify Icon Font Integrity for `android-iconics`](./mitigation_strategies/bundle_and_verify_icon_font_integrity_for__android-iconics_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Bundle icon fonts:** Ensure icon font files (`.ttf`, `.otf`) used by `android-iconics` are bundled within your application resources (e.g., `res/font`, `assets`). Avoid dynamic font downloading.
    2.  **Trusted font sources:** Obtain font files from official and reputable sources (official project websites, trusted CDNs).
    3.  **Generate checksums:** Calculate cryptographic checksums (SHA-256) of downloaded font files.
    4.  **Securely store checksums:** Store checksums in version control or build scripts.
    5.  **Implement checksum verification in build:** Integrate a build process step (e.g., Gradle task) to:
        *   Recalculate checksums of font files in resources.
        *   Compare recalculated checksums to stored checksums.
        *   Fail the build if checksums mismatch, indicating potential font file tampering.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised font files in source repository (Medium Severity):** Detects altered or corrupted font files within your project.
    *   **Supply chain attacks on font sources (Medium Severity):** Reduces risk from compromised font sources by verifying integrity against known good checksums.

*   **Impact:** Medium risk reduction by ensuring the integrity of the font resources used by `android-iconics`.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Bundling fonts is standard for `android-iconics`. Checksum verification is less common.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Checksum verification of bundled font files is often not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Number of Icon Fonts Used with `android-iconics`](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_number_of_icon_fonts_used_with__android-iconics_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Audit icon usage:** Review your application's UI and identify all used icons.
    2.  **Consolidate font libraries:** Determine if you can use fewer icon font libraries by using more comprehensive sets or removing redundancies.
    3.  **Remove unnecessary dependencies:** Remove unused `android-iconics` modules or icon font libraries from your `build.gradle` dependencies.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Increased attack surface (Low Severity):** Slightly reduces attack surface by minimizing external dependencies.
    *   **Performance impact (Low Severity):** Minor improvements in application size and resource loading.

*   **Impact:** Low risk reduction, primarily improves maintainability and slightly reduces potential attack surface and performance overhead related to resource management by `android-iconics`.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Often implicitly done for project management.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Systematic audits to minimize icon fonts are not always performed proactively.
