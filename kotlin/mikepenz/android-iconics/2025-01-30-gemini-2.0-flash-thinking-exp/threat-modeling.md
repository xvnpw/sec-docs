# Threat Model Analysis for mikepenz/android-iconics

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated dependencies used by `android-iconics`. They might use publicly available exploits to target these vulnerabilities after identifying the vulnerable dependency and version used by the application. Exploitation could range from denial of service to remote code execution depending on the specific vulnerability. This threat is directly related to `android-iconics` because the library dictates which dependencies are used.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, data breach, remote code execution, compromise of user device.
*   **Affected Component:**  `android-iconics` library and its dependencies (e.g., image processing libraries, font handling libraries).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update the `android-iconics` library to the latest version.
    *   Implement automated dependency scanning in the development pipeline to detect and flag vulnerable dependencies.
    *   Monitor security advisories for `android-iconics` and its dependencies.
    *   Apply security patches promptly when vulnerabilities are identified.

## Threat: [Malicious Library (Supply Chain Risk)](./threats/malicious_library__supply_chain_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could compromise the `android-iconics` library repository or build process and inject malicious code. This malicious code would be distributed to applications using the library through standard dependency management channels. Upon application installation or update, the malicious code would execute on user devices. The attacker could gain control of the application, steal data, or perform other malicious actions. This threat is directly related to `android-iconics` as it concerns the integrity of the library itself.
*   **Impact:**  Application compromise, data breach, malware distribution, remote code execution, compromise of user devices on a large scale.
*   **Affected Component:** Entire `android-iconics` library package and potentially the application integrating it.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use reputable package repositories (like Maven Central) and verify library source.
    *   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to detect anomalies and potential supply chain attacks.
    *   Monitor the library's repository and community for suspicious activities.
    *   Consider code signing and integrity checks for dependencies.
