## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Font File Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_font_file_handling.md)

**1. Exploit Malicious Font File Handling (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):**

*   **Attack Vector:** The application loads an icon font file that has been maliciously crafted by the attacker. This malicious font file contains data designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the font rendering process.
*   **Critical Node: Application Loads Icon Font from Untrusted Source:**
    *   **Attack Scenario:** The application allows users to specify custom font sources, fetches fonts from a server controlled by the attacker, or uses insecure APIs that allow font loading from arbitrary locations.
    *   **Attacker Action:** The attacker sets up a server hosting a malicious font file or manipulates the application's configuration to point to this server.
*   **Critical Node: Malicious Font File Contains Exploitable Data:**
    *   **Attack Scenario:** The malicious font file is crafted to trigger specific vulnerabilities in the underlying font rendering engine.
    *   **Attacker Action:** The attacker reverse engineers the font rendering process to identify vulnerabilities and crafts a font file that exploits them.
        *   **Trigger Buffer Overflow in Rendering:** The font file contains data that, when processed, overflows a buffer in the rendering engine, potentially allowing the attacker to overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code.
        *   **Exploit Format String Vulnerability:** (Less likely in font rendering) The font file contains data that is interpreted as a format string, allowing the attacker to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Configuration or Usage](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_configuration_or_usage.md)

**2. Exploit Insecure Configuration or Usage (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):**

*   **Attack Vector:** The application is configured or used in a way that introduces security vulnerabilities, specifically related to how it handles icon fonts.

    *   **High-Risk Path: Application Downloads Icon Fonts Over Insecure Connection (HTTP):**
        *   **Attack Scenario:** The application downloads icon font files from a remote server using an unencrypted HTTP connection.
        *   **Attacker Action:** The attacker intercepts the network traffic between the application and the server.
            *   **Attacker Performs Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** The attacker positions themselves between the application and the server, intercepting and potentially modifying communication.
                *   **Critical Node: Replace Legitimate Font with Malicious One:** The attacker replaces the legitimate font file being downloaded with a malicious one before it reaches the application.

    *   **High-Risk Path: Application Uses Outdated or Vulnerable Version of android-iconics:**
        *   **Attack Scenario:** The application uses an older version of the `android-iconics` library that contains known security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Attacker Action:** The attacker identifies known vulnerabilities in the specific version of the library being used.
            *   **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in the Library:** The attacker leverages publicly available exploits or develops their own to target the identified vulnerabilities in the outdated library. The impact depends on the specific vulnerability, but could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution.
