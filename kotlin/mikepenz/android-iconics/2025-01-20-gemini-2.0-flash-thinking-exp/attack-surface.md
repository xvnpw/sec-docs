# Attack Surface Analysis for mikepenz/android-iconics

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Icon Font Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious_icon_font_files.md)

**Description:** If the application allows users to provide custom icon font files, a malicious user could upload a crafted font file designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying font rendering engine.

**How android-iconics Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `android-iconics` is designed to load and render icon fonts. If the source of these fonts is not controlled, it introduces the risk of processing malicious files.

**Example:** A user uploads a specially crafted `.ttf` file. When `android-iconics` attempts to render icons from this file, it triggers a buffer overflow in the font rendering library, potentially leading to code execution.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (application crash), potentially Remote Code Execution (if the font rendering vulnerability allows it).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:** Avoid allowing users to provide custom font files. If necessary, implement rigorous validation and sanitization of uploaded font files before using them with `android-iconics`. Consider using a sandboxed environment for processing untrusted font files.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities within the `android-iconics` Library](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_within_the__android-iconics__library.md)

**Description:** Like any software, `android-iconics` itself might contain undiscovered vulnerabilities in its code.

**How android-iconics Contributes to the Attack Surface:** By including and using the `android-iconics` library, the application becomes susceptible to any vulnerabilities present within it.

**Example:** A vulnerability in how `android-iconics` parses or handles icon identifiers could be exploited by providing a specially crafted icon name, leading to unexpected behavior or even a crash.

**Impact:** Unexpected application behavior, potential information disclosure (if the vulnerability allows it), Denial of Service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:** Keep the `android-iconics` library updated to the latest version. Regularly check the library's repository and release notes for security updates and bug fixes. Consider using static analysis tools to scan for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** `android-iconics` might rely on other third-party libraries. These dependencies could have their own security vulnerabilities.

**How android-iconics Contributes to the Attack Surface:** By depending on other libraries, `android-iconics` indirectly introduces the attack surface of those dependencies into the application.

**Example:** A dependency used by `android-iconics` has a known vulnerability that allows for arbitrary code execution. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability through the application's usage of `android-iconics`.

**Impact:** Depends on the severity of the vulnerability in the dependency - could range from information disclosure to Remote Code Execution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:** Regularly update the dependencies of the `android-iconics` library. Use dependency management tools that can identify and alert on known vulnerabilities in dependencies. Review the dependency tree to understand the libraries being used.
