# Threat Model Analysis for mikepenz/android-iconics

## Threat: [Malicious Icon Font Injection](./threats/malicious_icon_font_injection.md)

* **Description:** An attacker could trick the application into loading a specially crafted icon font file. This malicious font could contain data or instructions that exploit vulnerabilities in the `android-iconics` font parsing logic.
    * **Impact:**
        * Denial of Service (DoS): The application could crash or become unresponsive due to errors during font parsing.
        * Remote Code Execution (RCE): In a severe scenario, a vulnerability in the font parsing could be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the device.
        * Information Disclosure: The malicious font could potentially be crafted to leak information from the application's memory during the parsing process.
    * **Affected Component:** `Iconics` library core, specifically the font loading and parsing mechanisms.
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Verify Font Source:** Ensure icon fonts are loaded only from trusted and verified sources. Avoid loading fonts dynamically from arbitrary URLs.
        * **Input Validation:** If loading fonts from external sources is necessary, implement robust validation checks on the font files before passing them to `android-iconics`. Check file integrity (e.g., using checksums).
        * **Keep Library Updated:** Regularly update the `android-iconics` library to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that may address font parsing vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Underlying Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_underlying_dependencies.md)

* **Description:** The `android-iconics` library might depend on other third-party libraries that contain known security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities through the `android-iconics` library if it doesn't properly isolate or sanitize data passed to its dependencies.
    * **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency but could range from information disclosure and denial of service to remote code execution.
    * **Affected Component:**  Indirectly affects `android-iconics` through its dependencies.
    * **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep the `android-iconics` library and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * **Dependency Scanning:** Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk) to identify known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies.
        * **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):** Maintain an SBOM to track and manage the dependencies used in the application.
        * **Evaluate Dependencies:** Carefully evaluate the security posture of the dependencies used by `android-iconics` before including the library in the project.
