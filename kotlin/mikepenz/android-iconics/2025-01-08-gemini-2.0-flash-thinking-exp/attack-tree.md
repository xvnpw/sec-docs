## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious SVG -> Crafted SVG with Embedded Scripts (if supported by underlying renderer) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_svg_-_crafted_svg_with_embedded_scripts__if_supported_by_underlying_renderer___high_bbcfdef0.md)

*   Attacker crafts a specially crafted SVG file with embedded malicious scripts (if the rendering engine allows it) or uses SVG features to trigger vulnerabilities (e.g., excessive resource consumption, buffer overflows). This SVG is then loaded and rendered by the application through `android-iconics`.
*   If the underlying rendering engine doesn't properly sanitize SVG content, embedded JavaScript or similar scripting languages could be executed within the application's context, leading to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious SVG -> SVG Bomb (Denial of Service) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_svg_-_svg_bomb__denial_of_service___high-risk_path_.md)

*   Attacker crafts a specially crafted SVG file with nested elements or recursive definitions.
*   When the application attempts to render this SVG through `android-iconics`, it consumes excessive CPU and memory resources, causing the application to freeze or crash.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious SVG -> Exploiting SVG Parser Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_svg_-_exploiting_svg_parser_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   Attacker crafts a malicious SVG file that exploits known vulnerabilities in the SVG parsing library used by the application or indirectly by `android-iconics`.
*   This can trigger buffer overflows, memory corruption, or other security flaws during the parsing process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malformed Icon Font Data -> Exploiting Font Parsing Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malformed_icon_font_data_-_exploiting_font_parsing_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   Attacker creates or modifies a font file with malicious data that targets vulnerabilities in the font parsing library used by `android-iconics`.
*   Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to memory corruption or potentially code execution when the application attempts to load and process the malicious font file.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of android-iconics -> Vulnerabilities in Underlying SVG Parsing Libraries [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_android-iconics_-_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_svg_parsing_libraries__high-_4d64483d.md)

*   `android-iconics` likely relies on other libraries for parsing and rendering SVG files.
*   Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in these underlying libraries (e.g., Batik, Android's built-in SVG support) if the `android-iconics` library doesn't adequately address them or uses outdated versions. This can lead to various impacts, including Denial of Service or even code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of android-iconics -> Vulnerabilities in Font Processing Libraries [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_android-iconics_-_vulnerabilities_in_font_processing_libraries__critical_nod_38a1c5b5.md)

*   Similar to SVG parsing, `android-iconics` likely uses external libraries for processing font files.
*   Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in these font processing libraries, potentially leading to Denial of Service or code execution when the application uses `android-iconics` to handle malicious font data.
