# Threat Model Analysis for mikepenz/android-iconics

## Threat: [Compromised Library Release](./threats/compromised_library_release.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control of the `android-iconics` repository or a maintainer's account and publishes a modified version of the library containing malicious code. Developers unknowingly include this compromised version in their applications. The malicious code could perform actions like data exfiltration, displaying phishing UI, or other malicious activities within the application's context.

**Impact:** Critical. Could lead to complete compromise of applications using the malicious library, resulting in data breaches, financial loss, reputational damage, and user harm.

**Affected Component:** The entire `android-iconics` library package.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Verify the integrity of the library using checksums or signatures if provided by the maintainers.
*   Monitor the library's repository for unusual activity or unauthorized changes.
*   Use dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in the library itself.
*   Consider using a private or internal repository for dependencies with tighter access control.

## Threat: [Malicious Icon Definition Injection](./threats/malicious_icon_definition_injection.md)

**Description:** If the application allows users or external sources to provide icon names or definitions that are then processed by `android-iconics` (e.g., through dynamic theming or user customization), an attacker could inject specially crafted icon definitions. These definitions could exploit parsing vulnerabilities *within the `android-iconics` library*, potentially leading to denial of service (crashing the application) or, in more severe cases, code execution if the library has vulnerabilities in its rendering or parsing logic.

**Impact:** High. Can lead to application crashes and potentially remote code execution due to vulnerabilities in `android-iconics` itself.

**Affected Component:** The icon loading and parsing mechanism within `android-iconics`, specifically the functions responsible for processing icon definitions (e.g., parsing XML or other formats).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly validate and sanitize any user-provided input used for icon names or definitions.
*   Avoid allowing users to provide arbitrary icon definition files or code.
*   Ensure the `android-iconics` library is updated to the latest version to patch known parsing vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Security Misconfiguration - Using Outdated Version](./threats/security_misconfiguration_-_using_outdated_version.md)

**Description:** Developers fail to update the `android-iconics` library to the latest version, leaving the application vulnerable to known security flaws *within `android-iconics`* that have been patched in newer releases. Attackers can exploit these known vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can be High if the outdated version contains critical security flaws allowing remote code execution or significant data breaches.

**Affected Component:** The entire `android-iconics` library.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement a process for regularly updating dependencies, including `android-iconics`.
*   Use dependency management tools that provide notifications about available updates and potential vulnerabilities.
