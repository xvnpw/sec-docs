# Attack Surface Analysis for mikepenz/android-iconics

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Dependency Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Description:** The `android-iconics` library relies on other third-party libraries (transitive dependencies). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the application.
    * **How android-iconics Contributes:** By including `android-iconics`, the application directly incorporates its dependencies, inherently inheriting the risk of vulnerabilities within those libraries.
    * **Example:** A critical security flaw (e.g., remote code execution) exists in a specific version of a support library that `android-iconics` depends on. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if the application uses that vulnerable version through its inclusion of `android-iconics`.
    * **Impact:** Application crash, data breach, unauthorized access, code execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**  Prioritize keeping `android-iconics` updated to the latest version. This often includes updates to its dependencies, patching known vulnerabilities. Utilize dependency management tools and security scanners to identify and address vulnerabilities in the dependency tree. Implement SBOM practices for better visibility.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion through Excessive Icon Rendering](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_through_excessive_icon_rendering.md)

* **Resource Exhaustion through Excessive Icon Rendering:**
    * **Description:**  Using `android-iconics` to render a very large number of complex icons can consume significant device resources, potentially leading to application unresponsiveness or crashes (Denial of Service).
    * **How android-iconics Contributes:** `android-iconics` provides the functionality to easily render and display icons. The library's core purpose is icon rendering, making it a direct contributor to this potential resource exhaustion.
    * **Example:** A malicious actor could craft a scenario within the application (or exploit a vulnerability allowing manipulation of the UI) that forces the rendering of thousands of icons simultaneously using `android-iconics`, causing the application to freeze or crash.
    * **Impact:** Application freeze, crash, battery drain, negative user experience.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement strategies to limit the number of icons rendered at any given time, such as using techniques like view recycling, pagination, or lazy loading. Optimize icon complexity and sizes. Implement safeguards against actions that could trigger the rendering of an excessive number of icons.
