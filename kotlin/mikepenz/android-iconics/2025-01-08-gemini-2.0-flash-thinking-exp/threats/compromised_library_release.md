**4. Enhanced Mitigation and Detection Strategies:**

Building upon the initial mitigation strategies, here are more detailed and proactive measures:

* **Dependency Management Best Practices:**
    * **Pinning Dependencies:**  Specify exact versions of the library in your build files (e.g., Gradle). Avoid using wildcard versions (e.g., `+`) that automatically pull in the latest release.
    * **Regular Dependency Audits:**  Periodically review and update dependencies, but with caution, verifying the integrity of new releases.
    * **Utilize Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):**  Generate and maintain an SBOM to track all components in your application, facilitating faster identification of compromised libraries.

* **Verification and Integrity Checks:**
    * **Checksum/Hash Verification:** If the `android-iconics` maintainers provide checksums (e.g., SHA-256) for releases, integrate verification into your build process to ensure the downloaded library matches the expected hash.
    * **Digital Signatures:**  If the library is digitally signed by the maintainers, verify the signature to confirm its authenticity and integrity.

* **Repository Monitoring and Alerting:**
