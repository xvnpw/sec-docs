# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a library for Android developers to easily incorporate custom fonts and icons into their applications.
*   Offer a wide variety of pre-existing icon fonts, while also allowing developers to easily integrate their own custom fonts.
*   Simplify the process of using icons in Android development, reducing boilerplate code and improving developer productivity.
*   Maintain a lightweight and performant library to minimize impact on application size and performance.
*   Provide comprehensive documentation and support to ensure ease of use and adoption.
*   Foster a community around the library, encouraging contributions and feedback.

Business Risks:

*   Malicious code injection: If the library is compromised, attackers could inject malicious code that could be executed within applications using the library.
*   Supply chain attacks: Compromised dependencies could introduce vulnerabilities into the library.
*   Denial of service: Bugs or vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited to cause application crashes or performance degradation.
*   Data leakage: Although unlikely given the library's function, improper handling of custom fonts could potentially lead to font fingerprinting or other privacy concerns.
*   Intellectual property theft: Custom fonts provided by users could be stolen or misused if not handled securely.
*   Reputational damage: Security vulnerabilities or functional issues could damage the reputation of the library and its maintainers.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Code reviews: The project is open-source and subject to community review, which can help identify potential security issues. (Described in GitHub repository)
*   security control: Static analysis: The project may use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities. (Not explicitly mentioned, but common practice)
*   security control: Dependency management: The project uses Gradle for dependency management, which helps ensure that dependencies are tracked and updated. (Described in build.gradle files)
*   security control: Open source license: The project uses a permissive open-source license (Apache 2.0), which encourages scrutiny and contributions from the security community. (Described in LICENSE file)

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The library relies on third-party font libraries, which may contain vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: The library does not provide explicit mechanisms for protecting custom fonts provided by users.
*   accepted risk: The library does not currently implement specific security hardening measures beyond standard Android development practices.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a robust Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) management process to track all dependencies and their versions.
*   security control: Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools into the build process to automatically scan for vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Perform regular Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) to identify runtime vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Consider implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) if the library interacts with web resources.
*   security control: Provide guidelines and best practices for users on securely handling custom fonts.
*   security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure process.
*   security control: Regularly audit the codebase for potential security issues.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable to this library.
*   Authorization: Not directly applicable to this library.
*   Input Validation:
    *   The library should validate user-provided font file paths and names to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   The library should validate font data to prevent buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues.
*   Cryptography: Not directly applicable, unless the library handles encrypted fonts, in which case standard cryptographic best practices should be followed.

```

Build Process Description:

1.  **Code Commit:** A developer commits code changes to the Git repository (GitHub).
2.  **CI Trigger:** A webhook triggers the CI server (GitHub Actions) upon code commit.
3.  **Build Execution:** The CI server runs the build script (Gradle).
4.  **Dependency Resolution:** Gradle resolves dependencies from Maven Central/JitPack.
5.  **Static Analysis:** SAST tools (e.g., FindBugs, PMD, Checkstyle) are executed to analyze the code for potential vulnerabilities.
6.  **Linting:** Android Lint is used to identify potential code quality and style issues.
7.  **AAR Generation:** Gradle compiles the library code and generates the AAR (Android Archive) file.
8.  **Artifact Upload:** The AAR file is uploaded to an artifact repository (GitHub Releases or Maven Central/JitPack).

*   security control: **CI/CD:** The use of a CI server (GitHub Actions) automates the build and testing process, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of manual errors.
*   security control: **Signed Releases:** Releases should be digitally signed to ensure their integrity and authenticity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Providing a reliable and functional library for Android developers.
*   Maintaining the reputation and trust of the library and its maintainers.

Data Protection:

*   **Font Files (TTF, OTF):** While the library itself doesn't store sensitive data, it handles font files provided by users. The sensitivity of these files depends on the user's content. If a user provides a custom font containing sensitive information (e.g., a proprietary font used for branding), that information could be exposed if the font file is not handled securely.  Sensitivity: Low to Medium (depending on user-provided content).
*   **Library Code:** The library's source code itself is not considered sensitive data, as it is publicly available. However, vulnerabilities in the code could be exploited to compromise applications using the library. Sensitivity: Low (source code), High (vulnerabilities).
*   **No other user data is handled by the library.**
