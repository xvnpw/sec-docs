# Attack Surface Analysis for mikepenz/android-iconics

## Attack Surface: [Font File Parsing and Processing](./attack_surfaces/font_file_parsing_and_processing.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the parsing and processing of font files (TTF, OTF) to achieve code execution or denial of service.
*   **`android-iconics` Contribution:** The library *directly* processes font files to extract icon data and render them. While it uses Android's `Typeface`, its internal handling of icon mappings and custom font features could introduce vulnerabilities. This is the core functionality of the library, making it a direct contributor.
*   **Example:** A malicious actor crafts a TTF file with deliberately malformed data structures designed to trigger a buffer overflow in the font parsing logic *within `android-iconics`* when it attempts to load and process the font.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE): (Less likely in a managed environment, but theoretically possible) Executing malicious code within the application's context.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Crashing the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (due to the potential, even if low probability, of ACE).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Trusted Font Sources:** Only use font files from reputable, trusted sources. Verify the integrity of downloaded fonts using checksums (e.g., SHA-256) and digital signatures.
    *   **Bundle Fonts:** Package font files directly within the application's APK/AAB to avoid loading from external sources. This is the most effective way to prevent malicious font files from being loaded.
    *   **Input Validation:** If fonts *must* be loaded dynamically, rigorously validate the file's integrity *before* passing it to `android-iconics`. This is crucial.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** Conduct thorough fuzz testing of the library's font parsing components using tools like `AFL++` or similar, feeding it a wide range of valid and *malformed* font files. This is essential for identifying potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `android-iconics` and its dependencies updated to the latest versions to benefit from any security patches released by the developers.
    *   **Code Review:** Perform regular security-focused code reviews of the application's font handling logic, paying close attention to areas where `android-iconics` is used and how font files are loaded and processed.

## Attack Surface: [Loading Fonts from Untrusted Sources (External Storage) *when used with `android-iconics`*](./attack_surfaces/loading_fonts_from_untrusted_sources__external_storage__when_used_with__android-iconics_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker places a malicious font file on external storage, which the application then loads *using `android-iconics`*, triggering a vulnerability in the library's font parsing.
    *   **`android-iconics` Contribution:** This is a direct involvement because the vulnerability is triggered *through the use of `android-iconics` to process the malicious font file*. The library is the component that handles the font loading and parsing.
    *   **Example:** A malicious app places a crafted font file in a shared external storage location. The vulnerable application, *using `android-iconics` to load fonts from external storage*, loads this file, triggering a buffer overflow and allowing the attacker to execute code.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE): High potential for executing malicious code, as the attacker controls the font file being processed by `android-iconics`.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS): Crashing the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid External Storage:** *Strongly* prefer bundling fonts within the application's APK/AAB. This is the *most effective* mitigation, eliminating the attack vector entirely.
        *   **Scoped Storage (Android 10+):** If external storage *absolutely must* be used, utilize Android's scoped storage APIs to restrict access to specific, application-private directories. This limits the attacker's ability to place malicious files.
        *   **Strict Permissions:** Request only the absolute minimum necessary storage permissions (ideally, none).
        *   **File Integrity Checks:** Before loading *any* font from external storage, perform *rigorous* file integrity checks. This includes verifying checksums (e.g., SHA-256) and, if possible, digital signatures. Do *not* rely on file extensions or MIME types. The check must happen *before* the file is passed to `android-iconics`.
        * **Content Provider (for sharing):** If fonts need to be shared between applications, use a properly secured `ContentProvider` with appropriate permissions and input validation, rather than direct file access.
