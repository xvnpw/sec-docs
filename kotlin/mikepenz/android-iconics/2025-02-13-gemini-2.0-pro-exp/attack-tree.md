## Attack Tree Path: [1. Denial of Service (DoS) / Application Crash [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__denial_of_service__dos___application_crash__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker aims to make the application unusable by causing it to crash or become unresponsive. This is the most likely and impactful category of attacks against the `android-iconics` library.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Robust input validation.
    *   Careful resource management.
    *   Comprehensive exception handling.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Malformed Icon Resource Input [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__malformed_icon_resource_input__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the primary entry point for several high-risk DoS attacks. The attacker provides invalid or malicious data to the library, hoping to trigger vulnerabilities or errors.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly validate all input data, including icon definitions, font names, character codes, and styling parameters.
    *   Enforce size limits on icon definitions.
    *   Use a secure XML parser (if applicable) with features like external entity resolution disabled.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Extremely Large Icon Definition (Size) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__extremely_large_icon_definition__size___high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides an icon definition with excessively large dimensions or a massive amount of data.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Submit an icon definition (e.g., through an XML file if the application loads icons externally) that specifies extremely large width and height values, or includes a very large embedded image or data payload.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict size limits on icon dimensions and data size.
    *   Validate the size of any embedded images or data before processing.
    *   Perform fuzz testing with large and malformed icon definitions.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.2. Cause OutOfMemoryError (OOM) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_2__cause_outofmemoryerror__oom___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the direct consequence of providing an extremely large icon definition. The application runs out of memory while trying to process the icon, leading to a crash.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   All strategies listed under 1.1.1.
    *   Monitor memory usage and implement safeguards to prevent excessive memory allocation.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.2.1. Provide icon definition that consumes excessive memory. [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_2_1__provide_icon_definition_that_consumes_excessive_memory___high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the specific action the attacker takes to cause an OOM error.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Same as 1.1.1.2

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2. Invalid Icon Font/Character Reference [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2__invalid_icon_fontcharacter_reference__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides a non-existent font name or character code to the library.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Specify an invalid font name or a character code that does not exist within the specified font.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Validate font names against a whitelist, if possible.
    *   Validate character codes against the valid range for the specified font.
    *   Handle font loading and character rendering exceptions gracefully.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2.1. Trigger Exception due to Unhandled Font/Character [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_1__trigger_exception_due_to_unhandled_fontcharacter__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the direct consequence of providing an invalid font or character reference. If the application does not handle the resulting exception, it will crash.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust exception handling for all font loading and character rendering operations.
    *   Use `try-catch` blocks to gracefully handle potential errors.
    *   Log any exceptions that occur for debugging and monitoring.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2.1.1. Provide non-existent font or character code. [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_1_1__provide_non-existent_font_or_character_code___high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the specific action the attacker takes.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Same as 1.1.2.1

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2.2. Exploit potential vulnerabilities in font loading/rendering. [CRITICAL if custom fonts]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_2__exploit_potential_vulnerabilities_in_font_loadingrendering___critical_if_custom_fonts_.md)

*   **Description:** This is a highly specialized attack that targets vulnerabilities in the underlying font rendering engine (often part of the OS). It's much more likely if the application allows the use of *custom fonts*.
*   **Attack Vector (if custom fonts are used):**
    *   Provide a maliciously crafted font file that exploits a vulnerability in the font rendering engine. This could lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid custom fonts if possible.** This significantly reduces the attack surface.
    *   **If custom fonts are absolutely necessary:**
        *   **Thoroughly validate the font file before loading it.** Use multiple independent validation tools.
        *   **Consider using a sandboxed environment for font rendering.** This isolates the font rendering process from the rest of the application, limiting the impact of a potential exploit.
        *   **Keep the underlying OS and any font rendering libraries up-to-date.** This ensures that any known vulnerabilities are patched.
        *   **Implement strict file permissions to prevent unauthorized modification of font files.**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2.2.1. If custom fonts are supported, supply a malicious font file. [HIGH-RISK if custom fonts]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_2_1__if_custom_fonts_are_supported__supply_a_malicious_font_file___high-risk_if_custom_fonts_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the specific, high-risk action if custom fonts are allowed.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Same as 1.1.2.2
