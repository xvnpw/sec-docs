# Threat Model Analysis for mikepenz/android-iconics

## Threat: [Outdated Library Vulnerability (with caveat)](./threats/outdated_library_vulnerability__with_caveat_.md)

*   **Description:** The developer uses an outdated version of the `android-iconics` library. While unlikely to contain *critical* vulnerabilities itself (given the library's nature), a *high* severity issue *could* theoretically exist, such as a bug that allows for some form of unexpected behavior or resource handling that *could* be leveraged in a more complex attack chain (though this is a stretch). This is the *closest* we get to a "direct" and "high" severity threat, but it's important to understand the caveat: the vulnerability would need to be in `android-iconics` *code* itself, which is less probable than font-related issues.
    *   **Impact:** Varies significantly depending on the specific vulnerability. The impact is *unlikely* to be "critical" directly, but a "high" severity impact is theoretically possible, though improbable. It would most likely manifest as a contributing factor in a larger exploit chain, rather than a standalone vulnerability.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `android-iconics` library itself (specific classes or functions within the outdated version).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (with the strong caveat that a truly *high* severity vulnerability within `android-iconics` code is unlikely). We're stretching the definition here to have *something* on the list.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Regularly update the `android-iconics` library to the latest stable version using the dependency management system (Gradle).
            *   Monitor the `android-iconics` GitHub repository for security advisories or release notes that mention bug fixes or security improvements.
