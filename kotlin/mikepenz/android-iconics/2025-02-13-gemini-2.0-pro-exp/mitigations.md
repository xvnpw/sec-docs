# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mikepenz/android-iconics

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Dependency Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_dependency_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Dependency Management:** Ensure your project uses a dependency management tool like Gradle.
    2.  **Specify Version:** In your `build.gradle` file (app-level), specify the `android-iconics` dependency.  Initially, use a specific version (e.g., `implementation 'com.mikepenz:iconics-core:5.3.6'`).
    3.  **Check for Updates:** Regularly check for newer versions of `android-iconics`.  Do this manually (GitHub) or using a tool.
    4.  **Use a Versioning Plugin (Recommended):** Integrate `gradle-versions-plugin`. Add to your `build.gradle` (project-level):
        ```gradle
        plugins {
            id "com.github.ben-manes.versions" version "0.47.0" // Use latest
        }
        ```
        Run `./gradlew dependencyUpdates` to see updates.
    5.  **Update Version:** When a new `android-iconics` version is available, update the version number in your `build.gradle`.
    6.  **Review Release Notes:** *Before* updating, review the release notes for security fixes, bug fixes, or breaking changes.
    7.  **Test Thoroughly:** After updating, test your application, especially where icons are used.
    8.  **Automate (Ideal):** Integrate dependency update checks into your Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of using `android-iconics` with known vulnerabilities in its code or its *direct* dependencies. Exploitation could lead to various issues, including potential code execution.
    *   **Future Vulnerabilities (Unknown Severity):** Proactively addresses potential undiscovered vulnerabilities that might be patched in future `android-iconics` releases.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Significantly reduces the risk (High impact). Changes risk from exploitable to patched.
    *   **Future Vulnerabilities:** Moderate risk reduction (Medium impact). Ensures you're on the latest, most secure version.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. The project uses Gradle and specifies the dependency. Manual checks are done occasionally. `gradle-versions-plugin` is *not* integrated.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Full automation with `gradle-versions-plugin` and CI integration are missing. Regular, scheduled checks are inconsistent.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Vulnerability Scanning of Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/vulnerability_scanning_of_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose an SCA Tool:** Select a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, JFrog Xray, Sonatype Nexus Lifecycle).
    2.  **Integrate into Build Process:** Integrate the tool into your build. For OWASP Dependency-Check and Gradle:
        *   Add to `build.gradle` (project-level):
            ```gradle
            plugins {
                id "org.owasp.dependencycheck" version "8.3.1" // Use latest
            }
            ```
        *   Configure the plugin (optional, but recommended).
    3.  **Run Scans:** Run the SCA tool as part of your build (e.g., `./gradlew dependencyCheckAnalyze`).
    4.  **Review Reports:** Review reports listing vulnerabilities in your dependencies, *including* `android-iconics` and its dependencies.
    5.  **Address Vulnerabilities:** For each vulnerability:
        *   **Update:** If a newer version of the affected dependency (including `android-iconics` or one *it* uses) fixes the vulnerability, update.
        *   **Mitigate:** If no update is available, investigate other mitigations.
        *   **Suppress (Carefully):** If a vulnerability is a false positive or not exploitable, suppress it (with documentation).
    6.  **Automate (Essential):** Integrate the SCA tool into your CI pipeline for automatic scans on every build. Fail the build for high-severity issues.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Directly identifies known vulnerabilities in `android-iconics` itself.
    *   **Indirect Dependency Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Identifies vulnerabilities in libraries that `android-iconics` uses. This is crucial, as `android-iconics` might pull in other libraries.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** High impact. Provides an actionable list of vulnerabilities to address directly in `android-iconics`.
    *   **Indirect Dependency Vulnerabilities:** High impact. Provides an actionable list of vulnerabilities in libraries used by `android-iconics`.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:** The project lacks any automated vulnerability scanning. This is a significant gap.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review Library Usage](./mitigation_strategies/review_library_usage.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Code Reviews:** Include `android-iconics` usage in code reviews. Look for:
        *   Custom modifications to the `android-iconics` library itself (highly discouraged).
        *   Unusual usage patterns.
        *   Dynamic generation or manipulation of icon data (unlikely, but check).
    2.  **Periodic Audits:** Periodically audit how `android-iconics` is used in the codebase.
    3.  **UI Thread Usage:** Ensure icon rendering is on the UI thread; avoid blocking operations related to `android-iconics` on the main thread.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Improper Configuration/Usage (Medium Severity):** Helps identify and correct misuses of `android-iconics` that could introduce vulnerabilities. This is about how *your code* interacts with the library.
    *   **Future Vulnerabilities (Unknown Severity):** Might help uncover subtle issues related to future vulnerabilities *within* `android-iconics`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Improper Configuration/Usage:** Medium impact. Reduces self-inflicted vulnerabilities related to how you use `android-iconics`.
    *   **Future Vulnerabilities:** Low impact. Provides a small degree of proactive protection.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Code reviews happen, but don't always focus on `android-iconics`. Periodic audits aren't formal.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Formal, scheduled audits of `android-iconics` usage are missing. Code reviews could be more explicit.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Stay Informed](./mitigation_strategies/stay_informed.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Subscribe to Repository:** Subscribe to the `android-iconics` GitHub repository for notifications about new releases, issues, and discussions *specifically about this library*.
    2. **Follow Maintainer:** Follow the library's maintainer (Mike Penz) on relevant platforms to stay informed about `android-iconics` updates.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Future Vulnerabilities (Unknown Severity):** Helps you stay informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities or best practices *specifically for android-iconics*.

* **Impact:**
    * **Future Vulnerabilities:** Low to Medium impact. Provides early warning of potential issues *in android-iconics*.

* **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Developers are generally aware of security, but there's no formal process for tracking `android-iconics`-specific updates.

* **Missing Implementation:** A structured approach to staying informed about `android-iconics` updates is beneficial. This could involve setting up specific alerts.
