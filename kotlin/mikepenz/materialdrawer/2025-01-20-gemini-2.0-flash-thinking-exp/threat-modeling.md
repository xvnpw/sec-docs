# Threat Model Analysis for mikepenz/materialdrawer

## Threat: [Malicious Content Injection in Drawer Items](./threats/malicious_content_injection_in_drawer_items.md)

* **Description:** The `DrawerAdapter` and specific `IDrawerItem` implementations within the `materialdrawer` library could be vulnerable to displaying malicious content if the application provides unsanitized data. If the library doesn't properly escape or sanitize data when rendering drawer items (especially if custom views or HTML rendering within items is used), an attacker could inject malicious HTML or JavaScript. This could be exploited if the application fetches data from an untrusted source and directly passes it to the drawer items without sanitization.
* **Impact:** Successful injection could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) like vulnerabilities within the application's context. This could allow an attacker to steal user session tokens, redirect users to malicious websites, display phishing prompts, or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user within the application.
* **Affected Component:**
    * `DrawerAdapter` (responsible for rendering drawer items)
    * Specific `IDrawerItem` implementations that display dynamic content or allow custom views.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Library Updates:** Ensure you are using the latest version of the `materialdrawer` library, as the developers may have addressed potential rendering vulnerabilities.
    * **Data Sanitization:**  The primary responsibility lies with the application developer to sanitize and encode all data *before* passing it to the `materialdrawer` library for display. Do not rely solely on the library for sanitization.
    * **Avoid Custom HTML Rendering:** If possible, avoid using features that allow rendering arbitrary HTML within drawer items, as this significantly increases the risk of injection.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP) for WebViews:** If `WebView` components are used within custom drawer items, implement a strong Content Security Policy to restrict the sources from which the WebView can load resources.
