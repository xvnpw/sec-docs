## Attack Surface: [High and Critical Attack Surfaces Directly Involving MaterialDrawer - Applications loading images from untrusted sources](./attack_surfaces/high_and_critical_attack_surfaces_directly_involving_materialdrawer_-_applications_loading_images_fr_f616b2bb.md)

*   **Description:** Applications loading images from untrusted sources for drawer items or profile headers are susceptible to various attacks.
    *   **How MaterialDrawer Contributes:** MaterialDrawer allows setting icons and profile images via URLs. If the application doesn't validate or sanitize these URLs, it can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could provide a URL to an extremely large image, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) by consuming excessive resources. Alternatively, they could provide a URL to an internal resource, potentially leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service, Server-Side Request Forgery, potential for information disclosure (indirectly through SSRF).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only load images from trusted sources.
        *   Implement robust URL validation and sanitization.
        *   Consider downloading and storing images locally instead of directly loading from URLs.
        *   Set appropriate timeouts for image loading to prevent indefinite loading attempts.

## Attack Surface: [High and Critical Attack Surfaces Directly Involving MaterialDrawer - The ability to inject custom views](./attack_surfaces/high_and_critical_attack_surfaces_directly_involving_materialdrawer_-_the_ability_to_inject_custom_v_288485e0.md)

*   **Description:** The ability to inject custom views into the MaterialDrawer can introduce significant security risks if not handled carefully.
    *   **How MaterialDrawer Contributes:** MaterialDrawer allows developers to add custom views as header, footer, or item components. If the application allows untrusted sources to provide or influence these custom views, it opens a wide attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A malicious actor could provide a custom view that contains embedded malware, attempts to access sensitive device resources, or performs UI redressing attacks (overlaying legitimate UI elements with fake ones).
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, UI redressing/clickjacking, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never** allow untrusted sources to provide or influence custom views within the MaterialDrawer.
        *   If custom views are necessary, ensure they are created and managed entirely within the application's trusted codebase.
        *   Thoroughly review and test any custom views used within the MaterialDrawer for potential security vulnerabilities.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege to custom views, limiting their access to system resources and sensitive data.
