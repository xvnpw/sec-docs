# Threat Model Analysis for mikepenz/materialdrawer

## Threat: [Unintentional Sensitive Data Exposure in Drawer Items](./threats/unintentional_sensitive_data_exposure_in_drawer_items.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to sensitive information because the application displays it within `materialdrawer` components without proper authorization or sanitization. This occurs when dynamically populating drawer items (e.g., `PrimaryDrawerItem`, `SecondaryDrawerItem`, `ProfileDrawerItem`) with data from a database, API, or other source, and that data is not properly checked for user permissions or sanitized for potentially harmful content. The attacker could be a legitimate user exceeding their privileges or an external attacker exploiting a separate vulnerability to view the drawer.

**Impact:** Leakage of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial data, authentication tokens, or other confidential information. This can lead to identity theft, financial loss, reputational damage, and legal repercussions.

**Affected Component:**
    *   `PrimaryDrawerItem`, `SecondaryDrawerItem`, `ProfileDrawerItem`, and all other classes used for creating drawer items.
    *   The `DrawerBuilder` class and its methods for adding items to the drawer.
    *   Any custom `IDrawerItem` implementations.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Authorization:** Implement robust authorization checks *before* populating any drawer items. Ensure only data the current user is *permitted* to see is displayed.
    *   **Data Sanitization:** Sanitize *all* data before displaying it in the drawer. Escape HTML or other potentially dangerous characters if the data might be rendered in a way that could be vulnerable to injection.
    *   **Minimal Data Display:** Only display the absolute *minimum* necessary information in the drawer. Avoid sensitive data unless strictly required and properly protected.
    *   **Data Source Review:** Carefully review all data sources used to populate the drawer. Ensure they are secure and only provide the necessary data.
    *   **Use of Placeholders:** Use placeholder text or images for sensitive data until the user explicitly requests to view it (e.g., a "Show Details" button).

## Threat: [Malicious Drawer Item Injection via User Input (Leading to XSS or Intent Injection)](./threats/malicious_drawer_item_injection_via_user_input__leading_to_xss_or_intent_injection_.md)

**Description:** If the application allows *unvalidated and unsanitized* user input to directly influence the content or behavior of `materialdrawer` items, an attacker can inject malicious code or data. This is most likely with custom `IDrawerItem` implementations, especially those using WebViews.  If user input is directly inserted into HTML rendered in a WebView within a drawer item, an attacker could inject JavaScript (XSS). If user input controls the `Intent` associated with a drawer item, a malicious intent could be crafted.

**Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Session hijacking, data theft, website defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Malicious Intents:** Unauthorized actions, data leakage, or potentially privilege escalation, depending on the intent's target and permissions.

**Affected Component:**
    *   `DrawerBuilder` and its methods for adding items.
    *   *Crucially:* Any custom `IDrawerItem` implementations, particularly those using WebViews or handling user-provided data in any way.
    *   `withOnDrawerItemClickListener` and similar event handlers if they process user-provided data unsafely.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Rigorously validate *all* user input that influences drawer item content. Use whitelisting (allowing only known-good values) whenever possible.
    *   **Thorough Input Sanitization:** Sanitize any user input that *must* be used in drawer items. Escape HTML, JavaScript, and other potentially dangerous characters.  Use appropriate sanitization libraries for the data type.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** If using WebViews within drawer items, implement a *strict* CSP to limit the WebView's capabilities and prevent XSS. Disable JavaScript if it's not absolutely necessary.
    *   **Intent Filtering:** If drawer items trigger Intents, meticulously validate the target and data of the Intent to prevent malicious actions. Use explicit Intents whenever possible, and avoid using data from user input in the Intent.
    *   **Avoid Direct User Input:** The best mitigation is to *avoid* using user-provided data directly in drawer item creation. Use pre-defined options, data from trusted sources, or carefully controlled transformations of user input.
