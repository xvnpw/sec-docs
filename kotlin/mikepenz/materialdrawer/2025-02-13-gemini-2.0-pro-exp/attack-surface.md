# Attack Surface Analysis for mikepenz/materialdrawer

## Attack Surface: [1. Transitive Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/1__transitive_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in libraries that `materialdrawer` depends on (and their dependencies).
*   **`materialdrawer` Contribution:** The library's dependency tree introduces potential vulnerabilities that wouldn't exist without its use.  This is a *direct* contribution because the library *chooses* these dependencies.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in an older version of the Android Support Library (a transitive dependency) could allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges.
*   **Impact:** Varies widely, from information disclosure to remote code execution, depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Regularly update all dependencies (including `materialdrawer`) to their latest stable versions. Use dependency analysis tools (e.g., `gradle dependencies`, OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk) to identify and track vulnerabilities. Consider dependency pinning to specific, known-good versions.  *This is the most crucial mitigation for this direct risk.*
    *   **Users:** Keep the application updated to the latest version released by the developers.

## Attack Surface: [2. Intent Redirection via Click Handlers (If `materialdrawer` provides default handling)](./attack_surfaces/2__intent_redirection_via_click_handlers__if__materialdrawer__provides_default_handling_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could craft a malicious `Intent` if click handlers for drawer items use unvalidated user input to construct `Intents`. *This is only included if `materialdrawer` itself provides some default `Intent` handling that is not fully under the application developer's control.* If the application *fully* controls the `Intent` creation, this is an indirect risk.
*   **`materialdrawer` Contribution:** *Potentially* direct if the library has built-in `Intent` handling that is not fully configurable by the application developer.  If the application developer has *complete* control over the `Intent` construction, this is an *indirect* risk and would be excluded from this list.  I am including it here with this caveat because drawer libraries *sometimes* provide convenience methods that might handle `Intents`.
*   **Example:** A drawer item's click handler, *using a default `materialdrawer` mechanism*, launches an `Intent` based on a URL provided by the user (or even a hardcoded, but attacker-influenceable, value). The attacker provides a malicious URL.
*   **Impact:** Can lead to various attacks, including phishing, launching malicious activities, or accessing sensitive data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** If `materialdrawer` provides *any* default `Intent` handling, *carefully review its documentation and implementation*.  Override or disable any default behavior that uses potentially untrusted data.  Always validate and sanitize any data used to construct `Intents`, even if it seems to come from a trusted source within the library. Prefer explicit `Intents`.
    *   **Users:** No direct mitigation, relies on developer implementation.

## Attack Surface: [3. Custom View Vulnerabilities (If MaterialDrawer provides default custom views)](./attack_surfaces/3__custom_view_vulnerabilities__if_materialdrawer_provides_default_custom_views_.md)

* **Description:** If MaterialDrawer provides default custom views within the drawer, vulnerabilities in those custom views can be exploited.
    * **`materialdrawer` Contribution:** The library provides default custom views.
    * **Example:** A default custom view that renders HTML without proper sanitization could be vulnerable to XSS.
    * **Impact:** Depends on the specific vulnerability in the custom view; could range from XSS to arbitrary code execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the custom view).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** If MaterialDrawer provides default custom views, thoroughly test and audit them for security vulnerabilities.
        * **Users:** No direct mitigation.
