# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mikepenz/materialdrawer

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Management and Vulnerability Scanning](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_management_and_vulnerability_scanning.md)

1.  **Targeted Scanning:** Focus vulnerability scanning specifically on `materialdrawer` and its *direct and transitive* dependencies. While general dependency scanning is good, prioritize analyzing the output related to this library.
2.  **Rapid Response:** Establish a process for *immediate* review and remediation of any vulnerabilities found in `materialdrawer` or its dependencies.  "Immediate" means within a defined, short timeframe (e.g., 24-48 hours for critical vulnerabilities).
3.  **Version Pinning (with Caution):** Consider pinning the version of `materialdrawer` to a specific, known-good version *after* thorough testing.  This prevents accidental upgrades to a potentially vulnerable version.  *However*, this must be balanced against the need to apply security updates.  A process for regularly reviewing and updating the pinned version is essential.
4. **Forking (Last Resort):** If a critical vulnerability exists and no official patch is available, *and* the risk is unacceptable, consider forking the `materialdrawer` repository and applying a patch yourself.  This is a high-maintenance option and should only be used as a last resort.  Document the reasons for forking and the applied changes thoroughly.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in `materialdrawer`:** (Severity: High to Critical) - Direct exploitation of flaws in the library's code.
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies:** (Severity: High to Critical) - Vulnerabilities in libraries used by `materialdrawer` that could be leveraged through the library.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Directly reduces the risk of attacks targeting the library and its dependencies. Risk reduction: High.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `npm audit` is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions).
    *   Dependabot is enabled and configured for security updates.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A dedicated process for prioritizing and rapidly addressing `materialdrawer`-specific vulnerabilities is not formalized.
    *   Version pinning is not currently used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Validation (for `materialdrawer` Inputs)](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_validation__for__materialdrawer__inputs_.md)

1.  **Precise Input Mapping:** Create a precise mapping of *every* `materialdrawer` component property that accepts user-provided or externally-sourced data.  This goes beyond just `name` and `description`; consider:
    *   `icon` (if accepting URLs or custom components).
    *   `badge` content.
    *   Any custom properties used in custom renderers.
    *   Data used to dynamically generate drawer items (e.g., from an API).
2.  **Targeted Sanitization:** Apply *strict* HTML sanitization to *all* mapped input points *before* passing data to `materialdrawer` components.  Use a well-vetted library like DOMPurify (for JavaScript) and configure it to allow only a minimal set of safe HTML tags and attributes.
3.  **Type and Format Validation (Pre-Sanitization):** *Before* sanitization, validate the *type* and *format* of the data.  This prevents unexpected input from bypassing sanitization or causing errors.  For example:
    *   If a `badge` is expected to be a number, ensure it *is* a number before sanitizing.
    *   If an `icon` is expected to be a URL, validate it as a URL.
4.  **Custom Renderer Audits:** Conduct *rigorous* security audits of any custom renderers used with `materialdrawer`.  These are high-risk areas because they often involve direct manipulation of the DOM.  Ensure they:
    *   Properly sanitize and validate *all* input.
    *   Avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (React) or similar constructs without extreme caution and thorough sanitization.
    *   Prefer built-in `materialdrawer` components whenever possible.
5. **Data-Driven Drawer Generation:** If drawer items are generated dynamically (e.g., from a database or API), apply sanitization and validation *at the point of data retrieval or generation*, *before* the data is used to create `materialdrawer` components.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (via `materialdrawer`):** (Severity: High) - Prevents injection of malicious scripts through data displayed in the drawer.
    *   **HTML Injection (via `materialdrawer`):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents UI disruption or phishing attacks through manipulated drawer content.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS/HTML Injection:** Directly mitigates the risk of these attacks through the `materialdrawer` component. Risk reduction: High.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic sanitization using DOMPurify is applied to the `name` property of drawer items.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Sanitization is *not* consistently applied to *all* input points (e.g., `description`, `badge`, custom renderers, dynamically generated items).
    *   Type and format validation is largely absent.
    *   Rigorous security audits of custom renderers have not been performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review Custom Drawer Logic (Related to `materialdrawer`)](./mitigation_strategies/review_custom_drawer_logic__related_to__materialdrawer__.md)

1.  **Identify `materialdrawer`-Specific Logic:** Focus code reviews and security testing specifically on code that *interacts with* `materialdrawer`. This includes:
    *   Event handlers attached to `materialdrawer` components (e.g., `onClick`, `onSelection`).
    *   Code that dynamically creates or modifies drawer items.
    *   Custom renderers.
    *   Any logic that uses `materialdrawer`'s API (e.g., opening/closing the drawer, managing selection).
2.  **Security-Focused Code Reviews:** During code reviews, explicitly look for:
    *   Improper handling of user input passed to `materialdrawer`.
    *   Potential authorization bypasses related to drawer item visibility or actions.
    *   Logic errors that could lead to unexpected behavior or data exposure.
3.  **Targeted Security Testing:** Create test cases that specifically target the `materialdrawer` integration:
    *   Attempt to inject malicious data into drawer items.
    *   Test edge cases and boundary conditions for dynamically generated content.
    *   Verify that access controls are correctly enforced for drawer items and actions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Logic Flaws (in `materialdrawer` Usage):** (Severity: Variable) - Vulnerabilities introduced by how the application *uses* `materialdrawer`.
    *   **XSS/Injection (through Custom Logic):** (Severity: High) - If custom logic mishandles input, it could create vulnerabilities even if `materialdrawer` itself is secure.
    *   **Authorization Bypasses (Related to Drawer):** (Severity: High) - Flaws in how the application controls drawer visibility or actions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Logic Flaws/XSS/Injection/Authorization Bypasses:** Reduces the risk of vulnerabilities arising from the application's interaction with `materialdrawer`. Risk reduction: Variable, depending on the complexity of the integration.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   General code reviews are conducted, but they don't specifically focus on the security of `materialdrawer` interactions.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Dedicated security-focused code reviews and testing specifically targeting `materialdrawer` integration are missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Exposure Prevention (Within materialdrawer context)](./mitigation_strategies/data_exposure_prevention__within_materialdrawer_context_.md)

1.  **Drawer Content Inventory:** Create a detailed inventory of *all* data displayed within the `materialdrawer` components. This includes data in standard items, custom items, badges, and any other UI elements within the drawer.
2.  **Sensitivity Classification (Drawer-Specific):** Classify each data item's sensitivity *specifically in the context of the drawer*.  Even if data is displayed elsewhere in the application, consider whether its presence in the drawer introduces new risks.
3.  **Conditional Rendering (Drawer Items):** Use conditional logic *within the drawer rendering code* to show or hide drawer items based on user roles, permissions, and the sensitivity of the data.  This ensures that only authorized users see specific drawer items.
4. **Avoid Sensitive Data in Drawer:** Minimize the display of sensitive data (PII, credentials, etc.) *directly within the drawer*. If absolutely necessary, ensure:
    * The data is essential for the drawer's functionality.
    * The user *must* see it in the drawer context.
    * Strong access controls are in place.
    * The data is handled securely (encrypted in transit, masked if possible).
5. **Review Drawer Item Structure:** Examine the structure of your drawer items. Avoid complex nested structures or custom renderers that might inadvertently expose data.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (via Drawer):** (Severity: High to Critical) - Prevents unauthorized users from viewing sensitive information displayed *within the drawer*.
    *   **Data Breach (Impact on Drawer):** (Severity: High to Critical) - Reduces the impact of a data breach by limiting the sensitive data exposed *through the drawer*.
    *   **Privacy Violations (Drawer Context):** (Severity: High) - Protects user privacy by controlling the display of PII *within the drawer*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access/Data Breach/Privacy Violations:** Significantly reduces the risk of these issues specifically related to the `materialdrawer` component. Risk reduction: High.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic role-based access control is implemented to show/hide some drawer items.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A comprehensive inventory and classification of data displayed *specifically within the drawer* is missing.
    *   Access control logic is not consistently applied to *all* drawer items.
    *   Some potentially sensitive information is displayed in the drawer without a clear security justification.
