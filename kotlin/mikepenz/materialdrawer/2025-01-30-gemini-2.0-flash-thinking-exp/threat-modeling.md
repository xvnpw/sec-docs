# Threat Model Analysis for mikepenz/materialdrawer

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Input in Custom Drawer Items](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_input_in_custom_drawer_items.md)

**Description:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into custom drawer items if the application fails to properly sanitize user-provided or untrusted data used to create these items. This injection can occur through various input vectors that feed into the drawer item creation process. When a user renders the drawer, the unsanitized input containing malicious scripts is executed within their browser.

**Impact:** Account compromise through session cookie theft or credential harvesting, session hijacking enabling attackers to impersonate users, data theft by accessing sensitive information displayed on the page, and defacement of the application's user interface.

**Affected MaterialDrawer Component:** Custom drawer item rendering functionality, specifically when developers utilize dynamic content or directly embed HTML within drawer items.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Mandatory sanitization and encoding of all user-provided or untrusted data before incorporating it into drawer items. Employ robust encoding functions to escape HTML characters and prevent script execution.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP) Enforcement:** Implement a strict Content Security Policy to control resource loading sources, significantly limiting the impact of XSS by preventing execution of inline scripts and scripts from unauthorized domains.
*   **Secure Templating Practices:** Utilize secure templating engines that automatically handle output encoding, minimizing the risk of XSS vulnerabilities during dynamic content generation for drawer items.
*   **Regular Security Assessments:** Conduct routine security audits and penetration testing specifically focusing on areas where user input interacts with MaterialDrawer to proactively identify and remediate potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Transitive Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_transitive_dependencies.md)

**Description:** MaterialDrawer relies on external JavaScript libraries as dependencies. If vulnerabilities exist within these dependencies, applications using MaterialDrawer become indirectly susceptible. Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in these dependencies to compromise the application. This threat is introduced *by using* MaterialDrawer, as it brings in these dependencies.

**Impact:**  Depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability, the impact can be severe, ranging from Denial of Service (DoS) attacks that disrupt application availability, to Remote Code Execution (RCE) allowing attackers to gain control of the user's system or the server, and potential data breaches exposing sensitive information.

**Affected MaterialDrawer Component:** MaterialDrawer's dependency management and the inclusion of transitive dependencies. While not a vulnerability *in* MaterialDrawer's code directly, it is a risk introduced by *using* MaterialDrawer.

**Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific dependency vulnerability, can be Critical)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Proactive Dependency Scanning:** Regularly employ dependency scanning tools (e.g., `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check) to identify and track known vulnerabilities in MaterialDrawer's dependencies.
*   **Timely Dependency Updates:**  Maintain MaterialDrawer and all its dependencies at the latest versions. Security patches addressing known vulnerabilities are frequently released in updated versions.
*   **Continuous Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases relevant to JavaScript libraries and MaterialDrawer to stay informed about newly disclosed vulnerabilities and necessary updates.
*   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA) Integration:** Integrate Software Composition Analysis into the development lifecycle to continuously monitor and manage open-source dependencies, proactively addressing associated security risks.
