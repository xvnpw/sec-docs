# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is an Android UI component library, specifically a Drawer (navigation menu) implementation called MaterialDrawer.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide Android developers with a reusable, customizable, and Material Design compliant Drawer component.
  - Simplify the process of adding navigation drawers to Android applications.
  - Offer a feature-rich and well-maintained alternative to building drawers from scratch.
  - Enable developers to create consistent and user-friendly navigation experiences in their Android apps.
  - Foster a community around the library for contributions and improvements.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the library could be inherited by applications using it, potentially impacting a large number of Android users.
  - Poor performance or instability of the library could negatively affect the user experience of applications using it.
  - Lack of maintenance or updates could lead to the library becoming outdated and incompatible with newer Android versions or security standards.
  - Supply chain risks if dependencies used by the library have vulnerabilities.
  - Negative reputation if the library is perceived as insecure or unreliable, impacting adoption and community trust.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Review - The project is open source, allowing for community review of the code. Implemented: Github repository visibility.
  - security control: Issue Reporting - Github issue tracker allows users to report bugs and potential security vulnerabilities. Implemented: Github issue tracker.
  - security control: Dependency Management - Gradle is used for dependency management, allowing for some control over included libraries. Implemented: build.gradle files.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community for security audits and vulnerability discovery.
  - accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to exist in dependencies.
  - accepted risk: No formal security development lifecycle is explicitly documented.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
  - security control: Integrate static analysis security testing (SAST) tools into the build process to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability reporting and response process.
  - security control: Consider code signing of the library artifact to ensure integrity and authenticity.
  - security control: Document secure coding practices followed during development.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a UI library itself. Authentication is handled by applications using the library.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a UI library itself. Authorization is handled by applications using the library.
  - Input Validation: While a UI library receives input indirectly through Android framework events, ensure proper handling of potentially malicious or unexpected input data passed to the library's components to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes. Focus on validating data that library processes directly, if any.
  - Cryptography:  Likely not directly required for a UI library. If any sensitive data handling is introduced in future, appropriate cryptography should be used.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Development and maintenance of the MaterialDrawer library.
  - Distribution of the library to Android developers.
  - Integration of the library into Android applications.
  - Reliable and secure operation of Android applications using the library.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Source code of the MaterialDrawer library (Moderate Sensitivity - Confidentiality and Integrity).
  - Build artifacts (AAR file) (Moderate Sensitivity - Integrity and Availability).
  - Credentials for publishing to Maven Central (High Sensitivity - Confidentiality and Integrity).
  - No direct user data is processed or stored by the library itself. Indirectly, vulnerabilities could impact user data in applications using the library.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What CI/CD system is currently used for building and publishing the library (if any)?

  - What is the process for handling reported security vulnerabilities?
  - Are there any specific security requirements from the community or users of the library?
  - Is code signing of the library artifact considered or implemented?

- Assumptions:
  - Standard open-source development practices are followed.
  - The library is intended for wide public use by Android developers.
  - Maven Central is the primary distribution channel.
  - Security is a concern for the project maintainers and users, even if not explicitly stated in detail.
  - The project aims to provide a reliable and stable UI component.
