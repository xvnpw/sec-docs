## Attack Surface: [Deep Link Manipulation via Drawer Item Actions](./attack_surfaces/deep_link_manipulation_via_drawer_item_actions.md)

**Description:** Drawer items trigger deep links or intents based on data that could be manipulated or is sourced from untrusted locations.

**How MaterialDrawer Contributes:** The library allows setting actions (like starting activities or opening URLs) when a drawer item is clicked. If the parameters for these actions are not properly handled *within the MaterialDrawer's action handling*, it can be exploited.

**Example:** A drawer item is configured to open a specific product page using an intent. The product ID used in the intent's data is taken directly from a user-controlled source when the drawer item is created. A malicious user could manipulate this source to open a different, unintended page or activity.

**Impact:**
* Bypassing intended application flow or security checks.
* Accessing sensitive functionalities without proper authorization.
* Potential for launching unintended external applications with manipulated data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Data Validation Before Setting Actions:** Thoroughly validate any data used to construct deep links or intents *before* setting the action on the MaterialDrawer item.
* **Avoid Direct User Input in Action Configuration:** Do not directly use user-provided input to configure the intent parameters of MaterialDrawer items.
* **Use Whitelisting for Targets:** If possible, use a whitelist of allowed deep link targets or intent actions when configuring MaterialDrawer item actions.
* **Secure Data Passing:** Ensure secure methods are used to pass data needed for actions, avoiding reliance on easily manipulated sources when creating drawer items.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Transitive Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_transitive_dependencies.md)

**Description:** The `materialdrawer` library relies on other libraries, which may contain security vulnerabilities.

**How MaterialDrawer Contributes:** By including these dependencies, the application indirectly becomes susceptible to vulnerabilities present in those libraries, and these vulnerabilities can be exploited in the context of how `materialdrawer` utilizes those dependencies.

**Example:** A dependency used by `materialdrawer` for image loading has a known vulnerability that allows for remote code execution when processing a specially crafted image. If the application uses `materialdrawer` to display images from untrusted sources, this vulnerability could be exploited.

**Impact:** The application becomes vulnerable to exploits targeting the vulnerable dependency, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or other severe consequences.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Regularly Update MaterialDrawer:** Keep the `materialdrawer` library updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for vulnerabilities in its dependencies.
* **Dependency Scanning:** Utilize dependency scanning tools (like those integrated into Android Studio or standalone tools) to identify known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies, including those used by `materialdrawer`.
* **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories and vulnerability reports for the libraries your application uses, including `materialdrawer`'s dependencies.
* **Evaluate Dependency Usage:** Understand how `materialdrawer` uses its dependencies and whether your application's usage patterns could expose these vulnerabilities.
