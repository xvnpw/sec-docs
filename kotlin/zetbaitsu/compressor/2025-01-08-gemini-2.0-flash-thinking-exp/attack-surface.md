## Attack Surface: [Malicious Image Input Leading to Resource Exhaustion (Image Bomb)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_image_input_leading_to_resource_exhaustion__image_bomb_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted image file (similar to a zip bomb) that, when processed by the compression library, expands to an extremely large size in memory or on disk, potentially causing a denial-of-service (DoS).
    *   **How Compressor Contributes:** The library is responsible for decoding and processing the image data before compression. If it doesn't have safeguards against excessively large intermediate representations, it can be vulnerable to image bombs.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a seemingly small PNG file that, when decoded by the library, consumes gigabytes of RAM, causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, application crash, resource starvation affecting other application components or the entire system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement size limits on uploaded image files *before* passing to the compressor.
        *   Set resource limits (memory, CPU time) for the image processing operations performed by the compressor.
        *   Consider using libraries with built-in defenses against image bombs or implementing checks for unusually large decoded sizes *within the application's use of the compressor*.
        *   Monitor resource usage during image processing initiated by the compressor and implement alerts for abnormal consumption.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Underlying Image Processing Libraries](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_image_processing_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** The `compressor` library likely relies on other libraries for handling specific image formats (e.g., libjpeg, libpng). Vulnerabilities in these underlying libraries can be indirectly exploited through the `compressor`.
    *   **How Compressor Contributes:** By using these libraries, `compressor` directly exposes the application to any vulnerabilities present in them during its image processing tasks.
    *   **Example:** A known buffer overflow vulnerability exists in a specific version of libpng. If the `compressor` uses this vulnerable version, an attacker could craft a malicious PNG image that triggers the overflow *during the compressor's processing*, potentially leading to code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, depending on the specific vulnerability in the underlying library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the underlying vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a robust dependency management strategy. Regularly audit and update the `compressor` library and all its dependencies to the latest stable and patched versions.
        *   Use tools like Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to identify known vulnerabilities in the compressor's dependencies.
        *   Consider using containerization or sandboxing to limit the impact of potential exploits within the image processing environment *used by the compressor*.
