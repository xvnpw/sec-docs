# Threat Model Analysis for zetbaitsu/compressor

## Threat: [Injection via Insecure Compression Settings](./threats/injection_via_insecure_compression_settings.md)

**Description:** If the application allows users to configure compression settings that are directly passed to the underlying compression tools *through the `compressor` library's API or internal mechanisms*, an attacker could inject malicious commands. For example, if `compressor` exposes a way to pass arbitrary arguments to ffmpeg, they might inject arguments to execute shell commands.

**Impact:**  Remote code execution on the server, leading to full system compromise.

**Affected Component:**  `compressor`'s API or internal mechanisms for handling and passing compression configuration to underlying tools.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid allowing users to directly configure low-level compression settings through `compressor`.
* If configuration is necessary, provide a limited set of safe and predefined options within `compressor`'s API.
* Validate and sanitize any user-provided configuration values before passing them to `compressor` functions.
* Ensure `compressor`'s API does not allow for arbitrary command injection.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `compressor` Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__compressor__library_itself.md)

**Description:** The `zetbaitsu/compressor` library itself might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities in its code. These vulnerabilities could be exploited by providing specific input or by interacting with the library in a particular way.

**Impact:**  The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.

**Affected Component:**  The `compressor` library code.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical or High).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update the `compressor` library to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
* Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to the library.
* Consider contributing to or reviewing the `compressor` library's code for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Large File Processing by `compressor`](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_large_file_processing_by__compressor_.md)

**Description:** The `compressor` library's internal processing logic for handling large image or video files might be inefficient or vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks. An attacker could upload a large file that causes `compressor` to consume excessive CPU, memory, or disk I/O, leading to a denial-of-service.

**Impact:**  Application becomes unresponsive or crashes, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service. Can lead to financial losses and reputational damage.

**Affected Component:**  `compressor`'s core processing logic for image and video compression.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement file size limits *before* passing files to `compressor`.
* Implement timeouts for `compressor`'s processing functions.
* Consider using asynchronous processing or a queue to handle compression tasks, preventing blocking of the main application thread.
* Monitor server resources (CPU, memory) and implement alerts for high usage during `compressor` operations.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via `compressor`'s Output Handling](./threats/path_traversal_via__compressor_'s_output_handling.md)

**Description:** If the `compressor` library provides functionality to specify output paths and doesn't properly sanitize or validate these paths, an attacker could potentially manipulate the output path to write compressed files to unintended locations, potentially overwriting sensitive files or exposing them.

**Impact:**  Overwriting of critical system files leading to application instability or failure. Exposure of sensitive data if compressed files are written to publicly accessible directories.

**Affected Component:**  `compressor`'s API or internal mechanisms for handling output paths.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid using `compressor`'s functionality to directly specify user-controlled output paths.
* If `compressor` requires output path configuration, generate unique and sanitized output paths server-side before passing them to `compressor`.
* Enforce strict output directory restrictions and permissions at the operating system level.
