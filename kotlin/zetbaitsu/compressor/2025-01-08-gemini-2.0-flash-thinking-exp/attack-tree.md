## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Memory Corruption Vulnerability (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_memory_corruption_vulnerability__critical_node_.md)

*   Attackers can craft images with specific header structures or data that exploit buffer overflows or other memory corruption vulnerabilities within the compressor's image parsing or processing logic. This could lead to arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the overwritten memory.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Input Sanitization within Compressor (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_input_sanitization_within_compressor__critical_node_.md)

*   Attackers might try to inject malicious commands or scripts through image filenames or metadata (like EXIF data) if the compressor doesn't properly sanitize these inputs before using them in internal commands or file operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in GD Library (if used) (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_gd_library__if_used___critical_node_.md)

*   The `compressor` library might utilize the GD library for image manipulation. Known vulnerabilities in GD's image processing functions (e.g., in specific file format parsers) could be triggered by providing a specially crafted image.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Imagick (if used) (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_imagick__if_used___critical_node_.md)

*   If the `compressor` uses Imagick, vulnerabilities in Imagick's extensive image processing capabilities could be exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure File Handling (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_file_handling__high-risk_path_.md)

    *   **Path Traversal via Manipulated Filename (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):** If the application allows users to specify the input or output filename (directly or indirectly), an attacker could use ".." sequences in the filename to access or modify files outside the intended directory.
    *   **Local File Inclusion (LFI) via Manipulated Filename (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):** By manipulating the input filename, an attacker might be able to trick the compressor into processing a local malicious file (e.g., a PHP file containing malicious code).

## Attack Tree Path: [Inadequate Input Validation Before Compressor (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/inadequate_input_validation_before_compressor__high-risk_path_.md)

    *   **Upload Malicious File Disguised as Image (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):** Attackers might upload files containing malicious code (e.g., PHP scripts) with an image extension. If the application doesn't perform proper content-based validation before passing the file to the compressor, the malicious code might be executed if the output is later accessed.
