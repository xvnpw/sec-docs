## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Image Processing Logic](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_image_processing_logic.md)

* **Critical Node:** Exploit Vulnerabilities in Image Processing Logic
    * This represents the broad category of attacks targeting weaknesses in the image processing capabilities of the application, specifically through the `compressor` library's use of underlying libraries.
* **High-Risk Path:** Supply Malicious Image File --> Crafted Image Exploits Underlying Library Vulnerability (e.g., GD, Imagick) --> Trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE)
    * **Attack Vector:**
        * An attacker crafts a malicious image file specifically designed to exploit a known vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, integer overflow) in the underlying image processing library (like GD or Imagick) used by the `compressor` library.
        * When the application processes this malicious image using the `compressor` library, the vulnerable underlying library attempts to parse the image.
        * The crafted data within the image triggers the vulnerability, leading to memory corruption.
        * The attacker can leverage this memory corruption to inject and execute arbitrary code on the server, gaining full control.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit External Command Execution (If Enabled)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_external_command_execution__if_enabled_.md)

* **Critical Node:** Exploit External Command Execution (If Enabled)
    * This node highlights the risk associated with the `compressor` library potentially using external command-line tools for image processing.
* **High-Risk Path:** Exploit External Command Execution (If Enabled) --> Command Injection via External Tools --> Malicious Filename/Path Injection --> Execute Arbitrary System Commands
    * **Attack Vector:**
        * If the `compressor` library is configured to use external tools (e.g., `optipng`, `jpegoptim`), it might pass user-supplied input (like filenames or paths) as arguments to these external commands.
        * If this input is not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious commands into the filename or path.
        * When the `compressor` library executes the external tool, the injected commands are interpreted by the shell and executed on the server with the privileges of the web server process.
        * This allows the attacker to run arbitrary system commands, potentially leading to complete server compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. File System Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/3__file_system_manipulation.md)

* **Critical Nodes:** Overwrite Configuration Files, Overwrite Application Code
    * These nodes represent the severe consequences of an attacker gaining write access to critical files on the server.
* **High-Risk Path:** File System Manipulation --> Path Traversal Vulnerability --> Control Output Path to Overwrite Sensitive Files --> Overwrite Configuration Files
    * **Attack Vector:**
        * The application might allow users to (directly or indirectly) specify the output path for the compressed image.
        * If this input is not properly validated, an attacker can use path traversal techniques (e.g., `../../`) to manipulate the output path.
        * By crafting a malicious output path, the attacker can force the `compressor` library to write the compressed image (or potentially other malicious files) to arbitrary locations on the server.
        * Overwriting configuration files allows the attacker to change application settings, potentially granting administrative access, disabling security features, or redirecting application behavior.
* **High-Risk Path:** File System Manipulation --> Path Traversal Vulnerability --> Control Output Path to Overwrite Sensitive Files --> Overwrite Application Code
    * **Attack Vector:**
        * Similar to the previous path, the attacker exploits a path traversal vulnerability to control the output path.
        * Instead of overwriting configuration files, the attacker targets application code files.
        * By overwriting application code with malicious scripts or backdoors, the attacker can inject persistent malicious functionality into the application, allowing for long-term compromise and control.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_dependencies.md)

* **Critical Nodes:** Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies, Vulnerable Underlying Image Processing Libraries (GD, Imagick, etc.)
    * These nodes highlight the inherent risks of relying on external libraries, which can contain their own vulnerabilities.
* **High-Risk Path:** Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies --> Vulnerable Underlying Image Processing Libraries (GD, Imagick, etc.) --> Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies --> Trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE)
    * **Attack Vector:**
        * The `compressor` library relies on underlying image processing libraries like GD or Imagick.
        * These libraries are complex and can have known security vulnerabilities.
        * Attackers actively search for and exploit these vulnerabilities.
        * If the application uses a version of the underlying library with a known RCE vulnerability, an attacker can craft specific input (often a malicious image) that triggers this vulnerability during processing by the `compressor` library.
        * Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, gaining full control.
