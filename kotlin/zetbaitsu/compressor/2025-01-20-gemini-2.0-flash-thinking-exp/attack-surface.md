# Attack Surface Analysis for zetbaitsu/compressor

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Image Input](./attack_surfaces/malicious_image_input.md)

*   **Description:** The application processes user-provided image files using the `compressor` library. Maliciously crafted images can exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying image processing libraries used by `compressor`.
    *   **How Compressor Contributes:**  `compressor` acts as the entry point for processing these potentially malicious image files. It passes the image data to underlying libraries without necessarily performing its own deep security validation on the image format and content.
    *   **Example:** A user uploads a PNG file with a specially crafted header that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Pillow library (a common dependency for image processing in Python). When `compressor` processes this file, it triggers the vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (application crash), potential for arbitrary code execution on the server if the underlying library vulnerability allows it.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the underlying vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation on image files *before* passing them to the `compressor` library. This includes checking file headers, magic numbers, and potentially using dedicated image validation libraries.
        *   Keep the `compressor` library and its dependencies (like Pillow) updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using sandboxing or containerization to isolate the image processing operations, limiting the impact of a successful exploit.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The `compressor` library relies on other libraries (dependencies) for its functionality. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited if not properly managed.
    *   **How Compressor Contributes:** By including these dependencies, `compressor` indirectly introduces the attack surface of those libraries into the application. If a dependency has a vulnerability, any application using `compressor` is potentially affected.
    *   **Example:** The `compressor` library depends on an older version of a compression library that has a known remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted image that triggers the vulnerable code path within the dependency.
    *   **Impact:**  Wide range, from denial of service and information disclosure to arbitrary code execution, depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly audit the `compressor` library's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using security scanning tools.
        *   Keep the `compressor` library and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions.
        *   Utilize dependency management tools that provide vulnerability scanning and update recommendations.
        *   Consider using Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track and manage dependencies.
