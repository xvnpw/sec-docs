# Threat Model Analysis for zetbaitsu/compressor

## Threat: [Malicious Image Input leading to Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/malicious_image_input_leading_to_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted image file designed to exploit inefficiencies or vulnerabilities within the `compressor` library's image processing logic. When `compressor` attempts to process this image, it consumes excessive CPU and memory resources, leading to a slowdown or complete crash of the application. The vulnerability lies in how `compressor` handles certain image structures or encoding formats.
    *   **Impact:** Application becomes unavailable or unresponsive, impacting legitimate users. Server resources may be exhausted, potentially affecting other applications on the same server.
    *   **Affected Component:** `compressor` library's image decoding and processing modules (potentially within its own code or triggered through its use of underlying libraries).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement input validation to check image dimensions and file size *before* passing to `compressor`, although this might not catch all DoS vectors within the processing itself.
        *   Set resource limits (e.g., memory limits, CPU time limits) specifically for the `compressor` processing.
        *   Implement request timeouts to prevent long-running `compressor` operations from blocking resources.
        *   Consider using a separate process or container with resource constraints for `compressor` operations.

## Threat: [Malicious Image Input leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/malicious_image_input_leading_to_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a carefully crafted image file that exploits a vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, integer overflow) within the image processing libraries directly used by `compressor` (like Pillow), or potentially within `compressor`'s own code if it performs unsafe operations on image data. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application. The vulnerability resides in how `compressor` or its direct dependencies parse and process specific image formats or header information.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to steal data, install malware, or pivot to other systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** `compressor` library's image decoding and processing modules, specifically vulnerabilities within its own code or its direct dependencies (e.g., Pillow) as used by `compressor`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `compressor` and its direct dependencies (especially Pillow) updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   While input validation can help, RCE vulnerabilities often bypass simple checks. Focus on keeping dependencies updated.
        *   Run the application in a sandboxed environment or with restricted privileges to limit the impact of successful exploitation.
        *   Employ static and dynamic analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in `compressor` and its dependencies.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow/Underflow during Image Processing leading to Exploitation](./threats/integer_overflowunderflow_during_image_processing_leading_to_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** A maliciously crafted image could contain header values that, when processed by `compressor` or its underlying image libraries, lead to integer overflow or underflow conditions. This can cause memory corruption or other unexpected behavior that an attacker could leverage to gain control of the application or server. The vulnerability lies in how `compressor` or its dependencies handle calculations related to image dimensions, buffer sizes, or other image properties.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, unexpected behavior, or potentially RCE if the memory corruption is exploitable.
    *   **Affected Component:** `compressor` library's image decoding and processing modules, specifically within its own code or its direct dependencies (e.g., Pillow) as used by `compressor`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `compressor` and its dependencies updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that address integer handling issues.
        *   While difficult to implement at the application level for library internals, understanding the underlying libraries' limitations can inform usage patterns.
        *   Consider using libraries with robust error handling and built-in protection against common integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities.
