# Attack Surface Analysis for zetbaitsu/compressor

## Attack Surface: [Decompression Bomb (Zip Bomb/Gzip Bomb) Vulnerability](./attack_surfaces/decompression_bomb__zip_bombgzip_bomb__vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:**  Processing maliciously crafted compressed files that expand to an extremely large size upon decompression, leading to resource exhaustion.
    *   **Compressor Contribution:** The `compressor` library's core function is decompression. It directly handles the processing of compressed data, making it the component that triggers the decompression bomb vulnerability when processing malicious files.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a small (e.g., 100KB) zip bomb file to an application endpoint. The application uses `compressor` to decompress this file. Upon decompression, the file expands to gigabytes, rapidly consuming server memory and CPU, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Resource Exhaustion (CPU, Memory, Disk Space), Application Crash, Server Unresponsiveness.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Size Limits:** Implement and enforce maximum file size limits for uploaded compressed files *before* they are processed by `compressor`.
        *   **Decompression Ratio Limits:**  Monitor the ratio between the decompressed size and the original compressed size. Abort the decompression process immediately if this ratio exceeds a predefined, safe threshold (e.g., 10:1, 100:1). This is crucial for detecting and preventing decompression bombs.
        *   **Resource Quotas and Limits:**  Configure resource quotas and limits (CPU time, memory usage) for the processes that perform decompression using `compressor`. Operating system level controls or containerization can be used for this.
        *   **Streaming Decompression:** Utilize streaming decompression techniques where possible to avoid loading the entire decompressed output into memory at once. This can help mitigate memory exhaustion.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically focusing on the application's handling of compressed data and the integration with `compressor`.

## Attack Surface: [Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries](./attack_surfaces/memory_corruption_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_libraries.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or heap overflows within the underlying compression libraries (used by Go's standard library and consequently by `compressor`) can be triggered by maliciously crafted compressed data.
    *   **Compressor Contribution:** `compressor` relies on Go's standard library packages for decompression (like `gzip`, `zlib`, `flate`). If these underlying libraries have memory corruption vulnerabilities, `compressor`, by using them, indirectly exposes the application to these risks when processing compressed data.
    *   **Example:** A specially crafted gzip file is designed to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in the zlib library (used by Go's `gzip` package). When `compressor` attempts to decompress this file, it triggers the buffer overflow. This could lead to application crashes, unexpected behavior, or potentially, in more severe scenarios, remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Application Crash, Unexpected Behavior, Data Corruption, Potential Remote Code Execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical depending on the specific vulnerability and exploitability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Updates and Management:**  Keep Go dependencies, including the standard library, updated to the latest versions. Regularly update Go itself to benefit from security patches and bug fixes in the standard library's compression packages.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Implement automated vulnerability scanning tools that can detect known vulnerabilities in Go dependencies, including the standard library components used by `compressor`.
        *   **Stay Informed on Security Advisories:**  Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to Go and its standard library, particularly concerning compression libraries. Apply security patches promptly.
        *   **Consider Sandboxing/Isolation:** For high-security environments, consider running decompression processes in sandboxed or isolated environments. This can limit the potential impact if a memory corruption vulnerability is exploited.
