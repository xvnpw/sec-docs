## Attack Tree Visualization



## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via zetbaitsu/compressor Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_zetbaitsucompressor_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** This is the overarching goal. Attackers aim to leverage any weakness in `zetbaitsu/compressor` or its usage to compromise the application. This can be achieved through various means detailed below.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious Image Upload (Image Parsing Exploits):**
        *   Attackers upload specially crafted image files (e.g., JPEG, PNG, GIF) designed to trigger vulnerabilities in the image parsing libraries used by `zetbaitsu/compressor` or its dependencies.
        *   These vulnerabilities can include:
            *   **Buffer Overflows:** Overloading buffers during image processing, potentially overwriting memory and leading to code execution.
            *   **Integer Overflows:** Causing integer overflows during size calculations, leading to unexpected behavior or memory corruption.
            *   **Heap Overflows:** Corrupting the heap memory during image processing, potentially leading to code execution.
    *   **Use of Vulnerable Image Parsing Libraries (Dependencies):**
        *   Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the image parsing libraries that `zetbaitsu/compressor` depends on (e.g., libraries for JPEG, PNG, GIF processing).
        *   They leverage publicly available exploits or develop their own to target these CVEs.
        *   Attack vectors involve uploading images that trigger the specific vulnerable code paths in these libraries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__rce___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Successful exploitation of input handling vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, heap overflows, or known CVEs in image parsing libraries can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   Attackers can inject and execute arbitrary code on the server by carefully crafting malicious images that exploit these memory corruption vulnerabilities.
    *   RCE allows attackers to gain full control over the server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Use of Vulnerable Image Parsing Libraries (Dependencies) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/use_of_vulnerable_image_parsing_libraries__dependencies___high_risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Identify and Exploit Known CVEs in Dependencies (e.g., libjpeg, libpng, etc.) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/identify_and_exploit_known_cves_in_dependencies__e_g___libjpeg__libpng__etc____high_risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve RCE [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_rce__high_risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Image Bomb/Zip Bomb Style Attacks (DoS) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/image_bombzip_bomb_style_attacks__dos___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Attackers upload extremely large or complex image files (Image Bombs) that are designed to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) during the compression process.
    *   These images are often crafted to have a very high compression ratio or require intensive processing, leading to resource exhaustion.
    *   This can cause Denial of Service (DoS) by making the application unresponsive or unavailable to legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exhaust Server Resources (CPU, Memory, Disk I/O) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exhaust_server_resources__cpu__memory__disk_io___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector here is the crafted Image Bomb itself.
    *   When the application attempts to process and compress the Image Bomb using `zetbaitsu/compressor`, the library will consume excessive resources trying to handle the complex or large image.
    *   This resource exhaustion is the direct mechanism that leads to the DoS condition.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Application Unavailability [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/cause_application_unavailability__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   As server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) are exhausted by processing Image Bombs, the application's performance degrades significantly.
    *   Eventually, the application may become unresponsive, crash, or be unable to handle legitimate user requests, resulting in application unavailability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   `zetbaitsu/compressor` relies on external libraries (dependencies) for image processing tasks.
    *   These dependencies may contain known security vulnerabilities (CVEs).
    *   Attackers can identify outdated or vulnerable dependencies used by `zetbaitsu/compressor` by using dependency scanning tools or checking public vulnerability databases.
    *   Once vulnerable dependencies are identified, attackers can exploit known CVEs in these libraries to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Dependencies Used by `zetbaitsu/compressor` [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_dependencies_used_by__zetbaitsucompressor___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is the presence of vulnerable libraries within the dependency tree of `zetbaitsu/compressor`.
    *   Common vulnerable dependencies in image processing contexts are often related to libraries like `libjpeg`, `libpng`, `giflib`, etc.
    *   Attackers focus on exploiting vulnerabilities within these specific libraries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Outdated or Vulnerable Dependencies [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/identify_outdated_or_vulnerable_dependencies__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Attackers use automated tools (dependency scanners) or manual methods to analyze the dependencies of `zetbaitsu/compressor`.
    *   They compare the versions of used libraries against public vulnerability databases (like CVE databases) to identify outdated or vulnerable components.
    *   This identification step is crucial for targeting known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known CVEs in Dependencies [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_cves_in_dependencies__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Once vulnerable dependencies and their CVEs are identified, attackers search for publicly available exploits or develop their own.
    *   They craft attacks that leverage these known CVEs to target the application.
    *   This often involves sending specific inputs (e.g., malicious images) that trigger the vulnerable code paths in the outdated dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfiguration/Misuse of Compressor in Application](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurationmisuse_of_compressor_in_application.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Even if `zetbaitsu/compressor` itself is secure, misconfigurations or improper usage within the application can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   This category focuses on how the application *uses* the compressor, rather than vulnerabilities *within* the compressor code itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure File Storage of Compressed Images [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_file_storage_of_compressed_images__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   If the application stores compressed images in a publicly accessible location (e.g., a publicly accessible cloud storage bucket or web directory), attackers can directly access these images without authorization.
    *   This leads to information disclosure if the compressed images contain sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Publicly Accessible Storage Location [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/publicly_accessible_storage_location__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The misconfiguration of the storage location itself is the attack vector.
    *   This can be due to incorrect permissions settings on cloud storage, misconfigured web server directories, or other access control failures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unauthorized Access to Compressed Images (Information Disclosure) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/unauthorized_access_to_compressed_images__information_disclosure___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Attackers simply access the publicly accessible storage location using standard web browsers or tools.
    *   They can list directory contents or directly request image files if they know the file names or paths.
    *   This results in unauthorized access and potential information disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Input Validation Before Compressor [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_input_validation_before_compressor__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   If the application fails to validate user-provided input (e.g., uploaded image files) *before* passing it to `zetbaitsu/compressor`, it becomes vulnerable to all input handling attacks that the compressor or its dependencies might be susceptible to.
    *   This lack of validation acts as a multiplier, amplifying the risk of all input-related vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Passes Unvalidated User Input Directly to Compressor [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/application_passes_unvalidated_user_input_directly_to_compressor__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The application code directly takes user-provided image data and feeds it into the `zetbaitsu/compressor` library without performing any checks or sanitization.
    *   This direct passthrough of unvalidated input is the core attack vector, exposing the compressor to potentially malicious data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Application to all Input Handling Vulnerabilities (above) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/expose_application_to_all_input_handling_vulnerabilities__above___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   By passing unvalidated input, the application becomes vulnerable to all the input handling attack vectors described earlier (Malicious Image Upload, Image Parsing Exploits, etc.).
    *   The lack of input validation essentially removes a crucial security layer, making the application directly susceptible to these attacks.
