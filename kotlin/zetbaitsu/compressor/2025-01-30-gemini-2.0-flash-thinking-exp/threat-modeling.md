# Threat Model Analysis for zetbaitsu/compressor

## Threat: [Decompression Bomb (Zip Bomb/Image Bomb)](./threats/decompression_bomb__zip_bombimage_bomb_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads or provides a specially crafted image file that is small in size but expands to an extremely large size when decompressed by the `compressor` library's decompression module. The attacker aims to exhaust server resources by triggering excessive decompression.
    *   **Impact:** Server overload, application slowdown, service unavailability for legitimate users, potential server crash due to memory exhaustion or disk space filling up.
    *   **Affected Component:** Decompression module within the `compressor` library, specifically image decoding functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict file size limits for uploaded images.
        *   Validate image dimensions before decompression to prevent excessively large images.
        *   Set resource limits (memory and CPU quotas) for the image processing service.
        *   Implement timeout mechanisms for decompression operations.
        *   Consider using streaming decompression if supported.
        *   Employ dedicated image processing services with DoS protection.

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow/Underflow in Image Processing](./threats/buffer_overflowunderflow_in_image_processing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious image file that exploits buffer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities in the underlying image decoding or compression/decompression libraries used by `zetbaitsu/compressor`. By sending this malicious image for processing, the attacker could potentially overwrite memory and gain control of the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data breach, complete system takeover, loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
    *   **Affected Component:** Underlying image processing libraries used by `compressor` (e.g., libraries for JPEG, PNG, GIF handling), and potentially `compressor`'s wrapper code if vulnerabilities exist there.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Crucially:** Regularly update the `zetbaitsu/compressor` library and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement robust input validation to reject malformed or suspicious image files before processing.
        *   Consider using sandboxed environments or containerization for image processing to limit the impact of potential exploits.
        *   Employ static and dynamic analysis tools to scan the `compressor` library and its dependencies for vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The `zetbaitsu/compressor` library relies on other Go packages and potentially external libraries. These dependencies might contain known security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities indirectly through the `compressor` library if the application uses vulnerable versions of dependencies.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability in the dependency, but could range from information disclosure, denial of service, to remote code execution, potentially leading to server compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Dependencies of the `zetbaitsu/compressor` library, including both direct and transitive dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Essential:** Regularly scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `govulncheck` or similar dependency scanning tools.
        *   Keep dependencies up-to-date by regularly updating the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files and rebuilding the application.
        *   Carefully review dependency licenses and security policies before including them in the project.
        *   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) as part of the development pipeline to continuously monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities.
