# Threat Model Analysis for zetbaitsu/compressor

## Threat: [Decompression Bomb (Zip Bomb)](./threats/decompression_bomb__zip_bomb_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a highly compressed archive (e.g., a small file that expands to petabytes) and provides it as input to the `zetbaitsu/compressor` library's decompression functions.  The library, lacking sufficient safeguards, attempts to decompress the entire archive, consuming excessive resources (memory, CPU, disk space) and leading to a denial-of-service condition. The vulnerability lies in the library's *failure to limit resource consumption during decompression*.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). The application becomes unresponsive or crashes, preventing legitimate users from accessing it.  Potentially, the entire server could become unstable.
*   **Affected Component:** Decompression functions within the library. Specifically, any function that reads and expands compressed data, such as `decompress()`, `decompress_stream()`, or similar functions, depending on the specific API. The core decompression algorithm implementation (e.g., Deflate, zlib, bzip2) is directly involved.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Maximum Decompressed Size Limit (Library-Level):** The `zetbaitsu/compressor` library *should* implement a hard limit on the maximum allowed size of data *after* decompression. This limit should be enforced *before* any significant decompression occurs.  This is a *critical* library-level responsibility.
    *   **Decompression Ratio Limit (Library-Level):** The library should calculate the compression ratio and reject files exceeding a threshold.
    *   **Staged Decompression (Library-Level):** The library should decompress data in small, fixed-size chunks, checking resource usage after each chunk.
    *   **Resource Monitoring (Library/Application):** The library (or the application using it) should continuously monitor resource usage and terminate decompression if limits are exceeded.
    *   **Timeout (Library/Application):**  A timeout should be enforced for the entire decompression operation.

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Decompression Vulnerability](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via_decompression_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, format string vulnerability, integer overflow) exists within the `zetbaitsu/compressor` library's decompression logic (or in a compression library it depends on, like zlib). An attacker crafts a malicious compressed payload that exploits this vulnerability. When `zetbaitsu/compressor` attempts to decompress the payload, the attacker's code is executed, potentially giving them full control. This is a *direct* vulnerability in the library's code.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete system compromise. The attacker could gain full control, steal data, install malware, or use the compromised system for further attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** The specific decompression function(s) containing the vulnerability. This could be within the core decompression algorithm implementation (e.g., a bug in the zlib library) or in the wrapper code provided by `zetbaitsu/compressor`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep the Library Updated:** This is paramount. Regularly update `zetbaitsu/compressor` *and* its underlying compression libraries to the latest versions. Security patches are frequently released to address such vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency manager to ensure you're using the latest patched versions of all dependencies.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Employ vulnerability scanners to automatically detect known vulnerabilities in your dependencies, including `zetbaitsu/compressor`.
    *   **Sandboxing (Application-Level, but mitigates library flaws):** Run the decompression process in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
    *   **Code Review (of the Library):** If feasible, conduct a security-focused code review of the `zetbaitsu/compressor` library's source code, especially the decompression functions.
    *   **Fuzzing (of the Library):** Use fuzzing to test the decompression functions with malformed inputs, helping to uncover hidden vulnerabilities.
    * **Use Memory Safe Language (For Library Developers):** If you are contributing to or maintaining `zetbaitsu/compressor`, consider using memory-safe languages like Rust.
