# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for zetbaitsu/compressor

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Decompressed Size (Progressive Check within `compressor`)](./mitigation_strategies/limit_decompressed_size__progressive_check_within__compressor__.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Integrate with `compressor`:**  Ideally, this check should be integrated *within* the `zetbaitsu/compressor` library itself, or through a very tightly coupled wrapper. This ensures the check happens as early as possible in the decompression process.
2.  **Chunk-Based Decompression:**  The `compressor` library (or the wrapper) should be configured or modified to decompress data in chunks.  This might involve using a streaming API or manually managing buffers.
3.  **Size Check After Each Chunk:** After each chunk is decompressed, the `compressor` (or wrapper) should check the *cumulative* decompressed size against the predetermined limit.
4.  **Immediate Termination:** If the limit is exceeded, the `compressor` should immediately stop further decompression, release any allocated resources, and raise an exception or return an error code.  It should *not* return any partially decompressed data to the calling application.
5.  **Configuration Option (Ideal):** The best approach would be if `zetbaitsu/compressor` provided a configuration option to set a maximum decompressed size, handling the chunking and checks internally.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Compression Bombs (DoS):** *Severity: High*. Prevents resource exhaustion.
*   **Excessive Memory Consumption (DoS):** *Severity: High*. Limits memory usage.

**Impact:**
*   **Compression Bombs (DoS):** Risk reduced from *High* to *Very Low*.
*   **Excessive Memory Consumption (DoS):** Risk reduced from *High* to *Low*.

**Currently Implemented:**  Assuming `zetbaitsu/compressor` does *not* have built-in support for this, it's likely not implemented.

**Missing Implementation:**  This requires either modifying `zetbaitsu/compressor` directly (if open-source and feasible), creating a wrapper around it that manages the chunking and size checks, or requesting this feature from the library maintainers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Algorithm Restriction (Configuration within `compressor`)](./mitigation_strategies/algorithm_restriction__configuration_within__compressor__.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Whitelist Approach:** Configure `zetbaitsu/compressor` to *only* allow a specific set of whitelisted compression algorithms.  This is the most secure approach.
2.  **Configuration Mechanism:** Use the library's provided configuration mechanism (if any) to specify the allowed algorithms. This might involve a list of allowed algorithm names, constants, or a configuration file.
3.  **Disable Custom Compressors (If Applicable):** If `zetbaitsu/compressor` allows users to define custom compression algorithms, *disable* this feature unless absolutely necessary and rigorously controlled. Custom compressors introduce significant security risks.
4.  **Error Handling:** Ensure that if the application attempts to use an unsupported algorithm, `zetbaitsu/compressor` raises a clear exception or returns an error.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Excessive CPU Consumption (DoS):** *Severity: Medium*. By restricting to less computationally intensive algorithms.
*   **Vulnerabilities in Specific Algorithms:** *Severity: Variable*. Eliminates the risk from known vulnerabilities in disallowed algorithms.

**Impact:**
*   **Excessive CPU Consumption (DoS):** Risk reduction depends on the algorithms restricted (Low to Medium).
*   **Vulnerabilities in Specific Algorithms:** Risk reduced to *Very Low* for the disallowed algorithms.

**Currently Implemented:**  Likely not implemented; the application probably uses the library's default settings, allowing all supported algorithms.

**Missing Implementation:**  Requires configuring `zetbaitsu/compressor` (through its API or configuration files) to restrict the allowed algorithms.  The specific implementation depends on how the library handles configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [CPU Time Limit (Integration with `compressor` - if possible)](./mitigation_strategies/cpu_time_limit__integration_with__compressor__-_if_possible_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Ideal Integration:** The *ideal* scenario is if `zetbaitsu/compressor` provides a built-in mechanism to set a CPU time limit for decompression operations. This would be the most reliable and efficient approach.
2.  **Wrapper with Timeouts (If Necessary):** If the library doesn't offer built-in timeouts, a wrapper function could be created. This wrapper would:
    *   Start a timer before calling `zetbaitsu/compressor`'s decompression function.
    *   Call the decompression function.
    *   Periodically check the elapsed time (using a separate thread or asynchronous checks, if possible, to avoid blocking the main thread).
    *   If the time limit is exceeded, attempt to *forcefully* terminate the decompression process. This might involve using signals, killing a subprocess, or other OS-specific mechanisms.  This is the *least* reliable part, as forcefully terminating a library might lead to instability.
3. **Configuration (Ideal):** If built-in, a configuration option within `zetbaitsu/compressor` would be used to set the time limit.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Excessive CPU Consumption (DoS):** *Severity: Medium*.

**Impact:**
*   **Excessive CPU Consumption (DoS):** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.

**Currently Implemented:**  Highly unlikely to be implemented directly within `zetbaitsu/compressor`.  A wrapper might exist, but it's probably not robust.

**Missing Implementation:**  Requires either a feature request to the `zetbaitsu/compressor` maintainers for built-in time limits or the creation of a robust wrapper function that handles timeouts and (attempts to) safely terminate the decompression process. The wrapper approach is significantly more complex and potentially less reliable.
