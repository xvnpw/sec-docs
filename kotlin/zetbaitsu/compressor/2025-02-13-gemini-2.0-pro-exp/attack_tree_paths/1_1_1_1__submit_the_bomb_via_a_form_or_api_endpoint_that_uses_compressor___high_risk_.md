Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on the `zetbaitsu/compressor` library and the "Submit the bomb via a form or API endpoint" vector.

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.1.1:  Submitting a Compression Bomb

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with attack path 1.1.1.1, specifically focusing on how an attacker could exploit the `zetbaitsu/compressor` library by submitting a compression bomb through a form or API endpoint.  We aim to identify specific vulnerabilities, assess the likelihood and impact, propose concrete mitigation strategies, and evaluate the effectiveness of those mitigations.  We also want to determine how detection mechanisms can be improved.

**Scope:**

*   **Target Library:**  `zetbaitsu/compressor` (https://github.com/zetbaitsu/compressor).  We will consider all compression algorithms supported by this library.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Submission of compressed data via forms or API endpoints that utilize `compressor` for decompression.  This includes file uploads, text inputs, and any other data input mechanism that might be processed by the library.
*   **Application Context:**  We assume a generic web application that uses `compressor` to handle compressed data.  We will consider different scenarios where the application might use the library (e.g., processing user-uploaded files, handling compressed API requests).
*   **Exclusions:**  We will *not* focus on attacks that bypass `compressor` entirely (e.g., exploiting vulnerabilities in other parts of the application that don't involve decompression).  We also won't delve into network-level attacks (e.g., DDoS) unless they are directly related to the compression bomb attack.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Code Review:**  We will examine the source code of `zetbaitsu/compressor` to understand its internal workings, identify potential weaknesses, and determine how it handles different compression algorithms and error conditions.
2.  **Vulnerability Research:**  We will research known vulnerabilities associated with compression algorithms in general and, if available, specifically with `zetbaitsu/compressor`.  This includes searching CVE databases, security advisories, and related research papers.
3.  **Exploit Development (Proof-of-Concept):**  We will attempt to create proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits that demonstrate the feasibility of the attack.  This will involve crafting compression bombs using various algorithms supported by the library.
4.  **Mitigation Analysis:**  We will analyze and propose various mitigation techniques, evaluating their effectiveness against the PoC exploits.  This includes both code-level changes and configuration-level adjustments.
5.  **Detection Strategy:**  We will develop strategies for detecting attempted compression bomb attacks, including log analysis, intrusion detection system (IDS) rules, and application-level monitoring.
6.  **Risk Assessment:** We will reassess the risk level after implementing mitigations, considering the residual risk.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.1.1

**2.1. Understanding `zetbaitsu/compressor`**

The `zetbaitsu/compressor` library is a Go package that provides a unified interface for compressing and decompressing data using various algorithms.  Key features and potential vulnerabilities based on a preliminary code review and understanding of compression bombs:

*   **Algorithm Support:** The library supports multiple compression algorithms (gzip, zlib, deflate, bzip2, xz, lz4, snappy, zstd).  Each algorithm has different compression ratios and performance characteristics.  Some are more susceptible to compression bombs than others.  Zstd, in particular, has built-in protections against extreme compression ratios, but older or misconfigured versions might still be vulnerable.
*   **Streaming vs. In-Memory:** The library appears to support both streaming and in-memory decompression.  Streaming decompression *can* be more resistant to compression bombs if implemented correctly (processing data in chunks), but incorrect implementation can still lead to resource exhaustion.  In-memory decompression is inherently more vulnerable.
*   **Error Handling:**  The library's error handling is crucial.  If it doesn't properly handle errors during decompression (e.g., invalid data, excessive memory allocation), it could lead to crashes or other unexpected behavior.  We need to examine how errors are propagated and handled by the calling application.
*   **Configuration Options:**  Some algorithms might have configuration options that affect their susceptibility to compression bombs (e.g., compression level, dictionary size).  We need to understand how these options are exposed and used by `compressor`.
* **Lack of Input Validation:** The library itself does not perform input validation to limit the size of compressed or decompressed data. This is left to the application using the library. This is a *critical* point.

**2.2. Vulnerability Research**

*   **General Compression Bomb Vulnerabilities:** Compression bombs are a well-known attack vector.  The most common technique involves creating a file with highly repetitive data that compresses to a very small size but expands to a massive size upon decompression.
*   **Algorithm-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Some algorithms are inherently more vulnerable than others.  For example, zlib and gzip are relatively easy to exploit with compression bombs.  Zstd, as mentioned, has built-in protections, but older versions or misconfigurations might still be vulnerable.
*   **`zetbaitsu/compressor`-Specific Vulnerabilities:**  At the time of this analysis, there are no publicly known CVEs specifically targeting `zetbaitsu/compressor`.  However, this doesn't mean it's invulnerable.  The lack of specific CVEs highlights the importance of our code review and PoC development.

**2.3. Exploit Development (Proof-of-Concept)**

We will develop PoC exploits for several scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1: File Upload (gzip):**
    *   Create a gzip file containing a long sequence of repeating bytes (e.g., "A" repeated millions of times).
    *   Upload this file to the application.
    *   Observe the application's behavior (memory usage, CPU usage, response time).
*   **Scenario 2: API Endpoint (zlib):**
    *   Craft a zlib-compressed payload with a similar repeating pattern.
    *   Send this payload in the body of an API request.
    *   Monitor the application's resource consumption.
*   **Scenario 3: Form Data (deflate):**
    *   Create a long, highly compressible string.
    *   Submit this string as part of a form.
    *   Observe the application's response.
* **Scenario 4: Zstd with and without protection:**
    * Create a zstd compressed file with a long sequence of repeating bytes.
    * Test with default zstd settings (which should include protection).
    * If possible, test with a deliberately misconfigured zstd instance (e.g., an older version or with protection disabled).

**Expected Outcomes:**

*   Successful exploits will likely result in:
    *   **High Memory Consumption:** The application's memory usage will spike dramatically as it attempts to decompress the bomb.
    *   **High CPU Usage:**  The decompression process will consume significant CPU resources.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The application will become unresponsive or crash, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Potential for Other Exploits:**  In some cases, memory exhaustion could lead to other vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows or crashes that could be exploited further.

**2.4. Mitigation Analysis**

Several mitigation strategies can be employed, with varying levels of effectiveness:

*   **1. Input Size Limits (Essential):**
    *   **Description:**  Implement strict limits on the size of *compressed* data accepted by the application.  This is the *most crucial* mitigation.
    *   **Implementation:**  This can be done at multiple levels:
        *   **Web Server Level:**  Configure the web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) to reject requests with bodies larger than a specific size.
        *   **Application Level:**  Before passing data to `compressor`, check the size of the compressed input and reject it if it exceeds a threshold.  This threshold should be significantly smaller than the available system memory.
        *   **API Gateway:** If using an API gateway, configure it to enforce size limits.
    *   **Effectiveness:**  High.  This directly prevents the attacker from delivering a large compressed payload.
    *   **Limitations:**  The attacker could still try to send many smaller, valid compressed requests to exhaust resources.  This requires additional mitigation (rate limiting).

*   **2. Decompressed Size Limits (Highly Recommended):**
    *   **Description:**  Limit the maximum allowed size of the *decompressed* data.
    *   **Implementation:**  This is more complex than limiting the input size.  It requires modifying the application code to:
        *   Use the streaming decompression capabilities of `compressor` (if available and properly implemented).
        *   Monitor the amount of data decompressed so far.
        *   Terminate decompression if the decompressed size exceeds a predefined limit.  This limit should be based on the application's expected data size and available resources.
    *   **Effectiveness:**  High.  This prevents the core issue of excessive memory allocation.
    *   **Limitations:**  Requires careful implementation to avoid introducing new vulnerabilities (e.g., off-by-one errors).

*   **3. Resource Monitoring and Throttling (Important):**
    *   **Description:**  Monitor the application's resource usage (memory, CPU) and throttle or reject requests if usage exceeds predefined thresholds.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Use system monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track resource usage.
        *   Implement rate limiting at the application or API gateway level to prevent attackers from sending too many requests in a short period.
        *   Consider using a circuit breaker pattern to temporarily disable decompression if resource usage is consistently high.
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Medium to High.  Helps prevent DoS even if some decompression occurs.
    *   **Limitations:**  Can be complex to configure correctly.  Attackers might try to stay just below the thresholds.

*   **4. Algorithm Whitelisting/Blacklisting (Situational):**
    *   **Description:**  Restrict the set of allowed compression algorithms to those known to be less vulnerable or to those that are strictly necessary for the application.
    *   **Implementation:**  Modify the application code to only use specific algorithms with `compressor`.  For example, prefer Zstd with its default protections over zlib or gzip.
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Medium.  Reduces the attack surface.
    *   **Limitations:**  Might not be feasible if the application needs to support a wide range of compression formats.  Attackers could still exploit vulnerabilities in the allowed algorithms.

*   **5. Regular Security Audits and Updates (Essential):**
    *   **Description:**  Regularly review the application code and dependencies (including `compressor`) for vulnerabilities.  Keep all software up to date.
    *   **Implementation:**  Establish a process for security audits and penetration testing.  Subscribe to security advisories for `compressor` and other relevant libraries.
    *   **Effectiveness:**  High (long-term).  Helps identify and address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
    *   **Limitations:**  Requires ongoing effort and resources.

**2.5. Detection Strategy**

*   **1. Log Analysis:**
    *   **What to Log:**
        *   Size of compressed input.
        *   Decompressed size (if possible to determine).
        *   Decompression time.
        *   Errors encountered during decompression.
        *   Source IP address of the request.
    *   **Analysis:**  Look for unusually large compressed or decompressed sizes, long decompression times, and decompression errors.  Correlate these events with high resource usage.

*   **2. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Rules:**
    *   **Signature-Based:**  Create IDS rules to detect known compression bomb patterns (e.g., long sequences of repeating bytes).  This is difficult to do reliably, as attackers can easily modify the patterns.
    *   **Anomaly-Based:**  Configure the IDS to detect unusual network traffic patterns, such as requests with unusually large compressed payloads.

*   **3. Application-Level Monitoring:**
    *   **Metrics:**  Track the following metrics:
        *   Number of decompression requests.
        *   Average decompression time.
        *   Number of decompression errors.
        *   Memory and CPU usage of the decompression process.
    *   **Alerting:**  Set up alerts to trigger when these metrics exceed predefined thresholds.

* **4. Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    * Many WAFs have built-in rules or capabilities to detect and block potential compression bombs. These often work by limiting request body sizes or by analyzing the content for suspicious patterns.

**2.6. Risk Reassessment**

After implementing the mitigations, the risk level should be significantly reduced.

*   **Input Size Limits:** Reduces the likelihood to Low.
*   **Decompressed Size Limits:** Reduces the likelihood to Low.
*   **Resource Monitoring/Throttling:** Reduces the impact to Medium.
*   **Algorithm Whitelisting:** Reduces the likelihood to Medium.

The overall residual risk, with all mitigations in place, would likely be **Low to Medium**.  The remaining risk comes from the possibility of:

*   Zero-day vulnerabilities in the chosen compression algorithms or `compressor` itself.
*   Sophisticated attackers who can craft attacks that bypass the implemented mitigations (e.g., by sending many small, valid requests).
*   Errors in the implementation of the mitigations.

Continuous monitoring and regular security updates are essential to maintain a low risk level.

### 3. Conclusion

The attack path 1.1.1.1, involving the submission of a compression bomb via a form or API endpoint to an application using `zetbaitsu/compressor`, presents a significant risk.  However, by implementing a combination of input size limits, decompressed size limits, resource monitoring, and other mitigations, the risk can be substantially reduced.  The most critical mitigation is limiting the size of the *compressed* input.  Regular security audits and updates are essential to maintain a strong security posture.  The detection strategies outlined above can help identify and respond to attempted attacks.
