# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.1 (Craft Highly Compressed Archive)

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the threat posed by an attacker crafting a highly compressed archive (a "zip bomb" or "decompression bomb") specifically targeting applications using the `zetbaitsu/compressor` library.  We aim to identify vulnerabilities, potential impacts, and effective mitigation strategies related to this specific attack vector.  This analysis will inform development decisions and security best practices.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on attack path 1.1.1: "Craft a highly compressed archive that expands to an enormous size."  We will consider:

*   **Target Library:**  `zetbaitsu/compressor` (https://github.com/zetbaitsu/compressor).  We assume the application uses this library for decompression operations.  We will *not* analyze other compression libraries.
*   **Attack Goal:**  Resource exhaustion (primarily disk space and potentially memory/CPU) leading to denial of service (DoS).  We are *not* considering code execution or data exfiltration in *this* specific analysis (though those could be *subsequent* goals of a broader attack).
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  We assume the attacker has the ability to:
    *   Craft malicious archives.
    *   Deliver the archive to the application (e.g., via file upload, network transfer, etc. - this is covered in *other* parts of the attack tree, but is a prerequisite).
    *   Understand basic compression principles.
* **Supported Formats:** Investigate the library's supported compression formats (e.g., ZIP, GZIP, Brotli, etc.) and how each might be exploited.
* **Library Version:** Analysis will be performed against the latest stable version of `zetbaitsu/compressor` at the time of this writing. If specific version vulnerabilities are known, they will be noted.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the `zetbaitsu/compressor` source code to identify:
    *   Decompression logic.
    *   Resource allocation mechanisms (memory buffers, temporary file handling).
    *   Error handling and exception management related to decompression.
    *   Any existing safeguards against decompression bombs (size limits, recursion limits, etc.).
2.  **Experimentation:**  Create various types of compressed archives (using different algorithms and techniques) and test their behavior with the library.  This includes:
    *   **Benchmarking:** Measure resource consumption (CPU, memory, disk I/O, disk space) during decompression.
    *   **Fuzzing:**  Provide slightly malformed or edge-case archives to observe the library's response.
    *   **Known Bombs:** Test with publicly available zip bomb examples.
3.  **Literature Review:**  Research known vulnerabilities and attack techniques related to compression bombs and the specific algorithms supported by the library.
4.  **Threat Modeling:**  Consider different attack scenarios and how the crafted archive could be delivered and exploited.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.1

**4.1. Threat Description:**

The attacker crafts a malicious archive designed to consume excessive resources upon decompression.  This is a classic denial-of-service (DoS) attack.  The archive itself is typically small, making it easy to transmit and bypass initial size checks.  However, upon decompression, it expands to a massive size, potentially filling the disk, exhausting memory, or overloading the CPU.

**4.2.  `zetbaitsu/compressor` Specific Considerations:**

*   **Supported Algorithms:**  The library's documentation and code need to be reviewed to determine precisely which compression algorithms are supported.  Each algorithm has different characteristics and potential vulnerabilities.  For example:
    *   **ZIP:**  Vulnerable to nested archive attacks and "billion laughs" type attacks if XML parsing is involved (though this is less likely with a pure compression library).  ZIP also has a 4GB uncompressed size limit per file *within* the archive, but this can be bypassed with multiple files or ZIP64.
    *   **GZIP:**  Generally less vulnerable to extreme compression ratios than ZIP, but can still be used to create large files.
    *   **Brotli:**  Can achieve very high compression ratios, especially with pre-shared dictionaries.  An attacker could potentially craft a malicious dictionary to maximize the expansion size.
    *   **Others:**  Any other supported algorithms (e.g., LZMA, Zstandard) need similar analysis.
*   **Resource Management:**  The key vulnerability lies in how `zetbaitsu/compressor` manages resources during decompression.  Crucial questions include:
    *   **Buffering:**  Does the library load the entire compressed data into memory at once?  Does it use streaming decompression with limited buffer sizes?  A large input buffer increases vulnerability.
    *   **Temporary Files:**  Does the library write decompressed data to temporary files?  If so, where are these files stored?  Are there size limits or quotas?  Is there proper cleanup of temporary files, even in error conditions?
    *   **Output Size Limits:**  Does the library have any built-in limits on the total size of the decompressed output?  This is a crucial defense.
    *   **Recursion Limits:**  If the library handles nested archives, is there a limit on the nesting depth?  Lack of a limit allows for exponential expansion.
    * **Disk Space Checks:** Does library check available disk space before and during decompressing?

*   **Error Handling:**  How does the library handle errors during decompression?  Does it:
    *   Terminate gracefully upon encountering a corrupted archive?
    *   Release allocated resources (memory, file handles) in case of an error?
    *   Log informative error messages that can aid in debugging and incident response?
    *   Throw exceptions that the calling application can catch and handle?

**4.3.  Exploitation Techniques (Specific to `zetbaitsu/compressor`):**

Based on the code review and experimentation, we would identify specific techniques that are most effective against this library.  Examples (hypothetical until code review is done):

*   **Nested ZIP Bombs:**  If the library supports ZIP and doesn't limit recursion, creating deeply nested ZIP archives would be a primary attack vector.
*   **Brotli Dictionary Attack:**  If Brotli is supported, crafting a malicious dictionary tailored to the expected input data could maximize compression.
*   **Buffer Overflow (Unlikely but Possible):**  If the library has flaws in its buffer management, a carefully crafted archive might trigger a buffer overflow, potentially leading to code execution (though this is beyond the scope of *this* analysis, it's a potential escalation).
* **Resource Leak:** If library doesn't free resources after decompression, multiple requests can lead to resource exhaustion.
* **Slow Decompression:** Even without extreme size, a specially crafted archive could be designed to be computationally expensive to decompress, tying up CPU resources.

**4.4.  Mitigation Strategies:**

Based on the identified vulnerabilities, we can recommend specific mitigation strategies:

*   **Input Validation:**
    *   **Maximum File Size (Before Decompression):**  Implement a strict limit on the size of uploaded or processed files *before* any decompression takes place.  This is the first line of defense.
    *   **Maximum Decompressed Size:**  The most crucial mitigation.  The application *must* enforce a limit on the total size of the decompressed output.  This can be done by:
        *   **Library-Specific Configuration:**  If `zetbaitsu/compressor` provides a configuration option for maximum output size, use it.
        *   **Wrapper Function:**  Create a wrapper function around the library's decompression calls that tracks the amount of data written and terminates the process if the limit is exceeded.
        *   **Streaming Decompression with Size Checks:**  Decompress the data in chunks, and after each chunk, check the total size written.
    *   **File Type Whitelisting:**  If possible, only allow specific, trusted file types to be processed.
    * **Available Disk Space Check:** Before decompression, check available disk space.

*   **Resource Limits:**
    *   **Memory Limits:**  Use operating system or containerization features (e.g., cgroups in Linux, Docker resource limits) to limit the amount of memory the application can use.
    *   **CPU Time Limits:**  Similarly, limit the CPU time the application can consume.
    *   **Process Limits:**  Limit the number of concurrent processes or threads the application can create.

*   **Library Updates:**  Keep `zetbaitsu/compressor` updated to the latest version to benefit from any security patches or improvements.

*   **Code Hardening:**
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Ensure the application code that uses `zetbaitsu/compressor` follows secure coding practices to prevent other vulnerabilities (e.g., input validation, output encoding, error handling).
    *   **Regular Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular code reviews to identify and address potential security issues.

*   **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    *   **Resource Monitoring:**  Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, disk space) and set up alerts for unusual activity.
    *   **Error Logging:**  Log all decompression errors and exceptions to facilitate incident response.

* **Sandboxing:** Run the decompression process in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of a successful attack.

**4.5.  Expected Outcomes of Further Investigation:**

*   **Specific Vulnerabilities:**  A detailed list of vulnerabilities in `zetbaitsu/compressor` related to decompression bombs, if any exist.
*   **Quantitative Data:**  Measurements of resource consumption for various types of compressed archives.
*   **Proof-of-Concept Exploits:**  Demonstration of how to create archives that can effectively exploit the identified vulnerabilities.
*   **Refined Mitigation Strategies:**  More specific and tailored recommendations for mitigating the risks, based on the findings.
