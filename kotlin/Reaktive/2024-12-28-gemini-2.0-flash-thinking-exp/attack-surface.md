Here's the updated key attack surface list focusing on elements directly involving Reaktive with high and critical severity:

* **Uncontrolled Asynchronous Operations Leading to Resource Exhaustion**
    * **Description:** A malicious actor can trigger a large number of asynchronous operations, overwhelming the application's resources (CPU, memory, threads).
    * **How Reaktive Contributes:** Reaktive's core functionality revolves around asynchronous streams of data. Unbounded or poorly managed `Publishers` or `Subjects` can be exploited to flood the system with events. Lack of backpressure handling exacerbates this.
    * **Example:** An attacker repeatedly triggers an action that publishes events to a `Subject` without any limits or backpressure, causing the application to consume excessive memory and potentially crash.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application instability, performance degradation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement backpressure mechanisms using operators like `buffer`, `throttle`, `debounce`, or `sample`.
        * Set limits on the number of concurrent operations or events being processed.
        * Use bounded `Publishers` or `Subjects` where appropriate.
        * Monitor resource usage and implement alerts for unusual activity.

* **Data Injection Through Unvalidated Input into Reactive Streams**
    * **Description:** Malicious data is injected into a reactive stream through an entry point like a `Subject` or a `Publisher` connected to external input.
    * **How Reaktive Contributes:** Reaktive facilitates the flow of data. If the initial data source is not sanitized, Reaktive will propagate the malicious data through the stream.
    * **Example:** User input is directly fed into a `Subject` without validation. An attacker injects a specially crafted string that, when processed by a downstream operator, causes a vulnerability (e.g., a command injection if the operator executes a system command based on the input).
    * **Impact:** Data corruption, code execution (depending on downstream processing), application compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the downstream processing).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict input validation and sanitization *before* data enters any reactive stream.
        * Use type-safe operators and data structures to minimize the risk of unexpected data types.
        * Apply the principle of least privilege to downstream operations, limiting what actions can be performed based on the data.
