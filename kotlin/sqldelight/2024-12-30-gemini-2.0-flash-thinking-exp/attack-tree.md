**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**I. Exploit Development-Time Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path):**

*   **Manipulate SQL Files (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Inject Malicious SQL in .sq Files (Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains access to the project's codebase (e.g., through a compromised developer account, insider threat, or vulnerability in the version control system). They then directly modify the `.sq` files, which are the source of truth for SQLDelight's code generation.
        *   **Impact:**  This allows the attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code that will be embedded into the application's data access layer. This can lead to:
            *   **Data Breach:**  Injecting SQL to extract sensitive data.
            *   **Data Manipulation:** Injecting SQL to modify or delete data.
            *   **Privilege Escalation:** Injecting SQL to grant themselves or others elevated privileges within the database.
            *   **Application Logic Bypass:** Injecting SQL to bypass intended application logic and perform unauthorized actions.

*   **Compromise Build Process (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Tamper with Gradle Configuration (Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker compromises the build environment or gains access to the `build.gradle` file. They modify the SQLDelight plugin configuration.
        *   **Impact:**
            *   **Point to Malicious SQL Files:** The attacker can redirect the SQLDelight plugin to use attacker-controlled `.sq` files, effectively injecting malicious SQL into the build output.
            *   **Disable Security Features (if any):** If SQLDelight has configurable security features, the attacker could disable them, making the application more vulnerable.
    *   **Supply Malicious Dependencies (Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker introduces compromised or vulnerable versions of SQLDelight itself or its transitive dependencies into the project's build configuration. This could be done through techniques like dependency confusion attacks or by exploiting vulnerabilities in package repositories.
        *   **Impact:**
            *   **Introduction of Vulnerabilities:** The malicious dependency could contain known vulnerabilities that can be exploited at runtime.
            *   **Backdoors:** The dependency could contain intentionally malicious code that allows the attacker to compromise the application.

**II. Exploit Runtime Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path):**

*   **Bypass SQLDelight's Type Safety (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Use RawQuery or Similar Escape Hatches Incorrectly (Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Developers use SQLDelight's features for executing raw SQL queries (like `rawQuery`) without proper input sanitization. User-provided input is directly concatenated into the SQL query string.
        *   **Impact:** This leads to classic SQL Injection vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to:
            *   Execute arbitrary SQL commands.
            *   Bypass authentication and authorization.
            *   Access, modify, or delete sensitive data.
    *   **Misuse Generated API Leading to SQL Injection (Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Developers incorrectly handle user input when constructing parameters for the functions generated by SQLDelight. For example, they might fail to properly escape or sanitize input before passing it to a generated query function.
        *   **Impact:**  Even though SQLDelight aims to prevent SQL injection, improper use of the generated API can still create vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL through the parameters.

This focused breakdown highlights the most critical areas of concern when using SQLDelight. By understanding these high-risk paths and critical nodes, development teams can prioritize their security efforts and implement targeted mitigations to protect their applications.
