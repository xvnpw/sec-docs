Here is the updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving SQLDelight:

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection via Dynamic Query Construction
    *   **Description:** Developers might bypass SQLDelight's type-safe API and construct SQL queries dynamically using string concatenation with unsanitized input. This directly undermines SQLDelight's intended protection against SQL injection by creating vulnerabilities where malicious SQL code can be injected and executed.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Confidentiality: Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
        *   Integrity: Modification or deletion of data.
        *   Availability: Denial of service by overloading the database or corrupting critical data.
    *   **Affected SQLDelight Component:** The Kotlin code where SQLDelight's generated API is intended to be used, but is bypassed in favor of manual query construction.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strictly adhere to SQLDelight's recommended practice of using parameterized queries.** Avoid any form of string concatenation or manual SQL construction with user-provided data.
        *   **Enforce code reviews to identify and prevent instances of manual SQL construction.**
        *   **Consider using static analysis tools to detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities, even when using SQLDelight.**

*   **Threat:** Malicious SQL in Schema Files
    *   **Description:** Attackers with access to the application's codebase can inject malicious SQL statements directly into the `.sq` files that SQLDelight uses to generate Kotlin code. When the SQLDelight compiler plugin processes these files, the malicious SQL becomes part of the generated code and will be executed by the application. This is a direct consequence of SQLDelight's reliance on these files for defining database interactions.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Confidentiality: Unauthorized data access.
        *   Integrity: Data modification or corruption.
        *   Availability: Application malfunction or denial of service.
    *   **Affected SQLDelight Component:** The `.sq` files and the SQLDelight compiler plugin.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement strict access controls and security measures for the directories containing `.sq` files.**
        *   **Treat `.sq` files as critical code and subject them to thorough code review processes.**
        *   **Use version control systems and track changes to `.sq` files to identify unauthorized modifications.**
        *   **Integrate security scanning tools into the development pipeline to detect potentially malicious SQL within `.sq` files.**

*   **Threat:** Dependency Confusion/Supply Chain Attacks on SQLDelight
    *   **Description:** If a compromised or malicious version of the SQLDelight library itself is introduced into the project's dependencies, it could contain code that compromises the application's security. This is a direct threat stemming from the application's reliance on the external SQLDelight library.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Confidentiality: Potential for data exfiltration through malicious code within the library.
        *   Integrity: Modification of data or application behavior by the compromised library.
        *   Availability: Application malfunction or complete compromise due to the malicious library.
    *   **Affected SQLDelight Component:** The SQLDelight library and its distribution mechanisms (e.g., Maven Central).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Utilize dependency management tools with integrity checks to verify the authenticity and integrity of the SQLDelight library.**
        *   **Pin specific versions of SQLDelight in the project's build configuration to avoid accidental upgrades to compromised versions.**
        *   **Regularly audit the project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using security scanning tools.**
        *   **Consider using private or trusted artifact repositories for managing dependencies.**
