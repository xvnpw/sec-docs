Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving SQLDelight, with high and critical severity:

- **Attack Surface: Schema Definition File Manipulation**
    - **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to and modifies the `.sq` schema files used by SQLDelight.
    - **How SQLDelight Contributes:** SQLDelight relies on these files as the source of truth for database structure and query generation. Changes here directly impact the generated code and database interactions.
    - **Example:** An attacker injects a `DROP TABLE users;` statement into a schema file. Upon the next build, SQLDelight generates code that, when executed, drops the `users` table.
    - **Impact:** Data loss, application malfunction, potential for further exploitation through the modified database structure.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Implement strict access controls on the project's source code repository and build environment.
        - Use version control for schema files and review changes carefully.
        - Consider storing schema files in a secure location with restricted access.
        - Employ code review processes for any modifications to schema files.

- **Attack Surface: Generated Code Vulnerabilities**
    - **Description:** The Kotlin/Java code generated by SQLDelight contains security vulnerabilities.
    - **How SQLDelight Contributes:** SQLDelight's code generation logic, if flawed, can produce vulnerable code. This is less about direct input and more about the inherent safety of the generated output.
    - **Example:** SQLDelight generates code that dynamically constructs SQL queries based on user input without proper sanitization, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities when these queries are executed.
    - **Impact:** SQL Injection, unauthorized data access, data modification, potential for remote code execution depending on database permissions.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Regularly update SQLDelight to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        - Review the generated code, especially for areas handling user input or complex query logic.
        - Utilize SQLDelight's features for parameterized queries and type-safe operations to minimize the risk of SQL injection.
        - Employ static analysis tools on the generated code to identify potential vulnerabilities.

- **Attack Surface: Build Process Exploitation**
    - **Description:** An attacker compromises the build process where SQLDelight is invoked, allowing them to inject malicious code or manipulate the generated output.
    - **How SQLDelight Contributes:** SQLDelight integrates with the build system (e.g., Gradle). If the build environment is insecure, this integration point can be exploited.
    - **Example:** An attacker gains control of the build server and modifies the Gradle configuration to use a compromised version of the SQLDelight plugin or injects malicious code that runs during the build, potentially altering the generated database access code.
    - **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build server, compromised application binaries, backdoors injected into the application.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Secure the build environment with strong access controls and regular security updates.
        - Use checksum verification for dependencies, including the SQLDelight plugin.
        - Implement a secure CI/CD pipeline with proper isolation and auditing.
        - Regularly scan the build environment for vulnerabilities.

- **Attack Surface: Custom Function/Expression Handling Vulnerabilities**
    - **Description:** If the application uses custom SQL functions or expressions within SQLDelight queries, vulnerabilities in these custom implementations can be exploited.
    - **How SQLDelight Contributes:** SQLDelight needs to parse and integrate these custom elements into the generated code. If the custom logic is flawed, SQLDelight's integration makes it accessible.
    - **Example:** A custom SQL function used in a SQLDelight query has a vulnerability that allows for SQL injection when specific input is provided through the application.
    - **Impact:** SQL Injection within the context of the custom function, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
    - **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the complexity and exposure of the custom functions)
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Thoroughly review and test all custom SQL functions and expressions for security vulnerabilities.
        - Apply the principle of least privilege to database user permissions used by custom functions.
        - Sanitize or parameterize any input passed to custom functions.
