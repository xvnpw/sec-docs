# Threat Model Analysis for sqldelight/sqldelight

## Threat: [Malicious SQL Injection via `rawQuery`](./threats/malicious_sql_injection_via__rawquery_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL statements and injects them into the application through the use of SQLDelight's `rawQuery` function or similar mechanisms where raw SQL strings are processed. The attacker might manipulate user input or exploit vulnerabilities in other parts of the application to construct these malicious SQL strings.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (accessing sensitive data), data manipulation (modifying or deleting data), potential for privilege escalation within the database if the application's database user has elevated privileges.
*   **Affected SQLDelight Component:** `com.squareup.sqldelight.runtime.coroutines.asFlow`, `com.squareup.sqldelight.runtime.coroutines.mapToList`, and underlying database interaction mechanisms when using `rawQuery` or similar raw SQL execution methods.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid using `rawQuery` whenever possible.
    *   Utilize SQLDelight's type-safe generated APIs and parameterized queries, which inherently prevent SQL injection by treating input as data, not executable code.
    *   If `rawQuery` is absolutely necessary, rigorously sanitize and validate all user-provided input before incorporating it into the SQL string. Employ techniques like input whitelisting and escaping.

## Threat: [Bugs in SQLDelight's SQL Parsing Logic Leading to Unexpected Query Generation](./threats/bugs_in_sqldelight's_sql_parsing_logic_leading_to_unexpected_query_generation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might exploit undiscovered bugs or vulnerabilities within SQLDelight's SQL parsing logic. By crafting specific, potentially complex or malformed SQL statements in the `.sq` files, they could cause SQLDelight to generate unexpected or incorrect SQL queries during compilation.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption (if the generated query modifies data unexpectedly), information disclosure (if the generated query retrieves more data than intended).
*   **Affected SQLDelight Component:** `sqldelight-compiler` module, specifically the SQL parsing and code generation components.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep SQLDelight updated to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    *   Thoroughly test the application with a wide range of SQL queries, including edge cases and potentially problematic syntax, in a controlled environment.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Generated Kotlin Code](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_generated_kotlin_code.md)

*   **Description:**  Bugs or vulnerabilities in the SQLDelight code generation logic could result in generated Kotlin code that contains security flaws. This might involve incorrect handling of data types or other programming errors that could be exploited.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (if generated code mishandles sensitive data), potential for other vulnerabilities depending on the nature of the generated code flaw.
*   **Affected SQLDelight Component:** `sqldelight-compiler` module, specifically the code generation components responsible for translating SQL definitions into Kotlin code.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Rely on stable and well-tested versions of SQLDelight.
    *   Review the generated Kotlin code, especially if using custom type mappers or complex SQL definitions, to identify potential security issues.
