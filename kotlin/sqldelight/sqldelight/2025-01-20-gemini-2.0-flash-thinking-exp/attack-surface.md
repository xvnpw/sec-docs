# Attack Surface Analysis for sqldelight/sqldelight

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection (Indirect via Schema Definition)](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection__indirect_via_schema_definition_.md)

**Description:** While SQLDelight aims to prevent direct SQL injection in queries, vulnerabilities can arise if the SQL schema definition files (`.sq` files) are dynamically generated or influenced by untrusted input.

**How SQLDelight Contributes:** SQLDelight parses these `.sq` files to generate Kotlin code. If an attacker can manipulate the content of these files before or during the build process, they can inject malicious SQL that becomes part of the generated code.

**Example:** An application feature allows users to define custom table names or column names that are then used to generate `.sq` files. An attacker could input a malicious table name like `users'); DROP TABLE users; --` which, if not properly sanitized, could lead to the generation of a `.sq` file containing harmful SQL.

**Impact:** Potentially leads to arbitrary SQL execution on the database, resulting in data breaches, data corruption, or denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Treat `.sq` files as trusted resources:** Avoid generating them dynamically based on user input.
* **Strict input validation:** If dynamic generation is necessary, rigorously validate and sanitize any input that influences the content of `.sq` files.
* **Secure build pipeline:** Ensure the build process is secure and prevents unauthorized modification of source files.

## Attack Surface: [Code Generation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/code_generation_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Bugs or vulnerabilities within the SQLDelight compiler itself could lead to the generation of insecure Kotlin code.

**How SQLDelight Contributes:** SQLDelight's core function is code generation. A flaw in the compiler could result in generated code that has unintended security weaknesses, such as incorrect escaping or flawed query construction logic.

**Example:** A bug in the SQLDelight compiler might cause it to incorrectly handle certain data types or edge cases, leading to generated code that is susceptible to SQL injection when used with specific input.

**Impact:** Can lead to vulnerabilities like SQL injection or data corruption due to flaws in the generated code.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep SQLDelight updated:** Regularly update to the latest version of SQLDelight to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
* **Monitor SQLDelight release notes and security advisories:** Stay informed about any reported vulnerabilities in SQLDelight.
* **Consider static analysis tools:** Use static analysis tools on the generated Kotlin code to identify potential security issues.

## Attack Surface: [Custom SQL Functions and Expressions](./attack_surfaces/custom_sql_functions_and_expressions.md)

**Description:** SQLDelight allows developers to define custom SQL functions and expressions within their `.sq` files. If these custom functions are not carefully implemented and validated, they can introduce vulnerabilities.

**How SQLDelight Contributes:** SQLDelight integrates these custom functions into the generated code, making them part of the application's database interaction layer.

**Example:** A custom function designed to process user input might not properly sanitize the input, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities when the function is called in a query.

**Impact:** Can lead to SQL injection or other database-related vulnerabilities depending on the implementation of the custom function.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Treat custom SQL functions with caution:** Implement them with the same security considerations as any other code interacting with external input.
* **Input validation and sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize any input processed by custom SQL functions.
* **Principle of least privilege:** Ensure custom functions only have the necessary database permissions.
* **Code review:** Carefully review the implementation of custom SQL functions for potential security flaws.

## Attack Surface: [Database Migration Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/database_migration_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** SQLDelight supports database schema migrations. If migration scripts are not properly reviewed and secured, they could be a vector for introducing malicious changes to the database structure or data.

**How SQLDelight Contributes:** SQLDelight executes these migration scripts to update the database schema. If an attacker can influence these scripts, they can manipulate the database.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the migration scripts and adds a script that inserts malicious data or alters table permissions.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, or denial of service due to malicious changes to the database.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Secure migration script management:** Store migration scripts securely and control access to them.
* **Code review for migration scripts:** Thoroughly review all migration scripts before execution for any unintended or malicious changes.
* **Automated testing of migrations:** Implement automated tests to verify the correctness and security of database migrations.
* **Principle of least privilege for migration execution:** Ensure the user executing migrations has only the necessary permissions.
