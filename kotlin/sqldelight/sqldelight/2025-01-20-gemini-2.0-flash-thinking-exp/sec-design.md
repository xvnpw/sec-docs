## 4. Detailed Design

### 4.1. Components

*   **`.sq` Files:**
    *   Plain text files containing SQL statements, including `CREATE TABLE`, `CREATE INDEX`, and `SELECT`/`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` queries.
    *   Utilize SQLDelight-specific syntax for defining named queries, schema elements, and expected result types.
    *   Serve as the foundational input for the SQLDelight compiler, defining the data model and access patterns.
    *   Typically located within the `src` directories of a project, organized by module or feature.

*   **SQLDelight Compiler Plugin:**
    *   A Kotlin compiler plugin that integrates with the Kotlin compilation process, either through the standard compiler plugin mechanism or the Kotlin Symbol Processing API (KSP).
    *   **Parsing and Lexing:** Reads and parses `.sq` files, performing lexical analysis to break down the content into tokens.
    *   **Syntax Analysis:**  Analyzes the token stream to ensure the SQL syntax is valid and conforms to SQLDelight's extensions.
    *   **Semantic Analysis:**  Performs semantic checks, such as verifying table and column names, and validating query parameters against the defined schema.
    *   **Code Generation:** Generates Kotlin code, including:
        *   Data classes representing database tables and query result sets.
        *   Interfaces defining type-safe query accessors with functions corresponding to the named queries in `.sq` files.
        *   Implementation classes for these interfaces, responsible for executing SQL against the database using the runtime library.
        *   Database schema definition and migration logic, often as Kotlin code that can be executed to create or update the database schema.
    *   **Error Reporting:** Provides feedback to the developer on syntax errors, semantic issues, and potential problems in the `.sq` files.

*   **Generated Kotlin Code:**
    *   Kotlin source code automatically produced by the compiler plugin during the build process.
    *   Key elements include:
        *   **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** Data classes representing rows in database tables or the results of specific queries, ensuring type safety when working with database data.
        *   **Query Interfaces:** Interfaces that define functions for executing the SQL queries defined in the `.sq` files, providing type-safe parameters and return types.
        *   **Implementation Classes:** Concrete implementations of the query interfaces, responsible for constructing and executing SQL statements using the SQLDelight Runtime Library.
        *   **Database Schema Definition:** Code that defines the structure of the database, including tables, columns, and indices.
        *   **Migration Logic:** Code to handle database schema changes over time, allowing for smooth updates to the database structure.

*   **Kotlin Compiler:**
    *   The standard Kotlin compiler responsible for compiling all Kotlin source code within the project, including the generated code produced by the SQLDelight plugin.
    *   Performs standard Kotlin compilation steps, including type checking, bytecode generation, and optimization.
    *   Ensures that the generated code is valid Kotlin and integrates seamlessly with the rest of the application's codebase.

*   **SQLDelight Runtime Library:**
    *   A lightweight Kotlin library providing the necessary runtime components for interacting with the database.
    *   **Database Connection Management:** Handles the creation and management of database connections.
    *   **Statement Execution:** Provides mechanisms for executing SQL statements against the database.
    *   **Result Mapping:**  Facilitates the mapping of database query results to the generated Kotlin data classes.
    *   **Transaction Management:** Offers support for managing database transactions.
    *   **Platform Abstraction:** Provides platform-specific implementations for interacting with different database systems, primarily focusing on SQLite across various platforms (JVM, Android, Native, JS).

*   **Database (e.g., SQLite):**
    *   The underlying database system where the application's data is persisted.
    *   SQLDelight's primary focus is SQLite, but it can be extended to support other SQL databases through custom drivers or integrations.
    *   Responsible for storing and retrieving data based on the SQL commands executed by the generated code via the runtime library.

### 4.2. Data Flow

The data flow within the SQLDelight system occurs in two distinct phases: build time and runtime.

*   **Build Time:**
    1. The Kotlin compiler initiates the compilation process, identifying `.sq` files within the project's source directories.
    2. The SQLDelight Compiler Plugin is invoked as part of the Kotlin compilation.
    3. The compiler plugin reads the content of the `.sq` files.
    4. The plugin parses the SQL statements and schema definitions, performing syntax and semantic validation.
    5. Based on the parsed information, the plugin generates Kotlin source code, including data classes, query interfaces, and implementation classes.
    6. The generated Kotlin code is added to the set of source files to be compiled by the Kotlin compiler.
    7. The Kotlin compiler compiles all Kotlin code, including the generated code, into bytecode (e.g., JVM bytecode, Android DEX bytecode, native binaries, or JavaScript).

*   **Runtime:**
    1. The compiled application code, including the generated SQLDelight code, is executed.
    2. The generated code utilizes the SQLDelight Runtime Library to establish a connection to the underlying database.
    3. When the application needs to interact with the database, it calls the type-safe query functions defined in the generated interfaces.
    4. The generated implementation classes construct and execute the corresponding SQL queries against the database using the runtime library.
    5. The database processes the SQL query and returns the results to the runtime library.
    6. The runtime library maps the database results to instances of the generated Kotlin data classes.
    7. The application code consumes the type-safe data from these data classes.

### 4.3. Key Interactions

*   **`.sq` Files and Compiler Plugin:** The compiler plugin directly consumes the `.sq` files as its primary input, relying on their integrity and correct syntax for successful code generation. Any tampering with these files could lead to unexpected or malicious code generation.
*   **Compiler Plugin and Generated Code:** The compiler plugin is the sole generator of the Kotlin code that interacts with the database. The security and correctness of the generated code are entirely dependent on the logic and security measures within the compiler plugin. Vulnerabilities here could have significant security implications.
*   **Generated Code and Runtime Library:** The generated code relies heavily on the SQLDelight Runtime Library for database interaction. This interaction involves passing SQL statements and handling database responses. The security of this interaction is crucial to prevent issues like SQL injection.
*   **Runtime Library and Database:** The runtime library manages the actual communication with the database, including connection management, statement execution, and result handling. This interaction needs to be secure, protecting against unauthorized access and data breaches.
*   **Kotlin Compiler and Generated Code:** The Kotlin compiler ensures the syntactic and semantic correctness of the generated code. While it doesn't directly guarantee the security of the database interactions, it plays a role in ensuring the generated code is well-formed and less likely to contain basic programming errors.

## 5. Security Considerations (For Threat Modeling)

The following areas represent potential security concerns that should be thoroughly evaluated during threat modeling:

*   **Compiler Plugin Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Malicious `.sq` Files:**  A carefully crafted `.sq` file could exploit vulnerabilities in the compiler plugin's parsing or code generation logic, potentially leading to:
        *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Execution of malicious code during the build process.
        *   **Generation of Insecure Code:**  Generation of Kotlin code with SQL injection vulnerabilities or other security flaws.
        *   **Denial of Service:**  Causing the compiler plugin to crash or consume excessive resources, disrupting the build process.
    *   **Input Validation Failures:** Insufficient validation of the content of `.sq` files could allow attackers to inject malicious SQL or exploit parsing errors.
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:**  Vulnerabilities in the dependencies used by the compiler plugin could be exploited to compromise the plugin itself.

*   **Generated Code Security:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** If the compiler plugin fails to properly sanitize or parameterize inputs when generating code, the resulting code could be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. This is a primary concern.
    *   **Information Disclosure:**  Poorly generated queries or data handling logic could inadvertently expose sensitive information.
    *   **Logic Errors:**  Flaws in the code generation logic could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities in the generated database access code.

*   **Runtime Library Security:**
    *   **Database Credential Management:**  How the runtime library handles database credentials (e.g., connection strings, passwords) is critical. Insecure storage or transmission of credentials could lead to unauthorized database access.
    *   **SQL Injection Prevention:** The runtime library should provide mechanisms or enforce practices to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities, even if the generated code has flaws.
    *   **Error Handling:**  Insecure error handling in the runtime library could reveal sensitive information about the database structure or data.
    *   **Platform-Specific Vulnerabilities:**  Security vulnerabilities in the platform-specific implementations of the runtime library could be exploited.

*   **Build Process Security:**
    *   **Compromised Dependencies:** If the SQLDelight Gradle plugin or its dependencies are compromised, malicious code could be injected into the build process, potentially leading to the generation of backdoored or vulnerable code.
    *   **Build Environment Security:**  A compromised build environment could allow attackers to modify `.sq` files or the compiler plugin itself.

*   **Database Security:**
    *   While SQLDelight aims to provide type-safe access, the security of the underlying database remains paramount. Standard database security practices, such as access controls, encryption, and regular security updates, are essential.

## 6. Deployment Considerations

SQLDelight itself is primarily a build-time dependency. The deployment artifact of an application using SQLDelight includes:

*   The compiled application code, which contains the generated SQLDelight code.
*   The SQLDelight Runtime Library.
*   The underlying database (or connection details to a remote database).

Security considerations during deployment include:

*   **Secure Distribution:** Ensuring the integrity of the application package to prevent tampering with the generated code or the runtime library.
*   **Database Security:**  Properly securing the database server, including access controls, network security, and encryption.
*   **Credential Management:** Securely managing database credentials used by the application at runtime.
*   **Runtime Environment:**  Securing the environment where the application and database are running.
