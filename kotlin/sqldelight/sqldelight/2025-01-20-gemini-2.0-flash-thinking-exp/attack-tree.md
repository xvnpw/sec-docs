## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Query Definition Weaknesses [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_query_definition_weaknesses__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This category focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how queries are defined in the Kotlin code using SQLDelight's DSL, specifically leading to SQL injection.
* **SQL Injection via Insecure Parameter Handling [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that is intended to be used as a parameter in a SQLDelight query. If the application code does not properly sanitize or parameterize this input, it can be interpreted as SQL code by the database.
    * **Mechanism:** This often involves manipulating string concatenation or other insecure methods of building SQL queries where user-controlled data is directly embedded.
    * **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
        * **Data Breach:**  Retrieving sensitive data from the database.
        * **Data Modification:** Altering or deleting data within the database.
        * **Denial of Service:** Executing queries that consume excessive resources, making the application unavailable.
    * **Example:**  Consider a query like `db.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + userInput + "'")`. If `userInput` contains `' OR '1'='1`, the resulting query becomes `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1'`, which will return all users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Code Generation [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_code_generation__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This category focuses on attacks that target the process of SQLDelight generating Kotlin code from the `.sq` files. The critical point is compromising the build process.
* **Exploit Build Process Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Description:** An attacker compromises the software build environment. This could involve various methods, such as:
        * **Compromising Dependencies:** Injecting malicious code into a dependency used by the project.
        * **Malicious Plugins:** Introducing malicious plugins to the build system (e.g., Gradle plugins).
        * **Compromised Build Servers:** Gaining unauthorized access to the build server and modifying the build process.
    * **Mechanism:** Once the build process is compromised, the attacker can modify the SQLDelight-generated Kotlin code. This could involve:
        * **Altering Generated SQL:** Changing the SQL queries to perform malicious actions.
        * **Injecting Additional Code:** Adding code to perform unauthorized database operations or exfiltrate data.
    * **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
        * **Complete Control over Database Operations:** The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
        * **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive data directly from the database.
        * **Application Takeover:** Potentially gaining control over the application's functionality through manipulated database interactions.
    * **Example:** A malicious Gradle plugin could intercept the SQLDelight code generation step and inject code that logs all database queries to an external server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This category focuses on exploiting known vulnerabilities in the libraries that SQLDelight depends on, specifically the underlying SQLite driver.
* **Vulnerabilities in SQLite Driver [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Description:** The SQLDelight library relies on an underlying SQLite driver to interact with the database. This driver, like any software, can have security vulnerabilities.
    * **Mechanism:** Attackers can exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in the specific version of the SQLite driver used by the application. These vulnerabilities can range from memory corruption issues to SQL injection vulnerabilities within the driver itself.
    * **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the SQLite driver but can include:
        * **Remote Code Execution:**  Allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or device running the application.
        * **Denial of Service:** Crashing the application or the underlying database system.
        * **Data Breaches:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to data.
    * **Example:** A known buffer overflow vulnerability in a specific version of the SQLite driver could be exploited by sending specially crafted SQL queries, leading to code execution.
