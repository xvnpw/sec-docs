## Deep Analysis: Malicious Schema Injection Threat in SQLDelight Application

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Malicious Schema Injection" threat targeting applications using SQLDelight. We will explore the technical details, potential attack vectors, and expand on the provided mitigation strategies.

**Threat Name:** Malicious Schema Injection

**Threat ID:** TSI-SQLD-001

**Executive Summary:**

The "Malicious Schema Injection" threat poses a significant risk to applications utilizing SQLDelight. By compromising the `.sq` files that define the database schema, an attacker can inject malicious SQL, alter data types, or introduce structural flaws. This directly impacts the code generated by SQLDelight, leading to exploitable vulnerabilities, primarily SQL injection, within the application's data access layer. The potential consequences include unauthorized data access, modification, deletion, and potentially complete system compromise. This threat is considered **Critical** due to the direct impact on data integrity and confidentiality.

**Detailed Threat Analysis:**

**1. Attack Vector and Methodology:**

* **Unauthorized Access:** The primary attack vector relies on gaining unauthorized access to either the:
    * **Source Code Repository:**  Compromising developer accounts, exploiting vulnerabilities in the repository platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab), or through insider threats.
    * **Build Environment:**  Gaining access to the CI/CD pipeline, build servers, or developer workstations involved in the build process. This could be achieved through compromised credentials, software vulnerabilities, or social engineering.
* **Targeting `.sq` Files:** Once access is gained, the attacker targets the `.sq` files. These files are plain text and contain the SQL statements defining the database schema (tables, columns, indexes, etc.).
* **Malicious Modifications:** The attacker can manipulate these files in several ways:
    * **Direct SQL Injection:** Injecting malicious SQL code directly into table or view definitions, especially within `CREATE VIEW` statements or by adding triggers with malicious logic. For example, adding a view that unions sensitive data with publicly accessible data.
    * **Altering Data Types:** Changing data types to create vulnerabilities. For instance, changing a numeric ID field to a string type without proper input validation in the application code could allow for SQL injection where numeric checks were previously assumed.
    * **Introducing Schema Flaws:** Creating schema inconsistencies or illogical relationships that can be exploited by crafting specific queries. This might involve adding nullable columns where they shouldn't be or creating ambiguous relationships between tables.
    * **Adding Malicious Functions or Procedures (if supported by the underlying database and SQLDelight):**  While SQLDelight primarily focuses on schema and basic queries, if the underlying database allows custom functions or procedures, and SQLDelight allows their declaration in `.sq` files (or if the attacker modifies generated code to use them), this could be a vector.
* **SQLDelight Compiler as the Conduit:** The modified `.sq` files are then processed by the SQLDelight compiler during the build process. This compiler generates Kotlin (or Java) code representing the database schema and data access objects. The malicious modifications in the `.sq` files are directly translated into the generated code.
* **Exploitation in Application Logic:** The vulnerabilities introduced via the modified schema are then exploitable by attackers interacting with the application. For example, if a malicious `WHERE` clause was injected into a view definition, any query against that view will execute the injected code.

**2. Impact Assessment (Expanding on the Description):**

* **Direct SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:** This is the most immediate and critical impact. The injected SQL code can be executed within the context of the application's database connection, allowing the attacker to:
    * **Bypass Authentication and Authorization:** Access data they are not authorized to see or modify.
    * **Data Exfiltration:** Extract sensitive data from the database.
    * **Data Manipulation:** Modify or delete critical data, leading to data corruption or loss.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** Potentially gain administrative access to the database server.
    * **Execute Operating System Commands (in some database configurations):** If the database user has sufficient privileges, the attacker might be able to execute commands on the underlying server.
* **Data Integrity Compromise:** Altering data types can lead to:
    * **Data Corruption:** Incorrect data being stored due to mismatched types.
    * **Application Errors:** Unexpected behavior and crashes due to type mismatches in application logic.
    * **Logical Errors:**  Incorrect calculations or business logic execution based on flawed data.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Malicious schema changes could lead to:
    * **Performance Degradation:** Poorly designed schemas or injected inefficient queries can severely impact database performance.
    * **Application Crashes:**  Schema inconsistencies or errors in generated code can lead to application crashes.
* **Information Disclosure:** Even without direct SQL injection, schema flaws can be exploited to reveal sensitive information through carefully crafted queries.
* **Supply Chain Risk:** If the build environment is compromised, the malicious schema changes can be silently introduced into the application without the development team's knowledge, affecting all deployments built from that compromised environment.

**3. Affected SQLDelight Component - Deeper Dive:**

* **SQLDelight Compiler:**
    * **Role:** The core component responsible for parsing `.sq` files and generating the corresponding Kotlin/Java code. It acts as the translator between the declarative schema definition and the application's data access layer.
    * **Vulnerability:** The compiler itself is not inherently vulnerable. The vulnerability lies in its trust of the input `.sq` files. If these files are malicious, the compiler faithfully generates code based on that malicious input, effectively baking the vulnerability into the application.
    * **Impact:** The compiler becomes the conduit for the attack. Its normal function of code generation becomes the mechanism for introducing vulnerabilities.
* **Schema Definition Files (`.sq` files):**
    * **Content:** These files contain SQL statements defining tables, columns, indexes, views, and queries. They are the single source of truth for the database schema within the SQLDelight workflow.
    * **Vulnerability:** Their plain-text nature and direct influence on code generation make them a prime target for malicious modification. Any alteration in these files directly impacts the generated code.
    * **Examples of Malicious Modifications:**
        * **Adding a view with a malicious `WHERE` clause:**
          ```sql
          CREATE VIEW vulnerable_users AS
          SELECT id, username, password FROM users WHERE 1=1 -- Injecting a always true condition
          UNION ALL
          SELECT id, username, password FROM admin_users;
          ```
        * **Modifying a query to bypass authorization:**
          ```sql
          -- Original Query: SELECT * FROM secure_data WHERE user_id = ?;
          -- Maliciously Modified Query: SELECT * FROM secure_data;
          ```
        * **Changing a data type to allow for SQL injection:**
          ```sql
          -- Original: CREATE TABLE items (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);
          -- Malicious: CREATE TABLE items (id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);
          ```

**4. Risk Severity Justification:**

The "Critical" risk severity is justified due to the following factors:

* **High Likelihood of Exploitation:** If an attacker gains access to the source code repository or build environment, modifying `.sq` files is a relatively straightforward process.
* **Severe Impact on Confidentiality:**  Successful exploitation can lead to the exposure of sensitive data, including user credentials, personal information, and financial data.
* **Severe Impact on Integrity:**  Data modification or deletion can compromise the accuracy and reliability of the application's data.
* **Potential Impact on Availability:**  DoS attacks through schema manipulation can render the application unusable.
* **Wide-Ranging Consequences:** The impact can extend beyond the application itself, potentially affecting downstream systems and business operations.

**5. Expanding on Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Implement Strong Access Controls and Multi-Factor Authentication:**
    * **Granular Repository Permissions:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict who can read, write, and modify the repository.
    * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for all users with access to the repository and build environment.
    * **Regular Access Reviews:** Periodically review and revoke unnecessary access permissions.
    * **Secure Key Management:** Protect API keys and credentials used for accessing the repository and build tools.
* **Enforce Mandatory Code Review Processes for Schema Definition Files:**
    * **Dedicated Security Reviewers:** Train developers on security best practices for SQLDelight schemas and designate specific individuals responsible for security reviews.
    * **Automated Code Analysis Tools:** Integrate static analysis tools that can scan `.sq` files for potential vulnerabilities or deviations from best practices.
    * **Focus on Security Implications:** Reviewers should specifically look for potential SQL injection points, data type inconsistencies, and logical flaws in the schema.
* **Utilize Version Control Systems with Robust Change Tracking and Access Logging:**
    * **Detailed Commit History:** Ensure all changes to `.sq` files are properly committed with clear and informative messages.
    * **Branching and Merging Strategies:** Implement a branching strategy that requires code reviews before merging changes to the main branch.
    * **Audit Logs:** Regularly review the repository's audit logs to identify any suspicious or unauthorized modifications.
    * **Immutable History:** Utilize features that prevent the alteration of past commits.
* **Automate Build Processes and Limit Manual Interventions:**
    * **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Define the build environment using IaC to ensure consistency and prevent ad-hoc modifications.
    * **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Implement a robust CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds and tests the application, reducing the need for manual intervention.
    * **Secure Build Agents:** Ensure build agents are securely configured and hardened against attacks.
    * **Artifact Verification:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of build artifacts.
* **Additional Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Static Analysis of `.sq` Files:** Employ specialized static analysis tools designed to identify potential vulnerabilities within SQL schemas. These tools can detect common SQL injection patterns or schema inconsistencies.
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Even with a secure schema, robust input validation and sanitization on the application side are crucial to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege for Database Access:** The application should connect to the database with the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the potential damage if a SQL injection vulnerability is exploited.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of the entire development and deployment pipeline, including the handling of `.sq` files.
    * **Security Training for Developers:** Educate developers about the risks associated with malicious schema injection and best practices for writing secure SQLDelight schemas.
    * **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring systems to detect unusual database activity or unauthorized changes to `.sq` files in the repository.

**6. Detection and Response:**

While prevention is key, it's also important to have mechanisms for detecting and responding to a successful "Malicious Schema Injection" attack:

* **Code Reviews:** Thorough code reviews, especially after any changes to `.sq` files, can help identify malicious modifications.
* **Build Process Monitoring:** Monitor the build process for unexpected changes to `.sq` files or unusual compiler behavior.
* **Database Monitoring:** Monitor database logs for suspicious query patterns, unauthorized data access, or data modification attempts.
* **Application Logging:** Log database interactions and application behavior to identify anomalies.
* **Security Audits:** Regular security audits can help identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the development and deployment process.
* **Incident Response Plan:** Have a well-defined incident response plan to address potential security breaches, including steps for isolating the affected system, investigating the incident, and remediating the vulnerability.

**Conclusion:**

The "Malicious Schema Injection" threat is a serious concern for applications using SQLDelight. By understanding the attack vectors, potential impact, and implementing comprehensive mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability. A layered security approach, combining strong access controls, rigorous code reviews, automated build processes, and continuous monitoring, is essential to protect against this critical threat. Regularly reviewing and updating security practices is crucial to stay ahead of evolving threats and ensure the ongoing security of the application.
