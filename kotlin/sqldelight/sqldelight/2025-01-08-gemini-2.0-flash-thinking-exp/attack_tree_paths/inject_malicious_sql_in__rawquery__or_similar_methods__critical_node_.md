## Deep Analysis of SQL Injection via `rawQuery` in SQLDelight

This analysis focuses on the attack tree path "Inject Malicious SQL in `rawQuery` or similar methods" within the context of an application using SQLDelight. This is a **critical vulnerability** as it allows attackers to directly manipulate database queries, potentially leading to severe consequences.

**Understanding the Context: SQLDelight and `rawQuery`**

SQLDelight is a Kotlin library that generates Kotlin data classes and typesafe APIs from SQL statements. It aims to improve database interaction by providing compile-time checks and eliminating boilerplate code. However, SQLDelight also provides escape hatches like `rawQuery` (and similar methods like `execute`, `transaction`, etc. when used with string concatenation) that allow developers to execute arbitrary SQL strings.

**Deep Dive into the Attack Path:**

**1. The Vulnerability: Lack of Parameterization in `rawQuery`**

The core of this vulnerability lies in the way `rawQuery` (and similar methods used with string concatenation) processes SQL statements. When constructing queries using string concatenation with user-supplied input, the application becomes susceptible to SQL injection.

* **How it Works:** The attacker exploits the lack of proper input sanitization and parameterization. They craft malicious SQL fragments within the user input that, when concatenated into the final SQL query, alter the intended logic.

* **Example:**

   Let's say an application uses `rawQuery` to fetch user details based on a username:

   ```kotlin
   val username = userInput // User-provided input
   val query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username';"
   val cursor = database.rawQuery(query, null)
   ```

   If the attacker provides the following input for `username`:

   ```
   ' OR '1'='1
   ```

   The resulting SQL query becomes:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1';
   ```

   This query will return all users in the `users` table because the condition `'1'='1'` is always true, effectively bypassing the intended filtering.

**2. Impact of Successful Injection:**

A successful SQL injection via `rawQuery` can have devastating consequences:

* **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive data, including user credentials, personal information, financial records, and confidential business data.
* **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify, delete, or insert data into the database, leading to data corruption, business disruption, and financial losses.
* **Authentication Bypass:** As demonstrated in the example above, attackers can bypass authentication mechanisms by manipulating login queries.
* **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers might be able to execute database commands with higher privileges than intended, potentially granting them administrative access.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers could execute resource-intensive queries that overload the database server, leading to service unavailability.
* **Remote Code Execution (in some cases):** Depending on the database system and its configuration, attackers might be able to execute operating system commands on the database server.

**3. Why is `rawQuery` a Risk?**

* **Bypasses SQLDelight's Safety Features:** While SQLDelight promotes type safety and compile-time checks for generated queries, `rawQuery` bypasses these safeguards, placing the responsibility of secure query construction entirely on the developer.
* **Developer Error:**  Developers might be tempted to use `rawQuery` for complex or dynamic queries, especially if they are not fully aware of the risks associated with string concatenation.
* **Legacy Code or Third-Party Integrations:**  Existing codebases or integrations with libraries that rely on raw SQL queries can introduce this vulnerability.

**4. Mitigation Strategies (Crucial for the Development Team):**

* **Prioritize Parameterized Queries:**  The **primary defense** against SQL injection is to **always use parameterized queries** (also known as prepared statements) whenever possible. SQLDelight supports parameterized queries through its generated API.

   ```kotlin
   // Example using SQLDelight's generated API (assuming a 'UserQueries' interface)
   val username = userInput
   val user = database.userQueries.selectUserByUsername(username).executeAsOneOrNull()
   ```

   SQLDelight handles the proper escaping and quoting of parameters, preventing malicious SQL from being interpreted as code.

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While not a replacement for parameterized queries, validating and sanitizing user input can provide an additional layer of defense. This involves:
    * **Whitelisting:** Only allowing specific characters or patterns in the input.
    * **Escaping:**  Escaping special characters that have meaning in SQL (e.g., single quotes, double quotes). **However, relying solely on escaping is error-prone and not recommended as the primary defense.**
    * **Input Type Validation:** Ensuring the input matches the expected data type (e.g., integer for IDs).

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant database users only the necessary permissions required for their tasks. This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause even if they successfully inject SQL.

* **Code Reviews:** Regularly review code, especially sections that handle database interactions, to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

* **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Utilize SAST tools that can analyze the codebase and identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Employ DAST tools to simulate attacks on the running application and identify vulnerabilities, including SQL injection.

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts before they reach the application.

* **Security Training for Developers:** Educate developers about the risks of SQL injection and best practices for secure database interaction.

**5. Detection and Monitoring:**

* **Database Activity Monitoring:** Monitor database logs for unusual or suspicious activity, such as:
    * Unexpected SQL commands.
    * Multiple failed login attempts from the same IP address.
    * Data modifications outside of normal application flow.
* **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS):** These systems can detect and potentially block SQL injection attempts based on known attack patterns.
* **Error Logging:**  Pay attention to database error logs, as they might contain clues about attempted SQL injection attacks.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Implement systems that can detect deviations from normal database access patterns.

**6. SQLDelight Specific Considerations:**

* **Leverage SQLDelight's Strengths:** Emphasize the use of SQLDelight's generated APIs for most database interactions to benefit from its type safety and compile-time checks.
* **Document `rawQuery` Usage:** If `rawQuery` is absolutely necessary, thoroughly document its usage, the reasons behind it, and the security measures implemented to mitigate the risks.
* **Consider Alternatives to `rawQuery`:** Explore if there are alternative ways to achieve the desired functionality without resorting to raw SQL, such as using more advanced SQLDelight features or refactoring the database schema.

**Conclusion:**

The "Inject Malicious SQL in `rawQuery` or similar methods" attack path represents a significant security risk in applications using SQLDelight. While SQLDelight provides tools for safer database interactions, the use of `rawQuery` bypasses these safeguards and places the burden of security on the developer.

**For the development team, the key takeaway is to avoid `rawQuery` whenever possible and prioritize parameterized queries through SQLDelight's generated API. Implementing robust input validation, conducting thorough code reviews, and utilizing security testing tools are also crucial steps in mitigating this critical vulnerability.** By understanding the mechanisms and potential impact of SQL injection, the development team can build more secure and resilient applications.
