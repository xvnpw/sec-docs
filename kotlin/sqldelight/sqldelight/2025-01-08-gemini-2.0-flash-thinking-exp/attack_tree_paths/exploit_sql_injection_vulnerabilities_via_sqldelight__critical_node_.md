## Deep Analysis: Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities via SQLDelight

This analysis delves into the attack tree path "Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities via SQLDelight," focusing on the potential risks and mitigation strategies for applications using the SQLDelight library. While SQLDelight promotes safer database interactions, vulnerabilities can still arise from improper usage, particularly with `rawQuery`.

**Understanding the Threat:**

SQL Injection (SQLi) is a code injection technique that exploits security vulnerabilities in the database layer of an application. Attackers inject malicious SQL statements into an entry field for execution, potentially allowing them to:

* **Bypass authentication and authorization:** Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities.
* **Retrieve sensitive data:** Extract confidential information like user credentials, financial records, or personal details.
* **Modify or delete data:** Alter or remove critical data, leading to data corruption or loss.
* **Execute arbitrary code on the database server:** In severe cases, gain control over the database server itself.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Disrupt the application's availability by overloading the database.

**Why SQLDelight Doesn't Eliminate SQLi Completely:**

SQLDelight primarily mitigates SQLi by generating type-safe Kotlin code for database interactions based on SQL schema definitions. This encourages the use of parameterized queries, which are inherently resistant to SQL injection. However, the `rawQuery` function provides a way to execute arbitrary SQL, bypassing these safety mechanisms.

**Deep Dive into the "Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities via SQLDelight" Path:**

This attack path hinges on the developer's decision to use `rawQuery` and how they handle user-provided input within those raw queries. Here's a breakdown of the potential attack vectors:

**1. Direct String Concatenation in `rawQuery`:**

This is the most common and dangerous scenario. If user input is directly concatenated into the SQL string passed to `rawQuery`, it opens the door for injection.

**Example (Vulnerable Code):**

```kotlin
fun searchUsersByName(name: String): Query<UserModel> {
    val query = "SELECT * FROM User WHERE name = '$name'" // Vulnerable!
    return database.userQueries.rawQuery(User.Adapter, query)
}
```

**Attack Scenario:**

An attacker could provide the following input for `name`:

```
' OR 1=1 --
```

This would result in the following SQL query being executed:

```sql
SELECT * FROM User WHERE name = '' OR 1=1 --'
```

The `--` comments out the rest of the query. The `OR 1=1` condition is always true, effectively returning all users in the database, bypassing the intended search functionality.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access.

**2. Improper Sanitization/Validation Before `rawQuery`:**

Developers might attempt to sanitize user input before using it in `rawQuery`. However, if the sanitization is incomplete or flawed, it can still be bypassed.

**Example (Potentially Vulnerable Code):**

```kotlin
fun searchUsersByName(name: String): Query<UserModel> {
    val sanitizedName = name.replace("'", "''") // Attempt to escape single quotes
    val query = "SELECT * FROM User WHERE name = '$sanitizedName'"
    return database.userQueries.rawQuery(User.Adapter, query)
}
```

**Attack Scenario:**

While escaping single quotes might prevent simple injection, more sophisticated attacks can still be crafted. For example, using URL encoding or other encoding techniques might bypass this basic sanitization. Furthermore, simply replacing single quotes doesn't protect against other injection vectors.

**Impact:**  Depending on the bypass, potential for unauthorized data access, modification, or even more severe consequences.

**3. Misunderstanding the Scope of SQLDelight's Protection:**

Developers might mistakenly believe that using SQLDelight inherently protects them from all SQL injection vulnerabilities, even when using `rawQuery`. This misconception can lead to complacency and insecure coding practices.

**Attack Scenario:**  Developers might use `rawQuery` for convenience without fully considering the security implications, leading to vulnerabilities similar to the direct concatenation example.

**Impact:**  Unintentional introduction of SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**4. Using `rawQuery` for Complex Queries with User-Controlled Parameters:**

While `rawQuery` offers flexibility for complex queries, it becomes a risk when user input directly influences the structure or logic of the query.

**Example (Vulnerable Code):**

```kotlin
fun filterUsers(orderBy: String): Query<UserModel> {
    val query = "SELECT * FROM User ORDER BY $orderBy" // Vulnerable!
    return database.userQueries.rawQuery(User.Adapter, query)
}
```

**Attack Scenario:**

An attacker could provide input like `name DESC; DROP TABLE User; --`. This could lead to the execution of the `DROP TABLE` statement, causing significant data loss.

**Impact:** Data loss, application disruption, potential for further malicious actions.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To effectively defend against SQL injection vulnerabilities when using SQLDelight, especially with `rawQuery`, the following strategies are crucial:

* **Avoid `rawQuery` Whenever Possible:**  The primary recommendation is to leverage SQLDelight's generated code and parameterized queries whenever feasible. This significantly reduces the attack surface.

* **Parameterized Queries with `rawQuery`:** If `rawQuery` is absolutely necessary, **always** use parameterized queries. SQLDelight allows passing arguments to `rawQuery` that are properly escaped and handled by the underlying database driver.

   **Example (Secure Code):**

   ```kotlin
   fun searchUsersByName(name: String): Query<UserModel> {
       val query = "SELECT * FROM User WHERE name = ?"
       return database.userQueries.rawQuery(User.Adapter, query, arrayOf(name))
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `?` acts as a placeholder, and the `name` is passed as an argument. The database driver will handle the proper escaping, preventing SQL injection.

* **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**  If user input must be used in `rawQuery` even with parameters (e.g., for dynamic column names in `ORDER BY`), implement robust input validation and sanitization. This involves:
    * **Whitelisting:**  Only allow predefined, safe values.
    * **Data Type Validation:** Ensure input matches the expected data type.
    * **Encoding/Decoding:** Properly handle character encoding to prevent bypasses.
    * **Contextual Escaping:** Escape data based on the specific context within the SQL query.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the database user used by the application has only the necessary permissions to perform its intended operations. This limits the damage an attacker can inflict even if SQL injection is successful.

* **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews, specifically looking for instances of `rawQuery` and how user input is handled. Regular security audits can help identify potential vulnerabilities.

* **Penetration Testing:**  Engage security professionals to perform penetration testing on the application to identify and exploit potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  If the application is web-based, a WAF can help detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts before they reach the database.

* **Developer Education and Training:**  Educate developers on the risks of SQL injection and secure coding practices for using SQLDelight, particularly with `rawQuery`.

**Code Review Focus Points:**

When reviewing code that uses SQLDelight, pay close attention to:

* **Presence of `rawQuery`:**  Identify all instances of `rawQuery`.
* **String Concatenation within `rawQuery`:**  Look for any direct concatenation of user input into the SQL string.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Verify if and how user input is validated and sanitized before being used in `rawQuery`.
* **Parameter Usage in `rawQuery`:**  Ensure that parameters are used correctly for user-controlled values.
* **Complexity of `rawQuery` Queries:**  Assess if complex queries using `rawQuery` could be simplified using SQLDelight's generated code.

**Conclusion:**

While SQLDelight offers significant advantages in preventing SQL injection through its type-safe generated code, the `rawQuery` function introduces a potential vulnerability if not used carefully. Developers must be acutely aware of the risks associated with `rawQuery` and prioritize the use of parameterized queries. A combination of secure coding practices, thorough code reviews, and regular security testing is essential to mitigate the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities in applications using SQLDelight. By understanding the potential attack vectors and implementing robust mitigation strategies, the development team can ensure the security and integrity of their application's data.
