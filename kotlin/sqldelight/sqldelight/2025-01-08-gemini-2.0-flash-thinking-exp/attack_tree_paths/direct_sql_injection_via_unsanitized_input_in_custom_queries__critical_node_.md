## Deep Analysis: Direct SQL Injection via Unsanitized Input in Custom Queries (SQLDelight)

**Context:** This analysis focuses on a specific attack path within an application utilizing the SQLDelight library (https://github.com/sqldelight/sqldelight). The identified vulnerability is a **Direct SQL Injection** occurring when **unsanitized user-provided input is directly incorporated into custom SQL queries**. This is a **CRITICAL** vulnerability due to its potential for complete database compromise.

**Understanding the Vulnerability:**

SQLDelight is a powerful library that generates Kotlin typesafe APIs from SQL statements. However, it also provides mechanisms for executing raw SQL queries, primarily through methods like `rawQuery`. While this offers flexibility, it introduces significant security risks if not handled carefully.

The core problem lies in the direct concatenation of user-controlled data into the SQL query string. Without proper sanitization or parameterization, malicious users can inject arbitrary SQL code that will be executed by the database.

**Technical Deep Dive:**

Let's illustrate with a concrete example. Imagine an application that allows users to search for products by name. A vulnerable implementation might look like this:

```kotlin
import com.squareup.sqldelight.runtime.coroutines.asFlow
import com.squareup.sqldelight.runtime.coroutines.mapToList
import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.Flow

class ProductQueries(private val database: MyDatabase) {
    fun findProductsByNameUnsafe(name: String): Flow<List<Product>> {
        val query = "SELECT * FROM product WHERE name = '$name';" // VULNERABLE!
        return database.productQueries.rawQuery(query, emptyArray(), Product.Adapter.Impl)
            .asFlow()
            .mapToList()
    }
}
```

In this example, the `name` parameter, which could originate from user input (e.g., a search bar), is directly embedded into the SQL query string.

**Exploitation Scenario:**

A malicious user could provide the following input for the `name` parameter:

```
' OR 1=1 --
```

This input, when incorporated into the query, transforms it into:

```sql
SELECT * FROM product WHERE name = '' OR 1=1 --';
```

Let's break down what happens:

1. **`name = ''`**: This part is likely false, as it searches for products with an empty name.
2. **`OR 1=1`**: This condition is always true.
3. **`--'`**: This is a SQL comment. It effectively comments out the remaining part of the original query (`'`).

The resulting query effectively becomes `SELECT * FROM product WHERE 1=1;`, which will return **all rows** from the `product` table, bypassing the intended search functionality.

More sophisticated attacks can involve:

* **Data Exfiltration:** Injecting queries to extract sensitive data from other tables. For example: `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --`.
* **Data Modification:** Injecting queries to update or delete data. For example: `'; DELETE FROM product; --`.
* **Privilege Escalation:** If the database user has elevated privileges, attackers might be able to execute administrative commands.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Injecting resource-intensive queries to overload the database.

**Impact Assessment:**

The impact of this vulnerability is **severe**. A successful SQL injection attack can lead to:

* **Complete Database Compromise:** Attackers can gain full access to all data within the database, including sensitive user information, financial records, and business secrets.
* **Data Breach and Leakage:**  Stolen data can be sold, publicly released, or used for malicious purposes.
* **Data Integrity Loss:** Attackers can modify or delete critical data, leading to inaccurate information and business disruption.
* **Application Downtime:**  DoS attacks can render the application unavailable.
* **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and customer trust.
* **Legal and Compliance Issues:** Data breaches can lead to significant fines and legal repercussions under regulations like GDPR, CCPA, etc.

**Mitigation Strategies (Crucial for the Development Team):**

The primary defense against SQL injection is to **never directly embed user input into SQL query strings**. Instead, employ the following strategies:

1. **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** This is the **most effective** and recommended approach. Parameterized queries treat user input as data, not executable code. SQLDelight supports this mechanism.

   **Corrected Example using Parameterized Queries:**

   ```kotlin
   import com.squareup.sqldelight.runtime.coroutines.asFlow
   import com.squareup.sqldelight.runtime.coroutines.mapToList
   import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.Flow

   class ProductQueries(private val database: MyDatabase) {
       fun findProductsByNameSafe(name: String): Flow<List<Product>> {
           return database.productQueries.findProductsByName(name).asFlow().mapToList()
       }
   }

   // In your .sq file (e.g., Product.sq):
   // findProductsByName:
   // SELECT * FROM product WHERE name = ?;
   ```

   In this corrected example:
   * The SQL query in the `.sq` file uses a placeholder `?`.
   * SQLDelight generates a typesafe function `findProductsByName(name: String)` that handles the parameterization.
   * The `name` is passed as a parameter, ensuring it's treated as a string literal and not interpreted as SQL code.

2. **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While not a replacement for parameterized queries, validating and sanitizing user input can provide an additional layer of defense.

   * **Validation:** Ensure the input conforms to expected formats and constraints (e.g., maximum length, allowed characters).
   * **Sanitization (with caution):**  Carefully remove or escape potentially harmful characters. However, this is error-prone and should be used with extreme caution. **Parameterization is always preferred.**

3. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the database user account used by the application has only the necessary permissions to perform its tasks. Avoid using accounts with `root` or `DBA` privileges.

4. **Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Regularly review code, especially sections dealing with database interaction, to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. Utilize static analysis tools that can detect potential issues.

5. **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** If the application is web-based, a WAF can help detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts before they reach the application.

6. **Regular Security Testing (Penetration Testing):** Conduct penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify vulnerabilities.

**SQLDelight Specific Considerations:**

* **Generated Code is Generally Safe:** SQLDelight's primary strength is that it generates typesafe code from your `.sq` files. Queries defined in these files and used through the generated API are inherently protected against SQL injection because they utilize parameterized queries.
* **`rawQuery` is the Danger Zone:** The risk arises when developers use `rawQuery` or similar methods and manually construct SQL strings with user input. This bypasses the safety mechanisms provided by SQLDelight's generated code.
* **Be Mindful of Dynamic Query Building:** Even if not using `rawQuery` directly, be cautious when dynamically constructing parts of SQL queries based on user input. Ensure that any dynamically added conditions or clauses are properly sanitized or parameterized.

**Detection and Testing:**

* **Code Reviews:** Look for instances of `rawQuery` or string concatenation used to build SQL queries with user input.
* **Static Analysis Tools:** Tools like SonarQube, Checkmarx, or Fortify can identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* **Dynamic Testing:** Use tools like SQLMap to automatically test for SQL injection vulnerabilities by injecting various payloads into input fields. Manually test by trying common SQL injection payloads like:
    * `' OR '1'='1`
    * `'; DROP TABLE users; --`
    * `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --`

**Conclusion:**

The "Direct SQL Injection via Unsanitized Input in Custom Queries" attack path is a critical vulnerability in applications using SQLDelight. While SQLDelight's core functionality promotes secure database interaction through generated parameterized queries, the use of `rawQuery` introduces significant risk if not handled with extreme care.

**For the development team, the key takeaways are:**

* **Prioritize Parameterized Queries:** Always use parameterized queries for any user-provided input that interacts with the database. Leverage SQLDelight's generated API for this.
* **Avoid `rawQuery` with User Input:**  Minimize the use of `rawQuery` when dealing with user-controlled data. If absolutely necessary, ensure rigorous sanitization and validation are in place (though parameterization is still preferred).
* **Implement Comprehensive Security Practices:** Combine parameterized queries with input validation, the principle of least privilege, regular security audits, and penetration testing to build a robust defense against SQL injection attacks.

By understanding the risks and implementing proper mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the likelihood of successful SQL injection attacks and protect the application and its data.
