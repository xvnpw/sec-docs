# Attack Surface Analysis for sqldelight/sqldelight

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection via Malicious `.sq` File Modification](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_via_malicious___sq__file_modification.md)

* **Description:** An attacker gains access to the codebase and modifies `.sq` files to inject malicious SQL queries. When SQLDelight generates code, this malicious SQL becomes part of the application's data access layer.
    * **How SQLDelight Contributes:** SQLDelight directly parses and uses the content of `.sq` files to generate Kotlin code that executes SQL queries. If these files are compromised, the generated code will contain the malicious SQL.
    * **Example:** An attacker modifies a `User.sq` file to include a query like `DELETE FROM users; --`. When the application runs this generated code, it could delete all user data.
    * **Impact:** Critical. Could lead to complete data loss, data corruption, unauthorized data access, or denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict access controls and permissions on the development environment and codebase.
        * Use secure version control practices with access restrictions and audit logs.
        * Perform regular security code reviews of `.sq` files, especially after changes.
        * Employ code signing or other integrity checks to ensure the authenticity of `.sq` files.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Build Process Leading to Malicious Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/compromised_build_process_leading_to_malicious_code_injection.md)

* **Description:** An attacker compromises the build process (e.g., through a vulnerable build tool plugin or a supply chain attack on SQLDelight or its dependencies) to inject malicious code into the generated Kotlin files.
    * **How SQLDelight Contributes:** SQLDelight's code generation is a critical part of the build process. If this process is compromised, the generated code, which interacts directly with the database, can be manipulated.
    * **Example:** An attacker injects code into the SQLDelight Gradle plugin that adds a backdoor to the generated data access objects, allowing remote access to the database.
    * **Impact:** Critical. Could lead to complete control over the application's data and functionality, including data breaches and remote code execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement secure build pipelines with integrity checks for dependencies and build tools.
        * Regularly update SQLDelight and its dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * Use dependency scanning tools to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in the build process.
        * Employ reproducible builds to ensure the consistency and integrity of the build output.

## Attack Surface: [Circumventing Type Safety with Complex or Dynamic Queries](./attack_surfaces/circumventing_type_safety_with_complex_or_dynamic_queries.md)

* **Description:** While SQLDelight aims for type safety, complex or dynamically constructed queries might bypass some of these guarantees, potentially leading to unexpected SQL execution or vulnerabilities if not handled carefully.
    * **How SQLDelight Contributes:**  While SQLDelight enforces type safety on statically defined queries, highly dynamic queries or those using custom SQL functions might have weaker type checking, requiring more vigilance from the developer.
    * **Example:** A developer constructs a complex query involving multiple joins and subqueries where the type mapping isn't perfectly clear, leading to unexpected data being returned or a SQL error that could be exploited.
    * **Impact:** High. Could lead to data leaks or incorrect data processing.
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Favor statically defined queries whenever possible to leverage SQLDelight's type safety.
        * Thoroughly test complex and dynamic queries to ensure they behave as expected.
        * Use caution when incorporating custom SQL functions and ensure they are secure.
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization even when using SQLDelight.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Generated Code Logic](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_generated_code_logic.md)

* **Description:** Bugs or vulnerabilities might exist within the code generated by SQLDelight itself. While the library is generally well-maintained, the code generation process is complex, and potential flaws could be present.
    * **How SQLDelight Contributes:** SQLDelight is responsible for generating the code that interacts with the database. If the generation logic has flaws, those flaws will be present in the application's data access layer.
    * **Example:** A bug in SQLDelight's code generation for a specific type of query could lead to incorrect data handling or a SQL injection vulnerability in the generated code.
    * **Impact:** High. The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the generated code, potentially leading to data corruption or information disclosure.
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Stay updated with the latest versions of SQLDelight to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        * Monitor SQLDelight's issue tracker and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities.
        * Perform thorough testing of the application's data access layer, including the generated code.
