# Threat Model Analysis for sqldelight/sqldelight

## Threat: [Malicious Schema Injection](./threats/malicious_schema_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker with unauthorized access to the project's source code repository or build environment could modify the `.sq` files. This involves directly altering the SQL schema definitions that SQLDelight uses to generate code. This could involve injecting malicious SQL queries, altering data types to create vulnerabilities, or introducing schema flaws that lead to exploitable code generation.

**Impact:** Introduction of SQL injection vulnerabilities within the application's data access layer, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. This can have critical consequences for data integrity and confidentiality.

**Affected SQLDelight Component:** SQLDelight Compiler, Schema Definition Files (`.sq` files).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong access controls and multi-factor authentication for the source code repository and build pipeline.
*   Enforce mandatory code review processes for all changes to schema definition files, with a focus on security implications.
*   Utilize version control systems with robust change tracking and access logging for schema files.
*   Automate build processes and limit manual interventions to reduce the risk of unauthorized modifications.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Generated Code](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_generated_code.md)

**Description:** An attacker could discover and exploit vulnerabilities within the Kotlin code automatically generated by the SQLDelight compiler. This involves finding flaws in how SQLDelight translates SQL schema and queries into executable Kotlin code. These vulnerabilities could be due to bugs in the SQLDelight compiler itself or unexpected edge cases in SQL syntax handling that lead to insecure code generation.

**Impact:**  Depending on the nature of the vulnerability, this could lead to unintended database operations, data corruption, application crashes, or in severe cases, potentially remote code execution if the generated code interacts with other vulnerable parts of the application or exposes exploitable interfaces.

**Affected SQLDelight Component:** SQLDelight Compiler, Generated Kotlin Code.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the SQLDelight library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches released by the maintainers.
*   Thoroughly test the application, including database interactions, to identify any unexpected behavior or crashes that might indicate vulnerabilities in the generated code.
*   Consider using static analysis tools on the generated Kotlin code to identify potential security flaws.
*   Report any suspected vulnerabilities in SQLDelight's code generation to the project maintainers through their established channels.
