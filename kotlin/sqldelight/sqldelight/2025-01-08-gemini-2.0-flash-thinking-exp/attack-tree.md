## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using SQLDelight (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_sqldelight__critical_node_.md)

*   This represents the attacker's ultimate goal. Successful exploitation of any of the underlying vulnerabilities can lead to this compromise. The impact is the complete compromise of the application, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities via SQLDelight (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities_via_sqldelight__critical_node_.md)

*   This node represents the category of attacks that leverage SQL injection vulnerabilities within the application's interaction with the database through SQLDelight. While SQLDelight aims to mitigate SQL injection, improper usage, particularly with `rawQuery`, can reintroduce this risk.

## Attack Tree Path: [Direct SQL Injection via Unsanitized Input in Custom Queries (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/direct_sql_injection_via_unsanitized_input_in_custom_queries__critical_node_.md)

*   This specific attack vector focuses on the use of custom SQL queries (e.g., using `rawQuery` or similar methods) where user-provided input is directly incorporated into the SQL query string without proper sanitization or parameterization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious SQL in `rawQuery` or similar methods (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_sql_in__rawquery__or_similar_methods__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the concrete action the attacker takes. By manipulating user input, the attacker crafts malicious SQL fragments that are then injected into the intended query. This can alter the query's logic, allowing the attacker to bypass security checks or access/modify data they should not.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass intended query logic to access/modify data (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_intended_query_logic_to_accessmodify_data__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This represents the successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability. The attacker's injected SQL is executed by the database, allowing them to perform unauthorized actions such as:
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Accessing and retrieving sensitive data from the database.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting data within the database.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Potentially gaining access to more privileged database accounts.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Revealing database schema or other internal information.
