Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Raw String SQL Injection" threat, tailored for a development team using SQLDelight, as per your provided threat model:

## Deep Analysis: Raw String SQL Injection in SQLDelight

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the mechanics of how a raw string SQL injection vulnerability can manifest within a SQLDelight-based application.
*   Identify specific code patterns and practices that are susceptible to this vulnerability.
*   Provide actionable recommendations and concrete examples to prevent and remediate this threat.
*   Establish clear guidelines for developers to follow, minimizing the risk of introducing this vulnerability.
*   Enhance the overall security posture of the application by eliminating this critical vulnerability class.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on SQL injection vulnerabilities arising from the misuse of raw strings within the context of SQLDelight.  It covers:

*   `.sq` files:  The primary location where SQL queries are defined in SQLDelight.
*   Kotlin/Java/Swift code:  Code that interacts with the SQLDelight generated database interface, specifically focusing on how queries are executed and how parameters are (or are not) bound.
*   SQLDelight API:  Analysis of the API methods related to query execution and parameter binding, highlighting safe and unsafe practices.
*   Configuration: Review of SQLDelight configuration that might influence the risk or mitigation of this threat.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   SQL injection vulnerabilities outside the scope of SQLDelight (e.g., in other parts of the application that might interact with the database directly).
*   Other types of injection attacks (e.g., command injection, XSS).
*   General database security best practices (e.g., user permissions, network security) beyond the immediate context of preventing SQL injection via SQLDelight.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Definition:**  Precisely define the vulnerability and its potential impact. (This is largely covered by the provided threat model entry, but we'll expand on it).
2.  **Code Pattern Analysis:**  Identify vulnerable code patterns in both `.sq` files and application code (Kotlin/Java/Swift).  Provide concrete examples of *incorrect* and *correct* code.
3.  **SQLDelight API Review:**  Examine the relevant parts of the SQLDelight API, highlighting methods that are safe (when used correctly) and those that could be misused to introduce vulnerabilities.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Deep Dive:**  Expand on the mitigation strategies provided in the threat model, providing detailed guidance and practical examples.
5.  **Static Analysis Configuration:**  Provide specific recommendations for configuring static analysis tools to detect this vulnerability.
6.  **Testing Strategies:** Suggest testing approaches to identify and confirm the absence of this vulnerability.
7.  **Developer Guidance:**  Create a concise checklist or set of rules for developers to follow.

### 2. Vulnerability Definition (Expanded)

Raw string SQL injection in the context of SQLDelight occurs when attacker-controlled data is directly incorporated into a SQL query string *without* using SQLDelight's parameterized query mechanism.  This bypasses SQLDelight's built-in defenses against SQL injection.  The key difference from a "traditional" SQL injection is that we're focusing on misuse *within* a framework designed to prevent it.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a user search feature.  A naive (and vulnerable) implementation might look like this:

**Vulnerable `.sq` file (userSearch.sq):**

```sql
-- DO NOT DO THIS!  VULNERABLE!
searchUsers:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?; -- Placeholder is good, but...
```

**Vulnerable Kotlin code:**

```kotlin
// DO NOT DO THIS!  VULNERABLE!
fun searchUsers(username: String): List<User> {
    // The problem is HERE: String concatenation bypasses parameterization.
    val query = database.userSearchQueries.searchUsers(username) // Correct usage
    return query.executeAsList()
}

fun searchUsersVulnerable(username: String): List<User> {
    // The problem is HERE: String concatenation bypasses parameterization.
    val statement = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username'"
    val query = database.userSearchQueries.searchUsers(statement) // Incorrect usage
    return query.executeAsList()
}
```

An attacker could input a `username` like: `' OR '1'='1`.  This would result in the following query being executed:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1'
```

This query would return *all* users, bypassing any intended filtering.  More sophisticated attacks could extract sensitive data, modify data, or even execute commands.

### 3. Code Pattern Analysis

**Vulnerable Patterns:**

*   **String Concatenation/Interpolation in Kotlin/Java/Swift:**  The most common culprit.  Any code that builds a SQL query string using `+`, `String.format()`, string interpolation (`"$variable"`), or similar methods *before* passing it to SQLDelight is highly suspect.
*   **Misuse of `rawSql` (if available):**  If SQLDelight provides any mechanism for executing raw SQL strings (check the documentation), its use should be extremely rare and heavily scrutinized.  It's a direct bypass of the framework's protection.
*   **Dynamic Query Generation:**  If the application needs to construct queries dynamically (e.g., based on user input for filtering or sorting), this must be done *very* carefully, using SQLDelight's API to build the query components and bind parameters correctly.  Avoid building the entire query string from scratch.
*   **Incorrect Placeholder Usage:** Even with placeholders in `.sq` files, if the application code doesn't use the corresponding `bind` methods correctly, the vulnerability remains.

**Correct Patterns:**

*   **`.sq` File Parameterization:**  Always use `?` placeholders in `.sq` files for *all* values that come from external sources (user input, configuration files, etc.).

    ```sql
    -- Correct:
    searchUsers:
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?;

    findUserById:
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?;

    insertUser:
    INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (?, ?);
    ```

*   **SQLDelight API Usage:**  Use the generated API methods correctly, relying on SQLDelight to handle parameter binding.

    ```kotlin
    // Correct:
    fun searchUsers(username: String): List<User> {
        return database.userSearchQueries.searchUsers(username).executeAsList()
    }

    fun findUserById(id: Long): User? {
        return database.userSearchQueries.findUserById(id).executeAsOneOrNull()
    }

    fun insertUser(username: String, passwordHash: String) {
        database.userSearchQueries.insertUser(username, passwordHash)
    }
    ```

*   **Dynamic Query Building (Safe Example):** If you *must* build queries dynamically, do it piece by piece using SQLDelight's API.

    ```kotlin
    // Safe dynamic query building (example - might need adaptation)
    fun searchUsers(username: String?, email: String?): List<User> {
        val queryBuilder = database.userQueries.selectAll().newBuilder() // Hypothetical API

        if (username != null) {
            queryBuilder.where("username = ?", username) // Hypothetical API
        }
        if (email != null) {
            queryBuilder.where("email = ?", email) // Hypothetical API
        }

        return queryBuilder.build().executeAsList() // Hypothetical API
    }
    ```
    *Important Note:* The above `newBuilder`, `where`, and `build` methods are *hypothetical*.  You'll need to adapt this to the actual SQLDelight API for building queries programmatically, if it exists.  The key principle is to use the API to construct the query, *not* string concatenation.

### 4. SQLDelight API Review

The core of SQLDelight's protection lies in its generated code and the methods it provides for executing queries.  Here's a breakdown of relevant API aspects:

*   **Generated Query Classes:** SQLDelight generates classes (e.g., `UserSearchQueries` in our example) based on your `.sq` files.  These classes contain methods for each defined query.
*   **`executeAsOne`, `executeAsList`, `executeAsOneOrNull`:** These methods execute queries and return results.  They are *safe* when used with properly parameterized queries in `.sq` files.
*   **`bindString`, `bindLong`, `bindBoolean`, etc.:**  These methods (or their equivalents) are used internally by SQLDelight to bind values to the `?` placeholders.  Developers typically don't call these directly when using `.sq` files, but they are crucial to understanding how SQLDelight works.
*   **`rawSql` (Hypothetical):**  If a `rawSql` method or similar exists, it should be avoided or used with extreme caution.  It bypasses parameterization.
*  **Programmatic Query Building API:** SQLDelight might offer an API to build queries programmatically. If it exists, it should be used instead of string concatenation.

### 5. Mitigation Strategy Deep Dive

Let's expand on the mitigation strategies from the threat model:

*   **Strictly Enforce Parameterized Queries:**
    *   **Policy:**  Establish a clear, written policy that *all* SQL queries executed through SQLDelight *must* use parameterized queries.  This should be part of the coding standards.
    *   **`.sq` File Guidelines:**  Provide clear examples and guidelines for writing `.sq` files, emphasizing the use of `?` placeholders.
    *   **Code Review Checklist:**  Include a specific item in the code review checklist to verify the use of parameterized queries.

*   **Code Reviews:**
    *   **Focus:**  Code reviewers should be specifically trained to identify any instance of string concatenation or interpolation used to build SQL queries.
    *   **Tools:**  Use code review tools that can highlight string operations, making it easier to spot potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Second Reviewer:**  For any code that involves dynamic query generation, consider requiring a second reviewer with security expertise.

*   **Static Analysis:**
    *   **Tool Selection:**  Choose static analysis tools that can analyze both `.sq` files and Kotlin/Java/Swift code.  Examples include:
        *   **IntelliJ IDEA/Android Studio Inspections:**  These IDEs have built-in inspections that can detect some forms of string concatenation in SQL contexts.
        *   **SonarQube:**  A popular static analysis platform that can be configured with custom rules to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **FindBugs/SpotBugs:**  Java-focused static analysis tools that can be extended with custom detectors.
        *   **SwiftLint:**  A linter for Swift code that can be customized with rules.
        *   **Detekt:** A static analysis tool for Kotlin.
    *   **Custom Rules:**  You will likely need to create *custom rules* for your static analysis tools to specifically target SQLDelight usage.  These rules should:
        *   **Flag string concatenation/interpolation within `.sq` files (outside of comments).**
        *   **Flag string concatenation/interpolation used as arguments to SQLDelight API methods (especially those related to query execution).**
        *   **Flag the use of any `rawSql` or similar methods (if they exist).**
    *   **Integration:**  Integrate static analysis into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan code for vulnerabilities on every commit.

*   **Developer Training:**
    *   **Curriculum:**  Develop a training curriculum that covers:
        *   The basics of SQL injection.
        *   How SQLDelight prevents SQL injection through parameterized queries.
        *   Examples of vulnerable and secure code patterns.
        *   How to use the static analysis tools.
        *   The importance of code reviews.
    *   **Hands-on Exercises:**  Include hands-on exercises where developers practice writing secure SQLDelight code and identifying vulnerabilities in existing code.
    *   **Regular Refreshers:**  Provide regular refresher training to keep developers up-to-date on best practices.

*   **Prohibit/Restrict Raw String Functions:**
    *   **Policy:**  If SQLDelight provides any functions that accept raw SQL strings, strongly consider prohibiting their use entirely.
    *   **Justification:**  If such functions *must* be used, require a detailed justification and a thorough security review.
    *   **Alternatives:**  Explore alternative approaches using SQLDelight's parameterized query mechanisms or programmatic query building API.

### 6. Testing Strategies

*   **Unit Tests:**
    *   Write unit tests that specifically target the data access layer (where SQLDelight is used).
    *   Include tests with malicious input to verify that SQL injection is not possible.  Use a variety of attack vectors (e.g., `' OR '1'='1`, `' UNION SELECT ...`, etc.).
    *   Assert that the correct data is returned (or not returned) and that no unexpected errors occur.

*   **Integration Tests:**
    *   Test the entire application flow, including user input and database interaction.
    *   Use similar malicious input as in the unit tests.

*   **Fuzz Testing:**
    *   Use a fuzz testing tool to generate a large number of random or semi-random inputs and feed them to the application.
    *   Monitor the application for crashes, errors, or unexpected behavior that might indicate a vulnerability.

*   **Penetration Testing:**
    *   Engage a security professional to perform penetration testing on the application.
    *   This is a more comprehensive test that can identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by other testing methods.
