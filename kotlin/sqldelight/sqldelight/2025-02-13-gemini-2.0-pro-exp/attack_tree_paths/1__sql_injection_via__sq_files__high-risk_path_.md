Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, formatted as Markdown:

# Deep Analysis of SQL Injection Attack Tree Path (SQLDelight)

## 1. Define Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the attack tree path related to SQL Injection vulnerabilities within a SQLDelight-based application, specifically focusing on how attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in `.sq` files.  We aim to:

*   Identify the specific mechanisms by which an attacker could bypass SQLDelight's intended security features.
*   Assess the likelihood, impact, effort, skill level, and detection difficulty associated with this attack path.
*   Provide concrete examples of vulnerable and secure code.
*   Recommend specific mitigation strategies and best practices to prevent this type of attack.
*   Provide recommendations for testing.

## 2. Scope

This analysis is limited to the following:

*   **SQLDelight:**  We are specifically focusing on applications using the SQLDelight library for database interaction.
*   **.sq Files:**  The analysis centers on vulnerabilities arising from the misuse of `.sq` files, where SQL queries are defined.
*   **Untrusted Input:** We assume the application receives input from untrusted sources (e.g., web forms, API requests, external data feeds).
*   **Kotlin/JVM:** While SQLDelight supports multiple platforms, this analysis will primarily use Kotlin/JVM examples for clarity, but the principles apply broadly.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path:  SQL Injection via .sq Files

### 4.1. Overall Description

This attack path represents a high-risk scenario where attackers can inject malicious SQL code into the application's database by exploiting vulnerabilities in how user input is handled within SQLDelight's `.sq` files.  The core issue is the circumvention of SQLDelight's type-safe query generation through improper string handling.

### 4.2. 1.1 Untrusted Input in .sq Files [CRITICAL]

*   **Description:** This is the foundational vulnerability.  It occurs when user-supplied data is directly incorporated into SQL queries defined in `.sq` files *without* proper sanitization or, crucially, *without using SQLDelight's parameterized query mechanism*.  This is a direct violation of secure coding principles and opens the door to SQL injection.

*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High.  Developers unfamiliar with SQL injection or those who mistakenly believe that using `.sq` files inherently provides protection are likely to introduce this vulnerability.

*   **Impact:** High to Very High.  Successful SQL injection can lead to:
    *   **Data Breaches:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data (user credentials, financial information, etc.).
    *   **Data Modification:**  Alteration or deletion of data.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:**  Stealing data from the database.
    *   **Denial of Service:**  Making the database unavailable.
    *   **System Compromise:**  In some cases, gaining control of the database server or even the application server.

*   **Effort:** Low to Medium.  Exploiting this vulnerability is relatively straightforward, especially with readily available tools and techniques.

*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.  While basic SQL injection is well-known, crafting sophisticated attacks to bypass specific defenses might require more skill.

*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.  Static analysis tools can often detect this pattern, but dynamic testing and code review are essential.

### 4.3. 1.1.1 Bypassing SQLDelight's Type Safety (e.g., using string interpolation in raw SQL) [CRITICAL]

*   **Description:** This is the most common and dangerous manifestation of the vulnerability.  Developers might use string concatenation or interpolation (e.g., `${userInput}` in Kotlin) to build SQL queries *within* the `.sq` file.  This completely bypasses SQLDelight's type safety and parameterized query features, rendering them useless.  The developer is essentially writing raw SQL, but with the added danger of believing it's protected.

*   **Example (Vulnerable):**

    ```sql
    -- In getUser.sq
    getUser:
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${userInput}';
    ```
    If `userInput` is controlled by an attacker, they can inject arbitrary SQL.  For example, if `userInput` is set to `' OR '1'='1`, the query becomes:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1';
    ```
    This will return *all* users, bypassing authentication.  More sophisticated payloads could delete tables, insert malicious data, or exfiltrate sensitive information.

*   **Example (Safe):**

    ```sql
    -- In getUser.sq
    getUser:
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?;
    ```
    ```kotlin
    // Kotlin code
    val statement = database.userQueries.getUser(userInput)
    val user = statement.executeAsOneOrNull()
    ```
    In this safe example, the `?` acts as a placeholder.  SQLDelight, *at runtime*, will correctly escape and bind the `userInput` value to this placeholder, preventing SQL injection.  The database driver handles the escaping, ensuring that the user input is treated as data, not as part of the SQL command.

*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High.  This is a common mistake, especially for developers new to SQLDelight or those transitioning from less secure database access methods.

*   **Impact:** High to Very High.  The impact is the same as described in 4.2.

*   **Effort:** Low to Medium.  The effort to exploit this is low, as it relies on basic SQL injection techniques.

*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.  Basic SQL injection knowledge is sufficient.

*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.  Static analysis tools that understand SQLDelight's `.sq` file format and Kotlin's string interpolation can be effective.  However, manual code review and dynamic testing are crucial.

## 5. Mitigation Strategies

1.  **Parameterized Queries (Always):**  *Never* use string concatenation or interpolation to build SQL queries within `.sq` files.  Always use the `?` placeholder syntax for parameters, and pass user input as arguments to the generated query functions. This is the *single most important* mitigation.

2.  **Input Validation (Defense in Depth):**  While parameterization is the primary defense, validate user input *before* it even reaches the database layer.  This adds an extra layer of security and can prevent other types of attacks (e.g., XSS).  Validate for:
    *   **Data Type:**  Ensure the input is of the expected type (e.g., integer, string, date).
    *   **Length:**  Limit the length of the input to a reasonable maximum.
    *   **Format:**  Enforce specific formats where appropriate (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers).
    *   **Allowed Characters:**  Restrict the set of allowed characters to prevent the injection of special characters used in SQL injection attacks.

3.  **Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the database user account used by the application has the *minimum* necessary privileges.  Don't use a database administrator account.  This limits the potential damage from a successful SQL injection attack.

4.  **Code Reviews:**  Conduct thorough code reviews, specifically looking for any instances of string concatenation or interpolation within `.sq` files.  Educate developers about the dangers of SQL injection and the proper use of SQLDelight.

5.  **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools that can detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.  Many modern IDEs and CI/CD pipelines have built-in support for static analysis.  Look for tools that specifically understand SQLDelight and Kotlin.

6.  **Dynamic Analysis (Penetration Testing):**  Perform regular penetration testing, including attempts to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities.  This helps identify weaknesses that might be missed by static analysis and code reviews.

7.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Consider using a WAF to filter out malicious requests that might contain SQL injection attempts.  A WAF can provide an additional layer of defense, but it should not be relied upon as the sole protection.

8. **Regular Updates:** Keep SQLDelight and all related libraries (database drivers, etc.) up-to-date to benefit from the latest security patches.

## 6. Testing Recommendations

1.  **Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests that specifically attempt to inject malicious SQL code through user input fields.  These tests should verify that the application correctly handles invalid input and prevents SQL injection.  Focus on testing the *boundaries* of input validation (e.g., maximum length, special characters).

2.  **Integration Tests:**  Perform integration tests that interact with the database to ensure that parameterized queries are being used correctly and that data is being handled securely.

3.  **Fuzz Testing:**  Use fuzz testing techniques to automatically generate a large number of random inputs and test the application's resilience to unexpected data.  This can help uncover edge cases and vulnerabilities that might be missed by manual testing.

4.  **SQL Injection Testing Tools:**  Use specialized SQL injection testing tools (e.g., sqlmap) to automate the process of finding and exploiting vulnerabilities.  These tools can be used as part of penetration testing.

## 7. Code Review Guidance

During code reviews, pay close attention to the following:

*   **`.sq` Files:**  Scrutinize all `.sq` files for any use of string concatenation or interpolation (e.g., `${...}`, `+` operator) within SQL queries.  Ensure that *all* user-supplied data is passed as parameters using the `?` placeholder.
*   **Kotlin Code:**  Examine the Kotlin code that interacts with the generated SQLDelight query functions.  Verify that user input is being passed as arguments to these functions and not being used to construct SQL strings directly.
*   **Input Validation:**  Check that input validation is being performed *before* data is passed to the database layer.  Look for validation of data type, length, format, and allowed characters.
*   **Error Handling:** Ensure that database errors are handled gracefully and do not reveal sensitive information to the user.

By following these guidelines, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities in their SQLDelight-based application. The key takeaway is to *always* use parameterized queries and *never* trust user input.
