# Deep Analysis: Denial of Service (Unbounded/Complex Queries) in SQLDelight

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly examine the risk of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks stemming from unbounded or computationally complex SQL queries defined within SQLDelight's `.sq` files.  We will identify specific vulnerabilities, assess their impact, and propose concrete mitigation strategies beyond the high-level overview.  The goal is to provide actionable guidance for developers to secure their SQLDelight-based applications against this attack vector.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following:

*   **SQLDelight `.sq` files:**  The primary target is the SQL query definitions within these files.  We are *not* analyzing general database security or the Kotlin/Java code that *calls* these queries (except where that code directly influences the query construction).
*   **Unbounded Queries:**  Queries lacking a `LIMIT` clause (or equivalent mechanism) that could potentially return a very large number of rows.
*   **Complex Queries:** Queries that, even with a `LIMIT` clause, could consume excessive database resources (CPU, memory, I/O) due to their structure (e.g., multiple joins, full-text searches without appropriate indexes, inefficient `WHERE` clauses).
*   **Denial of Service:**  The specific impact we are concerned with is making the application unavailable to legitimate users due to database resource exhaustion.
* **sqldelight/sqldelight** library: We are focusing on attack surface that is related to this library.

We explicitly *exclude* the following from this deep analysis:

*   **SQL Injection:**  While related to SQL, this is a separate attack vector and is not the focus here. SQLDelight's parameterized queries generally protect against SQL injection.
*   **Database Server Configuration:**  We assume the database server itself is reasonably configured.  This analysis focuses on the application-level vulnerabilities within the SQLDelight usage.
*   **Network-Level DoS:**  This analysis is concerned with application-level DoS caused by database queries, not network-level attacks.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  We will examine example `.sq` files and identify patterns that indicate potential vulnerabilities.  This includes searching for missing `LIMIT` clauses, complex joins, and inefficient `WHERE` clauses.
2.  **Query Analysis:**  We will use database profiling tools (e.g., `EXPLAIN` in many SQL databases) to analyze the execution plans of potentially problematic queries. This helps determine the actual resource consumption.
3.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will consider how an attacker might exploit these vulnerabilities, including the types of inputs or actions that could trigger unbounded or complex queries.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**  We will refine the high-level mitigation strategies into specific, actionable recommendations for developers.
5.  **Tooling Recommendations:** We will suggest tools that can assist in identifying and mitigating these vulnerabilities.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface

### 4.1.  Unbounded Queries

**Vulnerability Pattern:**  The most obvious vulnerability is the absence of a `LIMIT` clause (or a similar mechanism like `FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY`) in `SELECT` statements that could potentially return a large number of rows.

**Example (Vulnerable):**

```sql
-- products.sq
getAllProducts:
SELECT * FROM products;  -- No LIMIT!

findProductsByName:
SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE ?; -- No LIMIT, and LIKE with leading wildcard is slow.
```

**Explanation:**

*   `getAllProducts`:  If the `products` table contains thousands or millions of rows, this query will attempt to retrieve all of them, potentially overwhelming the database and the application.
*   `findProductsByName`:  Even if the `name` column is indexed, a `LIKE` query with a leading wildcard (e.g., `'%keyword%'`) cannot efficiently use the index.  Without a `LIMIT`, this query could scan the entire table.

**Threat Model:**

An attacker could repeatedly call an API endpoint that uses `getAllProducts` or `findProductsByName` (with a broad search term) to exhaust database resources.  Even a single, very large request could cause a DoS.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Mandatory `LIMIT`:**  Enforce a strict coding standard that requires a `LIMIT` clause on *all* `SELECT` statements in `.sq` files, unless there's a very strong justification (and review process) for its omission.  The limit should be chosen based on the application's needs and the expected data volume.
*   **Pagination:**  For cases where a large result set is expected, implement pagination.  This involves using `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` (or equivalent) to retrieve data in smaller chunks.  SQLDelight supports this.
    ```sql
    -- products.sq (Paginated)
    getProductsPage:
    SELECT * FROM products LIMIT ? OFFSET ?;
    ```
    The application code would then provide the `LIMIT` (page size) and `OFFSET` (starting row) values.
* **Input validation:** Even with pagination, validate the `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` values provided by the client to prevent excessively large values.

### 4.2. Complex Queries

**Vulnerability Pattern:**  Queries that, even with a `LIMIT`, are computationally expensive due to their structure.  This often involves:

*   **Multiple Joins:**  Joining many tables, especially without proper indexes on the join columns.
*   **Inefficient `WHERE` Clauses:**  Using functions on indexed columns, `OR` conditions that prevent index usage, or full-text searches without appropriate indexes.
*   **Subqueries:**  Poorly optimized subqueries, especially correlated subqueries.
*   **`ORDER BY` on Large Result Sets:**  Sorting a large number of rows before applying the `LIMIT` can be expensive.

**Example (Vulnerable):**

```sql
-- orders.sq
findOrdersWithDetails:
SELECT *
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE p.description LIKE '%keyword%'  -- Inefficient LIKE
  AND c.city = ?
ORDER BY o.order_date DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Multiple Joins:**  This query joins four tables.  If any of the join columns (`order_id`, `product_id`, `customer_id`) are not properly indexed, the query will be slow.
*   **Inefficient `LIKE`:**  The `LIKE '%keyword%'` clause prevents efficient index usage on the `products.description` column.
*   **`ORDER BY` Before `LIMIT`:**  The database might sort a large intermediate result set by `order_date` *before* applying the `LIMIT 100`, which is wasteful.

**Threat Model:**

An attacker could craft requests that trigger this complex query with specific `keyword` and `city` values that maximize the query's execution time.  Repeated requests could lead to DoS.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Indexing:**  Ensure that all columns used in `JOIN` conditions and frequently used in `WHERE` clauses are properly indexed.  Use database-specific tools to analyze query execution plans and identify missing indexes.
*   **Full-Text Search Indexes:**  For `LIKE` queries on text columns, use full-text search indexes (if supported by the database).  This significantly improves performance compared to wildcard `LIKE` queries.
*   **Query Optimization:**  Rewrite the query to be more efficient.  This might involve:
    *   Avoiding unnecessary joins.
    *   Using more specific `WHERE` clauses.
    *   Pushing the `LIMIT` clause down into subqueries (if possible).
    *   Re-ordering `JOIN` operations.
    *   Using `EXISTS` instead of `JOIN` for certain checks.
*   **Avoid `ORDER BY` on Large Sets Before `LIMIT`:** If possible, restructure the query to apply the `ORDER BY` *after* a more restrictive `WHERE` clause or a subquery that already limits the result set.
* **Timeout:** Set reasonable timeout for queries.

### 4.3. Tooling Recommendations

*   **Static Analysis Tools:**
    *   **Custom Scripts:**  Write scripts (e.g., using `grep` or a simple parser) to scan `.sq` files for missing `LIMIT` clauses.
    *   **Linting Tools:**  Explore integrating SQL linting tools (e.g., `sqlfluff`) into the build process to enforce coding standards and identify potential query issues.
*   **Database Profiling Tools:**
    *   **`EXPLAIN` (or equivalent):**  Use the database's built-in query analyzer to examine execution plans and identify performance bottlenecks.
    *   **Database Monitoring Tools:**  Use database-specific monitoring tools (e.g., MySQL's Performance Schema, PostgreSQL's `pg_stat_statements`) to track query execution times and resource consumption.
*   **Load Testing Tools:**
    *   **JMeter, Gatling:**  Use load testing tools to simulate realistic user traffic and identify performance issues under load.  This can help reveal DoS vulnerabilities.

## 5. Conclusion

Denial of Service attacks targeting SQLDelight applications through unbounded or complex queries are a serious threat.  By diligently reviewing and optimizing the SQL queries defined in `.sq` files, enforcing the use of `LIMIT` clauses, and leveraging appropriate database indexing and query optimization techniques, developers can significantly mitigate this risk.  The use of static analysis, database profiling, and load testing tools is crucial for identifying and addressing these vulnerabilities proactively.  A combination of preventative measures (coding standards, query reviews) and detective measures (monitoring, load testing) is essential for ensuring the availability and resilience of SQLDelight-based applications.
