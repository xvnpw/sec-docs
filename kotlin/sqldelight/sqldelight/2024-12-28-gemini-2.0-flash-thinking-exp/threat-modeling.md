Here is the updated threat list, focusing on high and critical threats directly involving SQLDelight:

*   **Threat:** Malicious SQLDelight Plugin Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker could compromise the SQLDelight Gradle plugin repository or a developer's build environment and replace the legitimate plugin with a malicious version. This malicious plugin, when used during the build process, would inject arbitrary code into the generated Kotlin/Java files.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the application's runtime environment. This could lead to data exfiltration, unauthorized access to resources, modification of data, or even complete control over the application.
    *   **Affected SQLDelight Component:** Gradle Plugin
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Verify the integrity of the SQLDelight plugin source and distribution using checksums or signatures.
        *   Use dependency management tools with strict version control and vulnerability scanning.
        *   Consider using a private or internal repository for dependencies to control the supply chain.
        *   Regularly update the SQLDelight plugin to benefit from security patches and improvements.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in SQLDelight Code Generation Logic
    *   **Description:** Bugs or vulnerabilities within the SQLDelight code generation logic could lead to the generation of insecure code. For example, incorrect escaping of string literals could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities even when using the generated type-safe API. An attacker could craft specific SQL schema or queries in `.sq` files that exploit these vulnerabilities during code generation.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of SQL injection vulnerabilities, potentially allowing attackers to bypass the intended data access layer and execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database. This could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected SQLDelight Component:** Code Generator (within the Gradle Plugin)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with the latest SQLDelight releases, which often include bug fixes and security improvements.
        *   Thoroughly test the generated code and the application's interaction with the database, including security testing for SQL injection.
        *   Report any suspected vulnerabilities in SQLDelight's code generation to the maintainers.
        *   Consider static analysis tools to scan the generated code for potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Database Schema Migrations
    *   **Description:** An attacker with access to the migration files or the migration process could introduce malicious changes to the database schema. This could involve adding new tables with vulnerabilities, altering existing table structures to expose sensitive data, or introducing malicious triggers that execute arbitrary code within the database.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, data breaches, introduction of new vulnerabilities within the database layer, or denial of service if migrations cause database instability.
    *   **Affected SQLDelight Component:** Schema Management (through `.sq` files and the `Schema` interface)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a robust and auditable process for creating and applying database schema migrations.
        *   Use version control for migration files and require code reviews for all changes.
        *   Restrict access to the database schema management process to authorized personnel.
        *   Test all migration scripts thoroughly in a non-production environment before applying them to production.
        *   Consider using database features for schema change tracking and rollback capabilities.

*   **Threat:** Misuse of `unsafe` Functions or Raw SQL Queries
    *   **Description:** SQLDelight provides escape hatches for using raw SQL or functions marked as `unsafe`. Developers might use these features without proper sanitization or validation of user inputs, reintroducing SQL injection vulnerabilities that SQLDelight's type-safe API aims to prevent. An attacker could exploit these areas by providing malicious input that is directly incorporated into raw SQL queries.
    *   **Impact:** SQL injection vulnerabilities leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or unauthorized access to the database.
    *   **Affected SQLDelight Component:** `Query` interface, `Adapter` implementations (if custom SQL is used)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Minimize the use of `unsafe` functions and raw SQL queries.
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate any user input used in raw SQL queries using parameterized queries or prepared statements (even within raw SQL).
        *   Conduct security reviews of any code using `unsafe` functions or raw SQL.
        *   Consider using alternative approaches that leverage SQLDelight's type-safe API whenever possible.
