## Attack Tree Path: [Attack: Compromise Application Using SQLDelight [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/attack_compromise_application_using_sqldelight__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the root goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application using SQLDelight as a vector.
*   **Why Critical:** Represents the ultimate failure from a security perspective. All subsequent high-risk paths lead to this node.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Code Generation Vulnerabilities -> 2.4. Dependency Vulnerabilities in Generated Code Dependencies [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_code_generation_vulnerabilities_-_2_4__dependency_vulnerabilities_in_generated_code_depen_b1567da5.md)

*   **Description:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities not directly in SQLDelight's core logic, but in the dependencies that the *generated code* relies upon at runtime.
*   **Why High Risk:**
    *   **Common Vulnerabilities:** Dependency vulnerabilities are frequently discovered and exploited.
    *   **Indirect Impact:**  Vulnerabilities in dependencies can be less obvious to developers focusing primarily on their own code and SQLDelight usage.
    *   **Wide Reach:** A vulnerability in a widely used dependency (like a database driver) can impact many applications.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **2.4.1. Vulnerabilities in runtime dependencies (e.g., SQLite JDBC driver) [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting known security vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs) in libraries used by the generated Kotlin code at runtime. For example, vulnerabilities in the SQLite JDBC driver, or any other database connector used.
        *   **Impact:** Can range from Denial of Service (DoS) to Remote Code Execution (RCE) depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency.
        *   **Example:** A known buffer overflow vulnerability in the SQLite JDBC driver could be exploited by sending specially crafted data to the database through SQLDelight generated queries, leading to RCE on the application server.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Misuse of SQLDelight Generated Code in Application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_misuse_of_sqldelight_generated_code_in_application__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This path highlights vulnerabilities arising from *how developers use* SQLDelight's generated code in their application logic, rather than flaws in SQLDelight itself.
*   **Why Critical:** Developer error is a significant source of security vulnerabilities. Even with secure tools like SQLDelight, improper usage can negate security benefits.

    *   **3.1. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in Application Logic (Despite SQLDelight's Parameterization) [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** Developers mistakenly introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities by directly concatenating user input into SQL queries *after* using SQLDelight to generate data access code. This bypasses SQLDelight's built-in parameterization.
        *   **Impact:** Full SQL Injection vulnerability, allowing attackers to read, modify, or delete data, bypass authentication, or potentially execute arbitrary code on the database server.
        *   **Example:**  A developer might retrieve a base query using SQLDelight, but then dynamically add a `WHERE` clause by string concatenation based on user input, without proper sanitization or parameterization.

    *   **3.3. Insecure Data Handling in Application Logic [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** Application code, after retrieving data using SQLDelight generated functions, handles sensitive data insecurely. This is not a vulnerability in SQLDelight itself, but a weakness in the application's data processing logic.
        *   **Impact:** Data breaches, exposure of sensitive information (passwords, personal data, financial details), compliance violations.
        *   **Example:**  Storing passwords retrieved from the database in plain text in application memory, logging sensitive data in application logs, or transmitting sensitive data over unencrypted channels.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Supply Chain Vulnerabilities -> 4.1. Compromised SQLDelight Dependency [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_supply_chain_vulnerabilities_-_4_1__compromised_sqldelight_dependency__high_risk___critic_ac6ed365.md)

*   **Description:** This path focuses on the risk of vulnerabilities introduced through the software supply chain, specifically by compromising dependencies of SQLDelight itself (not dependencies of the *generated code* as in path 2.4).
*   **Why High Risk:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks are Increasing:**  These attacks are becoming more prevalent and sophisticated.
    *   **Trust in Dependencies:** Developers often implicitly trust dependencies, making supply chain vulnerabilities harder to detect.
    *   **Wide Impact:** Compromising a core dependency of SQLDelight could affect many projects using SQLDelight.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **4.1.1. A dependency of SQLDelight (direct or transitive) is compromised [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:**  One of SQLDelight's direct or transitive dependencies is compromised by attackers. This could involve injecting malicious code into a dependency's repository, distribution channel, or developer environment.
        *   **Impact:**  Malicious code execution within SQLDelight itself, potentially leading to vulnerabilities in all applications using SQLDelight, data manipulation, or complete application compromise.
        *   **Example:** An attacker compromises a less-known dependency of SQLDelight and injects code that exfiltrates data during SQLDelight's schema parsing or code generation process.
