# Threat Model Analysis for sqldelight/sqldelight

## Threat: [Malicious Schema Injection](./threats/malicious_schema_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the development environment or supply chain and injects malicious SQL code into `.sq` files. This could be done by modifying existing files or introducing new ones. During SQLDelight compilation, this malicious SQL is incorporated into the generated code.
*   **Impact:**  Generation of vulnerable code containing SQL injection flaws. This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion in the application's database at runtime.
*   **Affected SQLDelight Component:** SQLDelight Compiler, `.sq` files
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong access controls and security measures for development environments.
    *   Conduct thorough code reviews of all `.sq` files, especially those from external or untrusted sources.
    *   Utilize version control systems and carefully track changes to `.sq` files.
    *   Employ code signing or integrity checks for development tools and dependencies.

## Threat: [SQLDelight Compiler Vulnerability](./threats/sqldelight_compiler_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker exploits a vulnerability within the SQLDelight compiler itself. This could involve crafting specific `.sq` files or inputs that trigger a bug in the compiler, leading to the generation of insecure or flawed code.
*   **Impact:** Generation of code with vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, data corruption, or application crashes. The impact depends on the nature of the compiler vulnerability and how it manifests in the generated code.
*   **Affected SQLDelight Component:** SQLDelight Compiler
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep SQLDelight library updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
    *   Monitor the SQLDelight project's security advisories and vulnerability reports.
    *   Consider using static analysis tools on the generated code to detect potential issues introduced by compiler vulnerabilities.
    *   Incorporate fuzzing or security testing of the SQLDelight compiler itself in advanced security practices.

## Threat: [Incorrectly Generated SQL Queries (SQL Injection)](./threats/incorrectly_generated_sql_queries__sql_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** Despite SQLDelight's parameterized queries, flaws in code generation logic or developer errors in using dynamic SQL features could result in the generation of SQL queries vulnerable to injection. Attackers could then manipulate user inputs to inject malicious SQL code into these queries.
*   **Impact:**  SQL Injection vulnerabilities allowing attackers to bypass application logic, access sensitive data, modify or delete data, or potentially execute arbitrary code on the database server.
*   **Affected SQLDelight Component:** Generated Kotlin/Java Code, Query Generation Logic
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review all generated SQL queries, especially those involving dynamic parts or complex logic.
    *   Strictly adhere to SQLDelight's recommended practices for parameterized queries and avoid constructing raw SQL strings.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the application side, even though SQLDelight aims to prevent SQL injection.
    *   Conduct comprehensive security testing, including SQL injection vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, on the application.
