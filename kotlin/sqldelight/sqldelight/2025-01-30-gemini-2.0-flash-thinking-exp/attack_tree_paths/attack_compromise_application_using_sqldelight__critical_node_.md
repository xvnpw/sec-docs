### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise Application Using SQLDelight

**Attack Node:** Compromise Application Using SQLDelight [CRITICAL NODE]

**Description:** This node represents the successful compromise of the application by an attacker leveraging SQLDelight as the primary attack vector.  Success at this node signifies a significant security breach, potentially leading to data theft, data manipulation, unauthorized access, or disruption of service.

**High-Risk Paths Leading to Compromise (Examples):**

To compromise the application using SQLDelight, an attacker would likely need to exploit vulnerabilities in how SQLDelight is used or potentially within SQLDelight itself (though less likely).  Here are some potential high-risk paths:

#### 4.1. SQL Injection via Unsafe Query Construction [HIGH RISK]

*   **Description:** This is the most probable and critical path. If developers construct SQL queries using string concatenation or other unsafe methods when interacting with SQLDelight, they can introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities. Attackers can then inject malicious SQL code into these queries, bypassing intended application logic and directly interacting with the database.

*   **Attack Vector Breakdown:**
    1.  **Vulnerable Code:** Developer uses string concatenation or similar unsafe methods to build SQL queries within SQLDelight code, incorporating user-supplied input directly without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    2.  **Input Manipulation:** Attacker crafts malicious input (e.g., through application forms, API requests, or other input channels) designed to inject SQL commands.
    3.  **Query Execution with Injected Code:** The application executes the vulnerable SQL query, now containing the attacker's injected SQL code.
    4.  **Database Compromise:** The injected SQL code is executed by the SQLite database, potentially allowing the attacker to:
        *   **Data Exfiltration:**  Retrieve sensitive data from the database (e.g., `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'attacker' OR '1'='1' --`).
        *   **Data Manipulation:** Modify or delete data in the database (e.g., `UPDATE users SET password = 'hacked' WHERE username = 'victim';`).
        *   **Privilege Escalation (in some contexts):**  Potentially gain elevated privileges within the database if the application's database user has excessive permissions.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Execute resource-intensive queries to overload the database or application.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always Use Parameterized Queries (Bound Parameters):** SQLDelight strongly encourages and facilitates the use of parameterized queries. Developers **must** utilize these features to ensure user input is treated as data, not executable code.  SQLDelight's generated code is designed to be safe when used correctly with parameters.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  While parameterized queries are the primary defense, implement input validation to reject obviously malicious or unexpected input formats *before* they reach the database layer.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the database user used by the application has only the necessary permissions required for its functionality. Avoid granting excessive privileges that could be exploited in case of SQL injection.
    *   **Code Review and Static Analysis:** Conduct regular code reviews to identify potential instances of unsafe query construction. Utilize static analysis tools that can detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Testing:** Perform penetration testing and vulnerability scanning to identify and validate SQL injection vulnerabilities in the application.

#### 4.2. Logic Errors in SQLDelight Queries Leading to Data Exposure [MEDIUM RISK]

*   **Description:** While less direct than SQL injection, poorly designed or logically flawed SQL queries created using SQLDelight could unintentionally expose sensitive data or allow unauthorized data access.

*   **Attack Vector Breakdown:**
    1.  **Flawed Query Logic:** Developer creates SQLDelight queries with incorrect logic, missing authorization checks, or overly broad data retrieval.
    2.  **Unintended Data Access:**  Due to the flawed query logic, the application might inadvertently return sensitive data to unauthorized users or in contexts where it should not be accessible.
    3.  **Data Exposure:** Attacker exploits the application's functionality to trigger the flawed query and gain access to sensitive information they should not have.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Query Design and Testing:** Carefully design and test all SQLDelight queries to ensure they accurately reflect the intended data access logic and enforce proper authorization.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Data Access):**  Design queries to retrieve only the minimum necessary data required for the application's functionality. Avoid overly broad queries that retrieve more data than needed.
    *   **Access Control Implementation:** Implement robust access control mechanisms within the application logic to ensure that users can only access data they are authorized to view.
    *   **Code Review and Security Audits:**  Review SQLDelight queries and related application code to identify potential logic flaws and unintended data exposure risks.

#### 4.3. Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource-Intensive Queries [LOW to MEDIUM RISK]

*   **Description:** An attacker might craft or inject resource-intensive SQL queries through SQLDelight that could overload the SQLite database or the application, leading to a Denial of Service.

*   **Attack Vector Breakdown:**
    1.  **Malicious Query Crafting/Injection:** Attacker crafts or injects SQL queries that are designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, I/O) on the SQLite database server. Examples include queries with:
        *   Complex joins on large tables.
        *   Inefficient `LIKE` clauses with leading wildcards.
        *   Lack of appropriate indexes.
    2.  **Resource Exhaustion:** The application executes these resource-intensive queries, causing the SQLite database to become overloaded and unresponsive.
    3.  **Denial of Service:** The application becomes slow, unresponsive, or crashes due to database overload, effectively denying service to legitimate users.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Query Optimization:**  Optimize SQLDelight queries for performance. Use appropriate indexes, avoid inefficient query patterns, and test query performance under load.
    *   **Query Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for database queries to prevent long-running queries from consuming excessive resources.
    *   **Rate Limiting and Request Throttling:** Implement rate limiting or request throttling at the application level to limit the number of requests from a single user or IP address, mitigating DoS attempts.
    *   **Database Resource Monitoring:** Monitor database resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O) to detect and respond to potential DoS attacks.
    *   **Input Validation (Query Complexity):**  While difficult, consider implementing some form of input validation to detect and reject potentially overly complex or resource-intensive queries before they are executed.

**Conclusion:**

Compromising an application using SQLDelight primarily hinges on exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities arising from unsafe query construction.  By consistently using parameterized queries, implementing robust input validation, adhering to the principle of least privilege, and conducting thorough security testing, the development team can significantly mitigate the risk of this critical attack path and ensure the security of the application when using SQLDelight.  Regular security reviews and awareness training for developers are crucial to maintain a strong security posture.
