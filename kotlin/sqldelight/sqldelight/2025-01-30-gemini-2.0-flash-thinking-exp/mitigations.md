# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for sqldelight/sqldelight

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Queries](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_queries.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Dynamic Data Inputs in SQLDelight Queries:** Pinpoint all locations in your `.sq` files where dynamic data needs to be incorporated into SQL queries. This usually involves parameters passed from your Kotlin/Java code.
    2.  **Utilize `?` Placeholders in `.sq` Files:** In your SQLDelight `.sq` files, replace the intended dynamic data insertion points within SQL statements with question mark (`?`) placeholders. These placeholders indicate where parameters will be bound.
    3.  **Pass Parameters in Code When Executing SQLDelight Queries:** In your Kotlin/Java code, when you obtain a query object from SQLDelight (e.g., `database.userQueries.getUserByName(username)`), ensure you are passing the dynamic data (`username` in this example) as arguments to the query function. SQLDelight automatically handles parameter binding using these arguments.
    4.  **Avoid String Manipulation within `.sq` Files for Dynamic Data:**  Strictly avoid using string concatenation or string interpolation *within your `.sq` files* to construct SQL queries dynamically.  SQLDelight's type safety and parameterization are designed to replace this insecure practice.
    5.  **Code Review Focused on `.sq` Files and Query Usage:** Conduct code reviews specifically examining your `.sq` files and the Kotlin/Java code that executes these queries. Verify that `?` placeholders are used correctly in `.sq` files and that parameters are consistently passed when executing queries in code.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious SQL code through user inputs by ensuring all dynamic data is treated as parameters, not executable SQL code, within SQLDelight queries.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Significantly reduces the risk of SQL Injection. Parameterized queries are the core defense mechanism against this threat when using SQLDelight.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented in the `UserQueries.sq` and `ProductQueries.sq` files within the `database` module. Queries for user authentication and product retrieval, defined in these files, utilize parameterized queries.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Review and update `ReportGenerationQueries.sq` file in the `database` module.  If any queries in this file involve dynamic parameters (especially if derived from user input for report filtering), they need to be refactored to use parameterized queries with `?` placeholders.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Logging of Sensitive Data in SQLDelight Queries](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_logging_of_sensitive_data_in_sqldelight_queries.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Logging Configuration Related to SQLDelight:** Examine your application's logging configuration and identify if SQLDelight's query execution or related events are being logged.
    2.  **Identify Sensitive Data in Logged SQLDelight Queries:** Determine if the logged SQLDelight queries, or data associated with them, contain sensitive information (e.g., user credentials, personal data, API keys used in database interactions).
    3.  **Configure Logging to Exclude or Mask Sensitive Data in SQLDelight Logs:** Adjust your logging configuration to prevent logging of sensitive data within SQLDelight query logs. This might involve:
        *   Disabling full SQL query logging for SQLDelight in production.
        *   Configuring log formatters to exclude parameter values from logged SQLDelight queries.
        *   Implementing custom logging interceptors (if supported by your logging framework and SQLDelight integration) to sanitize or mask sensitive data before logging SQLDelight events.
    4.  **Focus Logging on Necessary SQLDelight Events:**  If logging SQLDelight interactions is needed for debugging, focus on logging only essential events (e.g., query execution time, errors) without including sensitive data or full query details in production logs.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure through Logs (Medium Severity):** Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data if SQLDelight queries, including parameters, are logged and these logs are accessed by unauthorized individuals.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure through Logs:** Moderately reduces the risk of data exposure by minimizing the logging of sensitive data related to SQLDelight queries.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic logging using Logback in the `common` module captures some application events, but specific configuration for SQLDelight query logging and sensitive data masking is not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Need to configure logging specifically for SQLDelight interactions. Implement a strategy to prevent sensitive data from being logged when SQLDelight executes queries. This might involve adjusting Logback configuration or exploring custom logging solutions that integrate with SQLDelight.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Updates for SQLDelight](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_updates_for_sqldelight.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor SQLDelight Releases and Security Advisories:** Regularly check for new releases of SQLDelight and subscribe to any security advisories or release notes provided by the SQLDelight project maintainers.
    2.  **Evaluate SQLDelight Updates:** When a new version of SQLDelight is released, review the release notes to understand the changes, including any security fixes or improvements.
    3.  **Update SQLDelight Dependency in `build.gradle.kts`:** Update the SQLDelight dependency version in your project's `build.gradle.kts` files to the latest stable and secure version.
    4.  **Test After SQLDelight Updates:** After updating SQLDelight, thoroughly test your application to ensure compatibility and that the update has not introduced any regressions or broken existing functionality, especially related to database interactions.
    5.  **Automate Dependency Checks for SQLDelight:** Integrate dependency scanning tools into your CI/CD pipeline that can specifically check for known vulnerabilities in the version of SQLDelight you are using and alert you to necessary updates.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in SQLDelight (Variable Severity):** Mitigates risks arising from potential security vulnerabilities discovered within the SQLDelight library itself. Keeping SQLDelight updated ensures you benefit from security patches and bug fixes. Severity depends on the nature of the vulnerability.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in SQLDelight:** Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities in SQLDelight by proactively applying updates.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Dependency management is handled by Gradle. SQLDelight version is specified in `build.gradle.kts` files. Manual updates are performed occasionally.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated checks for SQLDelight dependency updates and vulnerability scanning are not currently in place. Need to integrate a dependency scanning tool that specifically monitors SQLDelight and its dependencies for vulnerabilities and alerts on outdated versions.
