# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, SQLDelight, aims to simplify database interactions for Kotlin Multiplatform and Android developers. It provides a type-safe way to write and manage SQL queries by generating Kotlin code from SQL schema and queries.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Enhance developer productivity by reducing boilerplate code for database access.
  - Improve code maintainability and reduce errors by providing type-safe database interactions.
  - Support Kotlin Multiplatform, enabling code sharing across different platforms (Android, iOS, JVM, etc.).
  - Offer a robust and reliable solution for database management in Kotlin projects.

- Business Risks:
  - Adoption risk: Developers might prefer existing ORM solutions or raw SQL queries.
  - Complexity risk: Integrating SQLDelight into existing projects might require a learning curve.
  - Dependency risk: Reliance on SQLDelight introduces a dependency that needs to be maintained and updated.
  - Security risk: Vulnerabilities in SQLDelight could potentially impact applications using it, especially if it mishandles SQL queries or data.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Code review process for contributions (GitHub pull requests). Implemented in GitHub repository contribution guidelines.
  - security control: Open source project, allowing community scrutiny. Implemented by project being publicly available on GitHub.
  - security control: Use of Kotlin and Java, languages with established security practices. Implemented by technology stack choice.
  - security control: Build process likely includes standard Kotlin/Java compilation and testing. Assumed based on typical software development practices.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in dependencies (Kotlin, Java, Gradle, etc.). Accepted as inherent risk of using external libraries and platforms.
  - accepted risk: Risk of community contributions introducing vulnerabilities. Mitigated by code review but not entirely eliminated.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on developer's secure coding practices when writing SQL queries and using generated code. Accepted as responsibility of the user of the library.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the build pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in the codebase.
  - security control: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Provide security guidelines for developers using SQLDelight, focusing on secure SQL query practices and input validation when using data with generated code.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to SQLDelight itself, as it's a library. Authentication is handled by the application using SQLDelight and the underlying database system.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to SQLDelight itself. Authorization is handled by the application and the database system. SQLDelight should not bypass database authorization mechanisms.
  - Input Validation: SQLDelight generates code based on SQL queries. It's crucial that the generated code and the library itself do not introduce vulnerabilities related to SQL injection. Input validation should be primarily handled by the application layer using SQLDelight, but SQLDelight should facilitate secure query construction and parameterization.
  - Cryptography: Not directly applicable to SQLDelight core functionality. Cryptographic operations would be handled by the application layer or the database system if data encryption is required. SQLDelight should not interfere with or weaken any cryptographic measures implemented by the application or database.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Development of applications using SQLDelight. If SQLDelight is compromised, it could impact all applications using it, potentially leading to data breaches or application malfunctions.
  - Build and release process of SQLDelight itself. A compromised build process could lead to distribution of malicious versions of SQLDelight.
  - Data access within applications using SQLDelight. Vulnerabilities could lead to unauthorized data access or manipulation.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - SQLDelight source code: Sensitive intellectual property. Confidentiality and integrity are important.
  - SQLDelight build artifacts: Integrity is crucial to prevent distribution of compromised libraries.
  - Data handled by applications using SQLDelight: Sensitivity depends on the application. SQLDelight itself doesn't handle data directly, but vulnerabilities could indirectly expose application data. Sensitivity ranges from low to high depending on the application domain (PII, financial data, etc.).
