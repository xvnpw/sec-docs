# Attack Surface Analysis for sqldelight/sqldelight

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection Vulnerabilities via Dynamic Query Construction](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_vulnerabilities_via_dynamic_query_construction.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into application queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access to data, modifying data, or disrupting database operations.
*   **SQLDelight Contribution:** SQLDelight generates code from SQL files. If developers bypass SQLDelight's intended parameterized query approach and dynamically construct SQL queries by concatenating user input into these generated queries (even indirectly), SQLDelight becomes the conduit for SQL injection. The generated code, designed for safe parameterized queries, is misused by developers introducing dynamic query building *after* SQLDelight's code generation.
*   **Example:** An application uses SQLDelight for user management. A search feature allows filtering users by name. If the application directly inserts user-provided search terms into the `WHERE` clause of a SQLDelight query using string concatenation instead of parameters, an attacker could input `' OR '1'='1` to bypass the filter and retrieve all user data, or inject malicious SQL to modify or delete data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Breach (Confidentiality Loss)
    *   Data Modification/Deletion (Integrity Loss)
    *   Denial of Service (Availability Loss)
    *   Privilege Escalation
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Parameterized Queries (Crucial & SQLDelight's Strength):**  **Mandatory** use of parameterized queries provided by SQLDelight for *all* user-supplied input that influences query conditions or values. This is the core defense and leverages SQLDelight's intended secure usage.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Defense-in-Depth):** Implement input validation and sanitization as a secondary layer of defense, even with parameterized queries, to catch unexpected or malicious input before it reaches the database interaction.
    *   **Strict Code Review (Focus on SQL Interactions):** Rigorous code reviews specifically targeting areas where user input interacts with SQLDelight generated code. Identify and eliminate any instances of dynamic query construction or string concatenation used to build SQL queries.
    *   **Static Analysis (SQL Injection Detection):** Employ static analysis tools capable of detecting potential SQL injection vulnerabilities, particularly in code interacting with SQLDelight.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in SQLDelight Compiler](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_sqldelight_compiler.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws within the SQLDelight compiler itself could lead to the generation of vulnerable code, even from seemingly secure SQL definitions. This is a supply chain risk directly related to SQLDelight.
*   **SQLDelight Contribution:** SQLDelight *is* the compiler. Any vulnerability in its parsing, code generation, or dependency handling directly translates to a potential vulnerability in applications built using it.  A compromised compiler can inject vulnerabilities into the application's core data access layer during the build process.
*   **Example:** A hypothetical vulnerability in the SQLDelight compiler's SQL parsing logic might cause it to misinterpret or mishandle certain SQL syntax related to data type validation or constraint enforcement. This could result in generated code that bypasses intended database-level security measures, allowing for data corruption or unauthorized access.  Another example could be a vulnerability in a dependency used by the compiler that is exploited during the compilation process itself, potentially leading to malicious code injection into the generated output.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Corruption
    *   Unexpected Application Behavior
    *   Potential for various exploits depending on the nature of the compiler vulnerability, including data breaches, integrity violations, or even remote code execution if the vulnerability is severe enough.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (Potentially **Critical** depending on the nature and exploitability of the compiler vulnerability and the application's criticality. Compiler vulnerabilities can have a wide-reaching impact across all applications using the affected version).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediate SQLDelight Updates (Critical):**  Apply updates to SQLDelight *immediately* upon release, especially security updates. Monitor SQLDelight release notes and security advisories closely.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring (Proactive & Continuous):** Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for SQLDelight and its direct dependencies. Subscribe to relevant security mailing lists or feeds.
    *   **Community Engagement & Reporting (Contribute to Security):** Participate in the SQLDelight community. Report any suspected bugs or security concerns you encounter. Contributing to the project's security helps all users.
    *   **Consider Build Process Security (Defense-in-Depth):** For extremely high-security environments, consider hardening the build environment itself to minimize the risk of compiler compromise. This might include using trusted build pipelines and verifying compiler integrity.
