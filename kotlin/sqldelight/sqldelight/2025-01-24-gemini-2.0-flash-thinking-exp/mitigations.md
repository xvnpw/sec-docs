# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for sqldelight/sqldelight

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Parameterized Queries (Bind Parameters)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_parameterized_queries__bind_parameters_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Parameterized Queries (Bind Parameters)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Developer Training (SQLDelight Focus):** Train developers specifically on using SQLDelight's parameterized query feature (`:bind` parameters in `.sq` files). Emphasize that *all* dynamic data inputs within SQLDelight queries *must* utilize bind parameters to prevent SQL Injection.
    2.  **SQLDelight Code Reviews:** Implement code reviews specifically for `.sq` files and the Kotlin/Java code generated by SQLDelight. Reviewers should verify that all dynamic data in SQLDelight queries is correctly parameterized using `:bind` parameters and flag any instances of string concatenation or formatting used to build SQL queries dynamically within SQLDelight context.
    3.  **Linting/Static Analysis for SQLDelight (Optional):** Explore or develop linting rules or static analysis tools that can specifically analyze `.sq` files and generated Kotlin/Java code to automatically detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities arising from improper parameterization in SQLDelight usage.
    4.  **Example Implementation in `.sq` file:**  Always use the parameterized syntax in `.sq` files: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username;` and ensure the generated Kotlin code is used correctly to bind values to the `:username` parameter. Avoid constructing queries using string interpolation within `.sq` files or in Kotlin code that interacts with SQLDelight.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** This strategy directly mitigates SQL Injection vulnerabilities, which are a primary threat when dynamically constructing SQL queries. SQLDelight's parameterized queries are the intended mechanism to prevent this within its ecosystem.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** High Impact - Effectively eliminates the primary attack vector for SQL Injection *within SQLDelight queries* when implemented correctly and consistently.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in [Project Name] where developers are generally encouraged to use parameterized queries with SQLDelight. Code reviews exist, but specific focus on SQLDelight parameterization might need strengthening.
    *   Implemented in: [Specific Code Location where parameterized queries are consistently used in SQLDelight, e.g., specific feature modules using SQLDelight].
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Inconsistent enforcement of parameterized queries across all SQLDelight usage within [Project Name]. Older `.sq` files or less frequently updated features might have instances of dynamic query construction.
    *   Lack of automated linting or static analysis specifically for SQLDelight parameterization practices.
    *   Missing dedicated SQLDelight-focused training materials and guidelines for developers on secure query construction using bind parameters.

## Mitigation Strategy: [SQLDelight Generated Code Review](./mitigation_strategies/sqldelight_generated_code_review.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** SQLDelight Generated Code Review
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Dedicated SQLDelight Review Step:** Establish a specific step in the development workflow to review the Kotlin/Java code *generated by SQLDelight* after any modifications to `.sq` files. This review should be focused on security aspects related to SQLDelight's code generation.
    2.  **Focus Areas (SQLDelight Specific):** During code review of generated code, specifically examine:
        *   Correctness of parameter binding in the generated functions. Ensure parameters from `.sq` files are properly handled in the Kotlin code.
        *   Logic of generated query execution and data mapping. Look for any unexpected or potentially vulnerable logic introduced by SQLDelight's code generation.
        *   Data type handling and conversions performed by the generated SQLDelight code, ensuring they are secure and prevent unexpected behavior.
        *   Error handling within the generated database interaction code, ensuring it doesn't expose sensitive information or create vulnerabilities.
    3.  **SQLDelight Security Checklist:** Create a checklist of security-related points *specific to SQLDelight generated code* to ensure consistent and thorough reviews. This checklist should focus on aspects unique to SQLDelight's code generation and database interaction patterns.
    4.  **Automated Analysis for Generated Code (Optional):** Explore using static analysis tools on the *generated Kotlin/Java code from SQLDelight* to identify potential code quality issues or security vulnerabilities that might arise from SQLDelight's specific code generation logic.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Code Generation Bugs in SQLDelight (Medium Severity):** Mitigates risks stemming from potential bugs or unexpected behavior *within SQLDelight's code generation process itself* that could inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities in the generated code.
    *   **Logic Errors in SQLDelight Database Interactions (Medium Severity):** Helps identify logical flaws *specifically in how SQLDelight's generated code interacts with the database*, which could lead to data corruption, unexpected data access patterns, or other security-relevant issues.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Code Generation Bugs in SQLDelight:** Medium Impact - Reduces the risk of vulnerabilities originating from issues within SQLDelight's code generation.
    *   **Logic Errors in SQLDelight Database Interactions:** Medium Impact - Improves the security and reliability of database interactions managed by SQLDelight by catching potential logical errors introduced through its generated code.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in [Project Name] as part of general code review practices. Developers review code changes, including those related to SQLDelight, but the review might not be specifically focused on the *generated code* and SQLDelight-specific security aspects.
    *   Implemented by: [Team/Person Responsible for code reviews, e.g., Development Team, Security Team].
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Lack of a *dedicated* and *documented* step specifically for reviewing *generated SQLDelight code* for security concerns. Reviews might be too broad and miss issues specific to SQLDelight's code generation.
    *   No specific security checklist tailored for reviewing *SQLDelight generated code*.
    *   No automated static analysis specifically targeting *generated SQLDelight code* for security vulnerabilities.

## Mitigation Strategy: [SQLDelight Dependency Updates and Management](./mitigation_strategies/sqldelight_dependency_updates_and_management.md)
