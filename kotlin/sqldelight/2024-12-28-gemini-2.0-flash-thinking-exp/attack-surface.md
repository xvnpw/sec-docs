Here's the updated key attack surface list, focusing only on elements directly involving SQLDelight and with High or Critical risk severity:

* **Malicious Modification of Schema Files (.sq files):**
    * **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the project's source code or build environment and modifies `.sq` files.
    * **How SQLDelight Contributes:** `.sq` files are the source of truth for the database schema used by SQLDelight to generate code. Changes here directly impact the application's data structure and queries.
    * **Example:** An attacker adds a new column to a user table to store a copy of passwords in plaintext, intending to exfiltrate them later.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, denial of service due to schema changes causing application errors or performance issues.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust access controls and permissions for the source code repository and build environment.
        * Utilize code review processes to identify unexpected or malicious changes to `.sq` files.
        * Employ file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized modifications.
        * Store `.sq` files in a secure location with restricted access.

* **Vulnerabilities in Generated Kotlin/Java Code:**
    * **Description:** Bugs or security flaws exist in the Kotlin/Java code generated by SQLDelight.
    * **How SQLDelight Contributes:** SQLDelight's code generation logic is responsible for translating `.sq` files into executable code. Errors in this process can introduce vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** The generated code might incorrectly handle user-provided input when building queries, leading to SQL injection if not all cases are handled properly.
    * **Impact:** SQL injection, data breaches, application crashes, potential for remote code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update the SQLDelight library to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        * Conduct thorough testing of the application, including security testing, to identify potential issues in the generated code.
        * Review the generated code (if feasible) for any suspicious patterns or potential vulnerabilities.
        * Report any suspected vulnerabilities in SQLDelight's code generation to the maintainers.

* **Improper Use of Custom SQL in `.sq` Files:**
    * **Description:** Developers write insecure SQL directly within `.sq` files, bypassing some of SQLDelight's safety features.
    * **How SQLDelight Contributes:** While SQLDelight provides type safety for parameters, developers can still construct dynamic SQL or use string concatenation within their queries, reintroducing SQL injection risks.
    * **Example:** A developer constructs a query using string concatenation with user input instead of using bind parameters, making the application vulnerable to SQL injection.
    * **Impact:** SQL injection, data breaches, data manipulation, potential for unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Enforce strict code review practices, specifically focusing on SQL queries within `.sq` files.
        * Educate developers on secure SQL coding practices and the importance of using bind parameters.
        * Utilize static analysis tools to detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in `.sq` files.
        * Limit the use of dynamic SQL construction within `.sq` files.

* **Build Process Compromise Leading to Malicious Code Generation:**
    * **Description:** An attacker compromises the build environment where SQLDelight code generation occurs.
    * **How SQLDelight Contributes:** SQLDelight's code generation is a crucial step in the build process. If this process is compromised, malicious code can be injected into the generated files.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to the build server and modifies the SQLDelight plugin or the build scripts to inject malicious code into the generated Kotlin/Java files.
    * **Impact:** Introduction of backdoors, data exfiltration, remote code execution within the application.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Secure the build environment with strong access controls and regular security audits.
        * Implement integrity checks for build tools and dependencies.
        * Use isolated and ephemeral build environments where possible.
        * Employ multi-factor authentication for access to build systems.
