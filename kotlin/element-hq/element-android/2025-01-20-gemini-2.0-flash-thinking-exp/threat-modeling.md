# Threat Model Analysis for element-hq/element-android

## Threat: [Compromised Olm Session Establishment](./threats/compromised_olm_session_establishment.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts the key exchange process during session establishment between two devices using the Olm library within `element-android`. The attacker might manipulate the exchanged keys, leading to an encrypted session where the attacker can decrypt messages sent between the two parties without their knowledge.

**Impact:** Loss of confidentiality for all messages exchanged within the compromised session. Potential for impersonation if the attacker can control the session.

**Affected Component:** `org.matrix.olm` (Olm library within `element-android`), specifically the key exchange functions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure proper TLS/SSL is used for all network communication to prevent eavesdropping on the key exchange (while not solely an `element-android` responsibility, it's crucial for its security).
*   Implement certificate pinning within the application using `element-android` to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks on the Matrix homeserver.
*   Regularly update the `element-android` library to benefit from security patches in the Olm library.
*   Implement robust device verification mechanisms provided by `element-android` and encourage users to verify devices.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Olm Private Keys](./threats/insecure_storage_of_olm_private_keys.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the device's local storage and extracts the Olm private keys managed by `element-android`. This could be achieved through malware, device rooting, or physical access. With the private keys, the attacker can decrypt past and future messages associated with that user's device.

**Impact:** Complete loss of confidentiality for all messages associated with the compromised user on that device. Potential for impersonation and sending messages as the compromised user.

**Affected Component:** `org.matrix.olm` (Olm library within `element-android`), specifically the key storage mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize the Android Keystore system to securely store Olm private keys within `element-android`, leveraging hardware-backed security if available.
*   Encrypt the local database used by `element-android` where keys are stored using strong encryption algorithms.
*   Educate users about the risks of rooting their devices and installing applications from untrusted sources (while not directly in `element-android`, it impacts its security).

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Megolm Session Handling](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_megolm_session_handling.md)

**Description:** A flaw in the `element-android` library's handling of Megolm session keys (used for group chats) could allow an attacker to decrypt past or future group messages. This might involve improper key rotation, storage vulnerabilities within `element-android`, or bugs in the decryption process within the library.

**Impact:** Loss of confidentiality for group chat messages.

**Affected Component:** `org.matrix.olm` (Olm library within `element-android`), specifically the Megolm session management functions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update the `element-android` library to benefit from security patches in the Olm library related to Megolm.
*   Ensure proper implementation of Megolm session key rotation as defined by the Matrix specification within `element-android`.
*   Securely store Megolm session keys within `element-android`, similar to Olm private keys.

## Threat: [Cross-Signing Impersonation](./threats/cross-signing_impersonation.md)

**Description:** An attacker manages to compromise a user's cross-signing keys managed by `element-android` or bypass the cross-signing verification process within the library. This allows the attacker to impersonate the user's devices, potentially gaining access to encrypted messages or performing actions as the user.

**Impact:** Loss of confidentiality and integrity. The attacker can read encrypted messages and potentially send messages as the compromised user.

**Affected Component:** `im.vector.app.features.crypto.crosssigning` (the cross-signing implementation within `element-android`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust cross-signing verification flows with clear user interfaces within the application using `element-android` to prevent accidental acceptance of malicious keys.
*   Securely store cross-signing private keys using the Android Keystore within `element-android`.
*   Regularly update the `element-android` library to address any vulnerabilities in the cross-signing implementation.

## Threat: [Malicious Media Exploiting Decoding Libraries](./threats/malicious_media_exploiting_decoding_libraries.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted media file (image, video, audio) that exploits a vulnerability in the media decoding libraries used by `element-android`. This could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the application.

**Impact:** Potential for data theft, installation of malware within the application's scope, or other malicious actions within the application's sandbox.

**Affected Component:** Media handling components within `element-android`, potentially relying on Android's media framework or third-party libraries bundled with or used by `element-android`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update the `element-android` library, which should include updates to underlying media decoding libraries.
*   Implement security measures like sandboxing for media processing within `element-android` to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
*   Consider using secure media decoding libraries and validating their integrity within the `element-android` project.

## Threat: [Message Rendering XSS](./threats/message_rendering_xss.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious Matrix message containing specially formatted text or embedded content that exploits a vulnerability in the `element-android` library's message rendering engine. This could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks within the application's UI, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the application's context.

**Impact:** Potential for session hijacking within the application, data theft from the application's UI, or redirection to malicious websites within the application's web views (if used).

**Affected Component:** `im.vector.app.features.home.room.detail.timeline.item` (likely related to timeline item rendering within `element-android`) or similar UI rendering components within the library.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding when rendering messages within `element-android`.
*   Utilize a secure rendering engine that is resistant to XSS attacks within `element-android`.
*   Regularly update the `element-android` library to benefit from fixes for rendering vulnerabilities.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) where applicable within the application's web views (if used by `element-android`) to mitigate the impact of XSS.
