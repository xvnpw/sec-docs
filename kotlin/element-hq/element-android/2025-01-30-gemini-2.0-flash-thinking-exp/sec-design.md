# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Element Android project aims to provide a secure, private, and feature-rich messaging and collaboration application on the Android platform. It is built upon the Matrix open protocol for decentralized communication. The primary business priorities and goals are:

- Provide a reliable and user-friendly Matrix client for Android users.
- Ensure secure and private communication for users, protecting their data and conversations.
- Promote the adoption of the Matrix protocol as an open and decentralized communication standard.
- Maintain an open-source project that is community-driven and transparent.
- Offer a competitive alternative to proprietary messaging applications, emphasizing user control and data ownership.

Key business risks associated with these priorities and goals include:

- Security vulnerabilities in the application or the underlying Matrix protocol that could compromise user privacy and trust.
- Data breaches or leaks that could damage the project's reputation and user confidence.
- Performance issues or usability problems that could hinder user adoption and satisfaction.
- Competition from other messaging applications, both open-source and proprietary.
- Dependence on the Matrix ecosystem and the stability of Matrix homeservers.
- Legal and regulatory compliance related to data privacy and communication security.
- Difficulty in monetizing the open-source project to ensure long-term sustainability.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:

- Secure and private messaging: Ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user communications.
- User account security: Protecting user credentials and preventing unauthorized access to user accounts.
- Data privacy: Safeguarding user data (messages, contacts, profile information) from unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification.
- Application availability and reliability: Ensuring the application is functional and accessible to users when needed.
- Trust and reputation: Maintaining user trust in the application's security and privacy features.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:

- User messages: Highly sensitive. Confidentiality is paramount due to the nature of personal communications. Integrity is also critical to ensure messages are not tampered with.
- User credentials (passwords, access tokens): Highly sensitive. Confidentiality is crucial to prevent unauthorized account access.
- User profile information (username, display name, contacts): Sensitive. Confidentiality is important to protect user privacy.
- Encryption keys: Highly sensitive. Confidentiality and integrity are critical for end-to-end encryption security. Loss or compromise of keys can lead to data breaches.
- Application logs and diagnostic data: Moderately sensitive. Logs may contain some user-related information and should be protected from unauthorized access.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- What specific SAST and DAST tools are currently used or planned to be used in the development and build process?
- What dependency scanning tools are used to manage third-party library vulnerabilities?
- Is there a formal security incident response plan in place for Element Android?
- Are penetration tests conducted regularly, and if so, what is the frequency and scope?
- What is the process for managing and rotating cryptographic keys used in the application?
- Are there specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that Element Android needs to adhere to?
- What is the process for user data retention and deletion in Element Android and related Matrix homeservers?
- Is multi-factor authentication (MFA) currently implemented or planned for Element Android?

Assumptions:

- BUSINESS POSTURE: The project prioritizes user privacy and security above all else, reflecting the nature of a secure messaging application. The target audience values privacy and open-source solutions.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC) principles are generally followed, including code reviews and some level of automated security testing. End-to-end encryption is a core security feature.
- DESIGN: The application relies heavily on the Matrix SDK for core Matrix protocol functionalities. Local data storage is used for offline capabilities. Push notifications are essential for real-time communication. The build process is automated using CI/CD pipelines.
- DEPLOYMENT: The primary distribution channels are app stores (Google Play Store, F-Droid), with APK downloads as an alternative. Users are expected to install the application on their personal Android devices.
