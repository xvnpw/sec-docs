#### 4.2. Complexity

The complexity of implementing this mitigation strategy is **moderate and primarily front-loaded**.

*   **Initial Effort:** The initial effort involves a thorough review of documentation and potentially code inspection, which requires time and expertise in both Element-Android and mobile security principles.
*   **Configuration Overriding:** Overriding configurations in code is generally straightforward, typically involving setting parameters during the Element-Android library initialization process.
*   **Ongoing Maintenance:**  The complexity increases with ongoing maintenance. As Element-Android is updated, new configuration options might be introduced, or default values might change.  Therefore, periodic reviews are necessary to ensure continued security.
*   **Documentation Dependency:** The complexity is heavily dependent on the quality and completeness of Element-Android's documentation. Poor documentation can significantly increase the effort required to understand and configure the library securely.

#### 4.3. Cost

The cost associated with this mitigation strategy is **relatively low**, primarily involving developer time.

*   **Time Investment:** The main cost is the time spent by developers to review documentation, analyze configurations, and implement overrides. This is a one-time cost during initial integration and a recurring cost for periodic reviews during updates.
*   **Resource Utilization:**  This strategy does not typically require significant computational resources or infrastructure.
*   **Potential for Automation:**  Parts of the review process, such as identifying configuration options and comparing them to secure baselines, could potentially be automated to reduce manual effort in the long run.

The cost is significantly lower compared to reactive security measures taken after a vulnerability is exploited. Proactive configuration review is a cost-effective way to prevent security issues.

#### 4.4. Dependencies

This mitigation strategy is largely **independent** but can be enhanced by other security practices.

*   **Independent Operation:** It can be implemented independently of other mitigation strategies. It focuses specifically on the configuration of the Element-Android library itself.
*   **Complementary Strategies:** It complements other security measures, such as secure coding practices, input validation, and regular security audits.  A secure configuration of Element-Android is a foundational element of overall application security.
*   **Documentation Dependency:** As mentioned earlier, it heavily depends on the availability and quality of Element-Android documentation.
