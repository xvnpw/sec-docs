# Project Design Document: Now in Android

## BUSINESS POSTURE

The "Now in Android" (NiA) application is an open-source, fully functional Android app showcasing modern Android development best practices. It serves as a learning resource and reference implementation for developers.

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a high-quality, up-to-date example of a modern Android application.
*   Demonstrate best practices in Android development, including architecture, UI/UX, and testing.
*   Serve as a learning resource for Android developers of all skill levels.
*   Maintain a codebase that is easy to understand, contribute to, and extend.
*   Showcase the use of the latest Android features and libraries.

Business Risks:

*   The application, while primarily educational, could potentially be forked and used as a basis for production applications. Therefore, security vulnerabilities in NiA could indirectly impact applications built upon it.
*   Outdated dependencies or unaddressed security issues could tarnish the project's reputation as a best-practice example.
*   Lack of clarity in the codebase or design could hinder its usefulness as a learning resource.
*   Sensitive data exposure, even if it's just sample data, could create reputational risk.

## SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Dependency management: The project uses Gradle's version catalogs and dependency management features to keep dependencies up-to-date. (build.gradle.kts, libs.versions.toml)
*   security control: Static analysis: The project includes static analysis tools like Detekt, Ktlint, and Android Lint to identify potential code quality and security issues. (build.gradle.kts, configuration files in the config/detekt and config/quality directories)
*   security control: Testing: A comprehensive suite of unit, integration, and UI tests helps ensure code correctness and prevent regressions. (androidTest, test directories)
*   security control: Code reviews: All changes are subject to code review before being merged. (GitHub pull request process)
*   security control: Obfuscation and minification: ProGuard/R8 is used to obfuscate and minify the code for release builds, making it harder to reverse engineer. (proguard-rules.pro)
*   security control: HTTPS: Network communication uses HTTPS. (Implicit in the use of modern networking libraries like Retrofit, which default to HTTPS)
*   security control: Data storage: Data is stored using appropriate mechanisms like DataStore and Room, which offer secure storage options. (Data layer implementations)

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The application uses some third-party libraries, which introduces a dependency on their security. This risk is mitigated by using well-maintained libraries and keeping them updated.
*   accepted risk: The application is primarily a sample and may not implement every possible security control. The focus is on demonstrating common best practices, not achieving the highest possible security level.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) if a WebView is used (currently, it doesn't appear to be, but this should be verified).
*   security control: Consider adding Network Security Configuration to explicitly define allowed network connections and certificate pinning.
*   security control: Regularly run dependency vulnerability scanners (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check) as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
*   security control: Explore the use of Jetpack Security library for enhanced data encryption at rest.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not applicable, as the app doesn't have user accounts.
*   Authorization: Not applicable, as there are no user roles or permissions.
*   Input Validation:
    *   All user inputs (if any) should be validated to prevent injection attacks. Currently, the app primarily consumes data from a backend API.
    *   Data received from the backend API should be treated as untrusted and validated/sanitized appropriately.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Data stored locally should be encrypted using appropriate cryptographic libraries (e.g., Jetpack Security).
    *   HTTPS should be enforced for all network communication.
*   Data Protection:
    *   Ensure no sensitive data is logged.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when accessing device resources.

### BUILD

    BuildArtifacts["Build Artifacts\n(APK/AAB)"]
    StaticAnalysis["Static Analysis\n(Detekt, Ktlint, Android Lint)"]
    Tests["Tests\n(Unit, Integration, UI)"]

    Developer -- Commits code --> GitHub
    Developer -- Runs --> LocalBuild
    LocalBuild -- Runs --> StaticAnalysis

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers write code and run local builds using Gradle.
2.  Local builds include running static analysis tools (Detekt, Ktlint, Android Lint) and tests (unit, integration, UI).
3.  Code is committed and pushed to the GitHub repository.
4.  GitHub Actions is triggered on push/pull request events.
5.  GitHub Actions runs the same build process as the local build, including static analysis and tests.
6.  If all checks pass, GitHub Actions produces build artifacts (APK/AAB).
7.  The build artifacts can be used for deployment (e.g., to Firebase App Distribution or Google Play Store).

Security Controls:

*   security control: Static analysis tools (Detekt, Ktlint, Android Lint) are run as part of the build process to identify potential code quality and security issues.
*   security control: Comprehensive tests (unit, integration, UI) are run to ensure code correctness and prevent regressions.
*   security control: GitHub Actions provides a secure and reproducible build environment.
*   security control: Dependency management ensures that dependencies are tracked and updated.
*   security control: Secrets (e.g., API keys) are managed securely using GitHub Actions secrets.
*   security control: Build process is automated, reducing the risk of manual errors.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Providing a reliable and accurate learning resource for Android developers.
*   Maintaining the reputation of the project as a showcase of best practices.

Data Protection:

*   Data: The application primarily displays publicly available news and updates related to Android development.
*   Sensitivity: Low. The data is not considered sensitive. However, data integrity is important to maintain the app's credibility.
*   Data: User preferences (if any) are stored locally.
*   Sensitivity: Low. Preferences are generally not considered sensitive, but should still be protected.
*   Data: Potentially, cached data from the backend API.
*   Sensitivity: Low, assuming the backend API doesn't provide sensitive data.

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   Is there a plan to introduce a backend API in the future? If so, what are the security requirements for the API?
*   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) that need to be considered? (Assumption: No, as the app doesn't collect personal data.)
*   What is the expected level of traffic and usage for the app? (Assumption: Moderate traffic, primarily from developers.)

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide an educational resource, not to build a production-ready application with strict security requirements.
*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The project has a relatively high risk tolerance, as it's an open-source sample application.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The existing security controls are sufficient for the current scope of the project.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The backend API (if used) is out of scope for this security assessment.
*   DESIGN: The architecture and design are appropriate for the project's goals.
*   DESIGN: The deployment process is well-defined and secure.
*   DESIGN: The build process is automated and includes security checks.
