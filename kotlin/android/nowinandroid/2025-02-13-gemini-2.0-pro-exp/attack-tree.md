## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Data Layer Vulnerabilities: SQL Injection [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_data_layer_vulnerabilities_sql_injection__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Although NiA uses Room, which generally protects against SQL injection *if used correctly*, improper use of `@RawQuery` or string concatenation within queries could introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Sub-Attacks:**
        *   **1a. Bypass Auth:** An attacker could craft a SQL injection payload to bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access.
        *   **1b. Modify Data:** An attacker could inject SQL code to modify, delete, or insert data into the database.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (Due to Room, but not impossible)
    *   **Impact:** High (Data breach, modification, authentication bypass)
    *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires finding a vulnerable `@RawQuery` or string concatenation)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Understanding of SQL injection and Room)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Detectable with static analysis and code review)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Strictly use parameterized queries with `@RawQuery`.
        *   Avoid any string concatenation within SQL queries.
        *   Employ static analysis tools to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement input validation as a defense-in-depth measure.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Data Layer Vulnerabilities: Data Exposure [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_data_layer_vulnerabilities_data_exposure__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data (user IDs, topic preferences, etc.) might be inadvertently exposed through logging, error messages, or insecure communication.
    *   **Sub-Attacks:**
        *   **2a. Read Sensitive Data:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive information by observing logs, error messages, or network traffic.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Accidental logging or error messages are common)
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Depends on the sensitivity of the exposed data)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Often requires just observing logs or error messages)
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner (Basic understanding of application behavior)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium (Logs/errors are often visible; identifying sensitive data requires analysis)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Review all logging statements to ensure no sensitive data is logged.
        *   Implement robust error handling that avoids exposing internal details.
        *   Use HTTPS for all communication and consider certificate pinning.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK]: 9. Third-Party Libraries {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__high-risk__9__third-party_libraries_{critical}.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most likely attack vector.  Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by NiA (Retrofit, OkHttp, Coil, etc.) can be exploited.
    *   **Sub-Attacks:**
        *   **9a. Supply Chain Attack [HIGH-RISK]:** A malicious actor compromises a legitimate library, injecting malicious code that is then distributed to applications using that library.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Increasingly common attack vector)
            *   **Impact:** Very High (Potential for complete application compromise)
            *   **Effort:** High (Requires compromising a library's build or distribution process)
            *   **Skill Level:** Expert (Advanced understanding of software supply chains)
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard (Requires sophisticated monitoring and analysis)
            * **Mitigation:**
                * Use signed artifacts.
                * Verify the integrity of dependencies.
                * Implement robust software composition analysis (SCA).
        *   **9b. Known Vulnerability in Dependency [HIGH-RISK] {CRITICAL}:** An attacker exploits a publicly known vulnerability in a third-party library used by the application.
            *   **Likelihood:** High (Libraries frequently have vulnerabilities)
            *   **Impact:** Variable (Depends on the specific vulnerability; can be Low to Very High)
            *   **Effort:** Variable (Depends on the vulnerability; can be Low to High)
            *   **Skill Level:** Variable (Depends on the vulnerability; can be Beginner to Expert)
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium (Vulnerability scanners can identify known vulnerabilities)
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Use a dependency management tool (Gradle) to keep libraries updated.
                *   Employ vulnerability scanning tools (Snyk, Dependabot, OWASP Dependency-Check).
                *   Establish a process for rapid patching of vulnerable dependencies.
                *   Minimize the number of dependencies used.
