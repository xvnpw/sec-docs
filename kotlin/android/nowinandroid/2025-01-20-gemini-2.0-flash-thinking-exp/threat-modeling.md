# Threat Model Analysis for android/nowinandroid

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerable Dependencies within NiA](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerable_dependencies_within_nia.md)

**Description:** An attacker could identify and exploit known security vulnerabilities present in the third-party libraries or Android Jetpack components *used directly by the Now in Android project*. This could involve crafting specific inputs or exploiting known API weaknesses in those libraries as they are integrated within NiA's modules.

**Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution on the user's device, data breaches by accessing sensitive information handled by NiA components, denial of service by crashing the application due to a vulnerability in a NiA dependency, or privilege escalation within the application's NiA-derived parts.

**Affected Component:** Primarily the `build.gradle.kts` files within NiA modules (e.g., `:app`, `:core-data`, `:feature-topic`) which define the project's dependencies. The specific vulnerable library integrated into NiA is also directly affected.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update all dependencies declared within NiA's `build.gradle.kts` files to their latest stable versions.
*   Implement a dependency management strategy that includes vulnerability scanning tools specifically targeting the dependencies used by NiA.
*   Monitor security advisories and release notes for the libraries used by NiA.
*   Consider using Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to identify and manage open-source risks within the NiA codebase.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of API Keys/Secrets within NiA Code](./threats/insecure_handling_of_api_keyssecrets_within_nia_code.md)

**Description:** An attacker could find accidentally committed API keys, secret tokens, or other sensitive credentials *within the Now in Android codebase itself* (even if intended for demonstration purposes). This could be through direct hardcoding or insecure configuration files present in the NiA repository.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to backend services that NiA might interact with (for demonstration or actual functionality), potential data breaches on the server-side if NiA uses real API keys, financial loss if the keys are associated with paid services integrated within NiA, or impersonation of the application based on exposed credentials within NiA.

**Affected Component:** Potentially any file within the NiA codebase where such secrets might be present, including Kotlin/Java source files, XML configuration files, or even build scripts *within the NiA project*.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the exposed secrets found within the NiA codebase).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly audit the NiA codebase for any hardcoded API keys or secrets.
*   Ensure that any example API keys or secrets are clearly marked as such and are not valid for production use.
*   Educate developers integrating NiA about the risks of inheriting insecurely stored secrets.
*   Implement pre-commit hooks or static analysis tools in the incorporating project to prevent accidental commit of secrets, even if they originate from NiA.
*   Regularly scan the incorporated codebase for potential secrets, even those that might have been copied from NiA.
