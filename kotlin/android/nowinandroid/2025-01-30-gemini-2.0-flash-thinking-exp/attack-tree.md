## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Expose Sensitive Data in Logs (e.g., API Keys, User Data) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__expose_sensitive_data_in_logs__e_g___api_keys__user_data___critical_.md)

**1.1.1. Expose Sensitive Data in Logs (e.g., API Keys, User Data) [CRITICAL]**

*   **Attack Vector Description:** Attacker gains access to application logs (e.g., through device access, logcat, or exposed log files) and extracts sensitive information that was unintentionally logged.
*   **Exploitable Weakness:**  Developers inadvertently log sensitive data like API keys, user credentials, personal information, or internal system details during development or in production code. Nia's logging patterns, if not used carefully, can contribute to this if developers are not mindful of what they log.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **High (API Keys):** Compromise of API keys can lead to unauthorized access to backend services, data breaches, and financial losses if paid APIs are abused.
    *   **Medium (User Data):** Exposure of user data violates privacy regulations, damages user trust, and can lead to identity theft or other harms.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement secure logging practices:
        *   Sanitize log messages to remove sensitive data before logging.
        *   Use appropriate logging levels (e.g., debug, info, warn, error) and avoid logging sensitive information at verbose levels in production.
        *   Utilize dedicated logging libraries that offer features for secure logging and redaction.
        *   Regularly review logs for accidental exposure of sensitive data.
        *   Restrict access to logs to authorized personnel only.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1. Client-Side Input Validation Bypass [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1__client-side_input_validation_bypass__high-risk_path___critical_.md)

**2.2.1. Client-Side Input Validation Bypass [CRITICAL]**

*   **Attack Vector Description:** Attacker manipulates client-side requests to bypass input validation performed in the UI (e.g., using browser developer tools, intercepting network requests).
*   **Exploitable Weakness:**  Relying solely on client-side input validation for security.  Nia's UI components and data binding mechanisms might make it easy to implement client-side validation, but this is inherently insecure if not backed by server-side validation.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **Medium (Data Integrity Issues):**  Invalid or malicious data can be submitted to the backend, leading to data corruption, application errors, or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Medium (Logic Bypass):**  Bypassing validation can allow attackers to circumvent intended application logic or access restricted functionalities.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Implement server-side validation:**  Always perform robust input validation on the backend for all critical data.
    *   Use client-side validation for user experience only (e.g., providing immediate feedback to users), but never rely on it for security.
    *   Sanitize and validate data on both client and server sides.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.1. Exposing Sensitive Data in UI State (e.g., storing API keys or tokens in UI state accessible to debugging tools) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_1__exposing_sensitive_data_in_ui_state__e_g___storing_api_keys_or_tokens_in_ui_state_accessible__d98d56a3.md)

**2.3.1. Exposing Sensitive Data in UI State (e.g., storing API keys or tokens in UI state accessible to debugging tools) [CRITICAL]**

*   **Attack Vector Description:** Attacker gains access to the application's UI state (e.g., using debugging tools, memory dumps, or by rooting the device) and extracts sensitive data stored there.
*   **Exploitable Weakness:**  Storing sensitive data directly in UI state management components (like ViewModel or Compose state) without proper protection. Nia's recommended state management patterns, if misused, could lead to developers unintentionally storing sensitive information in easily accessible state.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **Medium-High (Sensitive Data Exposure):** Exposure of API keys, tokens, or other sensitive credentials stored in UI state can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Avoid storing sensitive data directly in UI state:**  Do not store API keys, tokens, passwords, or other highly sensitive information in UI state components.
    *   Use secure storage mechanisms: Utilize Android Keystore, Encrypted Shared Preferences, or Room with encryption to store sensitive data securely.
    *   Access sensitive data only when needed: Retrieve sensitive data from secure storage only when it's required for a specific operation and avoid keeping it in memory longer than necessary.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1. Outdated Dependencies with Known Vulnerabilities (e.g., vulnerable versions of Kotlin libraries, Jetpack Compose libraries, etc.) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1__outdated_dependencies_with_known_vulnerabilities__e_g___vulnerable_versions_of_kotlin_librari_e220af41.md)

**3.1.1. Outdated Dependencies with Known Vulnerabilities (e.g., vulnerable versions of Kotlin libraries, Jetpack Compose libraries, etc.) [CRITICAL]**

*   **Attack Vector Description:** Attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in outdated dependencies used by the application. This can be done remotely if the vulnerability is network-exploitable or locally if the attacker can execute code on the device.
*   **Exploitable Weakness:**  Failure to regularly update dependencies to their latest secure versions. Nia project, like any modern Android project, relies on numerous dependencies, and outdated versions can contain known security flaws.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **Medium-High (Varies with Vulnerability):** Impact depends on the specific vulnerability. It can range from denial of service, data breaches, to remote code execution, potentially leading to full device compromise.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Regularly update dependencies:**  Establish a process for regularly updating all project dependencies, including transitive dependencies.
    *   **Use dependency vulnerability scanning tools:** Integrate tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, or GitHub Dependency Scanning into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Monitor security advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories for libraries used in the project to stay informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.1. Hardcoding API Keys in Code or Resources (directly in the application) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_1__hardcoding_api_keys_in_code_or_resources__directly_in_the_application___high-risk_path___crit_61eecc3d.md)

**4.1.1. Hardcoding API Keys in Code or Resources (directly in the application) [CRITICAL]**

*   **Attack Vector Description:** Attacker decompiles the application's APK or examines the source code (if exposed) to find hardcoded API keys.
*   **Exploitable Weakness:**  Storing API keys directly within the application's code or resources (e.g., in string resources, BuildConfig fields, or directly in Kotlin/Java code). This is a common mistake, especially during development.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **High (API Access, Potential Data Breach):** Compromised API keys can grant attackers unauthorized access to backend services, allowing them to steal data, manipulate application functionality, or incur financial costs.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Never hardcode API keys:**  Avoid storing API keys directly in the application code or resources.
    *   **Use Android Keystore:** Store API keys securely in the Android Keystore, which provides hardware-backed encryption.
    *   **Secure Configuration Management:** Utilize a secure configuration management system or environment variables to manage API keys outside of the application code.
    *   **Retrieve API keys at runtime:** Fetch API keys from secure storage or configuration at runtime when needed.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.2. Exposing API Keys through Source Code (if not properly managed in version control) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_2__exposing_api_keys_through_source_code__if_not_properly_managed_in_version_control___high-risk_c98d0bc5.md)

**4.1.2. Exposing API Keys through Source Code (if not properly managed in version control) [CRITICAL]**

*   **Attack Vector Description:** Attacker gains access to the application's source code repository (e.g., through accidental public exposure, compromised developer accounts, or insider threats) and finds API keys committed to version control.
*   **Exploitable Weakness:**  Committing API keys or configuration files containing API keys to version control systems, especially public repositories.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **High (API Access, Potential Data Breach):** Similar to hardcoding, exposed API keys in source code can lead to unauthorized API access and data breaches.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Use environment variables or secure configuration files:** Store API keys in environment variables or secure configuration files that are not committed to version control.
    *   **Avoid committing API keys to version control:**  Ensure that API keys and configuration files containing them are excluded from version control (e.g., using `.gitignore`).
    *   **Secrets scanning in VCS:** Implement automated secrets scanning in your version control system to detect accidental commits of sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.4.1. Logging Sensitive Information (as mentioned in 1.1.1, but can be a general integration issue) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/4_4_1__logging_sensitive_information__as_mentioned_in_1_1_1__but_can_be_a_general_integration_issue__960a8917.md)

**4.4.1. Logging Sensitive Information (as mentioned in 1.1.1, but can be a general integration issue) [CRITICAL]**

*   **Attack Vector Description:**  (Same as 1.1.1) Attacker gains access to application logs and extracts sensitive information that was unintentionally logged. This is reiterated here as it can be a general issue arising from improper integration of logging practices within the Nia framework.
*   **Exploitable Weakness:** (Same as 1.1.1) Developers inadvertently log sensitive data.
*   **Potential Impact:** (Same as 1.1.1) Compromise of API keys and exposure of user data.
*   **Mitigation:** (Same as 1.1.1) Implement secure logging practices (sanitize logs, use appropriate logging levels, dedicated libraries, regular reviews, restrict access).

## Attack Tree Path: [5.1.1. Fake Login Pages (mimicking the application's login screen) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/5_1_1__fake_login_pages__mimicking_the_application's_login_screen___high-risk_path___critical_.md)

**5.1.1. Fake Login Pages (mimicking the application's login screen) [CRITICAL]**

*   **Attack Vector Description:** Attacker creates a fake login page that visually resembles the application's login screen and tricks users into entering their credentials. This can be delivered through phishing emails, malicious websites, or compromised networks.
*   **Exploitable Weakness:**  Users' susceptibility to phishing attacks and lack of awareness about identifying fake login pages. While not directly a weakness in Nia itself, it's a threat to applications built with it, especially if they handle user authentication.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **High (Account Compromise, Data Theft):** Stolen credentials can be used to gain unauthorized access to user accounts, leading to data theft, account takeover, and other malicious activities.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Implement strong authentication mechanisms:** Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security beyond passwords.
    *   **Educate users about phishing attacks:**  Train users to recognize phishing attempts, verify website URLs, and be cautious about entering credentials on unfamiliar pages.
    *   **Use secure communication channels (HTTPS):** Ensure that all communication, especially login pages, uses HTTPS to protect data in transit and provide visual cues of security (e.g., padlock icon in the browser).
    *   **Application Signing and Integrity Checks:**  While less direct for phishing, ensuring application integrity can help users trust they are using the legitimate application and not a repackaged fake.
