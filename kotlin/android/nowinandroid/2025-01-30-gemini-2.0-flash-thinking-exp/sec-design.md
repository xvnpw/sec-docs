# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Goal: To showcase modern Android development best practices using Jetpack Compose and modern Android architecture.
 - Goal: To serve as a learning resource for Android developers interested in modern Android development.
 - Goal: To demonstrate a practical application of various Jetpack libraries and architectural patterns.
 - Priority: Code quality and adherence to best practices are paramount to effectively demonstrate modern Android development.
 - Priority: Maintainability and readability of the codebase to facilitate learning and understanding.
 - Priority: Demonstrating a functional application that showcases UI and data handling.

- Business Risks:
 - Risk: Misinterpretation of the sample application as a production-ready template without necessary security hardening.
 - Risk: Inclusion of insecure coding practices in the sample, which could be unintentionally adopted by developers learning from the project.
 - Risk: Outdated dependencies or libraries in the sample project over time, leading to security vulnerabilities if used as a template in the future.
 - Risk: Lack of clarity on the intended scope and limitations of the sample application, potentially leading to misuse or unrealistic expectations.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Code reviews are likely performed by the Android development team (inferred from open-source nature and Google's development practices). Implementation: GITHUB REPOSITORY - PULL REQUEST process.
 - security control: Dependency management using Gradle and dependency lock files. Implementation: GITHUB REPOSITORY - `build.gradle.kts` files and `gradle.lockfile`.
 - security control: Static code analysis using linters and code formatters (e.g., detekt, ktlint). Implementation: GITHUB REPOSITORY - Gradle configuration and potentially CI pipelines.
 - security control: ProGuard/R8 code shrinking and obfuscation during release builds. Implementation: ANDROID BUILD SYSTEM - Gradle configuration for release builds.

- Accepted Risks:
 - accepted risk:  Sample application may not undergo rigorous security penetration testing as a production application would. Rationale: It is a sample application and not intended for production use handling sensitive data.
 - accepted risk:  Vulnerabilities in backend services (if any are actually deployed and used for demo) are not in scope of this project's security posture. Rationale: Focus is on the Android application itself.
 - accepted risk:  Detailed security documentation and threat models are not explicitly created for this sample application. Rationale: Project's primary goal is demonstration and education, not production security.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement automated security scanning as part of the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions and SAST tools for Kotlin and Android).
 - security control: Regularly update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.
 - security control:  Include basic input validation examples within the sample application to demonstrate secure coding practices.
 - security control:  Provide clear documentation or comments within the code regarding security considerations and best practices for Android development.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Requirement:  For a sample news application, user authentication is likely not a core requirement. If implemented for demonstration purposes, it should showcase secure authentication practices.
  - Existing Control: Not explicitly implemented in the sample application as per initial review.
  - Recommended Control: If authentication is added as a feature, demonstrate secure storage of tokens (e.g., using Android Keystore) and secure communication protocols (HTTPS).
 - Authorization:
  - Requirement:  Authorization might be relevant if the application were to have different user roles or access levels. In the current sample, it is likely not a core requirement.
  - Existing Control: Not explicitly implemented.
  - Recommended Control: If authorization is added, demonstrate role-based access control or attribute-based access control within the application logic.
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement:  Input validation is crucial to prevent common vulnerabilities like injection attacks. The application should demonstrate proper input validation for user inputs and data received from external sources.
  - Existing Control: Basic input validation practices are expected as part of general good coding practices, but explicit security-focused input validation examples should be highlighted.
  - Recommended Control:  Implement and showcase input validation for common input fields (e.g., search queries, user profile updates) using Android Jetpack libraries or standard Kotlin validation techniques.
 - Cryptography:
  - Requirement:  Cryptography is essential for protecting sensitive data at rest and in transit. For a news application, data at rest might include user preferences or cached data. Data in transit should be protected using HTTPS.
  - Existing Control: HTTPS usage for network communication is expected. Data at rest encryption is not explicitly highlighted in the sample description.
  - Recommended Control:  Demonstrate best practices for handling sensitive data (if any) using Android Keystore for encryption and decryption. Ensure all network communication uses HTTPS.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Process: Demonstrating modern Android development best practices.
 - Process: Providing a learning resource for Android developers.
 - Process: Maintaining the credibility and reputation of the Android development team as experts in modern Android development.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - Data: Source code of the application. Sensitivity: High (Intellectual Property, competitive advantage in demonstrating best practices).
 - Data: Build artifacts (APK). Sensitivity: Medium (Integrity and availability for distribution).
 - Data: User data within the sample application (likely minimal, e.g., preferences). Sensitivity: Low (Sample data, not intended to be real user data).
 - Data: Developer credentials and signing keys. Sensitivity: Critical (Compromise could lead to unauthorized application updates or malicious application distribution).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
 - What is the intended backend service architecture for the "Now in Android" application? Is it a mock service or a real deployed service? (Assumption: Likely a simplified or mock service for demonstration purposes).
 - Are there specific security guidelines or policies that the "Now in Android" project adheres to beyond general Android security best practices? (Assumption: Adheres to general Android security best practices and Google's internal development guidelines).
 - What is the process for managing and updating dependencies for the project, and how are security vulnerabilities in dependencies addressed? (Assumption: Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning are performed, but specific details are not explicitly documented in the provided input).

- Assumptions:
 - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is educational and demonstrational, not production use. Security is important to showcase best practices but not to the level of a production application handling sensitive user data.
 - SECURITY POSTURE: Standard Android security best practices are followed. Security controls are primarily focused on secure development lifecycle and basic application security measures. Detailed security documentation and penetration testing are not assumed to be in scope for this sample project.
 - DESIGN: The application follows modern Android architecture principles with clear separation of layers. The backend service is simplified or mocked for demonstration purposes. Deployment is primarily through the Google Play Store. Build process is automated using CI/CD and includes basic security checks.
