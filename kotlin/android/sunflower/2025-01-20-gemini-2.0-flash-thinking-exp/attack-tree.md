## Attack Tree Path: [Indirect SQL Injection via User Input Passed to Sunflower Data Queries](./attack_tree_paths/indirect_sql_injection_via_user_input_passed_to_sunflower_data_queries.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path involves exploiting a weakness in the consuming application where user-provided input is used to construct database queries against data managed by Sunflower (using Room). If this input is not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Steps:**
    *   **Identify Input Points in Consuming App that Interact with Sunflower Data:** The attacker first identifies areas in the consuming application where user input is used in conjunction with Sunflower's data access logic (e.g., search fields, filtering options).
    *   **Craft Malicious Input to Manipulate Sunflower's Data Queries:** The attacker crafts specific input strings containing SQL commands (e.g., `'; DROP TABLE plants; --`) designed to alter the intended database query.
    *   **Execute Malicious Query to Extract Sensitive Data or Modify Application State:** When the consuming application executes the query containing the malicious input, the injected SQL commands are executed against the database, potentially leading to data extraction, modification, or even deletion.
*   **Risk Assessment:** This path is considered high-risk due to its medium likelihood (dependent on consuming app practices) and significant potential impact (data breach, data manipulation).

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution via Vulnerable Dependency](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution_via_vulnerable_dependency.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path involves exploiting a known vulnerability in one of Sunflower's dependencies that allows for the execution of arbitrary code on the device running the application.
*   **Steps:**
    *   **Identify Vulnerable Dependencies Used by Sunflower:** The attacker identifies outdated or vulnerable libraries used by Sunflower (e.g., an old version of Room or a networking library with a known RCE vulnerability).
    *   **Leverage Known Exploits for Identified Vulnerabilities:** The attacker utilizes publicly available exploits or develops their own to target the identified vulnerability.
    *   **Execute Arbitrary Code on the Device:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the application, potentially leading to complete device compromise.
*   **Risk Assessment:** This path is high-risk due to its potentially critical impact (full device compromise) and the fact that dependency vulnerabilities are relatively common. While the likelihood of successful exploitation might be lower than SQL injection, the severity of the impact elevates its risk.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Breach via Vulnerable Dependency](./attack_tree_paths/data_breach_via_vulnerable_dependency.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path involves exploiting a vulnerability in one of Sunflower's dependencies that allows for unauthorized access to sensitive data.
*   **Steps:**
    *   **Identify Vulnerable Dependencies Used by Sunflower:** Similar to the RCE path, the attacker identifies vulnerable libraries.
    *   **Leverage Known Exploits for Identified Vulnerabilities:** The attacker uses exploits that specifically target data access or leakage vulnerabilities within the dependency.
    *   **Gain Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to bypass normal access controls and retrieve sensitive information managed by the application or potentially even the device.
*   **Risk Assessment:** This path is high-risk due to its potential for critical impact (data breach) and the ongoing discovery of vulnerabilities in software dependencies.
