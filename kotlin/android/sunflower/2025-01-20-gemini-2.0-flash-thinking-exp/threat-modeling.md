# Threat Model Analysis for android/sunflower

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Sunflower's Dependencies](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_sunflower's_dependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Sunflower's Dependencies
    *   **Description:** Sunflower relies on various Android Jetpack libraries and potentially other third-party dependencies. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit them through the application. This could involve crafting specific inputs or triggering certain application flows that interact with the vulnerable dependency.
    *   **Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability. It could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution within the application's context.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Various modules depending on the vulnerable dependency. This could include the `app` module, `data` module (for Room), or UI-related modules (for UI libraries).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Sunflower's dependencies to the latest stable versions that include security patches.
        *   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies.
        *   Implement security best practices when using external libraries, such as input validation and output encoding.
