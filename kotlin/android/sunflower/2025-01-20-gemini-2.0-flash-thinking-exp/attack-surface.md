# Attack Surface Analysis for android/sunflower

## Attack Surface: [Improperly Sanitized User Input Leading to Potential SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/improperly_sanitized_user_input_leading_to_potential_sql_injection.md)

**Description:** User-provided data is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**How Sunflower Contributes:** If Sunflower's codebase directly constructs SQL queries using user input (e.g., when filtering or searching plant data), it becomes vulnerable. While Room generally mitigates this, developers might bypass it for custom queries.

**Example:** A malicious user could enter a plant name like `' OR '1'='1` in a search field, potentially bypassing intended filtering and retrieving all plant data.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive plant data, potential data modification or deletion.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**  Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by Room. Avoid constructing raw SQL queries with user input. Leverage Room's query builders and data access objects (DAOs).

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Handling Data from Remote API (Unsplash)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_handling_data_from_remote_api__unsplash_.md)

**Description:** The application trusts and processes data received from an external API without proper validation.

**How Sunflower Contributes:** Sunflower fetches plant images and potentially other data from the Unsplash API. If this data is not validated, malicious content could be displayed or processed.

**Example:** A compromised Unsplash account or a vulnerability in the Unsplash API could lead to the delivery of malicious image files that exploit vulnerabilities in image decoding libraries within Sunflower.

**Impact:**  Remote code execution (if image decoding vulnerability is severe), denial of service, displaying inappropriate content.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the nature of the vulnerability and the data being handled).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation on all data received from the Unsplash API. Use secure image loading libraries (like Glide) and keep them updated. Implement error handling for API responses. Consider using checksums or signatures to verify data integrity.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries (Glide, Retrofit)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_libraries__glide__retrofit_.md)

**Description:** The application relies on third-party libraries that may contain known security vulnerabilities.

**How Sunflower Contributes:** Sunflower uses libraries like Glide for image loading and potentially Retrofit for network communication. Using outdated or vulnerable versions of these libraries introduces risk.

**Example:** An outdated version of Glide might have a known vulnerability that allows for remote code execution when processing a specially crafted image.

**Impact:**  Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the severity of the library vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Regularly update all third-party libraries to their latest stable versions. Implement dependency management tools to track and manage library updates. Conduct security audits of dependencies.
