## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Sunflower (Root Goal)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_sunflower__root_goal_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker's ultimate objective is to compromise the application that integrates the Sunflower project. This could involve various forms of compromise, such as data theft, data manipulation, denial of service, or gaining unauthorized access/control.
*   **Attack Vectors (Summarized from Sub-Nodes):**
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   Exploiting insecure data handling practices, particularly input validation weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Sunflower Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_sunflower_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** This high-risk path focuses on exploiting known security vulnerabilities present in the third-party libraries (dependencies) used by the Sunflower project (and potentially the integrating application).  These dependencies include Coil, Room, WorkManager, and other Jetpack libraries.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploit Vulnerable Version of Coil (Image Loading)** `**Critical Node: Coil Dependency**`
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Specific Coil Version** `**Critical Node: Known Coil CVEs**`
            *   **Action:** Identify and exploit publicly known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in the specific version of the Coil library used.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium (depends on how outdated the Coil version is and the availability of exploits).
            *   **Impact:** Medium-High (depends on the CVE, could range from Denial of Service to code execution).
            *   **Effort:** Low-Medium (if an exploit exists, effort is lower; otherwise, higher for research and exploit development).
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium (using existing exploits is medium skill; developing exploits is high skill).
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (exploit attempts might be logged, but successful exploitation could be subtle).
    *   **Exploit Vulnerable Version of Room (Persistence)** `**Critical Node: Room Dependency**`
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Specific Room Version** `**Critical Node: Known Room CVEs**`
            *   **Action:** Identify and exploit known CVEs in the specific version of the Room persistence library.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium (depends on how outdated the Room version is and CVE severity).
            *   **Impact:** Medium-High (CVE dependent, could range from Denial of Service to data access or code execution).
            *   **Effort:** Low-Medium (exploit availability dependent).
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium (exploit usage); High (exploit development).
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.
    *   **Exploit Vulnerable Version of WorkManager (Background Tasks)** `**Critical Node: WorkManager Dependency**`
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Specific WorkManager Version** `**Critical Node: Known WorkManager CVEs**`
            *   **Action:** Identify and exploit known CVEs in the specific version of the WorkManager library.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium (depends on outdatedness and CVE severity).
            *   **Impact:** Medium-High (CVE dependent, Denial of Service, privilege escalation, etc.).
            *   **Effort:** Low-Medium (exploit availability dependent).
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium (exploit usage); High (exploit development).
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.
    *   **Exploit Vulnerable Version of other Jetpack Libraries or Dependencies** `**Critical Node: General Dependency CVEs**`
        *   **Action:**  General dependency vulnerability exploitation targeting any other vulnerable Jetpack library or third-party dependency used by Sunflower or the integrating application.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium (depends on overall dependency landscape and update practices).
        *   **Impact:** Medium-High (wide range depending on the vulnerable library and CVE).
        *   **Effort:** Low-Medium (if known CVEs exist, effort is lower).
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium (using exploits); High (finding new ones).
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Data Handling in Sunflower Code (or Misuse in Integrating App)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_data_handling_in_sunflower_code__or_misuse_in_integrating_app_.md)

*   **Description:** This high-risk path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from insecure practices in how the application handles data, either within the Sunflower code itself or, more likely, in how the integrating application extends or misuses Sunflower's data handling patterns.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Data Tampering/Modification** `**Critical Node: Data Tampering**`
        *   **Insecure Data Input Validation** `**Critical Node: Input Validation Weakness**`
            *   **Action:** Inject malicious data into application input fields (e.g., plant names, descriptions, user-added fields) due to insufficient or absent input validation in the integrating application.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (common vulnerability if input validation is not prioritized).
            *   **Impact:** Low-Medium (data corruption, application malfunction, potential for further exploits if data is used insecurely).
            *   **Effort:** Low-Medium (requires identifying input fields and testing for vulnerabilities).
            *   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium (basic understanding of input validation and app security).
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low-Medium (input validation errors can be detected through testing and monitoring, but subtle tampering might be missed).
