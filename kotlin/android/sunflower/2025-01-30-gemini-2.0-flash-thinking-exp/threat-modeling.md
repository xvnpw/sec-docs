# Threat Model Analysis for android/sunflower

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependencies (Potentially High Severity)](./threats/vulnerable_dependencies__potentially_high_severity_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Attacker could exploit *critical* known vulnerabilities in outdated or vulnerable dependencies (especially core Jetpack libraries like Room, Glide, CameraX, or WorkManager) used by Sunflower.
    *   Exploitation depends on the specific vulnerability, but in a worst-case scenario, a critical vulnerability in a core dependency could allow for remote code execution or significant data breaches *within the context of the Sunflower application*.
    *   For example, a vulnerability in Glide could potentially be exploited by displaying a maliciously crafted plant image, leading to code execution. A vulnerability in Room could potentially allow for database manipulation or data exfiltration.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High Impact:** Remote Code Execution (if a critical vulnerability in a library like Glide or a lower-level image processing library is exploited through image handling in Sunflower).
    *   **High Impact:** Data Breach (if a critical vulnerability in Room or another data storage related library is exploited, potentially leading to unauthorized access to plant data and potentially other application data).
    *   **High Impact:** Denial of Service (if a vulnerability causes application crashes or instability, impacting availability).
*   **Affected Sunflower Component:**
    *   All modules, as dependencies are used throughout the application, but especially:
        *   `image` loading components (Glide)
        *   `data` module (Room database)
        *   `camera` module (CameraX)
        *   `work` module (WorkManager)
*   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical depending on specific vulnerability)
    *   While the *likelihood* of a *critical* vulnerability being actively exploited in Sunflower specifically might be moderate, the *potential impact* of such a vulnerability in a core dependency is undeniably High to Critical.  The severity is elevated due to the potential for Remote Code Execution or Data Breach scenarios.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement a *proactive* and *rigorous* dependency management process.
        *   Utilize automated dependency scanning tools integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to continuously monitor for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Prioritize and *immediately* apply security updates for *all* dependencies, especially core Jetpack libraries and any third-party libraries used for critical functionalities like image processing, data storage, and networking (if applicable in future features).
        *   Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases relevant to the used libraries and frameworks to stay informed about emerging threats.
        *   Conduct regular security code reviews, focusing on areas where dependencies are heavily utilized, to identify potential weaknesses or misconfigurations that could amplify the impact of dependency vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Ensure \"automatic app updates\" are enabled in the Google Play Store to receive security patches for applications, including Sunflower, as quickly as possible.
        *   Keep Android OS updated to benefit from system-level security improvements and dependency updates provided by the OS vendor.
