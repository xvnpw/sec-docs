# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, named Sunflower, is an example Android application showcasing modern Android development best practices. It is designed to demonstrate the use of Architecture Components, Material Design, and other recommended Android libraries. The primary business goal is to provide a learning resource for Android developers, illustrating how to build robust, maintainable, and visually appealing Android applications.

- Business Priorities:
  - Provide a high-quality, practical example of modern Android development.
  - Showcase best practices and recommended libraries.
  - Serve as a learning tool for Android developers of varying skill levels.
  - Maintain code clarity and readability for educational purposes.

- Business Risks:
  - Misinterpretation of best practices if the example is not carefully crafted.
  - Security vulnerabilities in the example code that could be copied by developers.
  - Outdated dependencies or libraries that could lead to compatibility issues or security concerns in projects that adopt this example.
  - Lack of clarity or documentation, hindering the learning process for developers.

# SECURITY POSTURE

The Sunflower project, being a demonstration application, likely has a minimal security posture in its current form. The focus is on functionality and educational value rather than robust security controls.

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Use of Android Jetpack libraries, which are generally developed with security considerations in mind. Implemented within the application codebase, leveraging libraries like Room for data persistence and Navigation for UI flow.
  - security control: Adherence to Android security best practices as documented by Google. Implemented through code structure and library choices, implicitly following platform recommendations.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Lack of explicit authentication and authorization mechanisms. Accepted as the application is designed for offline, single-user use and does not handle sensitive user data or server-side interactions.
  - accepted risk: Minimal input validation beyond what is inherently provided by Android UI components and data binding. Accepted as the application's data inputs are primarily controlled by the user interface and are not designed to handle malicious or unexpected input from external sources.
  - accepted risk: No explicit cryptographic measures for data at rest or in transit. Accepted as the application stores non-sensitive data locally and does not communicate over networks.
  - accepted risk: Limited focus on supply chain security for dependencies. Accepted as the project relies on well-established and widely used Android libraries managed through Gradle and Maven Central.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement static analysis security testing (SAST) tools in the build pipeline to automatically detect potential code vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Regularly update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities in libraries.
  - security control: Consider adding basic input validation to handle unexpected user inputs more robustly, even for a demo application.
  - security control: If future iterations involve network communication or data sharing, implement appropriate transport layer security (TLS/SSL) and consider server-side security measures.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable in the current scope as it is a single-user, offline application. If user accounts or online features are added, authentication will become a requirement.
  - Authorization: Not applicable in the current scope. If user roles or data access controls are introduced, authorization mechanisms will be needed.
  - Input Validation: While currently minimal, more robust input validation should be considered, especially if the application were to handle data from external sources or user-provided text inputs beyond simple form fields. Validation should be implemented at the application layer, before data is processed or persisted.
  - Cryptography: Not currently required. If sensitive data storage or network communication is introduced, encryption at rest (using Android Keystore or similar) and in transit (TLS/SSL) will be necessary.

# DESIGN

The Sunflower project is designed as a single-application Android project, following a modern Android architecture. It is primarily focused on local data management and user interface interactions.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Providing a functional and educational example of modern Android development.
  - Maintaining the integrity and quality of the example code.
  - Ensuring the example does not inadvertently introduce insecure coding practices to developers.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Plant data: Publicly available information about plants. Low sensitivity.
  - User garden data (plantings, notes): Personal user data related to their virtual garden. Low to medium sensitivity. While not highly sensitive, user data should be treated with respect and protected from unauthorized access or modification within the application's scope.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - Is there any plan to extend Sunflower to include network features or user accounts in the future? If so, security requirements will significantly increase.
  - What is the intended audience skill level? This will influence the level of detail and security considerations needed in the example.
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements or security standards that this project should adhere to, even as a demo application?

- Assumptions:
  - The primary goal is educational, not to build a production-ready, feature-rich application.
  - Security is considered primarily from the perspective of demonstrating good Android development practices, rather than implementing advanced security features.
  - The application is intended for single-user, offline use in its current form.
  - Data stored by the application is considered low to medium sensitivity and does not require enterprise-grade security measures in this demo context.
