# Attack Surface Analysis for android/sunflower

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Local Storage of Plant Data](./attack_surfaces/insecure_local_storage_of_plant_data.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive user data related to plant collections, user notes, garden layouts, or potentially location data (if features expand) is stored locally on the device without proper encryption or protection. This could involve plaintext storage in SharedPreferences or unencrypted databases.
*   **Sunflower Contribution:** Sunflower's core functionality revolves around managing plant data and user gardens. If this data, which could be considered personal and private, is stored insecurely, it becomes a significant vulnerability.
*   **Example:** User's detailed notes on plant care, including specific locations of plants in their garden (if such a feature exists or is added), are stored in plaintext in an unencrypted SQLite database. A malicious application or attacker with physical access to the device could extract this database and access sensitive user information about their plant collection and habits.
*   **Impact:** **High - Privacy Violation, Information Disclosure, Potential for Targeted Attacks.** Exposure of detailed user plant data, personal notes, and potentially location information can lead to serious privacy breaches. This information could be valuable for targeted social engineering or even physical theft if garden locations are revealed.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Critically Important:** Encrypt all sensitive plant data at rest using robust encryption methods like AES and leverage the Android Keystore system for secure key management.
        *   Implement proper access controls and file permissions to restrict access to the application's data storage area.
        *   Minimize the amount of sensitive data stored locally if possible. Consider server-side storage for more sensitive information if the application's features expand to online capabilities.
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Essential:** Use a strong device lock screen password or biometric authentication to protect the device from unauthorized physical access.
        *   Be extremely cautious about granting storage permissions to untrusted applications, as they could potentially access insecurely stored data from other applications.

## Attack Surface: [Outdated Third-Party Libraries with Critical Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/outdated_third-party_libraries_with_critical_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Sunflower relies on third-party libraries (e.g., Jetpack libraries, potentially image handling or utility libraries). Using outdated versions of these libraries that contain known **critical** security vulnerabilities directly exposes the application to exploitation.
*   **Sunflower Contribution:**  Like any modern Android application, Sunflower depends on external libraries. If the development team does not diligently maintain and update these dependencies, Sunflower becomes vulnerable to publicly known exploits within those outdated libraries.
*   **Example:** Sunflower uses an outdated version of an image processing library that has a **critical** remote code execution vulnerability. If an attacker can find a way to trigger the vulnerable code path within Sunflower (even indirectly, through crafted data or interaction), they could potentially execute arbitrary code within the application's context, leading to device compromise or data theft.
*   **Impact:** **Critical - Remote Code Execution, Data Theft, Device Compromise.** Exploiting critical vulnerabilities in outdated libraries can allow attackers to gain full control of the application, potentially leading to data breaches, malware installation, or complete device compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if critical vulnerabilities are present in dependencies)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Crucial:** Implement a robust dependency management system (like Gradle with dependency management plugins) and establish a strict policy for **regularly and immediately updating all third-party libraries to their latest stable versions.**
        *   **Mandatory:** Integrate automated dependency vulnerability scanning tools into the development and CI/CD pipeline to proactively identify and address known vulnerabilities in dependencies before release.
        *   Prioritize security updates for libraries, especially those with known critical vulnerabilities, above feature development.
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Essential:** Keep the Sunflower application and your Android system updated through the Google Play Store. Developers release updates to patch vulnerabilities, including those arising from outdated libraries. Install updates promptly.
        *   While users cannot directly fix developer-side library issues, staying updated is the primary user-side mitigation for this type of vulnerability.
