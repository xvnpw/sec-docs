## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Deep Link Validation in `PlantDetailFragment`](./mitigation_strategies/strict_deep_link_validation_in__plantdetailfragment_.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Strict Deep Link Validation in `PlantDetailFragment`**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Locate Deep Link Handling:** The `PlantDetailFragment` in Sunflower handles deep links that navigate to a specific plant's detail view. The `plantId` is passed as an argument.
    2.  **Enhance `plantId` Validation:** Currently, the `plantId` is simply passed to the `ViewModel`.  Enhance this:
        *   **Type Check:** Ensure `plantId` is a valid string representation of a number (since it's used as a key in the database).
        *   **Positive Value Check:** Verify that `plantId` represents a positive number (or non-negative, depending on your database ID scheme).  Plant IDs should not be negative.
        *   **Existence Check (Optional but Recommended):** Before querying the database, you *could* add a check to see if a plant with that ID *likely* exists. This is a performance trade-off, but it can prevent unnecessary database queries for invalid IDs. This could involve a simple check against a cached list of IDs or a very lightweight database query.
    3.  **Error Handling:** If the `plantId` is invalid, display an appropriate error message to the user (e.g., "Plant not found") and navigate to a safe fallback screen (e.g., the plant list). Do *not* attempt to load data for an invalid `plantId`.
    4. **Review Navigation Graph:** Ensure that the navigation graph (`nav_garden.xml`) defines the `plantId` argument with the correct type (`string` in this case) and that no other unexpected arguments are accepted via deep links.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Deep Links (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from crafting deep links with invalid `plantId` values that could cause unexpected behavior, crashes, or potentially expose internal data (e.g., by triggering error messages that reveal database structure).
    *   **Intent Spoofing (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of other apps triggering unintended behavior in `PlantDetailFragment` by providing invalid `plantId` values.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Deep Links:** High impact.  Significantly reduces the risk of deep link-based attacks targeting the plant detail view.
    *   **Intent Spoofing:** Medium impact.  Provides additional protection against intent-based attacks.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially.** The `plantId` is received, but the validation is minimal.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive validation logic for the `plantId` within `PlantDetailFragment`, including type checks, positive value checks, and potentially an existence check.
    *   Robust error handling for invalid `plantId` values.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation in `PlantRepository` and `GardenPlantingRepository`](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_in__plantrepository__and__gardenplantingrepository_.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: Input Validation in `PlantRepository` and `GardenPlantingRepository`**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Target Repositories:** Focus on the `PlantRepository` and `GardenPlantingRepository` classes, as these are the entry points for data persistence.
    2.  **`Plant` Validation:** In `PlantRepository`, before inserting or updating a `Plant` object:
        *   **`plantId`:** Validate as a non-empty string (likely a unique identifier).
        *   **`name`:** Validate as a non-empty string, potentially with a maximum length.
        *   **`description`:** Validate as a string, potentially with a maximum length. Consider sanitizing this field if it might be displayed in a context where HTML/JavaScript could be injected (unlikely in this app, but good practice).
        *   **`growZoneNumber`:** Validate as an integer within a reasonable range (e.g., 1-13 for USDA hardiness zones).
        *   **`wateringInterval`:** Validate as a positive integer.
        *   **`imageUrl`:** Validate as a string, potentially checking for a valid URL format (although this is less critical if Glide handles image loading securely).
    3.  **`GardenPlanting` Validation:** In `GardenPlantingRepository`, before inserting or updating a `GardenPlanting` object:
        *   **`plantId`:** Validate as a non-empty string (matching a valid `Plant` ID).
        *   **`plantDate`:** Validate as a valid date (using Kotlin's date/time libraries).
        *   **`lastWateringDate`:** Validate as a valid date, and potentially ensure it's not in the future.
    4.  **Error Handling:** If any validation fails, throw an appropriate exception (e.g., `IllegalArgumentException`) or return an error result (depending on your error handling strategy). Do *not* proceed with the database operation.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Corruption (Medium Severity):** Prevents invalid or malicious data from being stored in the database, ensuring data integrity and preventing unexpected application behavior.
    *   **SQL Injection (Low Severity, but good practice):** While Room uses parameterized queries, this provides an extra layer of defense, especially if custom queries are ever added.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Corruption:** Medium impact.  Ensures data quality and prevents unexpected application behavior.
    *   **SQL Injection:** Low impact in the current context, but important for defense-in-depth.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially.** Room's annotations provide some basic data validation (e.g., `@NonNull`), but the repository classes lack explicit validation logic.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Explicit validation logic within the `PlantRepository` and `GardenPlantingRepository` methods that interact with the database.
    *   Consistent error handling for validation failures.

## Mitigation Strategy: [JSON Data Validation in `SeedDatabaseWorker`](./mitigation_strategies/json_data_validation_in__seeddatabaseworker_.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy: JSON Data Validation in `SeedDatabaseWorker`**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Target `SeedDatabaseWorker`:** This `Worker` is responsible for reading plant data from a JSON file (`plants.json`) and seeding the database.
    2.  **Enhance JSON Parsing:** While Moshi handles JSON parsing, add checks *after* parsing to validate the structure and content of the data:
        *   **Expected Structure:** Verify that the JSON data conforms to the expected structure (a list of plant objects, each with the required fields).
        *   **Data Type Checks:** For each plant object, check that the fields have the correct data types (e.g., `plantId` is a string, `growZoneNumber` is an integer).
        *   **Value Range Checks:** Check that values fall within expected ranges (e.g., `growZoneNumber` is within a valid range).
        *   **Sanitization (Optional):** Consider sanitizing string fields (e.g., `name`, `description`) to prevent potential issues if the data is ever displayed in a vulnerable context.
    3.  **Error Handling:** If the JSON data is invalid or missing required fields, handle the error gracefully:
        *   Log the error.
        *   Do *not* seed the database with invalid data.
        *   Potentially notify the user (although this might be overkill for a background worker).
        *   Consider stopping the worker or retrying with a fallback mechanism.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Corruption (Medium Severity):** Prevents invalid or malicious data from being seeded into the database from the `plants.json` file.
    *   **Code Injection (Low Severity, but possible):** If the JSON parsing is flawed, or if the data is used in an unsafe way, this could potentially lead to code injection.  Validation mitigates this risk.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Corruption:** Medium impact.  Ensures the initial database state is valid and consistent.
    *   **Code Injection:** Low impact, but validation provides an important layer of defense.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially.** Moshi handles JSON parsing, but there are no explicit checks on the structure or content of the parsed data *after* Moshi processes it.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Explicit validation logic within `SeedDatabaseWorker` to verify the structure and content of the JSON data *after* parsing with Moshi.
    *   Robust error handling for invalid JSON data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review and Minimize Permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`](./mitigation_strategies/review_and_minimize_permissions_in__androidmanifest_xml_.md)

**4. Mitigation Strategy: Review and Minimize Permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`**

* **Description:**
    1. **Examine `AndroidManifest.xml`:** Carefully review the `<uses-permission>` tags in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
    2. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the app only requests the *minimum* necessary permissions. Sunflower, in its basic form, should require very few permissions (likely just `INTERNET` for potential future network requests, and possibly storage access if you were to allow users to add their own images).
    3. **Remove Unnecessary Permissions:** If any permissions are declared that are not *absolutely* required for the app's functionality, remove them.
    4. **Runtime Permissions:** For dangerous permissions (e.g., accessing the camera or user's location, *if* you were to add such features), implement runtime permission requests.  Do *not* request these permissions at install time. Sunflower doesn't currently use any runtime permissions, but this is crucial if you extend its functionality.
    5. **Justify Permissions:** For each permission requested, have a clear justification for why it's needed. Document this in comments within the `AndroidManifest.xml` file.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** If the app has excessive permissions, a vulnerability in any part of the app could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to system resources or user data.
    * **User Privacy Violations (Medium Severity):** Requesting unnecessary permissions can erode user trust and potentially violate privacy regulations.

* **Impact:**
    * **Privilege Escalation:** High impact. Minimizing permissions significantly reduces the attack surface.
    * **User Privacy Violations:** Medium impact. Improves user trust and compliance with privacy best practices.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * **Mostly Good.** The provided Sunflower code doesn't explicitly request many permissions. The `INTERNET` permission is likely present (though not strictly required for the core sample functionality).

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * **Explicit Justification:** Add comments in `AndroidManifest.xml` explaining why each requested permission is necessary.
    * **Review After Extensions:** If you add new features to Sunflower, *re-review* the permissions to ensure they remain minimal.
