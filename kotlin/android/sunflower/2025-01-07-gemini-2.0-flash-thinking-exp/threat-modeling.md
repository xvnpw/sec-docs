# Threat Model Analysis for android/sunflower

## Threat: [Local SQL Injection through Room](./threats/local_sql_injection_through_room.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft malicious input that, when processed by the application's database queries (within the Sunflower project's Room Persistence Library usage), is interpreted as SQL code rather than data. This could allow the attacker to read, modify, or delete arbitrary data within the application's local database. This could occur if Sunflower's DAOs or entities don't properly sanitize or parameterize inputs used in database queries.

**Impact:** Data breach (access to plant information), data manipulation (altering plant details), potential denial of service (by corrupting the database).

**Affected Component:** `Sunflower` project's Room database implementation, specifically Data Access Objects (DAOs) and database entities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developer (Sunflower Project):** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements within Sunflower's DAOs when interacting with the Room database, especially when handling data that could originate from external sources (even if those sources are within the app itself).
*   **Developer (Sunflower Project):** Implement input validation within Sunflower's data handling layers to prevent malicious characters from being passed to database queries.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependencies within Sunflower](./threats/vulnerable_dependencies_within_sunflower.md)

**Description:** The Sunflower project relies on various third-party libraries. If any of these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities in applications using Sunflower. This could involve remote code execution or other malicious activities depending on the vulnerability.

**Impact:** Application crash, remote code execution, data breach, or other unexpected behavior depending on the specific vulnerability in Sunflower's dependencies.

**Affected Component:** Sunflower's Gradle build files (`build.gradle`) that define its project dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** High (if a critical vulnerability exists in a direct dependency)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developer (Sunflower Project):** Regularly update all of Sunflower's project dependencies to their latest stable versions.
*   **Developer (Sunflower Project):** Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities in Sunflower's dependencies.
