# Attack Surface Analysis for androidx/androidx

## Attack Surface: [Data Exposure via Improper State Handling](./attack_surfaces/data_exposure_via_improper_state_handling.md)

*Description:* Sensitive data leakage or manipulation due to incorrect Activity/Fragment state saving/restoration.
*AndroidX Contribution:* `androidx.activity`, `androidx.fragment`, and `androidx.lifecycle.SavedStateHandle` are the *direct* mechanisms. Misuse of these APIs is the root cause.
*Example:* Storing an unencrypted authentication token in the `Bundle` passed to `onSaveInstanceState`. 
*Impact:* Data leakage, account compromise, unauthorized access.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    * **Developers:** Use `SavedStateHandle`, avoid storing sensitive data directly, encrypt sensitive data before storing, thoroughly test state handling.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection in Room](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_in_room.md)

*Description:* Vulnerabilities arising from improper use of raw SQL queries within the Room persistence library.
*AndroidX Contribution:* `androidx.room` provides `@RawQuery`, which, if misused with unsanitized user input, *directly* enables SQL injection.
*Example:* Using `@RawQuery` with string concatenation of user input: `@RawQuery("SELECT * FROM ... WHERE ... " + userInput)`.
*Impact:* Data leakage, modification, deletion, potential code execution.
*Risk Severity:* Critical
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    * **Developers:** Always use parameterized queries (`@Query` with placeholders), avoid `RawQuery` if possible, meticulously sanitize input if `RawQuery` is unavoidable.

## Attack Surface: [Intent Redirection via Exported Components](./attack_surfaces/intent_redirection_via_exported_components.md)

*Description:* Unintentionally exported Activities, Services, or BroadcastReceivers leading to unauthorized actions or data leaks.
*AndroidX Contribution:* AndroidX components (Activities, Fragments) are subject to manifest `android:exported` rules. The vulnerability is *directly* tied to misconfiguring these AndroidX components in the manifest.
*Example:* An internal-use Activity accidentally declared with `android:exported="true"`.
*Impact:* Data leakage, unauthorized actions, privilege escalation.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    * **Developers:** Explicitly set `android:exported="false"` for all components unless external access is required, thoroughly validate all Intent data for exported components.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in WebView](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_webview.md)

*Description:* XSS attacks when `WebView` displays web content with improperly handled JavaScript.
*AndroidX Contribution:* `androidx.webkit.WebViewCompat` is the *direct* component. Enabling JavaScript without proper sanitization creates the vulnerability.
*Example:* Displaying user comments in a `WebView` without sanitizing for malicious JavaScript.
*Impact:* Data theft, phishing, redirection, defacement.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    * **Developers:** Disable JavaScript if unnecessary, sanitize all user input before display, use `WebSettings.setAllowFileAccess(false)`, consider Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated Deep Links (Navigation Component)](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_deep_links__navigation_component_.md)

*Description:* Malicious deep links navigating to unintended destinations, bypassing security.
*AndroidX Contribution:* `androidx.navigation` *directly* handles deep linking. The vulnerability is the lack of validation of deep link arguments.
*Example:* A deep link `myapp://profile?user_id=123` manipulated to `myapp://profile?user_id=admin` without proper validation.
*Impact:* Bypassing security, unauthorized access, privilege escalation.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    * **Developers:** Thoroughly validate *all* deep link arguments, ensure destinations are intended for deep link access.

## Attack Surface: [Outdated Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/outdated_dependencies.md)

*Description:* Using old versions of AndroidX libraries or their transitive dependencies can expose the application to known vulnerabilities.
*AndroidX Contribution:* AndroidX itself and its dependencies.
*Example:* An older version of `androidx.security:security-crypto` might have a known vulnerability in its encryption implementation.
*Impact:* Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but can range from data leaks to remote code execution.
*Risk Severity:* Varies (High to Critical)
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    * **Developers:**
        * Regularly update all AndroidX libraries and their dependencies to the latest stable versions.
        * Use a dependency management system (like Gradle) to track and update dependencies.
        * Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check) to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        * Monitor security advisories for AndroidX and related libraries.
