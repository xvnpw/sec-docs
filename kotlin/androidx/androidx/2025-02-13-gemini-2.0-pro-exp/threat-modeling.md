# Threat Model Analysis for androidx/androidx

## Threat: [Biometric Authentication Bypass](./threats/biometric_authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Threat:** Biometric Authentication Bypass

    *   **Description:** An attacker bypasses biometric authentication by exploiting weaknesses in the application's *implementation* of `androidx.biometric.BiometricPrompt`. This includes presenting a fake biometric, exploiting race conditions, or leveraging weak fallback mechanisms (e.g., easily guessed PINs) that are improperly handled by the application's `BiometricPrompt` integration. The vulnerability lies in *how* the app uses the `androidx` component, not in the biometric hardware itself.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality protected by biometric authentication. Loss of user privacy, potential financial loss, and reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** `androidx.biometric.BiometricPrompt`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if biometrics protect sensitive data) or Critical (if biometrics are the *only* authentication factor, or protect highly sensitive data/actions).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly adhere to `BiometricPrompt` documentation.
        *   Implement strong, *difficult-to-bypass* fallback authentication (e.g., a complex password). Fallback should *not* be easily guessable or bypassable.
        *   Thoroughly handle *all* error and cancellation cases. Do *not* assume success.
        *   Correctly use `CryptoObject` to bind cryptographic operations to successful biometric authentication.
        *   Extensively test on a wide variety of devices and Android versions.
        *   Use the strongest available biometric class (e.g., Class 3) when appropriate.
        *   Do *not* rely solely on `canAuthenticate()` before showing the prompt; handle errors gracefully and securely.

## Threat: [PendingIntent Hijacking](./threats/pendingintent_hijacking.md)

*   **Threat:** `PendingIntent` Hijacking

    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts or modifies a `PendingIntent` created by the application using `androidx.core.app.PendingIntentCompat` (or related `androidx` APIs), redirecting it to a malicious component. This is possible if the `PendingIntent` is created with mutable flags or if the target component is not explicitly and securely specified. The attacker exploits the *application's* incorrect use of the `androidx` API.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker's malicious component executes instead of the intended component. This can lead to data theft, privilege escalation, installation of malware, or other malicious actions.
    *   **Affected Component:** `androidx.core.app.PendingIntentCompat` (and related uses of `PendingIntent` throughout `androidx`)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use immutable `PendingIntent` flags (`PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE`) whenever possible. This is the *primary* defense.
        *   If mutability is *absolutely* required (rare), rigorously validate the target component and use explicit intents. This is a high-risk scenario.
        *   Use `PendingIntent.getActivity()`, `PendingIntent.getBroadcast()`, or `PendingIntent.getService()` with *explicit* `Intent` objects, clearly specifying the target component.
        *   Avoid `PendingIntent.getActivities()` unless absolutely necessary and carefully secured.

## Threat: [Fragment Injection via Navigation Component](./threats/fragment_injection_via_navigation_component.md)

*   **Threat:** Fragment Injection via Navigation Component

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious deep link or manipulates navigation arguments to inject data into a fragment, bypassing security checks or navigating to an unintended fragment. This exploits the *application's* handling of input within the `androidx.navigation` component. The attacker leverages how the app uses the navigation graph and argument passing.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality within a fragment. Potential for code execution if the injected data is used unsafely within the fragment (e.g., displayed in a `WebView` without sanitization).
    *   **Affected Component:** `androidx.navigation` (specifically, the navigation graph, argument handling, and deep link processing)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Rigorously validate *all* input to fragments, especially data from deep links or navigation arguments.
        *   Use Safe Args to enforce type safety and prevent type confusion vulnerabilities. This is a key mitigation.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for *all* data displayed or used within fragments.
        *   Avoid dynamic fragment transactions based on untrusted input.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in SharedPreferences (Plain)](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_sharedpreferences__plain_.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure in `SharedPreferences` (Plain)

    *   **Description:** An attacker with physical device access (or root access) reads sensitive data stored in *plain* `SharedPreferences` (accessed via `androidx.preference.PreferenceManager` or directly). This is a direct misuse of `androidx` by *not* using the secure alternative.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality of sensitive data (user credentials, session tokens, personal information).
    *   **Affected Component:** `androidx.preference.PreferenceManager` (when used for *plain* `SharedPreferences`), direct usage of `Context.getSharedPreferences()`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use `androidx.security.crypto.EncryptedSharedPreferences` for *all* sensitive data. This is the *only* acceptable solution for sensitive data in `SharedPreferences`.
        *   *Never* store sensitive data in plain `SharedPreferences`.

## Threat: [ContentProvider Data Leakage/Tampering](./threats/contentprovider_data_leakagetampering.md)

*   **Threat:** `ContentProvider` Data Leakage/Tampering

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a `ContentProvider` (implemented using `androidx.core.content.ContentProvider` or a custom subclass) to access or modify sensitive data without authorization. This occurs due to missing or inadequate permission checks, or if the `ContentProvider` is exported without proper restrictions. The vulnerability is in the *application's* implementation of the `ContentProvider` using `androidx`.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to or modification of sensitive data managed by the `ContentProvider`. Data breaches, data corruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** `androidx.core.content.ContentProvider` (and custom implementations extending `ContentProvider`)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement *strict* permission checks on *all* `ContentProvider` operations (query, insert, update, delete).
        *   Use the `android:permission` attribute in the manifest to restrict access.
        *   Consider signature-based permissions for controlled access.
        *   Validate *all* input to the `ContentProvider` to prevent SQL injection and other data manipulation attacks.
        *   Set `android:exported="false"` in the manifest unless external access is *absolutely* required and carefully controlled.
        *   Use `android:grantUriPermissions` with extreme caution and only when necessary, with minimal scope.

## Threat: [FileProvider Misconfiguration](./threats/fileprovider_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Threat:** `FileProvider` Misconfiguration

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to files that should be protected due to a misconfigured `androidx.core.content.FileProvider`. This includes granting excessive permissions, exposing the wrong directories, or failing to validate the receiving application. The vulnerability is in *how* the application configures and uses the `androidx` component.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, leading to data leakage or modification.
    *   **Affected Component:** `androidx.core.content.FileProvider`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure the `FileProvider` in the manifest and XML resource file.
        *   Grant *only* the minimum necessary permissions (read-only, specific files, short duration).
        *   *Never* expose sensitive directories.
        *   Validate the receiving application's identity (package name and signature).
        *   Use `getUriForFile()` correctly; avoid manual URI construction.
        *   Thoroughly test the `FileProvider` configuration.

## Threat: [WebView Information Leakage/XSS within WebView](./threats/webview_information_leakagexss_within_webview.md)

* **Threat:** WebView Information Leakage/XSS within WebView

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in a `androidx.webkit.WebViewCompat` to steal information from the application or inject malicious JavaScript. This occurs if JavaScript is enabled unnecessarily, untrusted content is loaded, or Content Security Policy (CSP) is not used. The threat is in the *application's* use and configuration of the `androidx` WebView component.
    *   **Impact:** Data leakage, cross-site scripting (XSS) within the WebView, phishing attacks, potential for broader application compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** `androidx.webkit.WebViewCompat`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable JavaScript *only* if absolutely necessary.
        *   Use `setSafeBrowsingEnabled(true)` to enable Safe Browsing.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
        *   Validate *all* URLs loaded into the WebView.
        *   Avoid loading untrusted content.
        *   Use `addJavascriptInterface()` with *extreme* caution and only with trusted, vetted JavaScript code.
        *   Consider a custom `WebViewClient` to intercept and validate requests.
