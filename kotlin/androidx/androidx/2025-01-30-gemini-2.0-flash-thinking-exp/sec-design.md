# BUSINESS POSTURE

The AndroidX project is a suite of libraries from Google that are used by Android developers to build applications. It is part of Android Jetpack and is designed to provide backward-compatible versions of Android framework APIs, as well as offer new features and components to accelerate development and improve app quality across different Android versions and devices.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Provide stable and reliable libraries for Android developers.
- Ensure backward compatibility for new features and bug fixes.
- Accelerate Android app development by providing reusable components.
- Improve the quality and consistency of Android applications.
- Support a wide range of Android devices and versions.
- Foster a healthy and active Android developer ecosystem.

Most Important Business Risks:
- Security vulnerabilities in AndroidX libraries could be exploited in a vast number of Android applications, leading to widespread impact.
- Breaking changes or regressions in libraries could disrupt Android app development and cause compatibility issues.
- Slow adoption of new AndroidX libraries could hinder innovation and developer productivity.
- Performance issues in libraries could negatively impact the performance of Android applications.
- Open-source nature of the project requires careful management of contributions and security.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Open Source Code Review - The AndroidX project is open source, allowing for community review of the code. This is implemented on GitHub.
- security control: Public Issue Tracker - Public issue tracker on GitHub allows security researchers and developers to report potential vulnerabilities. This is implemented on GitHub.
- security control: Google Security Team Review - Projects from Google typically undergo internal security reviews, although the extent for open-source projects may vary. This is assumed to be implemented internally within Google.
- security control: Dependency Management - Using dependency management tools (like Gradle) helps manage and track dependencies, potentially aiding in vulnerability management of third-party libraries. This is implemented in the project's build system.

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Public vulnerability disclosure - As an open-source project, vulnerabilities may be publicly disclosed before a patch is available.
- accepted risk: Third-party dependency vulnerabilities - AndroidX relies on third-party libraries, which may contain vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Contribution security - Security risks associated with accepting contributions from a large number of external developers.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Implement SAST tools in the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan code for potential vulnerabilities during development.
- security control: Automated Dependency Scanning - Implement dependency scanning tools to automatically check for vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by AndroidX.
- security control: Regular Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits by internal or external security experts to identify and address potential security weaknesses.
- security control: Security Champions - Designate security champions within the development teams to promote security awareness and best practices.
- security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Program - Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure program to encourage responsible reporting of security issues.
- security control: Security Training for Developers - Provide security training to developers to improve their awareness of secure coding practices.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - Requirement: Contributors to the AndroidX project must be authenticated to ensure traceability and accountability of code changes. This is implemented by GitHub authentication for committers.
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: Access control mechanisms should be in place to manage who can commit code, merge pull requests, and manage releases. This is implemented by GitHub's role-based access control.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: AndroidX libraries should perform robust input validation to prevent vulnerabilities such as injection attacks and denial-of-service. This needs to be implemented within the code of AndroidX libraries.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: If AndroidX libraries handle sensitive data or implement security-sensitive features, they must use strong and properly implemented cryptography. This needs to be implemented within the code of AndroidX libraries where applicable.
