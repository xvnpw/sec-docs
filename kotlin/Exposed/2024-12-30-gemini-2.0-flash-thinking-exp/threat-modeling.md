* **Threat:** SQL Injection via Raw SQL or Improper `Op.build()` Usage
    * **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries if the application uses `Op.build()` with unsanitized user input or executes raw SQL queries directly with user-provided data. The attacker might manipulate the query logic to bypass authentication, extract sensitive data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
    * **Impact:** Critical
        * Data Breach: Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
        * Data Manipulation: Modification or deletion of critical data.
        * Privilege Escalation: Gaining administrative access to the database.
        * Denial of Service: Overloading the database server with malicious queries.
    * **Affected Exposed Component:**
        * `org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.SqlExpressionBuilder.build` function.
        * Any part of the application code where raw SQL queries are constructed and executed using Exposed's `exec()` or similar functions.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Always use parameterized queries:** Leverage Exposed's type-safe query building DSL, which automatically handles parameterization and prevents SQL injection.
        * **Avoid `Op.build()` with user input:** If dynamic query construction is absolutely necessary, ensure meticulous sanitization and validation of all user-provided data before incorporating it into the query. Consider using whitelisting and escaping techniques.
        * **Prefer DSL functions:** Utilize Exposed's DSL functions for building queries as they inherently provide protection against SQL injection.
        * **Regular code reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify any instances of raw SQL or `Op.build()` usage with potential vulnerabilities.

* **Threat:** Data Exposure through Over-Eager Loading
    * **Description:** An attacker might exploit the application's use of eager loading (e.g., using `with()` or `join()` excessively) to retrieve more data than necessary. This could expose sensitive information that the user is not authorized to access directly, potentially revealing relationships or attributes that should be protected.
    * **Impact:** High
        * Information Disclosure: Exposure of sensitive data to unauthorized users.
        * Privacy Violation: Unintentional sharing of personal or confidential information.
    * **Affected Exposed Component:**
        * `org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.statements.api.ExposedBlob.with` function (and similar `with` functions for other column types).
        * `org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.Join` and related join functions in the DSL.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Use lazy loading by default:** Only load related entities when explicitly needed.
        * **Carefully evaluate the necessity of eager loading:**  Optimize queries to fetch only the required data.
        * **Implement proper authorization checks:** Ensure that the application enforces access controls on all loaded data, even if fetched eagerly. Filter the results based on the user's permissions.
        * **Consider projection:** Select only the necessary columns instead of fetching entire entities.

* **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in the Exposed Library Itself
    * **Description:** An attacker could exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the Exposed library. This could allow them to bypass security measures, gain unauthorized access, or cause other harm depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    * **Impact:** Varies (can be Critical)
        * Depends on the specific vulnerability. Could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
    * **Affected Exposed Component:**
        * Any part of the Exposed library code.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (monitor for announcements, can be Critical)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep Exposed library up-to-date:** Regularly update to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
        * **Monitor security advisories:** Stay informed about any reported vulnerabilities in Exposed through official channels and security news.
        * **Consider using static analysis tools:** These tools can help identify potential vulnerabilities in the application's dependencies, including Exposed.

* **Threat:** Developer Errors Leading to Insecure Data Handling
    * **Description:** Developers might unintentionally introduce vulnerabilities through incorrect usage or misunderstanding of Exposed's features. This could include improper transaction handling, incorrect use of DSL functions leading to unexpected query behavior, or failing to sanitize data before using it in queries (even when using the DSL).
    * **Impact:** Varies (can be High)
        * Can lead to various vulnerabilities, including SQL injection (if DSL is misused), data corruption, or information disclosure.
    * **Affected Exposed Component:**
        * All parts of the Exposed library, depending on the specific error.
        * Application code interacting with Exposed.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Provide thorough training on Exposed:** Ensure developers understand best practices and potential security pitfalls.
        * **Conduct regular code reviews:** Identify and address potential security issues early in the development process.
        * **Establish coding guidelines:** Define secure coding practices for using Exposed within the project.
        * **Utilize static analysis tools and linters:** These tools can help identify potential misuse of the Exposed library.
        * **Implement comprehensive testing:** Include unit and integration tests to verify the correctness and security of database interactions.
