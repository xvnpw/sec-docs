*   **Attack Surface:** Platform-Specific Native Interop Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Compose Multiplatform allows interaction with native platform code through mechanisms like `expect`/`actual` and platform-specific implementations. Vulnerabilities in this native code or the bridging layer can be exploited.
    *   **How Compose Multiplatform Contributes:** By providing a mechanism to integrate with native code, Compose Multiplatform inherits the security risks associated with that native code. Bugs in the interop layer itself could also introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A Compose Multiplatform application on iOS uses a native library for a specific feature. This native library has a buffer overflow vulnerability that can be triggered by passing specially crafted data from the Compose layer.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution, memory corruption, privilege escalation, data breaches depending on the vulnerability in the native code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Apply secure coding practices to all native code integrations. Thoroughly audit and test native code for vulnerabilities. Use memory-safe languages where possible for native components. Implement robust input validation and sanitization at the boundary between Compose and native code. Utilize secure communication channels if data is exchanged.

*   **Attack Surface:** State Management Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Improper or insecure management of application state within Compose Multiplatform can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Compose Multiplatform Contributes:** Compose relies heavily on reactive state management. Race conditions, improper synchronization, or insecure storage of sensitive state can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A race condition in updating a user's permission status in the application's state allows a user to temporarily bypass authorization checks and access restricted features.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, privilege escalation, data manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust and thread-safe state management practices. Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions. Avoid storing sensitive information directly in easily accessible state objects. Consider using encrypted storage for sensitive state data. Follow best practices for managing application lifecycle and state persistence.

*   **Attack Surface:** Dependency Vulnerabilities (Compose Libraries and Transitive Dependencies)
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the Compose Multiplatform libraries themselves or their transitive dependencies can be exploited.
    *   **How Compose Multiplatform Contributes:**  Like any software project, Compose Multiplatform relies on external libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies are a potential attack vector.
    *   **Example:** A known security vulnerability exists in a specific version of a Kotlin library used by Compose Multiplatform. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if the application uses the affected version.
    *   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can range from Denial of Service to Remote Code Execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Regularly update Compose Multiplatform libraries and all other dependencies to the latest versions. Utilize dependency management tools with vulnerability scanning capabilities to identify and address known vulnerabilities. Monitor security advisories for Compose Multiplatform and its dependencies.

*   **Attack Surface:** Build Process Vulnerabilities (Compose Plugins and Tooling)
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the build tools, Gradle plugins, or other tooling used in the Compose Multiplatform build process can be exploited to inject malicious code.
    *   **How Compose Multiplatform Contributes:** The Compose Multiplatform build process relies on specific Gradle plugins and potentially other tools. Compromising these tools can compromise the resulting application.
    *   **Example:** A malicious Gradle plugin used for Compose compilation injects malware into the application's bytecode during the build process.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromised application, potential for widespread distribution of malware.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Use official and trusted sources for Compose Multiplatform plugins and build tools. Implement integrity checks for build dependencies. Secure the build environment and restrict access. Regularly update build tools and plugins. Employ secure build pipelines and practices.
