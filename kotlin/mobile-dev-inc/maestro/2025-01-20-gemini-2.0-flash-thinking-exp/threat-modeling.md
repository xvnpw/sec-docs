# Threat Model Analysis for mobile-dev-inc/maestro

## Threat: [Malicious Script Injection](./threats/malicious_script_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Maestro script repository or the environment where scripts are created and injects malicious code into existing or new scripts. This could involve adding commands to exfiltrate data, modify application settings, or perform actions the legitimate user would not intend. The attacker might exploit weak access controls, compromised developer accounts, or vulnerabilities in the script management system.

**Impact:**  Data breaches by exfiltrating sensitive information displayed on the UI, unauthorized modification of application data leading to data corruption or incorrect application behavior, triggering unintended application functionality that could harm users or the system, and potentially introducing persistent vulnerabilities through automated actions.

**Affected Maestro Component:** Maestro Scripts, Maestro CLI (if used for script management), potentially the Maestro Agent if the script interacts directly with the device's file system or other resources.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong access control mechanisms for the Maestro script repository, requiring multi-factor authentication and role-based access.
*   Enforce code review processes for all Maestro scripts before they are used in testing or automation.
*   Utilize a version control system for Maestro scripts to track changes and facilitate rollback if necessary.
*   Regularly scan the script repository for suspicious patterns or known malicious code.
*   Restrict write access to the script repository to authorized personnel only.

## Threat: [Script Tampering](./threats/script_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker with some level of access to the Maestro script repository or execution environment modifies existing, legitimate Maestro scripts. This could be done subtly to mask application defects during testing, introduce malicious behavior that is difficult to detect, or cause unexpected application states or data corruption over time. The attacker might exploit insufficient access controls or lack of integrity checks on script files.

**Impact:**  False sense of security due to undetected defects, introduction of subtle malicious functionality that could be exploited later, data corruption due to unintended application state changes, and potential for long-term damage if the tampered scripts are used in production environments (if applicable).

**Affected Maestro Component:** Maestro Scripts, potentially the Maestro CLI if used for script modification.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong access control mechanisms for the Maestro script repository.
*   Utilize a version control system with integrity checks to detect unauthorized modifications to scripts.
*   Implement a process for verifying the integrity of Maestro scripts before execution, potentially using checksums or digital signatures.
*   Regularly audit changes made to Maestro scripts.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Scripts](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_scripts.md)

**Description:** Developers inadvertently or intentionally include sensitive information (API keys, credentials, test data containing Personally Identifiable Information - PII) directly within Maestro scripts. If the script repository is compromised or if scripts are shared insecurely, this sensitive data could be exposed to unauthorized individuals.

**Impact:**  Exposure of API keys leading to unauthorized access to backend services, exposure of credentials allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users or gain access to internal systems, and exposure of PII leading to privacy violations and potential legal repercussions.

**Affected Maestro Component:** Maestro Scripts.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Prohibit the embedding of sensitive data directly within Maestro scripts.
*   Utilize secure secrets management solutions to store and retrieve sensitive information required by Maestro scripts.
*   Implement mechanisms to inject secrets into Maestro scripts at runtime without them being permanently stored in the script files.
*   Regularly scan Maestro scripts for potential secrets leakage.
*   Educate developers on secure coding practices regarding sensitive data.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access via UI Automation Abuse](./threats/unauthorized_access_via_ui_automation_abuse.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to a system where Maestro is configured and uses its UI automation capabilities to interact with the application in an unauthorized manner. This could involve bypassing login screens, accessing restricted areas, or performing actions as a legitimate user without proper authorization. This might be possible if Maestro is configured with overly broad permissions or is accessible from untrusted networks.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data, unauthorized modification of application data, circumvention of security controls, and potential for further exploitation of the application's vulnerabilities.

**Affected Maestro Component:** Maestro Agent (responsible for UI interaction), Maestro CLI (if used to initiate the unauthorized actions).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict access to the systems where Maestro is installed and configured.
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing Maestro's functionalities.
*   Ensure Maestro is configured with the least privilege necessary to perform its intended tasks.
*   Monitor Maestro activity for unusual or unauthorized actions.
*   Segment the network where Maestro operates to limit the potential impact of a compromise.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Maestro Software Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_maestro_software_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Like any software, Maestro itself might contain security vulnerabilities. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain control over the Maestro execution environment, manipulate its behavior, or use it as a pivot point to attack the application under test or other systems.

**Impact:**  Compromise of the Maestro environment, potential for using Maestro to further attack the application, and possible lateral movement to other systems.

**Affected Maestro Component:** All Maestro components (CLI, Agent, potentially cloud services if used).

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical if a severe vulnerability exists)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Maestro updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Subscribe to security advisories from the Maestro developers.
*   Implement security best practices for the systems where Maestro is installed.
*   Consider using network segmentation to isolate the Maestro environment.

## Threat: [Compromised Development or CI/CD Environment Leading to Maestro Abuse](./threats/compromised_development_or_cicd_environment_leading_to_maestro_abuse.md)

**Description:** If the development environment where Maestro scripts are created or the CI/CD pipeline where they are executed is compromised, attackers could leverage Maestro to gain unauthorized access to the application or its infrastructure. This could involve modifying scripts, executing malicious scripts, or using Maestro's capabilities for reconnaissance.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the application and its data, potential for deploying malicious code through the CI/CD pipeline, and compromise of the development infrastructure.

**Affected Maestro Component:** Maestro Scripts, Maestro CLI (used in CI/CD), potentially the Maestro Agent depending on the attack.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong security controls for the development and CI/CD environments, including access control, multi-factor authentication, and regular security audits.
*   Secure the CI/CD pipeline to prevent unauthorized modifications or executions.
*   Isolate the CI/CD environment from production systems.
*   Regularly scan development machines and CI/CD servers for malware and vulnerabilities.
