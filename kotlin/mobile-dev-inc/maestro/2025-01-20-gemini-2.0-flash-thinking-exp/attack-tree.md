## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Control of Maestro Execution](./attack_tree_paths/gain_control_of_maestro_execution.md)

**Goal:** To be able to execute arbitrary Maestro commands against the target application.

**Description:** An attacker needs to gain control over where Maestro is being run. This could be a developer's machine or a CI/CD pipeline.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Developer Environment](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_developer_environment.md)

**Goal:** To obtain developer credentials to gain access to their machines and Maestro configurations.

**Description:** Tricking developers into revealing their credentials, allowing the attacker to access their machines and Maestro configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Phishing for Developer Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/phishing_for_developer_credentials.md)

**Goal:** To obtain developer credentials to gain access to their machines and Maestro configurations.

**Description:** Tricking developers into revealing their credentials, allowing the attacker to access their machines and Maestro configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise CI/CD Pipeline](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_cicd_pipeline.md)

**Goal:** To inject malicious Maestro scripts into the automated build and testing process.

**Description:** Attackers can target vulnerabilities in the CI/CD pipeline configuration, compromise pipeline credentials, or inject malicious Maestro scripts directly into the pipeline's workflow. This allows them to execute malicious commands during automated testing or deployment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Maestro Scripts into Pipeline Workflow](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_maestro_scripts_into_pipeline_workflow.md)

**Goal:** To execute malicious Maestro commands automatically during the CI/CD process.

**Description:** Inserting malicious Maestro scripts into the pipeline's workflow, which will then be executed automatically during the build or testing process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Maestro Communication Channel](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_maestro_communication_channel.md)

**[HIGH RISK]** Exploit Maestro Communication Channel

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Storage of Maestro Configuration/Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_storage_of_maestro_configurationcredentials.md)

**Goal:** To obtain Maestro credentials to execute malicious commands.

**Description:** If Maestro configuration files or credentials used to connect to the agent are stored insecurely (e.g., plain text), an attacker gaining access to the system can use these to execute commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Maestro Functionality for Malicious Purposes](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_maestro_functionality_for_malicious_purposes.md)

**Goal:** Utilize Maestro's intended functionality in unintended and harmful ways to compromise the application.

**Description:** Maestro's ability to automate UI interactions can be exploited to bypass security measures or trigger unintended application behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Application Logic via Automated Actions](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_application_logic_via_automated_actions.md)

**[HIGH RISK]** Exploit Insecure Application Logic via Automated Actions

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication/Authorization Flows](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authenticationauthorization_flows.md)

**Goal:** To bypass security controls or trigger unintended application behavior using automated Maestro actions.

**Description:**
*   **Bypass Authentication/Authorization Flows:** Craft Maestro scripts to navigate through the application in ways that bypass intended authentication or authorization checks. For example, directly navigating to protected screens or manipulating session tokens.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities within Maestro Itself](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_within_maestro_itself.md)

**Goal:** Directly exploit security vulnerabilities within the Maestro framework (Agent or CLI/SDK).

**Description:** Like any software, Maestro itself might contain vulnerabilities that an attacker can exploit.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Maestro Agent Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_maestro_agent_vulnerabilities.md)

**Goal:** To execute arbitrary code or gain elevated privileges on the device running the Maestro Agent.

**Description:**
*   **Buffer Overflows in Agent:** Send specially crafted commands to the agent that cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading to code execution on the mobile device.
*   **Remote Code Execution in Agent:** Exploit vulnerabilities that allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device running the Maestro Agent. This could give them full control over the device and the application.
*   **Privilege Escalation within Agent:** Exploit vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges within the Maestro Agent, potentially allowing access to more device resources or the ability to bypass security restrictions.
