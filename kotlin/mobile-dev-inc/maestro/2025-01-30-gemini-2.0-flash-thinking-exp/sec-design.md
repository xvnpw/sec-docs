# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Maestro, aims to provide a painless mobile UI automation solution. The primary business goal is to empower mobile development teams to efficiently create, run, and maintain UI tests for their applications. This leads to faster feedback loops, improved software quality, and reduced time to market for mobile applications.

Key business priorities are:
- Ease of use: The tool should be simple to learn and use for developers and QA engineers with varying levels of automation experience.
- Reliability: Tests should be reliable and produce consistent results across different devices and environments.
- Performance: Test execution should be fast to enable rapid feedback during development.
- Scalability: The solution should scale to accommodate growing teams and increasing test volumes.
- Integration: Seamless integration with existing development workflows and CI/CD pipelines is crucial.

Most important business risks to address:
- Data breaches: If Maestro handles sensitive application data or test credentials, breaches could lead to exposure of confidential information.
- Service disruption: Downtime or instability of Maestro services could halt testing processes and delay releases.
- Inaccurate test results: Flawed test execution or reporting could lead to undetected bugs in production applications, impacting user experience and business reputation.
- Vendor lock-in: Over-reliance on a single automation tool could create challenges if the tool becomes unsupported or unsuitable in the future.
- Security vulnerabilities in Maestro itself: Vulnerabilities in Maestro could be exploited to compromise the testing environment or the applications being tested.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Access control to the GitHub repository is likely in place, limiting who can contribute to the codebase. (Implemented in: GitHub repository settings)
- security control: Code review processes are likely used for contributions to the codebase. (Implemented in: Development workflow, GitHub pull requests)
- security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools might be used to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities. (Likely implemented in: CI/CD pipeline, if any)
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools might be used to scan the codebase for potential security flaws. (Likely implemented in: CI/CD pipeline, if any)
- security control: Regular security patching of underlying infrastructure and dependencies is assumed. (Implemented in: Infrastructure management processes)

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies. (Mitigation: SCA tools, dependency updates)
- accepted risk: Risk of insider threats with access to the codebase and testing infrastructure. (Mitigation: Access control, code review, monitoring)
- accepted risk: Reliance on the security of underlying cloud providers or hosting environments. (Mitigation: Choosing reputable providers, security configuration)

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing Maestro services and data.
- security control: Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
- security control: Use encryption for sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments of Maestro components.
- security control: Implement security monitoring and logging to detect and respond to security incidents.
- security control: Establish a secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC) incorporating security considerations at each stage.
- security control: Implement a robust secrets management solution to protect API keys, credentials, and other sensitive information.

Security requirements:
- Authentication:
    - requirement: Secure authentication mechanism for users accessing Maestro services (e.g., API, UI).
    - requirement: Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
    - requirement: Integration with existing identity providers (IdP) via protocols like OAuth 2.0 or SAML for enterprise users.
- Authorization:
    - requirement: Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and access to resources.
    - requirement: Granular authorization policies to control access to specific features and data within Maestro.
    - requirement: Principle of least privilege should be applied to all user and service accounts.
- Input Validation:
    - requirement: Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection, SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
    - requirement: Sanitize user inputs before processing or storing them.
    - requirement: Implement input validation on both client-side and server-side.
- Cryptography:
    - requirement: Use encryption for sensitive data at rest (e.g., test results, configuration data, credentials).
    - requirement: Use encryption for sensitive data in transit (e.g., API communication, communication with mobile devices).
    - requirement: Securely store and manage cryptographic keys.
    - requirement: Utilize industry-standard and well-vetted cryptographic algorithms and libraries.

Build Process Description:

The build process for Maestro is envisioned to be automated using GitHub Actions, triggered on code pushes or pull requests to the GitHub repository.

Build Process Steps:
1. Code Checkout: GitHub Actions checks out the latest code from the repository.
2. Dependency Install: Dependencies are installed using a dependency management tool (e.g., Maven, npm, pip, Go modules).
    - security control: Dependency scanning for known vulnerabilities during dependency installation. (Implemented in: DependencyInstall step, using SCA tools)
3. Unit Tests: Unit tests are executed to ensure code quality and functionality.
    - security control: Unit tests provide basic code validation and help prevent regressions. (Implemented in: UnitTests step)
4. SAST Scan: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are used to scan the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities.
    - security control: SAST tools identify potential security flaws in the code before deployment. (Implemented in: SASTScan step, using SAST tools integrated into CI/CD)
5. Build Artifacts: The codebase is compiled and packaged into build artifacts (e.g., JAR files, binaries, etc.).
    - security control: Code compilation process ensures code integrity and prevents tampering. (Implemented in: BuildArtifacts step, using compiler toolchain)
6. Containerize (if applicable): If Maestro components are containerized (e.g., using Docker), Docker images are built.
    - security control: Base image selection and container image scanning for vulnerabilities. (Implemented in: Containerize step, using secure base images and container scanning tools)
7. Publish Artifacts: Build artifacts (e.g., Docker images, binaries) are published to an artifact registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR, GitHub Packages).
    - security control: Secure artifact registry with access control to protect build artifacts. (Implemented in: ArtifactRegistry, using registry access control policies)
    - security control: Signing of artifacts to ensure integrity and authenticity. (Recommended security control: Artifact signing during PublishArtifacts step)

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- Mobile application development lifecycle: Maestro supports a critical part of the software development lifecycle by enabling UI testing. Disruption to Maestro can slow down development and release cycles.
- Quality assurance process: Maestro is directly involved in ensuring the quality of mobile applications. Failures or inaccuracies in Maestro can lead to undetected bugs and impact application quality.
- Brand reputation: If Maestro vulnerabilities lead to security breaches or data leaks in applications tested with it, it can negatively impact the brand reputation of the organizations using Maestro.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Test scripts: May contain sensitive information about application workflows and business logic. Sensitivity: Medium to High (depending on the application).
- Test results and logs: Can contain screenshots and data from the application under test, potentially including Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or other sensitive data. Sensitivity: Medium to High (depending on the application and test data).
- Configuration data: API keys, credentials, and settings for connecting to devices and services. Sensitivity: High.
- Source code of Maestro: Contains intellectual property and potential vulnerabilities if exposed. Sensitivity: High.
