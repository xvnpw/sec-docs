## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Masking and Scrambling in Test Environments (UI Context)](./mitigation_strategies/data_masking_and_scrambling_in_test_environments__ui_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Data Masking and Scrambling in Test Environments (for Maestro UI Testing)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive UI Elements:** Catalog UI elements within your application that display sensitive data during Maestro UI tests. This includes text fields, labels, and any other UI components showing PII, financial data, etc.
    2.  **Implement UI-Level Masking:**  Modify your application's test environment configuration to mask or scramble sensitive data *specifically* in the UI layer. This could involve:
        *   Using test-specific configurations to display masked data in UI tests.
        *   Implementing UI interceptors or proxies that dynamically mask data before it's rendered in the UI during tests.
        *   Utilizing Maestro's capabilities to interact with UI elements that already display masked data in test environments.
    3.  **Verify UI Masking in Maestro Tests:**  Design Maestro tests to explicitly verify that sensitive data is indeed masked in the UI during test execution.
    4.  **Avoid Real Data in Maestro Flows:** When designing Maestro flow files (`.yaml`), ensure you are using placeholder data or test-specific data that is not real or sensitive.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Accidental Data Exposure During Maestro UI Tests (High Severity):** Risk of real sensitive data being displayed and potentially captured in Maestro screenshots, recordings, or logs during UI tests.
    *   **Data Breach via Maestro Test Artifacts (High Severity):** If Maestro test outputs (screenshots, recordings, logs) containing unmasked sensitive data are compromised, it can lead to a data breach.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Medium Severity):** Failure to protect sensitive data displayed in UI tests can lead to violations of data privacy regulations.
*   **Impact:** Significantly Reduces risk of data exposure specifically through Maestro UI testing artifacts.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Backend data scrambling is used, but dedicated UI-level masking for tests and verification within Maestro tests are missing.
    *   Location: Backend data scrambling scripts in `staging-environment` repository.
