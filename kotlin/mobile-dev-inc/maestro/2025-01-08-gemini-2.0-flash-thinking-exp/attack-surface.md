# Attack Surface Analysis for mobile-dev-inc/maestro

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Local Communication Channels](./attack_surfaces/insecure_local_communication_channels.md)

*   **Description:** Maestro communicates with the device under test (emulator/simulator or real device) via local network connections or debugging bridges like ADB. These channels, if not properly secured, can be intercepted or manipulated.
    *   **How Maestro Contributes:** Maestro establishes these communication channels as a core part of its functionality to control and interact with the device.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on the same local network as the machine running Maestro could intercept commands sent to the device, potentially injecting malicious commands to install unauthorized applications or exfiltrate data.
    *   **Impact:** Device compromise, data exfiltration, unauthorized application installation, disruption of testing process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use secure protocols (e.g., SSH tunneling) for communication with the device.
        *   Restrict network access to the machine running Maestro and the devices under test.
        *   Ensure proper firewall configurations to limit access to Maestro's communication ports.
        *   Avoid using Maestro in untrusted network environments.

## Attack Surface: [Execution of Malicious Test Scripts](./attack_surfaces/execution_of_malicious_test_scripts.md)

*   **Description:** Maestro executes test scripts that can contain arbitrary commands to interact with the device. If the system allows for the execution of untrusted or poorly vetted scripts, malicious code can be introduced.
    *   **How Maestro Contributes:** Maestro's primary function is to execute these scripts, making it the vehicle for potential malicious code execution.
    *   **Example:** A compromised developer account could introduce a test script that, when executed by Maestro, accesses sensitive data on the device and sends it to an external server.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, device compromise, unauthorized access to device resources, potential for lateral movement if the testing environment is connected to other systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict code review processes for all Maestro test scripts.
        *   Use a version control system for test scripts and track changes.
        *   Enforce strong authentication and authorization for accessing and modifying test scripts.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed environment for executing test scripts to limit the impact of malicious code.
        *   Regularly scan test scripts for potential vulnerabilities or malicious patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Maestro Server/Agent Components](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_maestro_serveragent_components.md)

*   **Description:** If the Maestro server or agent components are exposed beyond a secure development or testing environment, they can become targets for attackers.
    *   **How Maestro Contributes:** Maestro's architecture involves server/agent components that manage and execute tests. Improper configuration can lead to their unintended exposure.
    *   **Example:** A misconfigured firewall could expose the Maestro server to the public internet, allowing attackers to attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in the server software.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, information disclosure about the application and testing environment, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the Maestro server and agent are only accessible within a trusted network.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the Maestro server and agent.
        *   Keep the Maestro server and agent software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Use a web application firewall (WAF) if the Maestro server exposes a web interface.
