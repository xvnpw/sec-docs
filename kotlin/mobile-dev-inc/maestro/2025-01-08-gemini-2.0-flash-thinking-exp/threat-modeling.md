# Threat Model Analysis for mobile-dev-inc/maestro

## Threat: [Malicious Script Injection](./threats/malicious_script_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Script Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker could craft or modify a Maestro flow file to include malicious commands. This might involve directly editing YAML files or exploiting vulnerabilities in how Maestro parses and executes flow instructions. The attacker could aim to execute arbitrary code on the system running Maestro or interact with the target application in unintended ways.
    *   **Impact:** Successful injection could lead to data exfiltration from the target application or the system running Maestro, modification of application data, disruption of testing processes, or even gaining control of the testing environment.
    *   **Affected Component:** Maestro Flow Files, Maestro CLI (specifically the flow execution engine).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict code review processes for all Maestro flow files.
        *   Store flow files in version control systems to track changes and identify unauthorized modifications.
        *   Enforce principle of least privilege for users who can create or modify flow files.
        *   Consider using static analysis tools to scan flow files for potentially malicious patterns.
        *   Secure the environment where Maestro CLI is executed to prevent unauthorized access and modification of files.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Flow Files](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_flow_files.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Data in Flow Files
    *   **Description:** Developers might unintentionally include sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or test credentials directly within Maestro flow files. An attacker gaining access to these files could extract this sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of credentials could lead to unauthorized access to backend systems, data breaches, or the compromise of third-party services.
    *   **Affected Component:** Maestro Flow Files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in flow files.
        *   Use environment variables or secure secret management solutions to handle sensitive data.
        *   Implement regular scanning of flow files for potential secrets.
        *   Enforce access controls on flow file repositories.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Maestro Execution Environment](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_maestro_execution_environment.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Maestro Execution Environment
    *   **Description:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the system where Maestro is being executed (developer machine, CI/CD server). This access could be used to manipulate flows, access sensitive data related to the application or the testing process, or disrupt testing.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the testing environment, potential for injecting malicious code into the application build process, or access to sensitive data used in testing.
    *   **Affected Component:** The system where Maestro CLI is installed and executed.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization measures for access to development machines and CI/CD servers.
        *   Keep the operating system and software on these systems up to date with security patches.
        *   Use network segmentation to isolate the testing environment.
        *   Implement monitoring and intrusion detection systems.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Maestro Framework Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_maestro_framework_itself.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Maestro Framework Itself
    *   **Description:** The Maestro framework itself might contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the system running Maestro or the target application.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution on the system running Maestro, denial of service, or unintended interactions with the target application.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Core Maestro framework code, potentially specific modules or functions within the framework.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Maestro updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories related to Maestro.
        *   Report any discovered vulnerabilities to the Maestro development team.

## Threat: [Compromised Maestro Installation](./threats/compromised_maestro_installation.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Maestro Installation
    *   **Description:** The downloaded or installed version of Maestro could be compromised with malicious code. An attacker could distribute a modified version of Maestro through unofficial channels.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of malicious code during test runs, potentially compromising the testing environment or the target application.
    *   **Affected Component:**  The entire Maestro installation package.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Download Maestro only from the official GitHub repository or trusted sources.
        *   Verify the integrity of the downloaded files using checksums or digital signatures.
        *   Use reputable package managers if installing Maestro through them.

## Threat: [Abuse of Maestro for Malicious Application Control (in compromised environment)](./threats/abuse_of_maestro_for_malicious_application_control__in_compromised_environment_.md)

*   **Threat:** Abuse of Maestro for Malicious Application Control (in compromised environment)
    *   **Description:** If an attacker gains control of a system where Maestro is configured, they could leverage Maestro's UI automation capabilities to perform malicious actions on the target application.
    *   **Impact:**  Automated execution of malicious actions within the application, such as creating fraudulent accounts, initiating unauthorized transactions, or exfiltrating data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Maestro CLI, Maestro Flow Files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Focus on securing the environment where Maestro is used (see "Unauthorized Access to Maestro Execution Environment").
        *   Implement strong authorization and authentication within the target application to prevent unauthorized actions, even if automated.
        *   Monitor application activity for suspicious patterns.
