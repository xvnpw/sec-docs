    * **Credential Stuffing Detection:** Implement mechanisms to detect and block credential stuffing attacks (using lists of compromised credentials).
    * **Alerting on Default Credential Usage:**  Implement checks to identify if default credentials are still in use and trigger alerts.

**2.2. Lack of Authentication on API -> Direct API Access [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

* **Description:** The Maestro API is exposed without requiring any form of authentication. This allows anyone with network access to interact with the API endpoints directly, bypassing any intended security controls.
* **Potential Impact:** Same as the parent node "Access Unprotected Maestro Server/API". This is a particularly severe vulnerability as it offers completely open access.
* **Technical Details:** This often occurs when developers prioritize ease of use during development and forget to implement proper authentication mechanisms before deployment. It can also happen due to misconfiguration of the API gateway or web server.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Implement Authentication Mechanisms:**  Integrate robust authentication methods such as:
        * **API Keys:** Require a valid API key for each request.
        * **OAuth 2.0:** Utilize OAuth 2.0 for more secure and granular authorization.
        * **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Employ JWTs for stateless authentication.
        * **Basic Authentication (HTTPS Required):**  While less secure than other methods, basic authentication over HTTPS is better than no authentication.
    * **Authorization Controls:** Implement authorization mechanisms to control what actions authenticated users are permitted to perform on the API.
    * **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
    * **Secure API Gateway:**  Utilize a secure API gateway to manage and protect access to the Maestro API.
