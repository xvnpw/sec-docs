## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Maestro -> Code Injection in Flow Files [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_maestro_-_code_injection_in_flow_files__critical_.md)

    *   **Description:** This is the most critical attack path. An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how Maestro processes flow files to inject and execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**
        *   **YAML Parsing Vulnerability [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Description:** Maestro uses YAML for flow files.  If the YAML parser is not configured securely, it can be vulnerable to code injection.  An attacker crafts a malicious YAML file that, when parsed, executes arbitrary code on the system running Maestro (CLI or server).
            *   **Likelihood:** High
            *   **Impact:** Very High (full system compromise)
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Unsafe Deserialization [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Description:** This is a specific type of YAML parsing vulnerability.  YAML allows for the serialization and deserialization of objects.  If the deserialization process is not handled securely, it can allow the attacker to create arbitrary objects and execute their methods, leading to code execution.
            *   **Likelihood:** High
            *   **Impact:** Very High (full system compromise)
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Abuse Legitimate Features](./attack_tree_paths/2__abuse_legitimate_features.md)

    *   **Bypass Authentication/Authorization:**
        *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a Maestro flow that bypasses the application's normal authentication or authorization mechanisms.  This could involve directly navigating to a protected page or resource without proper credentials.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (access to protected resources)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    * **Run Arbitrary Commands:**
        * **Description:** If Maestro allows execution of system commands (which it ideally shouldn't, or should severely restrict), an attacker could use this functionality to run arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.
        * **Likelihood:** Low (should be restricted by design)
        * **Impact:** Very High (full system compromise)
        * **Effort:** High
        * **Skill Level:** Advanced
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Capture Sensitive Data:**
        *   **Description:** An attacker creates a Maestro flow that interacts with the application's UI to extract sensitive data displayed on the screen, such as passwords, API keys, or personal information.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (data breach)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Manipulate Flow Files -> Inject Malicious Commands](./attack_tree_paths/3__manipulate_flow_files_-_inject_malicious_commands.md)

    * **Description:** If an attacker can gain write access to the location where Maestro flow files are stored, they can modify existing files or upload new ones containing malicious commands. These commands would then be executed by Maestro.
    * **Likelihood:** Low (requires file system access)
    * **Impact:** Very High (arbitrary code execution)
    * **Effort:** Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Advanced
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
