# Threat Model Analysis for mobile-dev-inc/maestro

## Threat: [Malicious Flow Injection](./threats/malicious_flow_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Flow Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the environment where Maestro flows are executed (CI/CD, developer machine) and either injects a completely new malicious flow or modifies an existing, legitimate flow. The attacker crafts the flow to interact with production systems, exfiltrate sensitive data, or perform unauthorized actions within the application.  The attacker leverages Maestro's ability to interact with the application as if it were a user.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized transactions, reputational damage, financial loss, system compromise.  The impact is similar to a direct attack on the application, but the entry point is through the testing framework.
    *   **Affected Component:** Maestro Flow Execution Engine (the component that parses and executes YAML flow definitions), CI/CD pipeline integration, local Maestro CLI execution environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Access Control:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for CI/CD pipelines and developer machines where Maestro flows are executed.
        *   **Flow Code Review:** Treat Maestro flow definitions (YAML) as code and subject them to rigorous code review processes.
        *   **Isolated Execution Environment:** Run Maestro flows in dedicated, ephemeral virtual machines or containers, especially when interacting with sensitive data or production-like environments.
        *   **Digital Signatures:** Digitally sign Maestro flow definitions and verify the signature before execution to prevent unauthorized modifications.
        *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement robust monitoring and alerting for unauthorized flow executions or modifications.

## Threat: [Compromised Maestro Cloud Account](./threats/compromised_maestro_cloud_account.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Maestro Cloud Account

    *   **Description:** (Applicable only if using Maestro Cloud) An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Maestro Cloud account through phishing, credential stuffing, or other means.  The attacker can then upload malicious flows, view test results (which may contain sensitive data), modify existing flows, or delete projects.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (test results, flow definitions), potential for malicious flow execution against connected applications, disruption of testing processes.
    *   **Affected Component:** Maestro Cloud platform, user authentication mechanisms, flow storage, test result storage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authentication:** Use strong, unique passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all Maestro Cloud accounts.
        *   **Access Logging:** Regularly review access logs and audit trails within Maestro Cloud for suspicious activity.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Limit the permissions of Maestro Cloud accounts to the minimum necessary for their intended use.
        *   **SSO Integration:** Consider using Single Sign-On (SSO) with a trusted identity provider.

## Threat: [Tampered Maestro Binary](./threats/tampered_maestro_binary.md)

*   **Threat:** Tampered Maestro Binary

    *   **Description:** An attacker replaces the legitimate Maestro binary (downloaded or built from source) with a compromised version. This malicious binary could intercept data sent to/from the application during testing, modify test results, or perform other malicious actions on the host machine.
    *   **Impact:** Data leakage, compromised test results, potential for further system compromise (if the tampered binary has elevated privileges).
    *   **Affected Component:** Maestro CLI binary, update mechanisms (if any).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Official Source:** Download Maestro *only* from the official GitHub repository or other trusted sources.
        *   **Checksum Verification:** Verify the integrity of the downloaded binary using checksums (e.g., SHA-256) provided by the official source.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Maestro updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   **Secure Build Process:** If building from source, use a secure build process that prevents the introduction of malicious code.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Leakage in Flows](./threats/sensitive_data_leakage_in_flows.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Leakage in Flows

    *   **Description:** Developers inadvertently include hardcoded credentials (API keys, passwords, database connection strings), personally identifiable information (PII), or other sensitive data directly within the Maestro flow YAML definitions.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potential for unauthorized access to systems or data, violation of privacy regulations.
    *   **Affected Component:** Maestro Flow YAML files, any storage location for these files (e.g., Git repository, CI/CD system).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **No Hardcoding:** *Never* hardcode sensitive data in flow definitions.
        *   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to inject sensitive data into the flow execution environment.
        *   **Secrets Management:** Utilize a secure secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
        *   **Automated Scanning:** Regularly scan flow definitions for potential secrets using automated tools.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data in Test Output](./threats/sensitive_data_in_test_output.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data in Test Output

    *   **Description:** Maestro captures screenshots, videos, and logs during test execution.  These outputs might contain sensitive data displayed by the application, such as user data, financial information, or internal API responses.  This data is then stored, potentially insecurely.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, violation of privacy regulations, potential for misuse of sensitive information.
    *   **Affected Component:** Maestro's output capture mechanisms (screenshot, video recording, logging), storage locations for test results (local filesystem, Maestro Cloud storage).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **UI Review:** Carefully review the application's UI to minimize the display of sensitive data during testing.
        *   **Data Masking/Redaction:** Use Maestro's features (if available) or post-processing to mask or redact sensitive data in screenshots and logs.
        *   **Secure Storage:** Store test outputs securely and restrict access to authorized personnel only.
        *   **Data Retention Policies:** Implement data retention policies to automatically delete old test outputs after a defined period.
