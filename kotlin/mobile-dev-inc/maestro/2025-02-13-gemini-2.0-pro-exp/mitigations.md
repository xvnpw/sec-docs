## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Data Handling within Maestro Flows](./mitigation_strategies/secure_data_handling_within_maestro_flows.md)

1.  **Environment Variables:**  *Never* hardcode sensitive data (passwords, API keys, etc.) directly within Maestro flow YAML files.  Use environment variables (e.g., `${MY_SECRET_KEY}`) within the `inputText`, `tapOn`, or other relevant commands.
2.  **Maestro Flow Modification:**  Replace all hardcoded sensitive data with references to environment variables.  For example:
    ```yaml
    # BAD:
    - inputText: "mysecretpassword"

    # GOOD:
    - inputText: "${MY_PASSWORD}"
    ```
3.  **Pre-flight Checks (Data Validation):** Before using any sensitive data obtained from environment variables, include assertions to validate its format or expected value (if possible). This adds a layer of defense against misconfiguration.  Example:
    ```yaml
    - assertVisible: "${API_KEY}" # Basic check that it's not empty
    # - runScript:  # More advanced validation (requires custom command)
    #     script: |
    #       if (!process.env.API_KEY.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9]{32}$/)) {
    #         throw new Error("Invalid API Key format");
    #       }
    ```
4. **Custom Command for Masking (Conceptual):** If sensitive data *must* be displayed on the screen, create a *custom Maestro command* that handles input and display with masking. This is a more advanced technique.  The custom command would:
    *   Take the sensitive data as input (likely from an environment variable).
    *   Use a JavaScript library or custom logic to mask the data (e.g., replace characters with asterisks).
    *   Use Maestro's `inputText` command to enter the *masked* value into the field.
    *   Potentially store the original (unmasked) value in a secure way *within the custom command's scope* (not globally accessible) if needed for later verification.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Environment-Aware Flows and Pre-flight Checks](./mitigation_strategies/environment-aware_flows_and_pre-flight_checks.md)

1.  **Environment Variables for URLs/Endpoints:** Use environment variables (e.g., `APP_URL`, `API_ENDPOINT`) within Maestro flows to specify the target application URL or API endpoint.
2.  **Conditional Flow Execution (`runFlow.when.env`):** Use the `runFlow` command with the `when.env` condition to execute specific flows only in the intended environment.  This prevents accidental execution against the wrong environment.
    ```yaml
    - runFlow:
        when:
          env: "staging"
        file: staging-specific-flow.yaml
    - runFlow:
        when:
          env: "testing"
        file: testing-specific-flow.yaml
    ```
3.  **Pre-flight Checks (Assertions):** At the *beginning* of each Maestro flow, include assertions to verify that the flow is running in the correct environment.  This is a crucial safeguard. Examples:
    ```yaml
    - assertVisible:
        text: "Staging Environment" # If a specific text is present only in staging
        optional: true # Avoid failing if the text is not found (log a warning instead)
    - assertVisible:
        id: "staging-only-element" # If a specific element ID exists only in staging
        optional: true
    - evalScript: | # More robust check using JavaScript
        output.url === "${EXPECTED_STAGING_URL}"
    - assertTrue: "${output.url}"
    ```
4. **Custom Command for Environment Verification (Advanced):** Create a custom Maestro command that encapsulates more complex environment verification logic. This command could:
    *   Check multiple indicators (URL, presence of specific elements, API responses).
    *   Log detailed information about the detected environment.
    *   Throw an error if the environment is incorrect, halting the flow execution.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Custom Command Implementation](./mitigation_strategies/secure_custom_command_implementation.md)

1.  **Input Validation:**  *Within* the JavaScript code of any custom Maestro command, rigorously validate all input parameters.  Use a validation library (e.g., `joi`, `validator`) or implement custom validation logic to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
    ```javascript
    // Example custom command (simplified)
    function myCustomCommand(input) {
      if (!input.username || typeof input.username !== 'string' || input.username.length > 50) {
        throw new Error("Invalid username");
      }
      // ... rest of the command logic ...
    }
    ```
2.  **Least Privilege (Conceptual - Limited within Maestro):** While true sandboxing is difficult within Maestro's current architecture, strive to limit the *scope* of variables and operations within the custom command. Avoid using global variables or accessing unnecessary system resources.
3.  **Avoid `eval` and Similar:** Do *not* use `eval()` or similar functions (e.g., `Function()`) within custom commands, as they can introduce significant security risks if used with untrusted input.
4. **Secure Handling of Secrets (if needed):** If a custom command *must* handle sensitive data, ensure it receives this data through environment variables (passed from the Maestro flow) and *never* hardcodes it.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust UI Element Selection within Flows](./mitigation_strategies/robust_ui_element_selection_within_flows.md)

1.  **Prioritize Robust Selectors:** Within Maestro flow YAML files, use the most robust and resilient selectors available:
    *   **`accessibilityLabel`:** This is generally the most reliable option, as it's tied to the application's accessibility features.
    *   **`id`:** Use IDs if they are unique and stable across application updates.
    *   **`text`:** Use text content if it's unique and unlikely to change.
    *   **`traits`:** (iOS-specific) Use UI element traits for selection.
    *   **`index`:** Use as last resort.
2.  **Avoid Fragile Selectors:** Minimize or avoid:
    *   Complex CSS selectors that depend on the exact DOM structure.
    *   XPath expressions, especially absolute paths.
3. **Use `optional: true` strategically:** When using `assertVisible` or `tapOn` with selectors that might not always be present (e.g., in different environments or application states), use `optional: true` to prevent the test from failing unnecessarily. Log a warning or use conditional logic instead.
4. **Use `evalScript` for dynamic checks:** If you need to perform more complex checks on UI elements (e.g., verifying computed styles or dynamic attributes), use `evalScript` to execute JavaScript code within the browser context.
