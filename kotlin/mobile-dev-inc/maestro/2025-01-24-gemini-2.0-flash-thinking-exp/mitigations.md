# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mobile-dev-inc/maestro

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Environment Variables for Sensitive Data](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_environment_variables_for_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all sensitive data used directly within Maestro scripts (API keys, passwords, tokens, etc. that are *used in Maestro commands or script logic*).
    2.  Replace hardcoded sensitive values in Maestro scripts with placeholders (e.g., `${API_KEY}`).
    3.  Define these placeholders as environment variables in the environment where Maestro tests are executed (e.g., CI/CD pipeline, local machine running `maestro cloud`).
    4.  Ensure Maestro execution environment is configured to pass these environment variables to the scripts. Maestro CLI and Cloud typically support environment variable substitution.
    5.  Verify that environment variables are securely managed in the execution environment and not inadvertently exposed in Maestro command outputs or publicly accessible configurations.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Hardcoded Credentials Exposure (High Severity):** Accidental exposure of sensitive credentials directly within Maestro scripts, potentially committed to version control or shared insecurely.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data (Medium Severity):** Increased risk of unauthorized access if credentials are easily discoverable within Maestro script files.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Hardcoded Credentials Exposure:** Significant risk reduction. Prevents credentials from being directly embedded in Maestro script code.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data:** Moderate risk reduction. Shifts credential management to a more secure environment outside of the script itself.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Environment variables are used for API base URLs in CI/CD pipeline for environment differentiation within Maestro scripts.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Not fully implemented for all sensitive credentials like API keys and service account tokens that might be directly used within Maestro scripts for actions like API calls or custom commands. These are still sometimes hardcoded in local development scripts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Secrets Management System Integration for Maestro Scripts](./mitigation_strategies/implement_secrets_management_system_integration_for_maestro_scripts.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Choose a suitable secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) that can be accessed from the environment where Maestro tests run.
    2.  Store all sensitive data required for Maestro tests within the secrets management system.
    3.  Develop a mechanism within your test setup (e.g., using Maestro's `setupScript` or custom commands) to authenticate to the secrets management system and retrieve secrets. This might involve using API calls or SDKs provided by the secrets management system *within the Maestro test execution context*.
    4.  Replace direct usage of sensitive data in Maestro scripts with calls to retrieve secrets from the secrets management system.
    5.  Ensure proper error handling in Maestro scripts if secret retrieval fails.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Hardcoded Credentials Exposure (High Severity):** Eliminates hardcoding of secrets directly in Maestro scripts by centralizing secret retrieval.
        *   **Secret Sprawl and Management Overhead (Medium Severity):** Simplifies secret management for Maestro tests by providing a centralized and controlled system.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data (High Severity):** Reduces risk by enforcing access control and auditing secret access through the secrets management system, applied to secrets used by Maestro.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Hardcoded Credentials Exposure:** Significant risk reduction. Eliminates the root cause of hardcoded secrets in Maestro scripts.
        *   **Secret Sprawl and Management Overhead:** Significant risk reduction. Streamlines secret management for Maestro testing and improves security posture.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data:** High risk reduction. Provides strong access control and auditability for secrets used by Maestro.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Secrets are currently managed through environment variables and configuration files, which are less secure and harder to manage at scale for Maestro specific secrets.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Completely missing. No secrets management system is currently integrated with Maestro testing processes to manage secrets used directly within Maestro scripts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Redact Sensitive Data in Maestro Logs and Reports](./mitigation_strategies/redact_sensitive_data_in_maestro_logs_and_reports.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify sensitive data that might be logged by Maestro during test execution (e.g., API request/response bodies if logged by custom commands, user inputs if echoed in logs).
    2.  Implement mechanisms to automatically redact or mask this sensitive data *specifically in Maestro logs and reports*. This could involve:
        *   Developing custom scripts to process Maestro log files after test execution and replace sensitive patterns with placeholders (e.g., `****`).
        *   If Maestro provides logging configuration options, utilize them to control the level of detail and exclude logging of sensitive information.
        *   Implementing post-processing steps in the CI/CD pipeline to sanitize Maestro logs before archiving or sharing.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Sensitive Data Leakage in Maestro Logs (Medium Severity):** Accidental exposure of sensitive data in Maestro logs and reports, potentially accessible to unauthorized personnel reviewing test results.
        *   **Compliance Violations (Medium Severity):** Failure to protect sensitive data in Maestro logs can lead to compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) if logs are not properly handled.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Sensitive Data Leakage in Maestro Logs:** Moderate risk reduction. Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data through Maestro specific logs.
        *   **Compliance Violations:** Moderate risk reduction. Helps in meeting data protection compliance requirements related to Maestro test outputs.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic logging levels are configured to reduce verbosity in general, but no specific redaction of sensitive data within Maestro logs is in place.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Missing automated redaction or masking of sensitive data in Maestro logs and reports. This needs to be implemented as a post-processing step or through custom logging configurations if Maestro allows for fine-grained control.
