## Focused Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Objective:** Attacker's Goal: To compromise application that use given project by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the project itself.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

*   **CRITICAL NODE**: Compromise Application Using Moshi
    *   **CRITICAL NODE**: Exploit Moshi Weaknesses
        *   **CRITICAL NODE**: Malformed JSON Input
            *   **High-Risk Path**: Denial of Service (DoS) - Application Crash
            *   **High-Risk Path**: Denial of Service (Application Crash) via Recursive Structures
        *   **High-Risk Path**: Security Vulnerabilities due to unexpected behavior (via Unexpected Data Types)
        *   **High-Risk Path**: Bypass Validation Logic (via Type Mismatches)
        *   **CRITICAL NODE**: Injection Attacks via JSON
            *   **High-Risk Path**: SQL Injection
        *   **High-Risk Path**: Code Execution (via Exploiting Custom Adapters)
        *   **CRITICAL NODE**: Deserialization Vulnerabilities
            *   **CRITICAL NODE**: Gadget Chains
                *   **CRITICAL NODE**: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
        *   **High-Risk Path**: Potential for Gadget Chain exploitation (via Incorrect Configuration of Moshi)
        *   **High-Risk Path**: Bypassing security checks or business logic (via Relying on Default Values)

**Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **CRITICAL NODE: Compromise Application Using Moshi:** This represents the attacker's ultimate objective. Success here means the attacker has achieved a significant breach of the application's security.

*   **CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Moshi Weaknesses:** This is the attacker's primary strategy, focusing on vulnerabilities introduced by or related to the Moshi library.

*   **CRITICAL NODE: Malformed JSON Input:** This is a critical entry point for attackers. Sending syntactically incorrect JSON can trigger parsing errors and exceptions, leading to:
    *   **High-Risk Path: Denial of Service (DoS) - Application Crash:**  Repeatedly sending malformed JSON can cause the application to crash, disrupting service availability.
    *   **High-Risk Path: Denial of Service (Application Crash) via Recursive Structures:**  Crafting deeply nested JSON structures can lead to stack overflow errors during parsing, resulting in application crashes and DoS.

*   **High-Risk Path: Security Vulnerabilities due to unexpected behavior (via Unexpected Data Types):**  Providing JSON values with types different from what the application expects can lead to type confusion. This can cause the application to behave in unexpected ways, potentially bypassing security checks or exposing vulnerabilities.

*   **High-Risk Path: Bypass Validation Logic (via Type Mismatches):** If the structure of the incoming JSON doesn't perfectly match the expected data model, Moshi might assign default values or skip validation steps. Attackers can exploit this to introduce malicious data by omitting fields or providing unexpected structures.

*   **CRITICAL NODE: Injection Attacks via JSON:** If the application uses deserialized data in a way that allows for interpretation as code or commands, injection attacks are possible.
    *   **High-Risk Path: SQL Injection:** If deserialized data is used to construct database queries without proper sanitization or parameterized queries, attackers can inject malicious SQL code to manipulate or extract data from the database.

*   **High-Risk Path: Code Execution (via Exploiting Custom Adapters):** If the application uses custom Moshi adapters, vulnerabilities in the logic of these adapters can be exploited. A flawed adapter might allow attackers to manipulate data in a way that leads to code execution or other malicious actions.

*   **CRITICAL NODE: Deserialization Vulnerabilities:** This is a critical category of vulnerabilities arising from the process of converting JSON data into Java/Kotlin objects.
    *   **CRITICAL NODE: Gadget Chains:** If the application uses reflection-based deserialization (which Moshi does) and has vulnerable dependencies on the classpath, attackers can craft malicious JSON payloads that trigger the execution of arbitrary code through a chain of method calls (gadget chain).
        *   **CRITICAL NODE: Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Successful exploitation of gadget chains leads to remote code execution, granting the attacker full control over the server.

*   **High-Risk Path: Potential for Gadget Chain exploitation (via Incorrect Configuration of Moshi):**  If the application is incorrectly configured to allow deserialization of unexpected or overly broad types, it increases the potential for attackers to leverage gadget chains present in the application's dependencies.

*   **High-Risk Path: Bypassing security checks or business logic (via Relying on Default Values):** If the application relies on default values assigned by Moshi when fields are missing in the JSON, without further validation, attackers can bypass security checks or business logic by omitting certain fields in their malicious payloads.
