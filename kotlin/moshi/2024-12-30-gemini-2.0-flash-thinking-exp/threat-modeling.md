### High and Critical Moshi Threats

Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve the Moshi library:

* **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Custom Adapters Leading to Security Issues
    * **Description:** If developers create custom `JsonAdapter` implementations, vulnerabilities within these adapters (e.g., improper handling of input, insecure interactions with external systems) could introduce security risks. An attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities by crafting malicious JSON that triggers the flawed logic in the custom adapter.
    * **Impact:** Potential for various security issues depending on the vulnerability in the custom adapter, including code execution, information disclosure, or data manipulation.
    * **Affected Moshi Component:** Custom `JsonAdapter` implementations.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly review and audit all custom `JsonAdapter` implementations for potential vulnerabilities.
        * Follow secure coding practices when developing custom adapters, including proper input validation and sanitization.
        * Avoid performing sensitive operations or interacting with external systems directly within custom adapters without careful consideration of security implications.
        * Implement unit tests for custom adapters to ensure they handle various input scenarios correctly and securely.

* **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Moshi Library Itself
    * **Description:** Like any software library, Moshi itself could contain security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker. An attacker could leverage these vulnerabilities by providing specific input or interacting with the library in a way that triggers the flaw.
    * **Impact:** Potential for various security issues depending on the nature of the vulnerability within the Moshi library. This could range from denial of service to remote code execution, depending on the severity and nature of the flaw.
    * **Affected Moshi Component:** Any part of the Moshi library.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Stay updated with the latest versions of the Moshi library to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        * Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues with Moshi.
        * Consider using dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies, including Moshi.
