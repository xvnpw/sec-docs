## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Shizuku Server Vulnerabilities [**HR**]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_shizuku_server_vulnerabilities__hr_.md)

*   **Critical Node: Vulnerabilities in Shizuku Server Code [**CR**]**
    *   **High-Risk Path: Memory Corruption (Buffer Overflow, Heap Overflow) [**HR**]**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Fuzzing Shizuku server with malformed inputs to trigger memory errors.
            *   Reverse engineering Shizuku server code to identify potential buffer overflow or heap overflow vulnerabilities.
            *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Shizuku server.
        *   **Potential Impact:** System-level code execution, complete device compromise, control over all applications using Shizuku.
    *   **High-Risk Path: Injection Vulnerabilities (Command Injection, Path Traversal) [**HR**]**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Injecting malicious commands through input fields processed by Shizuku server.
            *   Exploiting path traversal vulnerabilities to access or modify unauthorized files on the system.
            *   Manipulating input parameters to bypass security checks and execute arbitrary code.
        *   **Potential Impact:** System-level command execution, unauthorized file access, privilege escalation.

*   **Critical Node: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack during Shizuku Setup/Communication [**CR**]**
    *   **High-Risk Path: MitM during ADB Setup (if ADB method used) [**HR**]**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Network sniffing on the same network as the device during ADB setup.
            *   ARP poisoning or DNS spoofing to redirect traffic during ADB setup.
            *   Exploiting insecure or unencrypted ADB connections to intercept communication.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Compromise Shizuku server setup process, inject malicious Shizuku server, gain control over Shizuku server and applications using it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application's Shizuku Integration [**HR**]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application's_shizuku_integration__hr_.md)

*   **Critical Node: Insecure Use of Shizuku APIs by Application [**CR**]**
    *   **High-Risk Path: Improper Input Validation before Shizuku API Calls [**HR**]**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Providing malicious input to the application that is then passed to Shizuku APIs without proper validation.
            *   Exploiting format string vulnerabilities if input is used in format strings for Shizuku API calls.
            *   Bypassing client-side validation and directly sending malicious requests to the application that are then processed by Shizuku.
        *   **Potential Impact:**  Execution of privileged operations with attacker-controlled parameters, data manipulation, unauthorized access to system resources, application compromise.
    *   **High-Risk Path: Over-Privileged Shizuku Permissions Requested by Application [**HR**]**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Compromising the application through other vulnerabilities (not directly Shizuku related).
            *   Leveraging the excessively granted Shizuku permissions to perform actions beyond the application's intended scope.
            *   Confused deputy attacks where a malicious co-installed application exploits the target application's broad Shizuku permissions.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Increased attack surface, greater potential damage if the application is compromised, broader access to system functionalities than necessary.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering Attacks Related to Shizuku [**HR**]](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_attacks_related_to_shizuku__hr_.md)

*   **Critical Node: Tricking User into Granting Excessive Shizuku Permissions [**CR**]**
    *   **High-Risk Path: Tricking User into Granting Excessive Shizuku Permissions [**HR**]**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Misleading users about the necessity of broad Shizuku permissions through deceptive UI or descriptions.
            *   Bundling permission requests with seemingly legitimate actions to trick users into granting them without careful consideration.
            *   Exploiting user fatigue or lack of technical understanding to encourage granting permissions quickly.
        *   **Potential Impact:** User grants more permissions than needed, increasing the application's attack surface and potential for misuse if compromised.

*   **Critical Node: Malicious Shizuku Server Installation/Modification [**CR**]**
    *   **High-Risk Path: Malicious Shizuku Server Installation/Modification [**HR**]**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Distributing modified Shizuku server APKs through unofficial channels or websites.
            *   Tricking users into installing a malicious Shizuku server disguised as the official version.
            *   Compromising official distribution channels to replace the legitimate Shizuku server with a malicious one.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Installation of a backdoored or malicious Shizuku server, allowing attacker to control all applications using Shizuku, system-wide compromise.
