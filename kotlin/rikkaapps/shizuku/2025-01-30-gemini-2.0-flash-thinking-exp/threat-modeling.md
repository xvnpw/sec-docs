# Threat Model Analysis for rikkaapps/shizuku

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Application Vulnerability](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_application_vulnerability.md)

Description: An attacker exploits a vulnerability (e.g., injection, buffer overflow) in the application code that interacts with Shizuku. By sending crafted input or triggering specific application states, the attacker can execute arbitrary code with the elevated privileges granted by Shizuku. This could involve using Shizuku APIs in unintended ways due to application flaws.

Impact: Complete compromise of the device. Attacker gains system-level control, allowing them to steal data, install malware, modify system settings, and perform any action a root user could.

Shizuku Component Affected: Application's Shizuku integration code, Shizuku client library, Shizuku server (indirectly).

Risk Severity: Critical

Mitigation Strategies:
* Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization throughout the application, especially for data used in Shizuku API calls.
* Employ secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, injection flaws, and logic errors.
* Conduct thorough static and dynamic security testing, including penetration testing, focusing on Shizuku integration points.
* Apply the principle of least privilege: request and use only the necessary Shizuku permissions.
* Regularly update application dependencies and libraries to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Malicious Application Leveraging Shizuku](./threats/malicious_application_leveraging_shizuku.md)

Description: An attacker develops a seemingly legitimate application that secretly contains malicious code. Once installed and granted Shizuku permissions by the user, the malicious application uses Shizuku's elevated privileges to perform harmful actions in the background without the user's explicit consent or knowledge. This could involve data exfiltration, ransomware, or device bricking.

Impact: Severe compromise of user privacy and device security. Potential financial loss, data theft, identity theft, and device inoperability.

Shizuku Component Affected: Application's Shizuku integration code, Shizuku client library, Shizuku server (as a conduit).

Risk Severity: Critical

Mitigation Strategies:
* Users should only install applications from trusted sources like official app stores and verified developers.
* Users should carefully review requested permissions before granting them, especially Shizuku permissions.
* Implement code integrity checks and consider code obfuscation (though not a strong security measure on its own) to deter reverse engineering and tampering.
* Application developers should clearly communicate the purpose of Shizuku usage and the requested permissions to users.
* Implement runtime permission checks and user consent flows for sensitive actions performed via Shizuku, even after initial setup.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Shizuku Service Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_shizuku_service_itself.md)

Description: A security vulnerability exists within the Shizuku service application code. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability, potentially through local or remote means (though local exploitation is more probable), to gain control of the Shizuku service and escalate privileges on the device. This could involve sending crafted intents or exploiting weaknesses in Shizuku's permission handling or IPC mechanisms.

Impact: System-wide compromise. Attacker could potentially bypass security restrictions, gain root-level access, and control the device.

Shizuku Component Affected: Shizuku server application, Shizuku client library (if vulnerability is in IPC), Shizuku daemon (potentially).

Risk Severity: High

Mitigation Strategies:
* Stay updated with the latest Shizuku releases and security patches provided by the Shizuku developers.
* Monitor the Shizuku project's security advisories and vulnerability reports.
* As an application developer, limit dependency on specific Shizuku versions and ensure compatibility with newer versions to facilitate timely updates.
* Users should keep their Shizuku application updated to the latest version from trusted sources (e.g., official repositories).
