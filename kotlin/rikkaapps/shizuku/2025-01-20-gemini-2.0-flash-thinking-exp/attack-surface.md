# Attack Surface Analysis for rikkaapps/shizuku

## Attack Surface: [Execution of arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.](./attack_surfaces/execution_of_arbitrary_commands_with_elevated_privileges.md)

* **Description:** Execution of arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.
    * **How Shizuku Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Shizuku's core functionality is to allow applications to execute commands with permissions beyond their normal sandbox, effectively granting them root-like capabilities for specific actions. This direct elevation of privileges is the enabler for this attack surface.
    * **Example:** A seemingly harmless application using Shizuku to manage system settings could be compromised. An attacker could then inject malicious commands *through Shizuku*, leading to the deletion of critical system files.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the device, data loss, denial of service, installation of malware, privacy violation.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all commands executed *through Shizuku*.
            * Adhere to the principle of least privilege, only requesting necessary permissions *via Shizuku*.
            * Regularly audit the code for potential command injection vulnerabilities in code that interacts with Shizuku.
            * Implement robust error handling to prevent unexpected command execution *through Shizuku*.
        * **Users:**
            * Only grant Shizuku access to applications from trusted sources.
            * Be cautious about applications requesting Shizuku access, especially if their functionality doesn't clearly require the elevated privileges Shizuku provides.
            * Monitor the behavior of applications with Shizuku access for any suspicious activity involving privileged operations.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of vulnerabilities within the Shizuku service itself.](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_within_the_shizuku_service_itself.md)

* **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities within the Shizuku service itself.
    * **How Shizuku Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The Shizuku service acts as a bridge for privileged operations. Vulnerabilities *within this service* could allow attackers to bypass application-level security and directly execute commands with elevated privileges, regardless of the requesting application's intent.
    * **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Shizuku service could be exploited by a malicious application (or even a carefully crafted intent) to gain control of the service and execute arbitrary code *with Shizuku's elevated privileges*.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the device, bypassing application permissions, potential for persistent malware installation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Stay updated with the latest Shizuku releases and apply security patches promptly.
            * Report any discovered vulnerabilities in Shizuku to the developers.
        * **Users:**
            * Ensure the Shizuku application itself is updated to the latest version.
            * Be aware that the security of applications relying on Shizuku is fundamentally dependent on the security of the Shizuku service.
