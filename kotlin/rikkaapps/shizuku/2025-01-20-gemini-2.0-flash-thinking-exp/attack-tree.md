## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Shizuku App](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_shizuku_app.md)

This focuses on finding and exploiting software bugs within the Shizuku application itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Inter-Process Communication (IPC)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_inter-process_communication__ipc_.md)

Shizuku communicates with other apps via IPC. Vulnerabilities here could allow malicious apps to send crafted messages to Shizuku, triggering unintended actions or exploiting weaknesses in how Shizuku handles data.
    *   **Send Malicious Intents/Messages to Shizuku Service:** Inject crafted intents with malicious payloads targeting Shizuku's exposed functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Shizuku](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_memory_corruption_vulnerabilities_in_shizuku.md)

Like any software, Shizuku could have vulnerabilities like buffer overflows that allow an attacker to overwrite memory and potentially gain control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws in Shizuku](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_flaws_in_shizuku.md)

Shizuku needs to ensure only authorized apps can access its privileged functionalities. Flaws in this system could allow unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Shizuku's Granted Permissions](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_shizuku's_granted_permissions.md)

Shizuku requires significant permissions to function. An attacker could leverage these permissions to harm the target application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Shizuku's System-Level Permissions](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_shizuku's_system-level_permissions.md)

Permissions like `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` are powerful and could be abused to weaken system security, making the target application more vulnerable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Indirectly Abuse Permissions via Shizuku's Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/indirectly_abuse_permissions_via_shizuku's_functionality.md)

The target application might rely on Shizuku to perform actions it couldn't do itself. An attacker could manipulate the target app to request malicious actions through Shizuku.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Communication between Target App and Shizuku Service](./attack_tree_paths/modify_communication_between_target_app_and_shizuku_service.md)

If the communication between the target application and Shizuku can be intercepted and modified, an attacker could inject malicious commands.
    *   **Inject Malicious Commands/Data:** Alter requests sent to Shizuku to manipulate its behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering Targeting Shizuku](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_targeting_shizuku.md)

Attackers might try to trick users into performing actions that compromise the target application via Shizuku.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trick User into Performing Actions that Compromise the Target Application via Shizuku](./attack_tree_paths/trick_user_into_performing_actions_that_compromise_the_target_application_via_shizuku.md)

*   **Install a Malicious App that Exploits Shizuku:** A seemingly legitimate app could be designed to interact maliciously with Shizuku and the target application.
