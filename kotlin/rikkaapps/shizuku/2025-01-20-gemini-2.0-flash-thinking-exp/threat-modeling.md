# Threat Model Analysis for rikkaapps/shizuku

## Threat: [Malicious ADB Connection](./threats/malicious_adb_connection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with ADB access to the user's device could connect and initiate the Shizuku service. They could then grant Shizuku permissions to a malicious application they control, bypassing the intended user authorization flow within the legitimate application.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application's data and functionality. Potential for wider device compromise depending on the permissions granted to the malicious application through Shizuku.
    *   **Affected Shizuku Component:** Shizuku's initialization process, specifically the ADB verification mechanism (if any) and the permission granting flow.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Unauthorized Shizuku Activation (Compromised Device)](./threats/unauthorized_shizuku_activation__compromised_device_.md)

*   **Description:** If the user's device is already compromised (e.g., through malware), an attacker could activate the Shizuku service without user interaction and grant permissions to malicious applications, leveraging Shizuku's capabilities for malicious purposes.
    *   **Impact:**  Malicious applications gain elevated privileges, leading to data theft, modification, or device control. The impact is similar to a legitimate application having excessive permissions.
    *   **Affected Shizuku Component:** Shizuku's service activation mechanism and permission management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Persistent Unauthorized Shizuku Connections](./threats/persistent_unauthorized_shizuku_connections.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could establish a Shizuku connection that persists even after the legitimate application is closed or uninstalled. This allows the attacker's malicious application to continue using the granted permissions in the background.
    *   **Impact:** Continued unauthorized access to privileged APIs and potential background data exfiltration or malicious actions even when the user believes the application is no longer active.
    *   **Affected Shizuku Component:** Shizuku's connection management and persistence mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Exploiting Binder Vulnerabilities in IPC](./threats/exploiting_binder_vulnerabilities_in_ipc.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the Android Binder IPC mechanism to intercept, modify, or inject malicious commands into the communication between the application and the Shizuku service.
    *   **Impact:**  The attacker could potentially force Shizuku to perform actions it shouldn't, bypass permission checks, or gain access to sensitive data exchanged between the application and Shizuku.
    *   **Affected Shizuku Component:** The Binder interface used for communication between the application and the Shizuku service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Data Injection/Manipulation via IPC](./threats/data_injectionmanipulation_via_ipc.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious data or manipulate commands sent through the Binder interface to the Shizuku service, potentially causing it to perform unintended actions with elevated privileges.
    *   **Impact:**  Unintended system modifications, data corruption, or privilege escalation for the attacker's application.
    *   **Affected Shizuku Component:** The Binder interface and the Shizuku service's command processing logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via IPC](./threats/information_disclosure_via_ipc.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information exchanged between the application and the Shizuku service could be intercepted by a malicious application with sufficient privileges or by exploiting IPC vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Leakage of sensitive user data, application secrets, or system information.
    *   **Affected Shizuku Component:** The Binder interface and the data handling within the application and the Shizuku service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Shizuku Service](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_shizuku_service.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities within the Shizuku service itself could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to its functionality or the device's resources. This is a risk inherent in any software component.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the Shizuku service, potentially allowing attackers to control applications relying on it or gain broader system access.
    *   **Affected Shizuku Component:**  Various modules and functions within the Shizuku service implementation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Replacing the Shizuku Service](./threats/replacing_the_shizuku_service.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with root privileges could replace the legitimate Shizuku service with a malicious one. This malicious service could then intercept requests from applications and perform actions as if it were the legitimate Shizuku.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over applications relying on Shizuku, allowing for data manipulation, theft, and other malicious activities.
    *   **Affected Shizuku Component:** The entire Shizuku service application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation through Application Vulnerabilities](./threats/privilege_escalation_through_application_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Existing vulnerabilities in the client application (e.g., command injection) could be significantly amplified by the elevated privileges granted through Shizuku, allowing an attacker to perform actions they wouldn't normally be able to.
    *   **Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the application, but Shizuku's permissions can allow for more severe consequences, such as system-level changes or access to sensitive data beyond the application's scope.
    *   **Affected Shizuku Component:**  The application's code that interacts with Shizuku and the specific Shizuku APIs being used.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration with Elevated Permissions](./threats/data_exfiltration_with_elevated_permissions.md)

*   **Description:** If the application has vulnerabilities that allow for data access, Shizuku's permissions could enable the exfiltration of more sensitive data than would be possible without it (e.g., accessing system logs or data from other applications).
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access and theft of sensitive user data or system information.
    *   **Affected Shizuku Component:** The application's data access logic and the Shizuku APIs used for accessing data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Unintended System Modifications](./threats/unintended_system_modifications.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the application's logic when interacting with Shizuku could lead to unintended and potentially harmful modifications to the system due to the elevated privileges granted.
    *   **Impact:**  System instability, data corruption, or unexpected behavior of the device.
    *   **Affected Shizuku Component:** The application's code interacting with Shizuku and the specific Shizuku APIs used for system modifications.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data through Shizuku APIs](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_through_shizuku_apis.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses Shizuku to access sensitive system information, vulnerabilities could lead to unauthorized disclosure of this data.
    *   **Impact:** Leakage of sensitive system information that could be used for further attacks or to compromise user privacy.
    *   **Affected Shizuku Component:** The specific Shizuku APIs used to access sensitive information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Data Tampering via Shizuku](./threats/data_tampering_via_shizuku.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could potentially use Shizuku's capabilities to tamper with sensitive data managed by other applications or the system itself.
    *   **Impact:**  Corruption of data belonging to other applications or the system, leading to malfunction or security breaches.
    *   **Affected Shizuku Component:** The Shizuku APIs that allow for data modification.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
