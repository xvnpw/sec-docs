# Threat Model Analysis for rikkaapps/shizuku

## Threat: [Malicious ADB Access Exploitation](./threats/malicious_adb_access_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious ADB Access Exploitation
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the device via ADB and uses ADB commands to initiate the Shizuku service. They can then use ADB to instruct the Shizuku service to grant the integrating application elevated permissions without explicit user consent within the application's UI.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete compromise of the application's data and functionality.
        *   Potential for system-level manipulation depending on the permissions granted via Shizuku.
    *   **Affected Shizuku Component:**
        *   Shizuku Service initialization and permission handling logic.
        *   Interaction with the Android Debug Bridge (ADB).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **For Developers:** Implement checks to verify the integrity of the ADB connection if activation through ADB is supported. Consider alternative activation methods that rely less on ADB after initial setup.
        *   **For Users:** Only enable ADB debugging when necessary and disable it immediately afterward. Be cautious about connecting your device to untrusted computers.

## Threat: [Local Privilege Escalation via Shizuku Service](./threats/local_privilege_escalation_via_shizuku_service.md)

*   **Threat:** Local Privilege Escalation via Shizuku Service
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** A malicious application running on the same device attempts to communicate with the Shizuku service (which has elevated privileges granted by the user to the integrating application) and exploit vulnerabilities in the Shizuku service or the integrating application's interaction with it. This could involve sending crafted commands or exploiting insecure API endpoints.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized access to the integrating application's functionality and data.
        *   Potential for further system-level compromise depending on the permissions held by the integrating application via Shizuku.
    *   **Affected Shizuku Component:**
        *   Shizuku Service's API endpoints and command processing logic.
        *   Inter-process communication mechanisms used by Shizuku.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **For Developers:** Implement robust input validation and authorization checks on all interactions with the Shizuku API. Follow the principle of least privilege when requesting permissions through Shizuku. Ensure secure IPC mechanisms are used and properly configured.
        *   **For Users:** Be cautious about installing applications from untrusted sources.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the Integrating Application's Shizuku API Usage](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the_integrating_application's_shizuku_api_usage.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in the Integrating Application's Shizuku API Usage
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits errors or oversights in how the integrating application uses the Shizuku API. This could involve injecting malicious commands, exploiting improper handling of responses, or bypassing security checks in the application's Shizuku interaction code.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Potential for privilege escalation within the integrating application.
        *   Data manipulation or unauthorized access to Shizuku-controlled functionalities.
    *   **Affected Shizuku Component:**
        *   The integrating application's code that interacts with the Shizuku API.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **For Developers:** Thoroughly test and review the code that interacts with the Shizuku API. Implement proper input validation, error handling, and secure coding practices. Follow the Shizuku API documentation carefully.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the Shizuku Library](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the_shizuku_library.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in the Shizuku Library
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** Exploiting security vulnerabilities directly within the Shizuku library code. This could involve remote code execution, privilege escalation within the Shizuku service itself, or other forms of compromise.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to privilege escalation, information disclosure, or denial of service affecting applications using Shizuku.
    *   **Affected Shizuku Component:**
        *   Any part of the Shizuku library code containing the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **For Developers:** Stay updated with the latest Shizuku library releases and security advisories. Monitor the Shizuku project for reported vulnerabilities and apply updates promptly.
        *   **For Users:** Keep the Shizuku Manager application updated to benefit from any security patches in the underlying library.
