## Mitigation Strategy: [Clearly Document Shizuku's Role and Security Implications *Specific to Shizuku*](./mitigation_strategies/clearly_document_shizuku's_role_and_security_implications_specific_to_shizuku.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Create a dedicated section in your application's documentation explaining what Shizuku is *as a system component enabling elevated privileges*.
    2.  Explain *specifically why* your application uses Shizuku and what features *require Shizuku's capabilities*.
    3.  Clearly state that Shizuku *itself* requires either ADB debugging to be enabled or root access to function, and that your application relies on this Shizuku functionality.
    4.  Detail the security risks *directly related to enabling ADB debugging or using root in conjunction with Shizuku* (e.g., broader ADB access if enabled, root access implications for Shizuku itself).
    5.  Advise users to download Shizuku Manager only from trusted sources *to ensure the integrity of the Shizuku component itself*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   User Misunderstanding of Shizuku's Privileged Nature (Medium Severity): Users might not understand that Shizuku grants elevated privileges and the implications for system security.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces user misunderstanding *specifically about Shizuku's role and the underlying system configurations it relies on*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Many applications mention Shizuku, but detailed security implications *specifically related to Shizuku's privileged access* are often missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Comprehensive security explanations within application documentation and in-app guidance *focused on Shizuku's privileged operations* are often lacking.

## Mitigation Strategy: [In-App Warnings and Guidance *About Shizuku Activation*](./mitigation_strategies/in-app_warnings_and_guidance_about_shizuku_activation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Display a prominent warning message within your application *specifically when the user is about to use a feature that relies on Shizuku's elevated permissions*.
    2.  Before prompting the user to enable Shizuku, show a dialog explaining the necessity of Shizuku *for the specific feature* and the associated security considerations *of using Shizuku*.
    3.  Provide step-by-step instructions within the app on how to securely enable ADB debugging *if that's the chosen method for Shizuku activation*, focusing on security best practices for ADB in the context of Shizuku.
    4.  Include a link to your application's documentation or a dedicated help section for more detailed information *specifically about Shizuku and its security implications for your application*.
