### Key Ktor Attack Surface List (High & Critical - Ktor Specific)

Here's an updated list of key attack surfaces that directly involve Ktor, focusing on those with High and Critical risk severity:

*   **Attack Surface: Deserialization of Untrusted Data**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker sends malicious serialized data to the application, which, when deserialized, can lead to arbitrary code execution or other harmful actions on the server.
    *   **How Ktor Contributes:** Ktor's content negotiation and serialization features make it easy to handle various data formats. If the application deserializes data from untrusted sources (e.g., request bodies) using Ktor's content negotiation without proper safeguards, it becomes vulnerable. The choice of serialization library configured within the Ktor application also plays a crucial role.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a JSON payload via a POST request. Ktor's content negotiation uses Jackson, and the payload contains a malicious object that, when deserialized, executes a system command.
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Potential for remote code execution, complete server compromise, data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources via Ktor's content negotiation whenever possible.
        *   If deserialization is necessary, use safe deserialization practices specific to the chosen library within the Ktor application.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization *before* Ktor's content negotiation attempts deserialization.
        *   Consider using data transfer objects (DTOs) to limit the scope of deserialization within Ktor route handlers.
        *   Keep serialization libraries configured within the Ktor application updated to the latest versions with security patches.

*   **Attack Surface: Header Injection**
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious content into HTTP headers, which can lead to various vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), session fixation, or cache poisoning.
    *   **How Ktor Contributes:** Ktor allows developers to programmatically set response headers using `call.response.headers`. If user-controlled input is directly used to set header values through this mechanism without proper encoding or validation, attackers can inject malicious content.
    *   **Example:** A Ktor application uses a user-provided value from a query parameter to set a custom header like `call.response.headers.append("X-Custom-Header", call.request.queryParameters["custom"])`. If the `custom` parameter contains `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, it could be exploited if not handled correctly by the client.
    *   **Impact:** High - Potential for XSS, session hijacking, cache poisoning, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid directly using user input to set HTTP headers via Ktor's `call.response.headers`.
        *   If necessary, strictly validate and sanitize user input before using it in headers set by Ktor.
        *   Utilize Ktor's built-in features or libraries for setting security-related headers (e.g., `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`) in a safe manner.
        *   Encode header values appropriately for the context before setting them using Ktor's API.

*   **Attack Surface: Insecure Route Definitions**
    *   **Description:**  Poorly defined or overly permissive routes can expose unintended endpoints or functionality, allowing unauthorized access or manipulation.
    *   **How Ktor Contributes:** Ktor's routing DSL provides flexibility in defining routes. Misconfigurations within the Ktor routing configuration, such as using overly broad wildcards or failing to implement proper authorization checks within Ktor route handlers, can create vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A route defined in Ktor as `get("/admin/{param...}") { ... }` might unintentionally expose internal administrative functionalities if the handler within this route does not perform adequate authorization checks.
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High - Potential for unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if sensitive functionality is exposed)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Define routes in Ktor with the least privilege principle in mind.
        *   Avoid overly broad wildcard routes in Ktor's routing configuration.
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization checks within Ktor route handlers for all sensitive endpoints.
        *   Regularly review and audit route definitions within the Ktor application.
