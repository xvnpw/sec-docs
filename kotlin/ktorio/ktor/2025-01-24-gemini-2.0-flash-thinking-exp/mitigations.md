## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Routing Configuration using Ktor Routing DSL](./mitigation_strategies/secure_routing_configuration_using_ktor_routing_dsl.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Ktor's Routing DSL effectively:**  Define routes using Ktor's routing features within `routing { ... }` blocks in your application modules. This allows for structured and manageable route definitions.
    2.  **Employ specific HTTP method handlers:** Instead of generic `route()` blocks, use specific handlers like `get()`, `post()`, `put()`, `delete()` within the routing DSL to explicitly declare allowed HTTP methods for each route. This is a core feature of Ktor routing.
    3.  **Implement parameter validation directly within route handlers:** Leverage Ktor's parameter extraction capabilities (e.g., `call.parameters`, `call.receive<>()`) and integrate validation logic within the route handler functions. You can use Kotlin validation libraries or manual checks within these handlers.
    4.  **Apply authorization checks within route handlers or using Ktor's `AuthorizationPlugin`:**  Use Ktor's `Authentication` feature to establish user identity and then implement authorization logic within route handlers to control access based on user roles or permissions. Consider using Ktor's `AuthorizationPlugin` for a more structured approach to authorization within the routing context.
    5.  **Structure routes to avoid exposing internal paths:** Design your routing structure within Ktor to logically separate public and private routes. Utilize nested routes or different modules to control access and prevent direct exposure of sensitive internal functionalities through the routing configuration.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Ktor routing helps limit methods, reducing this risk.
        *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Medium Severity):**  Routing structure contributes to CSRF defense by controlling endpoints.
        *   **HTTP Verb Tampering (Low Severity):** Ktor's method-specific handlers directly mitigate this.
        *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Ktor's routing combined with authorization logic is key to access control.
        *   **Path Traversal (Medium Severity):** Parameter validation within Ktor route handlers prevents this.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities:** Medium - Ktor routing provides tools to reduce this risk.
        *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Low - Contributes to a broader CSRF strategy within Ktor app.
        *   **HTTP Verb Tampering:** Low - Ktor routing effectively eliminates this.
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** High - Ktor routing is fundamental for implementing authorization.
        *   **Path Traversal:** Medium - Ktor route handlers are the place to implement validation.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Ktor Routing DSL is used, and some routes use specific method handlers. Parameter extraction is used, but validation within handlers is inconsistent. Basic role-based authorization is in place within some route handlers. Routing structure is somewhat organized but could be improved for clearer separation of concerns. Located in `src/main/kotlin/com/example/api/Routes.kt` and related files.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Systematically enforce specific method handlers across all routes. Implement comprehensive parameter validation within all relevant route handlers using Ktor's features or validation libraries integrated into handlers.  Refactor authorization logic to consistently use Ktor's `AuthorizationPlugin` or a similar structured approach within the routing context. Improve routing structure to better delineate public and private API sections within Ktor's routing configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Content Negotiation and Serialization using Ktor Content Negotiation Feature](./mitigation_strategies/secure_content_negotiation_and_serialization_using_ktor_content_negotiation_feature.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Ktor's ContentNegotiation feature:**  Register content negotiation serializers (e.g., Jackson, kotlinx.serialization) using Ktor's `ContentNegotiation` plugin in your application module. This is the Ktor-recommended way to handle content negotiation.
    2.  **Configure serializers within Ktor's ContentNegotiation:** Configure the chosen serialization libraries (like Jackson) directly within the `ContentNegotiation` plugin configuration block in your Ktor application. This ensures secure defaults and customizations are applied within the Ktor context.
    3.  **Validate deserialized data within route handlers after Ktor's content negotiation:** Even though Ktor handles deserialization, perform explicit validation of the received objects within your route handlers after they are deserialized by Ktor's content negotiation mechanism.
    4.  **Limit supported content types in Ktor's ContentNegotiation:**  Configure the `ContentNegotiation` plugin to only support necessary content types. This restricts the application's attack surface by limiting the parsers Ktor will use.
    5.  **Handle content negotiation exceptions gracefully using Ktor's exception handling:** Implement exception handling in Ktor to manage potential errors during content negotiation (e.g., invalid content type, deserialization failures). Use Ktor's exception handling features to provide appropriate error responses and logging.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (Remote Code Execution - High Severity):** Secure Ktor content negotiation setup is crucial.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Ktor's content negotiation can be targeted for DoS if not configured properly.
        *   **Information Disclosure (Low to Medium Severity):**  Improper Ktor content negotiation can lead to information leaks.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities:** High - Ktor ContentNegotiation is the primary point to secure serialization.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Medium - Ktor ContentNegotiation configuration impacts DoS resilience.
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Low to Medium - Ktor ContentNegotiation settings can affect information exposure.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Ktor's `ContentNegotiation` plugin is used in `src/main/kotlin/com/example/Application.kt` with Jackson registered as the serializer.  Basic configuration is present. Content types are generally limited to JSON. Exception handling for content negotiation might be generic application-wide exception handling but not specifically tailored to content negotiation failures within Ktor.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Explicitly configure secure serialization settings (like disabling default typing in Jackson) within Ktor's `ContentNegotiation` plugin configuration. Implement specific validation of deserialized objects *after* Ktor's content negotiation in route handlers.  Further restrict supported content types in Ktor's `ContentNegotiation` to only the absolutely necessary ones. Implement dedicated exception handling within Ktor for content negotiation failures to provide more informative and secure error responses. Refine configuration in `src/main/kotlin/com/example/config/KtorConfig.kt` or application module setup.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Authentication and Authorization using Ktor Authentication and Authorization Plugins](./mitigation_strategies/secure_authentication_and_authorization_using_ktor_authentication_and_authorization_plugins.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Leverage Ktor's `Authentication` plugin:**  Use Ktor's `Authentication` plugin to implement authentication mechanisms. Choose appropriate authentication providers supported by Ktor (e.g., JWT, OAuth, Basic Auth) and configure them within the `Authentication` plugin block.
    2.  **Utilize Ktor's `AuthorizationPlugin` (or custom authorization logic within Authentication):**  Implement authorization checks using Ktor's `AuthorizationPlugin` for a structured approach to access control. Define authorization policies and integrate them with the authentication context established by the `Authentication` plugin. Alternatively, implement custom authorization logic directly within authentication providers or route handlers, but `AuthorizationPlugin` is recommended for better organization in Ktor.
    3.  **Securely configure authentication providers within Ktor:**  When configuring authentication providers in Ktor (e.g., JWT), ensure secure key management, token generation, and validation practices are followed. Protect JWT secrets, use strong hashing for passwords if applicable, and configure token expiration appropriately within the Ktor authentication setup.
    4.  **Apply authentication and authorization requirements to specific routes using Ktor's DSL:**  Use Ktor's `authenticate { ... }` and `authorize { ... }` blocks within the routing DSL to enforce authentication and authorization requirements on specific routes or route groups. This is the Ktor-idiomatic way to secure routes.
    5.  **Handle authentication and authorization failures gracefully using Ktor's features:**  Implement error handling within Ktor's authentication and authorization setup to manage authentication failures (e.g., invalid credentials) and authorization failures (e.g., insufficient permissions). Use Ktor's exception handling or plugin features to provide appropriate error responses and logging for security events.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Ktor Authentication and Authorization are core to preventing this.
        *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Ktor's authorization mechanisms mitigate this.
        *   **Session Hijacking (High Severity):** Secure Ktor authentication setup reduces session hijacking.
        *   **Credential Theft (High Severity):** Secure authentication in Ktor protects credentials.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** High - Ktor plugins are designed to effectively prevent this.
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** High - Ktor authorization is key to mitigating this.
        *   **Session Hijacking:** High - Secure Ktor authentication is vital for session security.
        *   **Credential Theft:** High - Ktor authentication mechanisms are crucial for credential protection.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Ktor's `Authentication` plugin is used in `src/main/kotlin/com/example/security/Authentication.kt` with JWT authentication configured. Basic role-based authorization is implemented, sometimes directly within route handlers.  `AuthorizationPlugin` might not be fully utilized. JWT configuration is present, but key management and token security practices might need review. Authentication is applied to some routes using `authenticate { ... }` blocks.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Fully adopt Ktor's `AuthorizationPlugin` for a more structured authorization approach instead of scattered logic in handlers. Implement fine-grained permissions and policies within Ktor's authorization framework.  Review and harden JWT configuration within Ktor's `Authentication` plugin, focusing on secure key storage, rotation, and token settings.  Consistently apply authentication and authorization requirements to all relevant routes using Ktor's DSL. Implement dedicated error handling within Ktor's authentication and authorization setup for security-related events. Refactor security configuration in `src/main/kotlin/com/example/security` directory and application modules.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Plugin Management and Dependency Updates in Ktor Project](./mitigation_strategies/secure_plugin_management_and_dependency_updates_in_ktor_project.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regularly update Ktor framework and plugins:**  Keep the Ktor framework version and all Ktor plugins used in your project updated to the latest stable releases. Use dependency management tools (like Gradle or Maven) to manage Ktor dependencies and facilitate updates.
    2.  **Utilize Ktor's plugin management features:**  Manage Ktor plugins through your application's module configuration using `install(PluginName) { ... }`. This is the standard way to manage plugins in Ktor.
    3.  **Perform dependency scanning for Ktor project dependencies:**  Use dependency scanning tools (integrated into your build process or IDE) to identify known vulnerabilities in Ktor's dependencies and plugin dependencies. Regularly scan your project's dependencies defined in `build.gradle.kts` (or `pom.xml` for Maven).
    4.  **Carefully select and review Ktor plugins:**  When choosing Ktor plugins, prioritize plugins from trusted sources (official Ktor plugins or reputable community plugins). Review plugin documentation and, if possible, plugin code before integrating them into your application.
    5.  **Minimize the number of Ktor plugins:**  Only install and use Ktor plugins that are strictly necessary for your application's functionality. Reducing the number of plugins reduces the potential attack surface and simplifies dependency management within your Ktor project.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Ktor Framework or Plugins (High to Critical Severity):** Outdated Ktor versions or plugins can have known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities (High to Critical Severity):** Ktor and its plugins rely on dependencies that might have vulnerabilities.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Ktor Framework or Plugins:** High - Keeping Ktor updated is crucial for patching framework-level vulnerabilities.
        *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** High - Dependency scanning and updates are essential for overall security.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Ktor dependencies are managed using Gradle in `build.gradle.kts`.  Plugin versions are generally specified. Dependency updates are performed periodically, but might not be consistently frequent. Dependency scanning is not routinely performed as part of the CI/CD process. Plugin selection is generally based on functionality needs, but formal security review of plugins might be lacking.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Implement automated dependency scanning as part of the CI/CD pipeline to regularly check for vulnerabilities in Ktor dependencies and plugins. Establish a policy for promptly updating Ktor framework and plugins when security updates are released.  Implement a process for security review of Ktor plugins before adoption, especially for third-party plugins.  Regularly review the list of installed Ktor plugins and remove any that are no longer necessary to minimize the attack surface. Integrate dependency scanning into `build.gradle.kts` and CI/CD pipeline configuration.
