# Attack Surface Analysis for ktorio/ktor

## Attack Surface: [Route Parameter Injection](./attack_surfaces/route_parameter_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate route parameters to access unintended resources or trigger unexpected application behavior.
    *   **How Ktor Contributes:** Ktor's routing mechanism relies on developers defining routes with parameters. If these parameters are not properly validated and sanitized, they become injection points.
    *   **Example:** A route `/users/{id}` where `id` is directly used in a database query without validation. An attacker could send `/users/1 OR 1=1` to potentially retrieve all user data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, code execution (in extreme cases).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Ktor's parameter validation features to enforce expected data types and formats.
        *   Avoid directly embedding route parameters in sensitive operations like database queries. Use parameterized queries or ORM features.
        *   Implement input sanitization to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers can send malicious serialized objects to the application, which, upon deserialization, can lead to arbitrary code execution or other harmful actions.
    *   **How Ktor Contributes:** Ktor often uses serialization libraries (like Jackson or Gson) to handle data conversion. If not configured securely, these libraries can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** Sending a specially crafted JSON payload that, when deserialized by Jackson, instantiates a class with malicious side effects.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources if possible.
        *   Use secure serialization libraries and keep them updated.
        *   Implement object filtering or whitelisting during deserialization to restrict the types of objects that can be created.
        *   Consider using safer data exchange formats if deserialization vulnerabilities are a concern.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via HTTP Client](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_http_client.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can induce the application to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources.
    *   **How Ktor Contributes:** If the application uses Ktor's `HttpClient` to make requests based on user-provided input without proper validation, it can be exploited for SSRF.
    *   **Example:** An endpoint that takes a URL as a parameter and fetches its content using Ktor's `HttpClient`. An attacker could provide an internal IP address to scan internal services.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, data exfiltration, launching attacks from the server's IP address.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never directly use user-provided input as URLs for outgoing requests without thorough validation.
        *   Implement a whitelist of allowed destination hosts or IP addresses.
        *   Disable or restrict access to sensitive internal networks from the application server.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Authentication Providers](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_authentication_providers.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured authentication mechanisms can lead to bypasses or vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Ktor Contributes:** Ktor provides features for integrating various authentication providers (e.g., OAuth, JWT). Misconfiguration of these features can create security flaws.
    *   **Example:**  An OAuth configuration that doesn't properly validate the `redirect_uri`, allowing an attacker to redirect the user to a malicious site after authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Authentication bypass, unauthorized access, account takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review and test authentication provider configurations.
        *   Enforce strict validation of redirect URIs in OAuth flows.
        *   Use strong, randomly generated secrets for JWT signing.
        *   Keep authentication libraries updated.
