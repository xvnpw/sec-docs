## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities -> Path Traversal via Routing](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_routing_vulnerabilities_-_path_traversal_via_routing.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit flaws in custom routing logic or handlers to manipulate path segments within a request. This allows them to access files or directories outside the intended scope of the application.
    *   **Mechanism:** By crafting requests with specific path components (e.g., using ".."), attackers can navigate the file system on the server.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Access to sensitive configuration files, application source code, user data, or even the ability to execute arbitrary code if upload directories are accessible.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Content Negotiation Issues -> Insecure Deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_content_negotiation_issues_-_insecure_deserialization.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage vulnerabilities in the deserialization process used by Ktor or its plugins. By sending malicious data disguised as a legitimate data format, they can trigger the execution of arbitrary code or manipulate the application's state.
    *   **Mechanism:** This often involves exploiting flaws in libraries like Jackson or kotlinx.serialization, where specially crafted payloads can be deserialized into objects that execute malicious code upon creation.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the server, steal data, or disrupt services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit WebSocket Vulnerabilities -> Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_websocket_vulnerabilities_-_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers flood the server with a large number of WebSocket messages or open numerous connections simultaneously, overwhelming its resources.
    *   **Mechanism:** This is a form of denial-of-service attack that exploits the server's capacity to handle WebSocket connections and messages.
    *   **Potential Impact:**  Application unavailability, slow response times for legitimate users, and potential server crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit HTTP Client Misconfigurations -> Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Ktor Client](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_http_client_misconfigurations_-_server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_ktor_client.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate the application into making unintended HTTP requests to internal resources or external malicious servers using Ktor's HTTP client. This is possible when the application uses user-controlled input to construct URLs for outgoing requests.
    *   **Mechanism:** By providing malicious URLs, attackers can force the server to interact with internal services that are not exposed to the public internet or to make requests to attacker-controlled servers to exfiltrate data.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Access to internal services and data, port scanning of internal networks, exfiltration of sensitive information, and potentially further attacks on other systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Ktor Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ktor_weaknesses.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This represents the overarching goal of exploiting vulnerabilities specifically within the Ktor framework itself, rather than general web application vulnerabilities.
    *   **Mechanism:** This involves identifying and leveraging weaknesses in Ktor's core functionalities, such as routing, content negotiation, WebSocket handling, or its HTTP client.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to a wide range of compromises depending on the specific vulnerability, including unauthorized access, data manipulation, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_deserialization.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** As described in the High-Risk Path, this involves exploiting vulnerabilities in the deserialization process.
    *   **Mechanism:** Sending malicious serialized data to the application.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Primarily remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Ktor Client](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_ktor_client.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** As described in the High-Risk Path, this involves manipulating the application to make unintended HTTP requests.
    *   **Mechanism:** Providing malicious URLs to the application's HTTP client functionality.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Access to internal resources, data exfiltration, and further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Ktor Official Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_ktor_official_plugins.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting security flaws within official Ktor plugins. These plugins often handle critical functionalities like authentication, authorization, and session management.
    *   **Mechanism:**  The specific attack vector depends on the vulnerability within the plugin. It could involve sending crafted requests, manipulating specific parameters, or exploiting logical flaws.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Bypassing authentication or authorization, gaining access to sensitive data, or manipulating application state.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_plugins.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting security flaws within third-party Ktor plugins. The security of these plugins can vary significantly.
    *   **Mechanism:** Similar to official plugins, the attack vector depends on the specific vulnerability in the third-party plugin.
    *   **Potential Impact:**  The impact depends on the functionality of the vulnerable plugin, but it could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
