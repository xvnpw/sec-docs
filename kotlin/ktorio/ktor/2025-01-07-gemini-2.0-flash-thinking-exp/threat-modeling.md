# Threat Model Analysis for ktorio/ktor

## Threat: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data via Content Negotiation](./threats/deserialization_of_untrusted_data_via_content_negotiation.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a request with a `Content-Type` header that the Ktor application supports for deserialization (e.g., `application/json`, `application/xml`). If the application doesn't properly validate the incoming data before deserialization, a malicious payload could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) or other vulnerabilities, depending on the chosen serialization library.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, denial of service, or information disclosure.

**Affected Ktor Component:** `ktor-server-content-negotiation`, `ktor-serialization-*` modules (e.g., `ktor-serialization-kotlinx-json`)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources if possible.
* Implement strict input validation *before* deserialization.
* Use serialization libraries with known security best practices and keep them updated.
* Consider using safer serialization formats or libraries that are less prone to deserialization vulnerabilities.
* Implement Content-Type whitelisting and reject requests with unexpected or suspicious `Content-Type` headers.

## Threat: [Bypass of Authentication due to Misconfigured Authentication Providers](./threats/bypass_of_authentication_due_to_misconfigured_authentication_providers.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits misconfigurations in the Ktor authentication setup (e.g., incorrect JWT verification, weak secrets, permissive OAuth configurations) to bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the application, access to all user data and functionalities.

**Affected Ktor Component:** `ktor-server-auth` and specific authentication provider modules (e.g., `ktor-server-auth-jwt`, `ktor-server-auth-oauth`)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly review and understand the configuration options for each authentication provider.
* Use strong, randomly generated secrets for JWT signing and other cryptographic operations.
* Enforce HTTPS for all authentication-related communication.
* Validate JWT signatures correctly and verify all claims.
* Implement proper OAuth flow validation and ensure redirect URIs are correctly configured.
* Regularly audit authentication configurations.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Unbounded WebSocket Connections](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_unbounded_websocket_connections.md)

**Description:** An attacker establishes a large number of WebSocket connections to the server without sending data or properly closing the connections, consuming server resources (memory, CPU, file descriptors) and potentially leading to a denial of service.

**Impact:** Denial of service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.

**Affected Ktor Component:** `ktor-server-websockets`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement connection limits per client IP address or user.
* Set timeouts for idle WebSocket connections.
* Implement mechanisms to detect and close inactive or malicious connections.
* Monitor server resource usage and implement alerting for unusual activity.

## Threat: [Insecure Route Parameter Handling leading to Unauthorized Access](./threats/insecure_route_parameter_handling_leading_to_unauthorized_access.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates route parameters (e.g., IDs, filenames) in the URL to access resources they are not authorized to view or modify. This can happen if the application doesn't properly validate or sanitize route parameters before using them to retrieve data or perform actions.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of resources belonging to other users, or execution of unintended actions.

**Affected Ktor Component:** `ktor-server-core` (Routing DSL, `call.parameters`)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all route parameters.
* Use parameterized queries or ORM features to prevent direct parameter injection into database queries.
* Enforce authorization checks based on the resolved resource and the user's permissions.
* Avoid exposing internal IDs directly in URLs; consider using UUIDs or other non-sequential identifiers.
