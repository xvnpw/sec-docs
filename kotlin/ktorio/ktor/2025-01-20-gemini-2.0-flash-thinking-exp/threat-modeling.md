# Threat Model Analysis for ktorio/ktor

## Threat: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./threats/deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a crafted serialized object (e.g., JSON, XML) within a request body or other data stream. Ktor's content negotiation or a specific deserialization library automatically deserializes this object. The malicious object, upon deserialization, executes arbitrary code on the server, potentially gaining full control of the application and the underlying system.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete compromise of the server, data breach, denial of service.

**Affected Ktor Component:** `ktor-server-content-negotiation` module, specifically the configured serialization/deserialization libraries (e.g., Jackson, kotlinx.serialization).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources if possible.
* If deserialization is necessary, use allow-lists to restrict the classes that can be deserialized.
* Keep serialization libraries up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* Consider using safer data formats like Protocol Buffers or FlatBuffers, which are less prone to deserialization vulnerabilities.
* Implement input validation *before* deserialization to check for unexpected or malicious data structures.

## Threat: [Insecure Session Management](./threats/insecure_session_management.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts or guesses a valid session ID. This could be done through network sniffing (if HTTPS is not used or improperly configured), cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or brute-force attempts. With a valid session ID, the attacker can impersonate the legitimate user, gaining access to their data and performing actions on their behalf.

**Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to sensitive data, manipulation of user data, financial loss.

**Affected Ktor Component:** `ktor-server-sessions` module, specifically the session storage mechanism (e.g., cookies, server-side storage).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always use HTTPS to encrypt session cookies and prevent interception.
* Configure session cookies with the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags.
* Use strong and unpredictable session IDs.
* Implement session timeouts and automatic logout after inactivity.
* Consider using server-side session storage instead of relying solely on cookies.
* Implement mechanisms to detect and prevent session fixation attacks.
* Regularly rotate session IDs.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Ktor HTTP Client](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_ktor_http_client.md)

**Description:** An attacker controls or influences the destination URL used by the Ktor HTTP client to make outbound requests. This allows the attacker to make requests to internal resources or external services that should not be accessible, potentially exposing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the server.

**Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, potential for further attacks on internal infrastructure, abuse of external services.

**Affected Ktor Component:** `ktor-client-core` module, specifically the `HttpClient` and its request building mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid using user-provided input directly in outbound request URLs.
* Implement strict validation and sanitization of any user-provided input used to construct outbound requests.
* Use allow-lists to restrict the allowed destination hosts or URLs for outbound requests.
* Consider using a proxy server for outbound requests to add an extra layer of security and control.
* Disable or restrict access to sensitive internal resources from the application server.
