# Attack Surface Analysis for ktorio/ktor

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated Route Parameters leading to Injection](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_route_parameters_leading_to_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate URL parameters to inject malicious code or commands, leading to unintended actions on the server or data breaches.
    *   **How Ktor Contributes:** Ktor's routing mechanism allows defining routes with parameters that are directly accessible in handlers. If these parameters are used in sensitive operations without proper validation *within the Ktor handler logic*, it creates an injection point. Ktor's parameter extraction makes this data readily available.
    *   **Example:** A route `/users/{id}` where the `id` parameter, extracted by Ktor, is directly used in a SQL query within the Ktor route handler without sanitization.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, remote code execution (depending on the context of the injection).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation within Handlers:** Implement strict input validation on all route parameters *within the Ktor route handler* before using them in any operations.
        *   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:** When interacting with databases *from within Ktor handlers*, always use parameterized queries or prepared statements.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

*   **Description:**  Deserializing data from untrusted sources without proper validation can lead to remote code execution or other malicious activities.
    *   **How Ktor Contributes:** Ktor's content negotiation feature automatically deserializes request bodies based on the `Content-Type` header. This automatic deserialization, if not paired with validation, directly exposes the application to risks if untrusted data is received.
    *   **Example:** An application using Ktor's content negotiation to automatically deserialize JSON payloads. An attacker sends a crafted JSON payload containing malicious code that gets executed during the deserialization process by a vulnerable library configured within the Ktor application.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Schema Validation with Ktor:** Utilize Ktor's content negotiation features in conjunction with schema validation libraries to ensure incoming data conforms to expected structures *before* processing.
        *   **Careful Selection of Deserialization Libraries:** Choose and configure deserialization libraries (like kotlinx.serialization or Jackson used with Ktor) carefully, keeping them updated and aware of their security implications.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via HTTP Client](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_http_client.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can induce the server to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources, potentially exposing internal services or performing actions on behalf of the server.
    *   **How Ktor Contributes:** If the Ktor application uses its built-in `HttpClient` to make requests based on user-provided input that is processed *within a Ktor handler*, it can be vulnerable to SSRF. Ktor's `HttpClient` provides the mechanism for making these requests.
    *   **Example:** A Ktor route handler takes a URL as input and uses Ktor's `HttpClient` to fetch content from that URL. An attacker provides a URL pointing to an internal service.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, data breaches, denial of service, potential for further exploitation of internal systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization in Handlers:** Strictly validate and sanitize any URLs or hostnames provided by users *within the Ktor route handler* before using them in `HttpClient` requests.
        *   **Restrict Outbound Network Access:** Configure network firewalls or security groups to restrict the server's ability to make outbound requests to only necessary destinations, limiting the scope of potential SSRF attacks originating from the Ktor application.

## Attack Surface: [WebSocket Injection](./attack_surfaces/websocket_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can send malicious messages through WebSocket connections that are then processed or echoed by the server, potentially affecting other connected clients or the server itself.
    *   **How Ktor Contributes:** Ktor provides support for WebSockets, and the application's handling of WebSocket messages within Ktor's WebSocket handlers determines the vulnerability. If data received through Ktor's WebSocket handling is not sanitized, it can lead to injection.
    *   **Example:** A chat application built with Ktor WebSockets. A malicious script sent through a WebSocket connection is broadcast to other clients without sanitization within the Ktor application logic.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on other clients, potential for denial of service or other malicious actions depending on the application logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization in WebSocket Handlers:** Sanitize all data received through WebSocket connections *within the Ktor WebSocket handler* before processing or broadcasting it.
