# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Ktor Framework, aims to provide a modern, lightweight, and flexible framework for building asynchronous web applications, HTTP services, mobile backends, and more. It is designed to be Kotlin-native, taking advantage of coroutines for concurrency and offering a modular architecture.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Provide a high-performance and scalable framework for building networked applications.
- Offer a developer-friendly experience with Kotlin DSLs and a modular design.
- Foster a strong and active community around the framework.
- Enable rapid development and deployment of web applications and services.
- Support diverse deployment environments, from traditional servers to cloud platforms.

Most Important Business Risks:
- Security vulnerabilities in the framework itself could lead to widespread application security issues.
- Lack of adoption by developers compared to competing frameworks.
- Performance bottlenecks or scalability limitations could hinder adoption for large-scale applications.
- Community fragmentation or lack of maintenance could lead to the project becoming outdated or insecure.
- Incompatibility with evolving Kotlin language features or ecosystem changes.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- security control: Unit and integration tests. Implemented in: test source code directories.
- security control: Code linters and formatters. Implemented in: project configuration and development guidelines.

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
- accepted risk: Security misconfigurations by users of the framework in their applications.

Recommended Security Controls:

- recommended security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the framework.
- recommended security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process.
- recommended security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices documentation for developers using Ktor.
- recommended security control: Implement dependency vulnerability scanning and management.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - Requirement: The framework should provide flexible and extensible mechanisms for implementing various authentication methods (e.g., Basic Auth, OAuth 2.0, JWT).
    - Requirement: Support for secure storage of credentials or tokens should be considered (though primarily the responsibility of the application developer).
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: The framework should offer robust authorization mechanisms to control access to resources and functionalities based on user roles or permissions.
    - Requirement: Support for attribute-based access control (ABAC) and role-based access control (RBAC) should be considered.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: The framework must provide tools and guidance to developers for performing thorough input validation to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
    - Requirement: Default configurations should encourage secure input handling practices.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: The framework should provide secure and easy-to-use cryptographic libraries for tasks such as data encryption, hashing, and digital signatures.
    - Requirement: Support for TLS/SSL for secure communication is essential and should be well-integrated.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Providing a secure and reliable framework for building networked applications.
- Maintaining the integrity and availability of the Ktor framework and its ecosystem.
- Ensuring developer trust and adoption of the framework.

Data Sensitivity:
- Ktor framework code itself: High sensitivity. Vulnerabilities can impact many applications. Integrity and confidentiality are important.
- Framework build artifacts (libraries): High sensitivity. Tampered artifacts can compromise applications using them. Integrity is critical.
- User application data processed by Ktor applications: Sensitivity depends on the application. Ktor framework needs to provide tools to protect sensitive data, but the framework itself does not store user data.
- Framework configuration data: Medium sensitivity. Misconfiguration can lead to security issues. Confidentiality and integrity are important.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What are the specific target deployment environments for Ktor applications (e.g., cloud platforms, on-premise, serverless)?
- What is the risk appetite of organizations using Ktor? (Startup vs. Fortune 500)
- Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA) that Ktor or applications built with Ktor need to adhere to?
- What are the most common use cases for Ktor framework? (Web APIs, microservices, full-stack web applications, etc.)

Assumptions:
- Ktor is intended to be used in internet-facing applications, making security a high priority.
- Developers using Ktor are expected to implement application-level security controls on top of the framework's features.
- The Ktor project aims to follow secure software development lifecycle best practices.
- The primary deployment model is assumed to be containerized environments in the cloud, but Ktor is flexible and can be deployed in various ways.
- The build process is assumed to be automated using CI/CD pipelines and includes basic security checks.
