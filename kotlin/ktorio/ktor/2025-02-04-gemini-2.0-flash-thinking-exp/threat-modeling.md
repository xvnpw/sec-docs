    *   Enforce HTTPS and redirect HTTP traffic from HTTP to HTTPS.
    *   Configure HSTS headers.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker sends malicious serialized data in requests that Ktor application deserializes. If the application uses vulnerable serialization libraries or configurations within Ktor's content negotiation, it can lead to code execution or other attacks.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, data manipulation, information disclosure.
*   **Ktor Component Affected:** Content Negotiation (`ContentNegotiation` plugin), Serialization libraries integration within Ktor.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure serialization libraries securely within Ktor's content negotiation setup (e.g., use class allowlists/denylists).
    *   Avoid deserializing untrusted data directly without validation.
    *   Keep serialization libraries updated.

## Threat: [Plugin Misconfiguration](./threats/plugin_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits misconfigurations in Ktor plugins, particularly security-related plugins. Incorrectly configured authentication, authorization, or content negotiation plugins within Ktor can create security gaps.
*   **Impact:** Bypass of security controls, unauthorized access, data exposure, application malfunction.
*   **Ktor Component Affected:** Plugins (Plugin configuration, e.g., `Authentication`, `Authorization`, `ContentNegotiation` configuration blocks)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully configure plugins according to documentation and security best practices within Ktor application.
    *   Thoroughly test plugin configurations, especially security-related ones.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring plugins.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Authentication and Authorization](./threats/misconfigured_authentication_and_authorization.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker bypasses or circumvents authentication and authorization mechanisms due to incorrect implementation or configuration using Ktor's features. This could involve weak authentication schemes, flawed authorization logic, or bypassable checks.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality, privilege escalation, data breaches.
*   **Ktor Component Affected:** Authentication (`Authentication` plugin, authentication providers), Authorization (`Authorization` plugin, authorization policies)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use Ktor's authentication and authorization features correctly.
    *   Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., MFA, strong passwords).
    *   Design and implement fine-grained authorization policies within Ktor.
    *   Thoroughly test authentication and authorization logic.

## Threat: [Weak or Default Security Configurations](./threats/weak_or_default_security_configurations.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits weak or default security configurations in Ktor or its plugins. Using default credentials, weak encryption, or insecure default settings provided by Ktor can make exploitation easier.
*   **Impact:** Easy exploitation by attackers, unauthorized access, data breaches, compromise of application security.
