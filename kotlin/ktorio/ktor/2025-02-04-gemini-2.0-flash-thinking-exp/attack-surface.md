# Attack Surface Analysis for ktorio/ktor

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization.md)

Description: Exploiting vulnerabilities in deserialization processes to execute arbitrary code, cause denial of service, or gain unauthorized access.
*   **Ktor Contribution:** Ktor's content negotiation and serialization features, particularly when using formats like JSON or XML with libraries like Jackson or kotlinx.serialization, can be vulnerable if untrusted data is deserialized without proper validation. Ktor provides the framework for content negotiation, making it a direct component in handling deserialization.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a crafted JSON payload in a POST request to a Ktor endpoint that uses Ktor's content negotiation to automatically deserialize the JSON into an object. This payload exploits a known vulnerability in the Jackson library (used implicitly or explicitly with Ktor), leading to remote code execution on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Data Breach, Privilege Escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate all data *before* deserialization. Use schemas or validation libraries to ensure the data conforms to expected formats and constraints *before* Ktor's deserialization process.
    *   **Secure Deserialization Libraries:**  Ensure that the deserialization libraries used with Ktor (Jackson, kotlinx.serialization, etc.) are up-to-date and patched against known vulnerabilities. Regularly audit and update dependencies.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Avoid deserializing complex objects directly from user input. If possible, deserialize into simpler data structures using Ktor's features and then map to application objects *after* rigorous validation.
    *   **Disable Polymorphic Deserialization (if not needed):** If polymorphic deserialization is not required, disable it in the serialization library configuration used within Ktor to reduce the attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Route Parameters](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_route_parameters.md)

Description: Attackers manipulate URL path parameters to access files or directories outside the intended application scope on the server's file system.
*   **Ktor Contribution:** Ktor's routing DSL allows defining routes with parameters. If these parameters are directly used to construct file paths within route handlers without proper sanitization, path traversal vulnerabilities can occur. Ktor's routing mechanism directly provides the parameters that, if misused, lead to this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A Ktor route `/files/{filename}` is intended to serve files from a specific directory. The route handler uses the `filename` parameter directly to construct a file path. An attacker crafts a request like `/files/../../../../etc/passwd` to attempt to access the system's password file, exploiting the Ktor route parameter handling.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure (access to sensitive files), potentially Remote Code Execution if combined with file upload or other vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Strictly validate and sanitize route parameters *within Ktor route handlers* before using them in file path construction. Use whitelists of allowed characters and patterns.
    *   **Path Normalization:** Normalize paths *within Ktor route handlers* to remove relative path components like `..` before using them to access files.
    *   **Chroot Environment (if applicable):** Confine the Ktor application's file system access to a specific directory using chroot or similar OS-level mechanisms to limit the impact of path traversal.
    *   **Avoid Direct File System Access from User Input:**  Whenever possible, avoid directly using user-provided route parameters to construct file paths. Use identifiers or mappings to access resources instead, abstracting away direct file system interaction within Ktor handlers.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Authentication Providers](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_authentication_providers.md)

Description: Weaknesses or errors in the configuration of authentication mechanisms, leading to authentication bypass or unauthorized access.
*   **Ktor Contribution:** Ktor provides various authentication providers (Basic, JWT, OAuth, etc.) as features and plugins. Misconfiguration of these *Ktor-provided* providers directly leads to security vulnerabilities. The vulnerability arises from how Ktor's authentication features are set up and used.
*   **Example:** A Ktor application uses JWT authentication *via Ktor's JWT plugin*, but the secret key used to sign tokens is weak or hardcoded in the application configuration. An attacker can easily discover or guess this key and generate valid JWTs, bypassing Ktor's authentication. Or, a Ktor OAuth provider is configured with overly permissive scopes, granting excessive access due to Ktor configuration errors.
*   **Impact:** Authentication Bypass, Unauthorized Access, Data Breach, Account Takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Secrets and Keys:** Use strong, randomly generated secrets and keys for authentication mechanisms configured within Ktor. Store them securely using environment variables, secrets management systems, or secure configuration practices *outside of the Ktor application code itself*.
    *   **Secure Configuration Practices:** Follow secure configuration guidelines for chosen authentication providers *as documented by Ktor and the specific provider*. Review Ktor's authentication documentation and best practices thoroughly.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of Authentication Configuration:** Periodically review and audit authentication configurations *within the Ktor application setup* to identify and rectify any misconfigurations.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Scopes:** When using OAuth or similar mechanisms *configured in Ktor*, define and enforce the principle of least privilege for scopes and permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Bypass in Route Handlers](./attack_surfaces/authorization_bypass_in_route_handlers.md)

Description: Lack of or insufficient authorization checks within route handlers, allowing authenticated users to access resources or perform actions they are not authorized to.
*   **Ktor Contribution:** While Ktor provides authentication features, the *implementation of authorization logic within route handlers is crucial and directly within the Ktor application's code*.  Failure to implement proper authorization *in Ktor route handlers* can lead to vulnerabilities. Ktor provides the context (route handlers, authentication context) where authorization must be implemented.
*   **Example:** A Ktor application has an admin panel route `/admin/users` that should only be accessible to administrators. The route is protected by Ktor's authentication, but the route handler *in the Ktor application code* only checks if the user is authenticated and *not* if they have the 'admin' role. Any authenticated user, even a regular user, can access the admin panel due to missing authorization logic in the Ktor handler.
*   **Impact:** Privilege Escalation, Unauthorized Access, Data Manipulation, Data Breach.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Robust Authorization Logic:** Implement comprehensive authorization checks *within Ktor route handlers* to verify user roles, permissions, or ownership of resources before granting access. This logic is implemented *using Ktor's context and features*.
    *   **Use Ktor's Authorization Features (if applicable):** Leverage Ktor's authorization features or plugins *to structure and enforce authorization policies within the Ktor application*.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions required for their roles, enforced *within the Ktor application's authorization logic*.
    *   **Regularly Review Authorization Logic:** Periodically review and test authorization logic *in Ktor route handlers* to ensure it is correctly implemented and covers all necessary access control points.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_plugins.md)

Description: Using outdated or vulnerable Ktor plugins that contain security flaws, which can be exploited to compromise the application.
*   **Ktor Contribution:** Ktor's plugin ecosystem is a core part of the framework's extensibility. Relying on third-party plugins *within a Ktor application* introduces dependencies that might have vulnerabilities. The vulnerability is directly linked to using Ktor's plugin mechanism and ecosystem.
*   **Example:** A Ktor application uses an outdated version of a popular *Ktor plugin* for rate limiting. This plugin has a known security vulnerability that allows attackers to bypass rate limiting and launch denial-of-service attacks against the Ktor application.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the plugin vulnerability, potentially Remote Code Execution, Data Breach, Denial of Service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (depending on the specific plugin vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Plugin Updates:** Keep all *Ktor plugins* up-to-date with the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. Utilize Ktor's dependency management and plugin update mechanisms.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Use dependency management tools (like Gradle or Maven in Kotlin/JVM projects) to track and manage *Ktor plugin* dependencies effectively.
    *   **Security Audits of Plugins:** Periodically audit used *Ktor plugins* for known vulnerabilities. Consider using vulnerability scanning tools that can analyze project dependencies, including Ktor plugins.
    *   **Choose Reputable Plugins:** Prefer plugins from reputable sources within the Ktor ecosystem with active maintenance and security updates. Evaluate the security track record of Ktor plugins before adoption.

## Attack Surface: [WebSocket Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/websocket_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: Exploiting vulnerabilities by injecting malicious data through WebSocket messages, similar to web application injection attacks (e.g., command injection, code injection).
*   **Ktor Contribution:** Ktor's WebSocket support *feature* allows handling real-time communication. If input received via WebSockets *through Ktor's WebSocket handling* is not properly sanitized, injection vulnerabilities can arise. Ktor provides the WebSocket infrastructure that, if misused, can lead to these vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A Ktor application uses WebSockets to receive commands from clients. The Ktor WebSocket handler directly processes messages as commands. An attacker sends a WebSocket message containing a malicious command that, when processed by the server *via Ktor's WebSocket handling* without sanitization, leads to command execution on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Data Manipulation, Denial of Service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (depending on the type of injection)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization for WebSocket Messages:** Strictly validate and sanitize all data received through WebSocket messages *within Ktor's WebSocket handlers* before processing or using it in server-side operations.
    *   **Secure WebSocket Message Processing:** Implement secure coding practices when processing WebSocket messages *in Ktor*, avoiding direct execution of user-provided data as commands or code.
    *   **Rate Limiting and Connection Limits for WebSockets:** Implement rate limiting and connection limits for WebSocket connections *within Ktor's WebSocket configuration* to mitigate potential DoS attacks targeting the WebSocket feature.
