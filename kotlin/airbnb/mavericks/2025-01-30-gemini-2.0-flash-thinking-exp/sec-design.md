# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Mavericks, is an Android framework developed by Airbnb to simplify and enhance the development of reactive Android applications. It aims to improve developer productivity, code maintainability, and application performance within Airbnb and potentially for the wider Android development community if open-sourced and adopted externally.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Enhance Android Developer Productivity: Mavericks aims to reduce boilerplate code and simplify complex UI development, allowing developers to build features faster.
- Improve Code Maintainability: By promoting a reactive architecture and component-based UI development, Mavericks should lead to more maintainable and testable Android codebases.
- Increase Application Performance: Reactive programming principles and optimized UI rendering techniques within Mavericks can contribute to better performing Android applications.
- Foster Innovation and Feature Velocity: By addressing common Android development challenges, Mavericks can enable faster iteration and innovation in Airbnb's Android applications.
- Attract and Retain Talent: Using modern and efficient frameworks like Mavericks can make Airbnb's Android development environment more attractive to skilled engineers.
- Community Engagement and Branding (if open-sourced): Open-sourcing Mavericks can enhance Airbnb's reputation within the Android developer community and potentially drive adoption and contributions.

Business Risks:
- Adoption Risk: Developers might resist adopting a new framework, especially if it requires significant learning or changes to existing workflows.
- Maintenance Overhead: Maintaining and evolving Mavericks requires ongoing investment in development and support.
- Security Vulnerabilities in Framework: Security flaws in Mavericks itself could be inherited by all applications built using it, posing a widespread risk.
- Compatibility Issues: Mavericks might have compatibility issues with certain Android versions, devices, or third-party libraries, limiting its applicability.
- Performance Bottlenecks: Despite aiming for performance improvements, unforeseen performance bottlenecks within Mavericks could negatively impact applications.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Code Reviews: Airbnb likely employs code reviews for contributions to Mavericks to identify potential security vulnerabilities and code quality issues.
- security control: Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST): Airbnb might use SAST tools to automatically scan Mavericks' codebase for common security flaws during development.
- security control: Dependency Management: Secure dependency management practices are likely in place to ensure that third-party libraries used by Mavericks are vetted and up-to-date with security patches.
- security control: Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC): Airbnb likely follows a SDLC that incorporates security considerations throughout the development process.
- security control: Access Control: Access to the Mavericks repository and related infrastructure is likely controlled based on the principle of least privilege.
- security control: Build Pipeline Security: Security checks might be integrated into the build pipeline for Mavericks, such as vulnerability scanning of dependencies and build artifacts.
- accepted risk: Framework Vulnerabilities: There is an inherent risk that vulnerabilities might be discovered in Mavericks after release, requiring patching and updates.
- accepted risk: Misuse by Developers: Developers using Mavericks might misuse its features or introduce vulnerabilities in their applications despite the framework's security measures.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Dynamic Analysis Security Testing (DAST): Implement DAST to test applications built with Mavericks in a runtime environment to identify vulnerabilities that might not be apparent in static analysis.
- security control: Security Training for Developers: Provide security training to developers using Mavericks to educate them on secure coding practices and common pitfalls when using the framework.
- security control: Regular Security Audits: Conduct periodic security audits of Mavericks by internal or external security experts to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
- security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Program: Establish a vulnerability disclosure program to allow security researchers to report vulnerabilities in Mavericks responsibly.
- security control: Automated Dependency Scanning: Implement automated tools to continuously monitor dependencies for known vulnerabilities and trigger alerts for necessary updates.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to Mavericks framework itself. Authentication is a concern for applications built using Mavericks.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to Mavericks framework itself. Authorization is a concern for applications built using Mavericks.
- Input Validation: Mavericks should encourage or enforce input validation within applications built using it, especially when handling user inputs or data from external sources. Framework should provide mechanisms to easily validate data within reactive components.
- Cryptography: Mavericks itself might not directly implement cryptography, but it should not hinder or complicate the use of cryptography in applications built with it. Framework should be compatible with standard Android cryptography libraries and best practices. Framework should not introduce any cryptographic vulnerabilities.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Android Application Development: Mavericks directly supports the process of developing Android applications for Airbnb, which are crucial for customer engagement and service delivery.
- Feature Delivery and Innovation: By improving developer productivity, Mavericks indirectly supports faster feature delivery and innovation in Airbnb's Android applications, impacting competitiveness and user experience.

Data Sensitivity:
- Mavericks framework itself primarily deals with code, configuration, and build artifacts. The data handled directly by the framework is not highly sensitive in terms of personal user data.
- However, vulnerabilities in Mavericks could lead to vulnerabilities in applications built using it, which might handle sensitive user data (e.g., user profiles, location data, payment information).
- Sensitivity levels:
    - Mavericks Codebase: Confidential (Airbnb intellectual property)
    - Build Artifacts: Confidential (potentially contain internal implementation details)
    - Dependencies: Publicly available, but integrity and vulnerability status are important.
