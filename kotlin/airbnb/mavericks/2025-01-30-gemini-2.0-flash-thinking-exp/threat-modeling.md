# Threat Model Analysis for airbnb/mavericks

## Threat: [State Mutation Manipulation via Reducer Logic Flaws](./threats/state_mutation_manipulation_via_reducer_logic_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the state reducer logic to manipulate the application's state in unintended ways. This could be achieved by crafting specific inputs or actions that trigger flawed logic in reducers, leading to unauthorized state changes.
*   **Impact:**  Data corruption, unauthorized access, privilege escalation, application malfunction, potential bypass of security controls.
*   **Mavericks Component Affected:** State reducers (`setState` lambda functions), `MavericksState` interface.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly test state reducers with various inputs, including edge cases and potentially malicious inputs.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization within state reducers to prevent unexpected or malicious data from corrupting the state.
    *   Use immutable state updates to ensure predictable state transitions and easier debugging.
    *   Conduct code reviews of state reducer logic to identify potential flaws.

## Threat: [State Tampering via External Input Injection (Deep Links, Custom Interceptors)](./threats/state_tampering_via_external_input_injection__deep_links__custom_interceptors_.md)

*   **Description:** In custom implementations, if the application allows external sources (like deep links or custom interceptors) to directly influence or inject state without proper validation, an attacker could craft malicious inputs to tamper with the application's state.
*   **Impact:**  Data corruption, unauthorized access, privilege escalation, application malfunction, bypass of intended application logic.
*   **Mavericks Component Affected:** Custom deep link handlers, custom interceptors (if implemented), `setState`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid direct state manipulation from external sources if possible.
    *   If external input influences state, implement strict input validation and sanitization.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when designing state update mechanisms from external sources.
    *   Carefully review and test any custom code that handles external inputs and state updates.
