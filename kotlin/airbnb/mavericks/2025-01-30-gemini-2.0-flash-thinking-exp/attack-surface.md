# Attack Surface Analysis for airbnb/mavericks

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization of Mavericks State](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization_of_mavericks_state.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from deserializing `MavericksState` objects from untrusted sources without proper validation, leading to potential code execution or state manipulation.
*   **Mavericks Contribution:** Mavericks architecture relies heavily on `MavericksState` for managing application data. The library's encouragement of state management, and the potential need to serialize/deserialize this state for persistence or other purposes, directly introduces this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized `MavericksState` payload. The application, using Mavericks, deserializes this payload from a local file or received data, assuming it's safe. The malicious payload exploits a deserialization vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the user's device, gaining full control of the application and potentially the device itself.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete application compromise, data breach, unauthorized access to device resources.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Eliminate Deserialization from Untrusted Sources:**  The most effective mitigation is to avoid deserializing `MavericksState` from any source that cannot be fully trusted. Re-evaluate if serialization and deserialization are absolutely necessary for the application's functionality.
        *   **Secure Serialization Libraries:** If deserialization is unavoidable, use well-vetted and secure serialization libraries that are less prone to vulnerabilities. Avoid default Java serialization if possible, as it's known to be problematic.
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize the deserialized `MavericksState` data before using it within the application. Implement checks to ensure the data conforms to expected schemas and does not contain malicious content.
        *   **Data Integrity Checks:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of serialized state before deserialization. This could involve using digital signatures or message authentication codes (MACs) to detect tampering.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design the application so that even if deserialization is compromised, the impact is minimized. Avoid storing highly sensitive data directly in serialized state if possible, or encrypt sensitive parts.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data through Mavericks State Logging](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_through_mavericks_state_logging.md)

*   **Description:** Unintentional leakage of sensitive user or application data contained within `MavericksState` due to insecure logging practices, particularly in production environments.
*   **Mavericks Contribution:** Mavericks' core concept is state management, and `MavericksState` naturally holds application data.  The library's debugging and development workflows might encourage logging state for inspection, which can become a vulnerability if logging is not properly controlled in production.
*   **Example:** Developers, during debugging, configure logging to output the entire `MavericksState` to easily inspect application behavior. This debug logging configuration is mistakenly left active in the release build. User Personally Identifiable Information (PII), authentication tokens, or API keys stored within the `MavericksState` are then written to system logs, accessible to other apps with sufficient permissions or during device compromise.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, Privacy Violation, potential Identity Theft, Account Takeover, Compromise of sensitive application secrets.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Disable Debug Logging in Production:** Ensure debug logging is completely disabled in release builds. Use build configurations and conditional compilation to achieve this.
        *   **Secure Logging Practices:** Implement secure logging practices that redact or mask sensitive data before logging any part of `MavericksState`.  Avoid logging the entire state object directly. Log only necessary information and sanitize it.
        *   **Logging Level Control:** Utilize logging frameworks that provide fine-grained control over logging levels. Configure different logging levels for debug and release builds, ensuring minimal logging in production.
        *   **Avoid Storing Sensitive Data Directly in State (If Possible):**  Re-evaluate if sensitive data must be directly stored in `MavericksState`. Consider using secure storage mechanisms (like Android Keystore for secrets) and only referencing identifiers or non-sensitive representations in the state.
        *   **Regular Security Audits of Logging:** Conduct periodic security audits to review logging configurations and ensure no sensitive data is being inadvertently logged in production.

## Attack Surface: [Logical Vulnerabilities in Complex Mavericks State Management](./attack_surfaces/logical_vulnerabilities_in_complex_mavericks_state_management.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities arising from complex and potentially flawed state transition logic within `MavericksViewModel`, making it difficult to identify and prevent unintended or malicious state manipulations.
*   **Mavericks Contribution:** Mavericks promotes building robust and feature-rich applications through comprehensive state management. While beneficial for application architecture, this complexity can inadvertently introduce logical vulnerabilities in the state machine if not carefully designed and rigorously tested.
*   **Example:** A `MavericksViewModel` manages a complex workflow involving multiple states and transitions for a financial transaction feature. A logical flaw exists in the state transition logic, allowing an attacker to manipulate the application flow by triggering specific actions in a particular sequence. This exploitation bypasses transaction authorization checks, allowing unauthorized fund transfers by manipulating the state into an unintended "transaction approved" state.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized Access, Privilege Escalation, Data Manipulation (e.g., unauthorized transactions), Business Logic Bypass, Potential Financial Loss.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Simplified State Management Design:** Strive for simplicity in state management logic. Break down complex state machines into smaller, more manageable, and easily auditable components.
        *   **Formal State Machine Design and Review:** For security-critical features, consider formally designing the state machine using diagrams or state transition tables. Conduct thorough security reviews of the state machine design and implementation.
        *   **Comprehensive Unit and Integration Testing:** Implement extensive unit and integration tests specifically targeting state transitions and edge cases, particularly for security-sensitive workflows. Focus on testing for unexpected state transitions and ensuring proper authorization checks are enforced at each state.
        *   **Code Reviews with Security Focus:** Conduct code reviews by multiple developers, with a specific focus on identifying potential logical vulnerabilities and security implications within the state management logic.
        *   **Security Focused Static Analysis:** Utilize static analysis tools that can help identify potential logical flaws and security vulnerabilities in the code, especially in state management and control flow logic.
