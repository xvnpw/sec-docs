# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for airbnb/mavericks

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Sensitive Data in State](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_sensitive_data_in_state.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **State Audit:** Examine all MvRx `MavericksState` classes and ViewModel state properties to locate instances where sensitive data is directly stored. Mavericks state is designed to be easily accessible and observable, making direct storage of sensitive data inherently riskier.
    2.  **Data Redesign for Mavericks State:** Refactor state to avoid storing highly sensitive data directly within Mavericks state. Instead:
        *   Store identifiers or references in Mavericks state and retrieve sensitive data on-demand from secure storage or backend services when needed within ViewModel logic, *outside* of the state itself.
        *   If absolutely necessary to store encrypted sensitive data in Mavericks state, ensure robust encryption and key management are implemented *outside* of the state, handling encryption/decryption in the ViewModel logic before setting/getting state properties.
    3.  **Code Review (Mavericks State Focus):** Conduct code reviews specifically focused on Mavericks state management to ensure developers are minimizing sensitive data storage in state and adhering to secure data handling practices within ViewModels interacting with the state.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data Breach via Mavericks State Exposure (High Severity):** If the application's Mavericks state is compromised (e.g., through memory dumps, debugging tools, or insecure logging of state), sensitive data directly within the state is immediately exposed. This is a high severity threat due to the central and observable nature of Mavericks state.
        *   **Accidental Data Leakage from Mavericks State (Medium Severity):** Sensitive data in Mavericks state is more prone to unintentional logging, insecure persistence (if implemented), or exposure through debugging interfaces due to the framework's design for easy state observation and manipulation.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Breach via Mavericks State Exposure:** High risk reduction. Directly addresses the core risk of sensitive data exposure inherent in Mavericks state management.
        *   **Accidental Data Leakage from Mavericks State:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the likelihood of unintentional leaks stemming from the framework's state management features.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have general guidelines discouraging storing passwords and API keys directly in state (documented in our internal coding standards), but these are not Mavericks-framework specific and lack detailed guidance for Mavericks state.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Mavericks-specific guidelines and training for developers on secure state management practices, emphasizing the risks of storing sensitive data directly in Mavericks state.
        *   Automated checks (e.g., custom linters or static analysis rules tailored for Mavericks) to detect potential storage of sensitive data in Mavericks state classes.
        *   Code review checklists specifically focused on Mavericks state security and minimization of sensitive data within state.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Sanitization in Mavericks State Updates](./mitigation_strategies/data_sanitization_in_mavericks_state_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Mavericks State Input Points:** Determine all points in ViewModels where external data (especially user inputs or data from APIs) is used to update Mavericks state properties.
    2.  **Sanitization Logic in ViewModels (Before State Update):** Implement data sanitization and validation logic *within ViewModels* *before* updating Mavericks state with external data. This ensures that only sanitized and validated data enters the state. Choose sanitization methods appropriate for the data type and its intended use in the UI or application logic driven by Mavericks state.
    3.  **Testing (Mavericks State and Sanitization):** Thoroughly test sanitization logic in ViewModels, specifically focusing on how sanitized data is reflected in Mavericks state and subsequently in the UI or application behavior driven by state changes.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Mavericks State (High Severity):** If unsanitized user input is stored in Mavericks state and subsequently used to render UI elements (which is a common pattern in Mavericks applications), it can directly lead to XSS vulnerabilities. Mavericks' data binding and UI rendering patterns amplify this risk.
        *   **Indirect Injection Attacks via Mavericks State (Medium Severity):** If data in Mavericks state is indirectly used to construct database queries, commands, or other security-sensitive operations *outside* of the UI rendering, lack of sanitization before state update can still contribute to injection vulnerabilities.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Mavericks State:** High risk reduction. Directly prevents XSS attacks originating from data managed and rendered through Mavericks state.
        *   **Indirect Injection Attacks via Mavericks State:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the risk of injection attacks where Mavericks state acts as an intermediary for data flow to backend systems or other vulnerable components.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have basic input validation in some UI components, but consistent sanitization *within ViewModels before Mavericks state updates* is not systematically applied. Sanitization is often missed in the data flow between external sources and Mavericks state.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Mandatory ViewModel-level sanitization logic for all external data sources *before* updating Mavericks state.
        *   Centralized sanitization library or utility functions specifically designed for use within Mavericks ViewModels to ensure consistent sanitization before state updates.
        *   Automated testing strategies to verify sanitization effectiveness in ViewModels and its impact on Mavericks state and UI rendering.
        *   Developer training focused on secure data handling and sanitization best practices *within the Mavericks framework context*, emphasizing sanitization before Mavericks state updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Mavericks State Persistence (If Implemented)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_mavericks_state_persistence__if_implemented_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Persistence Audit (Mavericks State):** If state persistence is implemented for Mavericks state (which is less common but possible for features like restoring app state), specifically audit which parts of the Mavericks state are being persisted.
    2.  **Secure Storage for Mavericks Persisted State:** If sensitive data is part of the persisted Mavericks state, *mandatorily* use Android Keystore or similar secure storage mechanisms for storing the persisted state data. Avoid insecure storage like SharedPreferences for any persisted Mavericks state containing sensitive information.
    3.  **Encryption for Mavericks Persisted State:** Encrypt the *entire* persisted Mavericks state data if it contains any sensitive information. Implement encryption *before* persisting the state and decryption *after* retrieving it. Use robust encryption algorithms and manage encryption keys securely (ideally using Android Keystore).
    4.  **Serialization Review (Mavericks State Persistence):** Carefully review the serialization methods used for persisting Mavericks state. Avoid insecure serialization formats that could be vulnerable to deserialization attacks, especially if the persisted state data is not encrypted or integrity-checked.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data Breach via Persisted Mavericks State (High Severity):** If Mavericks state persistence is implemented insecurely (e.g., unencrypted storage of state containing sensitive data), sensitive information can be exposed if the device is compromised or lost. This is a high severity threat if Mavericks state contains sensitive data and is persisted without proper security.
        *   **Deserialization Attacks on Mavericks Persisted State (Medium Severity):** If insecure serialization methods are used for Mavericks state persistence, the application might be vulnerable to deserialization attacks if the persisted state data is tampered with, even if encryption is used (integrity checks are also important).

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Breach via Persisted Mavericks State:** High risk reduction. Encryption and secure storage are critical for mitigating data breach risks associated with Mavericks state persistence.
        *   **Deserialization Attacks on Mavericks Persisted State:** Medium risk reduction. Secure serialization and integrity checks reduce the risk of deserialization attacks targeting persisted Mavericks state.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented for sensitive user data. We currently do not persist Mavericks state containing sensitive user data. Our application relies on re-authentication and data retrieval from the backend upon application restart, avoiding persistence of sensitive Mavericks state.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   If Mavericks state persistence is planned for future features involving sensitive data, secure persistence mechanisms (encryption, secure storage, secure serialization) *must* be implemented from the outset, specifically considering the risks associated with persisting Mavericks state.
        *   Development guidelines and best practices for *secure Mavericks state persistence* should be established if this feature is to be used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Logging Sensitive Mavericks State Data](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_logging_sensitive_mavericks_state_data.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Mavericks State Logging Audit:** Specifically analyze code that logs Mavericks state, particularly in ViewModels and `MvRxView` implementations. Identify instances where entire Mavericks state objects or properties containing sensitive data are logged. Mavericks' observable nature can make it tempting to log entire state objects for debugging, which is risky with sensitive data.
    2.  **Selective Logging for Mavericks State:** Modify logging logic to *specifically avoid* logging sensitive data from Mavericks state. Instead:
        *   Log only non-sensitive parts of the Mavericks state.
        *   Mask or redact sensitive data *before* logging any part of the Mavericks state that might indirectly contain sensitive information.
        *   Use conditional logging to *completely disable* logging of Mavericks state in production builds if possible, or severely restrict it to error conditions only.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data Leakage via Mavericks State Logs (Medium Severity):** Sensitive data logged from Mavericks state in application logs can be exposed to unauthorized individuals who have access to log files or logging systems. The ease of accessing and logging Mavericks state increases this risk.
        *   **Compliance Violations due to Mavericks State Logging (Medium Severity):** Logging sensitive data from Mavericks state might violate data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), especially if full state objects are logged without redaction.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Leakage via Mavericks State Logs:** Medium risk reduction. Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data through application logs originating from Mavericks state logging.
        *   **Compliance Violations due to Mavericks State Logging:** Medium risk reduction. Helps in adhering to data privacy regulations by avoiding logging sensitive information from Mavericks state.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have general guidelines to avoid logging PII in production, but specific checks and automated mechanisms to prevent logging of Mavericks state properties containing sensitive data are not in place.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Automated checks (e.g., custom linters tailored for Mavericks) to detect and flag logging of Mavericks state properties that are identified as sensitive.
        *   Centralized logging utility functions specifically for Mavericks components that automatically sanitize or mask sensitive data *before* logging any part of the state.
        *   Code reviews specifically focused on logging practices within Mavericks components, with a strong emphasis on preventing logging of sensitive Mavericks state data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Proper `MvRxView` Lifecycle Handling for Sensitive Operations](./mitigation_strategies/proper__mvrxview__lifecycle_handling_for_sensitive_operations.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Operations in `MvRxView`:** Pinpoint operations within `MvRxView` implementations that handle sensitive data (e.g., displaying masked sensitive data, triggering secure authentication flows based on state).
    2.  **Lifecycle Awareness in `MvRxView`:** Ensure these sensitive operations in `MvRxView` are correctly tied to the `MvRxView` lifecycle events (e.g., `onStart`, `onStop`, `onDestroyView`).  Mavericks `MvRxView` lifecycle management is crucial for preventing leaks and ensuring operations are active only when the view is visible and active.
    3.  **Coroutine Scope Management in `MvRxView`:** Use `launchWhenStarted`, `launchWhenResumed`, `launchWhenCreated` or `viewLifecycleOwner.lifecycleScope` to launch coroutines for sensitive operations *within* `MvRxView` when necessary. This ensures coroutines are automatically cancelled when the `MvRxView` is destroyed, preventing leaks and potential security issues arising from operations continuing after the view is no longer active.
    4.  **Resource Release in `MvRxView` Lifecycle:** Release resources specifically associated with sensitive operations performed within `MvRxView` (e.g., clearing UI caches of sensitive data, cancelling ongoing sensitive UI updates) in appropriate lifecycle callbacks (e.g., `onDestroyView`).

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data Leaks due to `MvRxView` Destruction (Medium Severity):** If sensitive operations within `MvRxView` continue after the `MvRxView` is destroyed (due to improper lifecycle management), it could lead to data leaks or resource exhaustion, especially if UI elements retain sensitive data in memory after the view is detached.
        *   **Resource Leaks in `MvRxView` (Low Severity):** Orphaned coroutines performing sensitive UI-related operations within `MvRxView` can lead to resource leaks and potentially impact application performance, although the security impact is less direct.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Leaks due to `MvRxView` Destruction:** Medium risk reduction. Prevents data leaks by ensuring sensitive operations within `MvRxView` are strictly tied to the view's lifecycle.
        *   **Resource Leaks in `MvRxView`:** Low risk reduction. Improves resource management within `MvRxView` and reduces potential performance impacts, indirectly contributing to overall application robustness.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Developers are generally aware of Android lifecycle management, but consistent and Mavericks-framework specific use of `launchWhenStarted/Resumed/Created` for *all* sensitive operations within `MvRxView` is not strictly enforced.  Specific guidance for `MvRxView` lifecycle and sensitive operations is lacking.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Code review checklist specifically tailored to Mavericks `MvRxView` implementations to verify lifecycle management for sensitive operations within views.
        *   Templates or code snippets demonstrating best practices for lifecycle-aware sensitive operations *within Mavericks views*.
        *   Training for developers on secure lifecycle management *in the context of Android and specifically Mavericks `MvRxView` lifecycle*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Prevent Data Leaks in `MvRxView` Bindings](./mitigation_strategies/prevent_data_leaks_in__mvrxview__bindings.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review `MvRxView` Data Binding Expressions:** Carefully examine all data binding expressions in `MvRxView` layout files (`.xml` files) that are bound to Mavericks state properties. Mavericks data binding makes it easy to directly connect state to UI, increasing the risk of accidental sensitive data display.
    2.  **Sensitive Data Binding Identification:** Identify data binding expressions in `MvRxView` layouts that directly display or process sensitive data from Mavericks state.
    3.  **Secure Data Display in `MvRxView` Bindings:** Modify data binding expressions in `MvRxView` layouts to *avoid directly displaying* sensitive data from Mavericks state in UI elements. Instead:
        *   Use data masking or partial display *within the data binding expressions* (e.g., using custom binding adapters to mask credit card numbers directly in the layout).
        *   Display only non-sensitive representations of sensitive data *through binding adapters* that transform the state data before display.
        *   Perform data transformations or sanitization *within ViewModels* before exposing data to Mavericks state, and then bind to the sanitized state properties in `MvRxView` layouts.
    4.  **Code Review for `MvRxView` Binding Security:** Include security considerations in code reviews of `MvRxView` layout files and data binding expressions, specifically focusing on preventing accidental display of sensitive data bound to Mavericks state.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Accidental Data Exposure in `MvRxView` UI (Medium Severity):** Unintentionally displaying sensitive data in `MvRxView` UI elements through data binding, directly from Mavericks state, can lead to data leaks, especially if screenshots are taken or the screen is viewed by unauthorized individuals. Mavericks' data binding features make this a more direct and common risk.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Accidental Data Exposure in `MvRxView` UI:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the likelihood of unintentional exposure of sensitive data through `MvRxView` UI elements by securing data binding practices.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have general UI/UX guidelines to avoid displaying full sensitive data in UI, but specific checks for data binding expressions *in `MvRxView` layouts* and their connection to Mavericks state are not routinely performed.  Mavericks-specific data binding security is not explicitly addressed.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Automated checks or linters specifically for `MvRxView` layout files to identify data binding expressions that might be displaying sensitive data directly from Mavericks state.
        *   Code review guidelines specifically addressing security aspects of data binding *in Mavericks views*, focusing on preventing sensitive data display from state.
        *   Reusable data binding adapters or utility functions *specifically for Mavericks views* for secure display of sensitive data (e.g., masking adapters for use with Mavericks state properties).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Data Handling in `MvRxView` `invalidate()` and `render()`](./mitigation_strategies/secure_data_handling_in__mvrxview___invalidate____and__render___.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Code Review of `MvRxView` `invalidate()` and `render()`:** Examine the `invalidate()` and `render()` methods in all `MvRxView` implementations.
    2.  **Identify Sensitive Operations in `MvRxView` Rendering:** Look for any security-sensitive operations performed *directly within* the `invalidate()` and `render()` methods of `MvRxView` (e.g., data decryption, complex data processing of sensitive information for UI display).
    3.  **Delegate to ViewModel (for `MvRxView` Rendering):** Refactor code to move security-sensitive operations *out of* `invalidate()` and `render()` methods of `MvRxView` and into the ViewModel.  ViewModels are the appropriate place for data processing and security logic in the Mavericks architecture.
    4.  **`MvRxView` Rendering for UI Updates Only:** Ensure `invalidate()` and `render()` methods in `MvRxView` *primarily focus on updating UI elements* based on data *already processed and sanitized by the ViewModel* and available in the Mavericks state. These methods should be lightweight and purely for UI rendering based on state changes.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Performance Issues and Potential DoS in `MvRxView` Rendering (Low Severity):** Performing heavy or blocking operations in `invalidate()` or `render()` of `MvRxView` can lead to UI thread blocking and performance issues, potentially causing denial of service, especially if rendering logic becomes complex and inefficient.
        *   **Security Vulnerabilities due to Complex Logic in `MvRxView` UI Thread (Low Severity):** Complex security-sensitive logic directly within `MvRxView` UI thread methods can be harder to secure, test, and audit, potentially introducing subtle vulnerabilities in UI rendering or data handling.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Performance Issues and Potential DoS in `MvRxView` Rendering:** Low risk reduction. Improves `MvRxView` UI performance and reduces potential for UI-related DoS by keeping rendering logic lightweight.
        *   **Security Vulnerabilities due to Complex Logic in `MvRxView` UI Thread:** Low risk reduction. Simplifies `MvRxView` UI code, making it easier to secure and audit by centralizing security logic in ViewModels.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Developers are generally encouraged to keep `invalidate()` and `render()` methods lightweight in `MvRxView`, but strict enforcement and specific security focus on avoiding sensitive operations in these methods are lacking. Mavericks-specific rendering security is not explicitly emphasized.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Code review guidelines emphasizing the separation of concerns in Mavericks, specifically avoiding security-sensitive logic in `invalidate()` and `render()` of `MvRxView` and delegating it to ViewModels.
        *   Static analysis rules or custom checks to detect complex logic or potentially insecure operations within `invalidate()` and `render()` methods of `MvRxView`.
        *   Developer training on the intended purpose and limitations of `invalidate()` and `render()` in Mavericks `MvRxView`, emphasizing their role as purely UI rendering methods based on state.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Structured Concurrency for Mavericks ViewModels' Coroutines](./mitigation_strategies/structured_concurrency_for_mavericks_viewmodels'_coroutines.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`viewModelScope` Usage in Mavericks ViewModels:** *Mandatorily* utilize `viewModelScope` provided by `viewModel()` extension function in Mavericks ViewModels for launching coroutines. This is the intended and secure way to manage coroutine lifecycle within Mavericks ViewModels, automatically tying coroutine lifecycle to the ViewModel lifecycle.
    2.  **Avoid `GlobalScope` in Mavericks ViewModels:** *Strictly discourage* the use of `GlobalScope` for coroutines within Mavericks ViewModels, as it can lead to orphaned coroutines that outlive the ViewModel and potentially cause resource leaks or unexpected background operations. Mavericks ViewModels are designed to manage their own coroutine lifecycles using `viewModelScope`.
    3.  **Structured Concurrency Principles in Mavericks ViewModels:** Follow structured concurrency principles by launching coroutines within the well-defined `viewModelScope` and ensuring proper cancellation and cleanup of coroutines when the ViewModel is cleared.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Resource Leaks due to Orphaned Coroutines in Mavericks ViewModels (Low Severity):** Using `GlobalScope` or improper scope management in Mavericks ViewModels can lead to orphaned coroutines that continue running even after the ViewModel is cleared, causing resource leaks and potentially impacting performance.
        *   **Unexpected Behavior from Background Tasks in Mavericks ViewModels (Low Severity):** Orphaned coroutines in Mavericks ViewModels might continue to perform operations in the background, leading to unexpected application behavior or data inconsistencies, although the security impact is generally low.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Resource Leaks due to Orphaned Coroutines in Mavericks ViewModels:** Low risk reduction. Improves resource management within Mavericks ViewModels and prevents potential performance degradation caused by orphaned coroutines.
        *   **Unexpected Behavior from Background Tasks in Mavericks ViewModels:** Low risk reduction. Enhances application stability and predictability by ensuring coroutines are properly managed within the Mavericks ViewModel lifecycle.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `viewModelScope` is generally used in ViewModels, but strict enforcement of `viewModelScope` usage and complete avoidance of `GlobalScope` in Mavericks ViewModels is not fully enforced. Mavericks-specific coroutine scope management is not always rigorously checked.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Code review guidelines specifically emphasizing structured concurrency and *mandatory* `viewModelScope` usage in Mavericks ViewModels, and *prohibition* of `GlobalScope`.
        *   Linters or static analysis rules specifically tailored for Mavericks to detect misuse of coroutine scopes in ViewModels (e.g., `GlobalScope` usage within Mavericks ViewModels).
        *   Developer training on structured concurrency best practices in Kotlin Coroutines *within the context of Mavericks ViewModels and `viewModelScope`*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Error Handling in Mavericks ViewModels' Coroutines](./mitigation_strategies/error_handling_in_mavericks_viewmodels'_coroutines.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`try-catch` Blocks in Mavericks ViewModel Coroutines:** *Mandatorily* wrap coroutine code within `try-catch` blocks *within Mavericks ViewModels* to handle potential exceptions that might occur during asynchronous operations (e.g., network errors, data parsing errors) initiated by ViewModels.
    2.  **Error State Management in Mavericks ViewModels:** Implement error state management *within Mavericks ViewModels*. Use Mavericks state to represent error conditions and update the state to reflect errors encountered during coroutine operations. This allows `MvRxView` to observe error state changes and update the UI accordingly to inform the user about errors in a Mavericks-driven manner.
    3.  **Graceful Error Handling via Mavericks State:** Implement graceful error handling logic *driven by Mavericks state changes*. When an error state is set in the ViewModel, `MvRxView` should react to this state change and display user-friendly error messages or trigger appropriate error handling UI flows (e.g., retry mechanisms) based on the Mavericks state.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Application Crashes due to Unhandled Exceptions in Mavericks ViewModels (Medium Severity):** Unhandled exceptions in coroutines within Mavericks ViewModels can lead to application crashes, resulting in denial of service and poor user experience. Mavericks ViewModels are central to application logic, making ViewModel crashes impactful.
        *   **Data Corruption due to Partial Operations in Mavericks ViewModels (Low Severity):** Unhandled exceptions in Mavericks ViewModels might interrupt critical data operations, potentially leading to data corruption or inconsistent application state managed by the ViewModel.
        *   **Information Disclosure via Error Messages from Mavericks ViewModels (Low Severity):** Verbose or poorly handled error messages originating from Mavericks ViewModels might inadvertently disclose sensitive information to users or in logs if error handling is not carefully implemented.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Application Crashes due to Unhandled Exceptions in Mavericks ViewModels:** Medium risk reduction. Improves application stability and prevents crashes due to coroutine errors originating from Mavericks ViewModels.
        *   **Data Corruption due to Partial Operations in Mavericks ViewModels:** Low risk reduction. Reduces the risk of data inconsistencies caused by interrupted operations within Mavericks ViewModels.
        *   **Information Disclosure via Error Messages from Mavericks ViewModels:** Low risk reduction. Prevents accidental disclosure of sensitive information through error messages originating from Mavericks ViewModels by promoting controlled error state management.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Error handling is generally practiced in network requests within ViewModels, but consistent and comprehensive error handling in *all* coroutines within Mavericks ViewModels, coupled with Mavericks state-driven error UI updates, is not fully enforced. Mavericks-specific error handling patterns are not consistently applied.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Code review guidelines emphasizing robust error handling in coroutines *within Mavericks ViewModels*, and the use of Mavericks state for error representation and UI updates.
        *   Centralized error handling mechanisms or utility functions *specifically for Mavericks ViewModels* to ensure consistent error management and state-driven error UI updates across the application.
        *   Developer training on best practices for error handling in Kotlin Coroutines *within the Mavericks framework context*, emphasizing state-driven error management in ViewModels and UI updates in `MvRxView`.
