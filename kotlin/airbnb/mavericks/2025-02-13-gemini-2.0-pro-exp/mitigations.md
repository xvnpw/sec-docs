# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for airbnb/mavericks

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for State (Mavericks-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_state__mavericks-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Component Analysis:** For each component using a MavericksViewModel, determine the *minimum* set of state properties needed.
2.  **`selectSubscribe` / `select`:** Use Mavericks' `selectSubscribe` (for observing changes) or `select` (one-time read) to subscribe *only* to those specific properties.  *Do not* use `withState` to access the entire state object unless absolutely necessary (and carefully justified).  This leverages Mavericks' built-in selective subscription mechanism.
3.  **Refactor `withState`:**  Actively refactor existing components using `withState` to use `selectSubscribe` or `select` for granular access. This is a direct application of Mavericks' intended usage pattern.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintentional State Exposure/Leakage (Severity: High):**  Directly prevents components from accessing data they don't need, leveraging Mavericks' core functionality.
    *   **Unauthorized State Modification (Severity: Medium):** Indirectly mitigates by limiting the scope of potential damage, as components have a narrower view of the state.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unintentional State Exposure/Leakage:** Significantly reduces risk by design.
    *   **Unauthorized State Modification:** Moderate risk reduction.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `UserProfileViewModel` uses `selectSubscribe(UserState::userName)`.
    *   Location: `app/src/main/java/com/example/app/viewmodels/UserProfileViewModel.kt`

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `DashboardViewModel` uses `withState`. Refactor to use `selectSubscribe`.
    *   Location: `app/src/main/java/com/example/app/viewmodels/DashboardViewModel.kt`
    *   `SettingsViewModel` uses withState.
    *   Location: `app/src/main/java/com/example/app/viewmodels/SettingsViewModel.kt`

## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlled State Updates (Mavericks-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/controlled_state_updates__mavericks-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Encapsulated Updates:** Instead of directly exposing Mavericks' `setState` or `withState` to external callers, create specific functions *within the ViewModel* that perform state updates.  These functions act as controlled access points.
2.  **`internal`/`private` Access:** Make the `setState` and `withState` calls *within the ViewModel* `internal` or `private`. This is a key Mavericks-specific mitigation, preventing direct manipulation of these core functions from outside the ViewModel. This leverages Kotlin's visibility modifiers in conjunction with Mavericks' design.
3.  **Validation within Encapsulated Functions:**  Perform validation and authorization *before* calling `setState` inside these controlled functions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized State Modification (Severity: High):**  The primary defense, directly controlling access to Mavericks' state modification mechanisms.
    *   **Unintentional State Exposure/Leakage (Severity: Low):** Indirectly helps by promoting structured state management.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized State Modification:** Significantly reduces risk.
    *   **Unintentional State Exposure/Leakage:** Minor risk reduction.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `LoginViewModel` has `loginUser(username, password)` which internally calls `setState`.
    *   `setState` is often used directly from event handlers.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Refactor most ViewModels to use encapsulated update functions.
    *   Make `setState`/`withState` `internal`/`private`.
    *   Add validation to update functions.
    *   Review `ProductDetailViewModel`, `CheckoutViewModel`, `SearchViewModel`.
    *   Locations:
        *   `app/src/main/java/com/example/app/viewmodels/ProductDetailViewModel.kt`
        *   `app/src/main/java/com/example/app/viewmodels/CheckoutViewModel.kt`
        *   `app/src/main/java/com/example/app/viewmodels/SearchViewModel.kt`

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Mavericks' Asynchronous Handling](./mitigation_strategies/use_mavericks'_asynchronous_handling.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Asynchronous Operations:** Find all asynchronous operations in your ViewModels.
2.  **`async` and `awaitState`:**  Use Mavericks' `async` to initiate asynchronous tasks and `awaitState` to *safely* access and update the state *within* the asynchronous block. This is crucial for correct state management with asynchronous code in Mavericks.  This is the core Mavericks-specific aspect.
3.  **Error Handling:** Implement error handling within the `async` block, updating the state to reflect any failures.
4.  **Avoid Manual Threading:** Do *not* use manual threading; rely on Mavericks' provided mechanisms.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **State Synchronization Issues (Severity: Medium):** Prevents race conditions by using Mavericks' built-in asynchronous handling, which is designed for safe state updates.
    *   **Unauthorized State Modification (Severity: Low):** Indirectly mitigates by ensuring controlled and predictable state updates, even asynchronously.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **State Synchronization Issues:** Significantly reduces risk.
    *   **Unauthorized State Modification:** Minor risk reduction.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `NetworkViewModel` uses `async` and `awaitState`.
    *   Inconsistent usage; some asynchronous operations use Coroutines directly.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Refactor asynchronous operations to use `async` and `awaitState` consistently.
    *   Ensure proper error handling.
    *   Review `ImageUploadViewModel` and `DataSyncViewModel`.
    *   Locations:
        *   `app/src/main/java/com/example/app/viewmodels/ImageUploadViewModel.kt`
        *   `app/src/main/java/com/example/app/viewmodels/DataSyncViewModel.kt`
