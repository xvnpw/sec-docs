# Attack Surface Analysis for airbnb/mavericks

## Attack Surface: [Unintentional State Exposure](./attack_surfaces/unintentional_state_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data unintentionally included in the Mavericks state becomes accessible to any component with state access.
*   **How Mavericks Contributes:** Mavericks' centralized state management, and the ease of accessing the *entire* state from any component, significantly increases the risk of accidental exposure if not carefully designed. This is a direct consequence of the framework's core design.
*   **Example:** Storing a user's JWT (JSON Web Token) or API key directly in the Mavericks state after login. Any component could then read this token.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data (PII, authentication tokens, API keys), leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, and privacy violations.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if sensitive data like authentication tokens or PII is exposed) or **High** (if less sensitive, but still confidential, data is exposed).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Minimize State:** Store *only* the absolute minimum necessary data in the Mavericks state.
        *   **Separate Sensitive Data:** Store sensitive data *outside* of Mavericks state (e.g., secure cookies, HTTP-only cookies, dedicated secure storage, server-side sessions).
        *   **Granular State:** Design state to be as granular as possible.
        *   **Review State Design:** Thorough code reviews focusing on state contents.
        *   **Disable Debugging in Production:** Ensure Mavericks debugging tools are disabled in production.

## Attack Surface: [State Manipulation via Unvalidated Input](./attack_surfaces/state_manipulation_via_unvalidated_input.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious data through user input or API responses to modify the Mavericks state in unintended ways, bypassing intended application logic.
*   **How Mavericks Contributes:** Mavericks' action-based state updates provide a defined mechanism for changing state.  If the inputs to these actions are not rigorously validated, they become direct attack vectors. This is a direct consequence of how state updates are handled in Mavericks.
*   **Example:** An action that updates a `user.isAdmin` property in the state based on an unchecked URL parameter. An attacker could modify the URL to gain administrative privileges.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, data corruption, bypassing security controls, potentially leading to complete application compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if it allows privilege escalation or significant data manipulation) or **High** (if it allows less severe, but still impactful, data modification).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Rigorous input validation for *all* data used to update the Mavericks state, regardless of source. Use strong typing and validation libraries.
        *   **Sanitization:** Sanitize data *after* validation.
        *   **Whitelist Allowed Values:** Use whitelists to define allowed values for state properties.
        *   **Validate API Responses:** Treat API responses as untrusted.
        *   **Atomic State Updates:** Design state updates to be atomic.

## Attack Surface: [Component Exposure via State Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/component_exposure_via_state_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate the Mavericks state to force the rendering of components that should not be visible, exposing sensitive data or functionality.
*   **How Mavericks Contributes:** Mavericks' core principle of state-driven rendering directly links component visibility to the state.  Compromising the state compromises the intended visibility rules.
*   **Example:** A component displaying administrative controls is rendered only when `state.isAdmin` is true. An attacker manipulates the state to set this flag.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, unauthorized access to functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (if sensitive data or functionality is exposed).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Server-Side Authorization:** *Always* enforce authorization checks on the server-side, *regardless* of client-side state.  This is crucial.
        *   **Least Privilege for Components:** Components should only have access to necessary data.
        *   **Data Masking:** Mask or encrypt sensitive data in the state if it must be present.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Mavericks Version](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_mavericks_version.md)

*   **Description:** Using an outdated or vulnerable version of the Mavericks library itself.
*   **How Mavericks Contributes:** This is a direct vulnerability *of* the Mavericks library.
*   **Example:** A publicly disclosed vulnerability (CVE) in a specific Mavericks version allows for remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from data leakage to complete application compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** or **High** (depending on the CVE).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Keep Mavericks Updated:** Regularly update to the latest stable version.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use automated tools to scan for vulnerable dependencies.
