# Attack Surface Analysis for airbnb/mavericks

## Attack Surface: [State Injection](./attack_surfaces/state_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers manipulate the application's state by influencing initial state values or state updates, leading to unintended behavior or security breaches.

**How Mavericks Contributes:** Mavericks' central role in managing application state makes it a target for state injection attacks if the initialization or update mechanisms are not properly secured. If external data sources directly influence the state without validation before being passed to the `MavericksViewModel`, it becomes vulnerable.

**Example:** A deep link or a push notification payload contains malicious data that, when used to initialize a `MavericksViewModel`'s state, causes the application to perform an unintended action or display incorrect information.

**Impact:**  Data corruption, unauthorized actions, privilege escalation, or even remote code execution if the injected state controls critical application logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Input Validation: Thoroughly validate all external data before using it to initialize or update Mavericks state. This includes data from deep links, push notifications, and server responses.
* Immutable State: Design state objects to be immutable. This makes it harder to accidentally or maliciously modify the state after it's created.
* Controlled State Updates:  Ensure state updates are only performed through well-defined and controlled mechanisms within the `MavericksViewModel`, avoiding direct external manipulation.
* Principle of Least Privilege: Only store necessary data in the state. Avoid storing sensitive information that isn't actively required for the current view.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in State (Accidental or Intentional)](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_state__accidental_or_intentional_.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information is stored within the Mavericks state and becomes accessible through unintended means.

**How Mavericks Contributes:** Mavericks manages the application's state, and developers might inadvertently store sensitive data within this state. If this state is then logged, persisted without encryption, or exposed through debugging tools, it becomes a vulnerability.

**Example:**  A developer stores a user's API key directly in the `MavericksViewModel`'s state. This key is then inadvertently included in debug logs or is accessible through a memory dump of the application.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data, leading to identity theft, financial loss, or other privacy violations.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Minimize Sensitive Data in State: Avoid storing highly sensitive information directly in the Mavericks state if possible. Consider alternative secure storage mechanisms.
* Data Encryption: If sensitive data must be stored in the state, ensure it is properly encrypted at rest and in transit.
* Secure Logging Practices:  Implement secure logging practices that prevent the logging of sensitive data. Configure logging levels appropriately for production environments.
* Secure Debug Builds:  Ensure debug builds do not expose sensitive information unnecessarily. Use conditional logging and disable features that expose internal state in production builds.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via State Rendering](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_state_rendering.md)

**Description:**  Malicious scripts are injected into the application's state and then rendered in the UI without proper sanitization, leading to XSS attacks.

**How Mavericks Contributes:** If data from the Mavericks state is directly rendered in UI components (e.g., `TextView` in Android, `Text` in SwiftUI) without proper encoding or sanitization, it can become a vector for XSS attacks.

**Example:** User-generated content, fetched from a server and stored in the Mavericks state, contains a malicious `<script>` tag. When this content is displayed in the UI, the script is executed in the user's browser.

**Impact:**  Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, or defacement of the application's UI.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Output Encoding/Sanitization:  Always sanitize or encode data retrieved from the Mavericks state before rendering it in UI components. Use platform-specific mechanisms for this (e.g., HTML escaping in web views, appropriate text rendering in native views).
* Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement and enforce a strong Content Security Policy to restrict the sources from which the application can load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.
* Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential XSS vulnerabilities.
