# Threat Model Analysis for airbnb/mavericks

## Threat: [Unintended State Modification via Side Effects in `execute` Blocks](./threats/unintended_state_modification_via_side_effects_in__execute__blocks.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit poorly designed `execute` blocks that have unintended side effects beyond their intended purpose. For example, an `execute` block meant to fetch user data could inadvertently modify other parts of the application state due to a coding error or lack of proper isolation. The attacker might trigger this `execute` block through a seemingly benign user action or by manipulating input parameters if the execution logic depends on them.

**Impact:** The application state could become corrupted, leading to incorrect data being displayed, unexpected application behavior, or even security vulnerabilities if the modified state controls access or permissions.

**Affected Mavericks Component:** `execute` function within `MavericksViewModel`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully design `execute` blocks to ensure they only modify the intended parts of the state.
* Isolate side effects within specific functions or use-cases rather than directly within the `execute` block's state update logic.
* Thoroughly test `execute` blocks with various inputs and scenarios to identify unintended side effects.
* Consider using immutable data structures and the `copy()` function correctly to ensure state updates are predictable and controlled.

## Threat: [State Tampering via Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Saved State](./threats/state_tampering_via_deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_saved_state.md)

**Description:** If the application utilizes `SavedStateHandle` or a custom mechanism to persist the ViewModel's state across process death, an attacker could potentially tamper with the saved state data. If the deserialization process is vulnerable (e.g., using insecure deserialization libraries or not validating the integrity of the saved data), the attacker could inject malicious data or code that gets executed when the state is restored.

**Impact:** The application's state could be manipulated, leading to unexpected behavior, data corruption, or even remote code execution if the deserialized data is used in a vulnerable way.

**Affected Mavericks Component:** `SavedStateHandle` and the state persistence mechanism implemented by the application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use secure serialization libraries and configurations when persisting and restoring state.
* Implement integrity checks (e.g., using digital signatures or MACs) on the saved state data to detect tampering.
* Avoid deserializing untrusted data directly into the ViewModel's state without proper validation and sanitization.
