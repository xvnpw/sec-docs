### Mavericks High and Critical Threats

This document outlines potential security threats with high or critical severity that directly involve the use of Airbnb's Mavericks library in an application.

* **Threat: Unintended State Mutation**
    * **Description:** An attacker could potentially find ways to manipulate the application state managed by Mavericks outside of the intended `setState` mechanisms. This might involve exploiting race conditions in asynchronous updates or finding loopholes in how state updates are handled *within Mavericks' own logic*. For example, a flaw in Mavericks' internal state management could allow a carefully crafted sequence of events to corrupt the state.
    * **Impact:** This could lead to data corruption, inconsistent application behavior, privilege escalation, or even denial of service if the state is critical for the application's functionality.
    * **Affected Mavericks Component:** `BaseViewModel`, `MavericksState`, `setState` function, asynchronous state update mechanisms *within Mavericks*.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure state objects are immutable to prevent direct modification *within Mavericks' state management*.
        * Carefully manage asynchronous operations and their impact on state updates *within Mavericks' implementation*.
        * Thoroughly test state transitions and side effects *within Mavericks' lifecycle* to identify unexpected behavior.

* **Threat: Information Disclosure via State**
    * **Description:** Sensitive information might be stored within the application's state managed by Mavericks. An attacker could potentially find ways to access this state without proper authorization *due to vulnerabilities in how Mavericks manages or exposes state*. This could involve exploiting debugging features *within Mavericks* that inadvertently expose state information or finding flaws in how Mavericks handles state access.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, API keys, internal application details, or other confidential information. This can lead to privacy violations, identity theft, or further attacks.
    * **Affected Mavericks Component:** `BaseViewModel`, `MavericksState`, any mechanisms *within Mavericks* used for state persistence or debugging (if they expose state).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid storing highly sensitive data directly in the state if possible.
        * Implement proper access controls and data masking techniques for sensitive information within the state *at the application level, recognizing potential Mavericks-specific exposure points*.
        * Disable debugging features *within Mavericks if such options exist* and remove sensitive logging statements related to Mavericks state in production builds.

* **Threat: Vulnerabilities in Mavericks' Dependencies**
    * **Description:** Mavericks relies on other libraries and frameworks. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could indirectly affect applications using Mavericks. An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in these dependencies to compromise the application *through Mavericks' usage of those dependencies*.
    * **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. It could range from denial of service to remote code execution.
    * **Affected Mavericks Component:** The overall Mavericks library and its dependency tree.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific dependency vulnerability (can be Critical).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Mavericks and its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * Use dependency scanning tools to identify and monitor for known vulnerabilities in Mavericks' dependencies.
        * Follow security advisories for Mavericks and its dependencies.
