Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors:

High-Risk Path 1: Improper State Management leading to Data Exposure
- **Goal:** Access sensitive data by exploiting weaknesses in state management.
- **Attack Vectors:**
    - **State Corruption via Side Effects in Reducers:** An attacker injects or triggers malicious code within state reducers. This code manipulates the state to expose sensitive information or create a state where sensitive data is more easily accessible. This could involve modifying data structures, altering access flags, or introducing new state variables containing sensitive data.
    - **Insecure Handling of Sensitive Data in State:** Developers store sensitive information directly within the Mavericks state without proper encryption or access controls. An attacker, gaining access through debugging tools, logs, or other vulnerabilities, can directly read this sensitive data.
    - **Exposing Sensitive Data through ViewModel State:** The ViewModel, responsible for providing state to the UI, unintentionally exposes sensitive data. This could be due to over-sharing state, not properly filtering data, or including sensitive information in debugging representations of the state. An attacker can then access this data through UI inspection or by intercepting communication between the ViewModel and the UI.

High-Risk Path 2: Developer Misuse leading to Data Corruption/Breach
- **Goal:** Corrupt application data or gain access to sensitive information due to insecure development practices.
- **Attack Vectors:**
    - **Insecure Implementation of State Reducers:** Developers implement state reducers with vulnerabilities. This could include logic flaws allowing unauthorized state modifications, injection points for malicious code, or improper handling of user inputs leading to data corruption. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to directly manipulate the application's data or introduce malicious data.
    - **Insecure Data Handling in KMP Shared Code:** Vulnerabilities exist in the shared Kotlin code that Mavericks relies on. This could involve insecure storage of data, flaws in data processing logic, or vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by the shared code. An attacker exploiting these vulnerabilities can compromise data integrity or gain access to sensitive information that is shared across platforms.

Critical Nodes:

- **Compromise Application via Mavericks Exploitation:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a complete security failure related to Mavericks.
- **State Corruption via Side Effects in Reducers:** Successful exploitation at this node directly leads to compromised data integrity and potential application malfunction.
- **Insecure Handling of Sensitive Data in State:** This node represents a direct and easily exploitable vulnerability if sensitive data is not properly protected.
- **Exposing Sensitive Data through ViewModel State:** This node highlights a common developer oversight that can lead to unintended data exposure.
- **Insecure Implementation of State Reducers:** This node represents a critical point where developer errors can introduce significant vulnerabilities into the application's core logic.
- **Insecure Data Handling in KMP Shared Code:** This node represents a vulnerability in a shared component, potentially impacting multiple platforms and leading to widespread data compromise.
