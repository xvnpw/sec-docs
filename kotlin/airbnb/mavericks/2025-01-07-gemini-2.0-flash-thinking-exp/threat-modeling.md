# Threat Model Analysis for airbnb/mavericks

## Threat: [Unintended State Exposure](./threats/unintended_state_exposure.md)

**Description:** An attacker might gain access to sensitive data stored within a Mavericks ViewModel's state if the state is not properly scoped *within the Mavericks architecture* or if access controls *within Mavericks' state management* are insufficient. This could involve observing state changes through `withState` intended for specific UI components or accessing the ViewModel's state directly through *Mavericks' provided mechanisms* in unintended ways.

**Impact:** Confidential user data, application secrets, or other sensitive information could be exposed, leading to privacy breaches, identity theft, or unauthorized access to resources.

**Affected Mavericks Component:** ViewModel, `withState` function, state properties.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement proper scoping of state properties using `private` or `internal` modifiers as needed.
* Avoid exposing sensitive data directly in the ViewModel's public state.
* Carefully review where `withState` is used and ensure only necessary components have access to specific parts of the state.
* Consider using data masking or encryption for sensitive data within the state.

## Threat: [State Manipulation via Malicious Intents](./threats/state_manipulation_via_malicious_intents.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft and send malicious Intents to an Activity or Fragment hosting a Mavericks ViewModel, potentially triggering unintended state changes through the ViewModel's intent handling logic *provided by Mavericks*. This could involve manipulating data, bypassing business rules, or causing application errors *through Mavericks' state management*.

**Impact:**  The application's state could be corrupted, leading to incorrect behavior, data inconsistencies, or even application crashes. Attackers could potentially manipulate application logic to their advantage.

**Affected Mavericks Component:** ViewModel, `intent { }` builder, state reducers invoked by intents.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation within the ViewModel's intent handlers to sanitize and verify all data received through Intents.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when handling intents, only allowing necessary state changes based on validated intent data.
* Avoid directly mapping external input to state changes without proper validation.
* Consider using sealed classes or enums to define allowed intent actions and parameters.

## Threat: [Security Vulnerabilities in Custom State Reducers](./threats/security_vulnerabilities_in_custom_state_reducers.md)

**Description:** If developers implement custom state reducers *within a Mavericks ViewModel* with security flaws (e.g., improper input validation, logic errors), an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to manipulate the application state in harmful ways *through Mavericks' state update mechanism*.

**Impact:** Data corruption, bypassing business logic, or potentially gaining unauthorized access or control.

**Affected Mavericks Component:** ViewModel, custom state reducers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Apply secure coding practices when implementing custom state reducers, including thorough input validation and sanitization.
* Conduct code reviews of custom state reducer logic to identify potential vulnerabilities.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when designing state changes within reducers.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the Mavericks Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the_mavericks_library_itself.md)

**Description:** Like any software library, Mavericks itself might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure and denial of service to remote code execution.

**Affected Mavericks Component:** Entire Mavericks library.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (potential for Critical).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the Mavericks library updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
* Monitor security advisories and release notes for Mavericks.

## Threat: [Abuse of Mavericks Testing Utilities in Production](./threats/abuse_of_mavericks_testing_utilities_in_production.md)

**Description:** If Mavericks' testing utilities (e.g., mechanisms for directly setting state for testing purposes) are inadvertently included or accessible in production builds, an attacker could potentially use them to manipulate the application's state or behavior in unintended ways *by directly interacting with Mavericks components*.

**Impact:**  Application state could be altered maliciously, leading to incorrect behavior, data corruption, or the bypassing of security controls.

**Affected Mavericks Component:** Mavericks testing utilities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement proper build configurations to ensure that testing-specific code and utilities are excluded from production builds (e.g., using build flavors or conditional compilation).
* Avoid exposing internal state manipulation mechanisms in production code.
