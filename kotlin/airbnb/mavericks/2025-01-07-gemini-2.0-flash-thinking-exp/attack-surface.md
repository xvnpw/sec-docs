# Attack Surface Analysis for airbnb/mavericks

## Attack Surface: [Insecure State Serialization/Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/insecure_state_serializationdeserialization.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities arise when Mavericks state is serialized (e.g., for caching, debugging) and then deserialized without proper sanitization or validation. Maliciously crafted serialized data can be injected.

**How Mavericks Contributes:** Mavericks encourages the use of state objects that might be serialized for various purposes. If custom serialization is implemented without security considerations, it becomes an attack vector.

**Example:** An attacker intercepts serialized state intended for caching and modifies it to inject malicious code. Upon deserialization, this code is executed within the application's context.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, data corruption, application crash.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use secure serialization libraries and configurations.
* Avoid custom serialization if possible, relying on well-vetted libraries.
* Implement integrity checks (e.g., HMAC) on serialized data to detect tampering.
* Encrypt serialized data if it contains sensitive information.
* Regularly audit custom serialization logic for vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [State Manipulation via Debugging Tools in Production](./attack_surfaces/state_manipulation_via_debugging_tools_in_production.md)

**Description:**  Mavericks often integrates with debugging tools that allow inspection and modification of application state. If these tools are accessible in production environments without proper authorization, attackers can directly manipulate the application's state.

**How Mavericks Contributes:** Mavericks' architecture makes state easily inspectable and modifiable through its debugging integrations, which is beneficial for development but a risk in production.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to internal debugging endpoints or tools in a production app and modifies the state to grant themselves administrative privileges or bypass payment checks.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access, privilege escalation, data manipulation, financial loss.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Absolutely disable or restrict access to Mavericks debugging tools and endpoints in production builds.**
* Implement strong authentication and authorization for any state modification interfaces, even for internal tools.
* Use build configurations to ensure debug features are completely removed in release builds.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in State](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_state.md)

**Description:** Developers might unintentionally store sensitive information directly within the Mavericks state, making it potentially accessible through debugging tools, logging, or if the state is persisted.

**How Mavericks Contributes:** Mavericks' central state management makes it tempting to store all application data within the state, including sensitive information.

**Example:** API keys, user credentials, or personal identifiable information are stored directly in the ViewModel's state and become visible through debugging tools or are inadvertently logged.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive information, compliance violations.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Avoid storing sensitive data directly in the Mavericks state.**
* If sensitive data must be part of the state, encrypt it appropriately.
* Implement mechanisms to redact sensitive information from logs and debugging outputs.
* Regularly review the application's state structure to identify and address potential sensitive data exposure.

## Attack Surface: [Logic Errors in State Reducers Leading to Exploitable State Transitions](./attack_surfaces/logic_errors_in_state_reducers_leading_to_exploitable_state_transitions.md)

**Description:**  Flaws in the logic within Mavericks' state reducers can lead to unintended or insecure state transitions that attackers might exploit.

**How Mavericks Contributes:** Mavericks relies on reducers to update the state based on actions. Errors in this logic directly impact the application's behavior and security.

**Example:** A reducer incorrectly handles a specific action, allowing a user to bypass a required step in a workflow or grant themselves unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Unauthorized actions, privilege escalation, data manipulation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Implement thorough unit and integration tests for all state reducers, covering various input scenarios and edge cases.**
* Conduct code reviews of state reducer logic to identify potential flaws.
* Follow secure coding practices when implementing state transformations.
