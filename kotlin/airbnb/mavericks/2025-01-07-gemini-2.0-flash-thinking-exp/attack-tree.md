## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   OR Exploit Mavericks State Management Vulnerabilities
    *   AND Exploit State Inconsistency [HIGH RISK PATH]
        *   Exploit Race Conditions in State Updates
            *   Trigger concurrent state updates leading to unexpected state
        *   Bypass State Validation Logic
            *   Provide invalid data that is not properly validated by Mavericks or the application logic, leading to incorrect state
    *   AND Manipulate State Directly [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]
        *   Exploit Insecure State Persistence [CRITICAL NODE]
            *   Access and modify persisted state data if not properly secured (e.g., SharedPreferences without encryption)
        *   Exploit Debug/Testing Features in Production [CRITICAL NODE]
            *   Utilize debugging features (if enabled in production) to directly modify the application's state

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit State Inconsistency](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_state_inconsistency.md)

**1. High-Risk Path: Exploit State Inconsistency**

*   **Exploit Race Conditions in State Updates:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Mavericks uses Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous state updates. If not handled carefully, concurrent updates can lead to unexpected and inconsistent state. An attacker could trigger specific actions simultaneously to exploit these race conditions.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Data corruption, incorrect UI rendering, unexpected application behavior, potentially leading to further exploitable vulnerabilities.

*   **Bypass State Validation Logic:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Applications using Mavericks define state and often have validation logic. If this validation is flawed or incomplete, an attacker might be able to inject invalid data into the state, leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Incorrect application functionality, potentially leading to further exploitation by manipulating the application into an unintended state.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate State Directly](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_state_directly.md)

**2. High-Risk Path and Critical Node: Manipulate State Directly**

*   **Critical Node: Exploit Insecure State Persistence**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Mavericks often integrates with persistence mechanisms like SharedPreferences. If this persistence is not properly secured (e.g., data is stored in plain text), an attacker with access to the device could modify the persisted state directly, leading to application compromise upon restart.
    *   **Potential Impact:**  Critical - Data breaches by accessing sensitive information stored in the persisted state. Application takeover by modifying state values that control critical application logic or user authentication.

*   **Critical Node: Exploit Debug/Testing Features in Production**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If debugging features related to state management are inadvertently left enabled in production builds, an attacker might be able to access and manipulate the application's state directly, bypassing normal application logic.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Critical - Full application control, allowing the attacker to modify any aspect of the application's state and behavior, potentially leading to data exfiltration, unauthorized actions, or complete application takeover.
