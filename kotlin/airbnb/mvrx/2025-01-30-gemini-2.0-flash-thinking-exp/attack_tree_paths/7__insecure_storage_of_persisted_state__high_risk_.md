### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 7. Insecure Storage of Persisted State (High Risk)

This attack path focuses on the vulnerabilities arising from improper handling of persisted application state. When applications, including those using MvRx, persist state to maintain user sessions, application settings, or offline capabilities, insecure storage practices can expose sensitive data and compromise application security.

#### 4.1. Attack Vector 1: Exploiting the use of insecure storage locations for persisted state data.

**Description:** This attack vector targets the fundamental choice of storage location. Developers might inadvertently or unknowingly choose storage locations that are inherently insecure, easily accessible to unauthorized entities, or lack sufficient protection mechanisms.

**MvRx Context:** MvRx itself does not dictate *where* state should be persisted. Developers are responsible for implementing the persistence mechanism. This flexibility, while powerful, can lead to vulnerabilities if developers choose insecure options. Common insecure locations might include:

*   **Publicly accessible directories:** Storing state files in directories accessible to other applications or users on the system.
*   **Unprotected cloud storage (misconfigured):**  While not strictly local storage, if MvRx state is persisted to cloud storage with weak access controls, it falls under this category.
*   **Default, insecure platform storage:**  Using default storage mechanisms without considering security implications (e.g., default SharedPreferences on Android without encryption).

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine an MvRx Android application that persists user authentication tokens and personal preferences. If the developer naively stores this state in a file within the application's external storage directory (e.g., `/sdcard/MyApp/state.json`), this location is often world-readable on many Android devices. A malicious application or even a user with a file explorer could easily access and read this file, potentially stealing authentication tokens or sensitive personal information.

**Impact:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Sensitive state data, including user credentials, personal information, or application secrets, can be exposed to unauthorized parties.
*   **Data Tampering:**  Attackers might modify the persisted state to manipulate application behavior, bypass security checks, or inject malicious data.
*   **Privacy Violations:** Exposure of user data can lead to privacy breaches and regulatory compliance issues.
*   **Reputational Damage:** Security incidents resulting from insecure storage can severely damage the application's and the development team's reputation.

**Risk Level:** High. Choosing insecure storage locations is a fundamental flaw that can have widespread consequences.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Principle of Least Privilege for Storage:**  Always choose the most secure storage location available on the target platform.
*   **Utilize Platform-Specific Secure Storage:**
    *   **Android:**  Prioritize using Android's internal storage (`Context.getFilesDir()`, `Context.getCacheDir()`) which is private to the application. For sensitive data, strongly consider using the Android Keystore system or EncryptedSharedPreferences from the Jetpack Security library.
    *   **Web Browsers:**  Avoid storing highly sensitive data in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`. If necessary, encrypt data before storing it. Consider using browser's encrypted storage APIs if available and suitable.
    *   **Other Platforms:**  Research and utilize platform-specific secure storage mechanisms provided by the operating system or framework.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Periodically review the application's state persistence implementation to ensure secure storage locations are being used and that no insecure locations have been inadvertently introduced.
*   **Code Reviews:**  Implement code reviews to catch potential insecure storage location choices during development.

#### 4.2. Attack Vector 2: Accessing storage mediums where persisted state is stored in plain text or without adequate protection.

**Description:** Even if a relatively secure storage location is chosen, storing state data in plain text or without proper access controls within that location renders the storage effectively insecure.  Attackers who gain access to the storage medium (even if it's intended to be somewhat private) can easily read and potentially manipulate the data.

**MvRx Context:** MvRx itself does not enforce encryption or specific serialization formats for persisted state. Developers are responsible for how they serialize and store the state. If developers simply serialize MvRx state objects directly to plain text formats (e.g., JSON, XML) and store them without encryption, the data is vulnerable.

**Example Scenarios:**

*   **Reading unencrypted SharedPreferences on Android:** As mentioned in the attack tree example, default SharedPreferences on Android store data in XML files in the application's private directory. However, this data is *not* encrypted by default. On rooted devices, or through backup mechanisms, these files can be accessed and read in plain text. Even without root, vulnerabilities in the OS or other apps could potentially grant access.
*   **Accessing unencrypted browser local storage:** Browser `localStorage` stores data in plain text within the browser's profile directory. JavaScript within the same origin can access this data. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities or malicious browser extensions could exploit this to steal sensitive data from `localStorage`.
*   **Exploiting file system permissions on persisted state files:** If state is persisted to files, but file permissions are not correctly configured, unauthorized users or processes might be able to read the files. For example, if files are created with world-readable permissions (e.g., `chmod 644` on Linux/Unix-like systems in a shared directory), they become vulnerable.

**Impact:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:**  Plain text storage directly exposes sensitive data to anyone who gains access to the storage medium.
*   **Data Tampering:**  Plain text data is easily modified. Attackers can alter persisted state to manipulate application behavior or inject malicious content.
*   **Integrity Compromise:** The integrity of the persisted state is not protected, leading to potential application malfunctions or unexpected behavior if the state is tampered with.

**Risk Level:** High. Storing sensitive data in plain text is a critical vulnerability, even if the storage location is somewhat protected.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Encryption at Rest:**  Always encrypt sensitive data before persisting it, regardless of the storage location.
    *   **Choose Strong Encryption Algorithms:** Use robust and well-vetted encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256, ChaCha20).
    *   **Proper Key Management:** Implement secure key generation, storage, and retrieval mechanisms. Avoid hardcoding keys in the application. Utilize platform key management systems like Android Keystore or browser's Web Crypto API.
*   **Secure Serialization:**  Avoid serializing sensitive data directly into plain text formats. Consider using binary serialization formats or encrypting the serialized data.
*   **Access Control Mechanisms:**
    *   **File System Permissions:**  On file-based storage, set restrictive file permissions to ensure only the application process can access the state files.
    *   **Platform Storage APIs:** Utilize platform-provided secure storage APIs that offer built-in access control mechanisms (e.g., Android Keystore, EncryptedSharedPreferences).
*   **Data Minimization:**  Reduce the amount of sensitive data persisted. Only persist essential state and avoid storing highly sensitive information if it's not absolutely necessary.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities related to insecure state storage and access control.
*   **Code Reviews:**  Ensure that state persistence logic is thoroughly reviewed for security best practices, including encryption and access control.

#### 4.3. Specific Examples Breakdown:

**4.3.1. Reading state data from unencrypted shared preferences on Android.**

*   **Detailed Analysis:** Android SharedPreferences, while intended for application-private data, are stored in XML files in the application's data directory. By default, these files are *not* encrypted. Rooted devices, ADB access, or backup/restore mechanisms can allow access to these files. Malicious applications with sufficient permissions (or vulnerabilities in the OS) could also potentially access SharedPreferences of other applications.
*   **MvRx Specifics:** If an MvRx application uses SharedPreferences to persist state (e.g., using a custom `StatePersistor` implementation) and stores sensitive data in the MvRx state, this data will be vulnerable if SharedPreferences are not encrypted.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Use `EncryptedSharedPreferences`:**  The recommended solution is to use `EncryptedSharedPreferences` from the Android Jetpack Security library. This library provides a wrapper around SharedPreferences that automatically encrypts the data at rest using the Android Keystore system.
    *   **Key Management:** Ensure proper initialization and management of the encryption key used by `EncryptedSharedPreferences`.
    *   **Avoid Storing Highly Sensitive Data:**  If possible, avoid storing extremely sensitive data in SharedPreferences even with encryption. Consider more robust security mechanisms for highly critical secrets.

**4.3.2. Accessing local storage in a web browser where state is stored without encryption.**

*   **Detailed Analysis:** Browser `localStorage` (and `sessionStorage`) stores data in plain text within the browser's profile directory.  Any JavaScript code running within the same origin (domain, protocol, port) can access this data. This makes it vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. If an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into a web page, they can steal data from `localStorage`. Malicious browser extensions could also potentially access `localStorage` data.
*   **MvRx Specifics:** If a web application using MvRx persists state to browser `localStorage` without encryption, any sensitive data in the MvRx state becomes vulnerable to XSS and other browser-based attacks.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Avoid Storing Sensitive Data in `localStorage`:**  The best approach is to avoid storing highly sensitive data in `localStorage` altogether. Consider server-side session management or more secure browser storage options if available.
    *   **Encryption (Client-Side):** If sensitive data *must* be stored in `localStorage`, encrypt it client-side before storing it. However, client-side encryption alone is not a complete solution as the encryption key itself might be vulnerable if exposed in the JavaScript code.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy to mitigate XSS attacks, which are a primary threat to `localStorage` security.
    *   **Input Validation and Output Encoding:**  Thoroughly validate all user inputs and properly encode outputs to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Consider Browser's Encrypted Storage APIs:** Explore and utilize browser's encrypted storage APIs (if available and suitable) for more secure client-side storage.

**4.3.3. Exploiting file system permissions to read persisted state files.**

*   **Detailed Analysis:** If MvRx state is persisted to files on the file system, incorrect or overly permissive file permissions can allow unauthorized access. For example, creating files with world-readable permissions (e.g., `chmod 644`) or storing files in publicly accessible directories makes them vulnerable.
*   **MvRx Specifics:** If an MvRx application uses file-based persistence and the developer does not properly configure file permissions, the persisted state files could be accessible to other applications or users on the system.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Store Files in Application-Private Directories:**  Always store persisted state files in directories that are private to the application and not accessible to other applications or users.
        *   **Android:** Use internal storage directories (`Context.getFilesDir()`, `Context.getCacheDir()`).
        *   **Other Platforms:** Follow platform-specific best practices for application-private file storage.
    *   **Restrictive File Permissions:**  Set file permissions to be as restrictive as possible, allowing only the application process to read and write the state files. On Unix-like systems, this typically means setting permissions to `600` or `700`.
    *   **Regular Permission Checks:**  Periodically check and enforce file permissions to ensure they remain secure, especially after application updates or configuration changes.
    *   **Avoid Publicly Accessible Directories:** Never store persisted state files in publicly accessible directories like `/tmp`, `/sdcard` (on Android external storage), or user's home directories without careful consideration and strong access controls.
