## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise MvRx Application (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_mvrx_application__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** This is the ultimate goal, and all subsequent points are attack vectors leading to this compromise.  Successful exploitation of any of the vulnerabilities listed below can contribute to achieving this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit State Management Vulnerabilities (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_state_management_vulnerabilities__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Targeting weaknesses in how the application manages and updates its state using MvRx.
    *   Focusing on manipulating the application state to deviate from intended behavior.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities within ViewModels, state persistence mechanisms, or asynchronous state updates.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Manipulate Application State Directly (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/3__manipulate_application_state_directly__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Bypassing intended state update mechanisms and directly altering the application state.
    *   Focusing on vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized or unintended modifications to the state.
    *   Exploiting weaknesses in ViewModel actions or state persistence to achieve direct state manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Vulnerable ViewModel Actions (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/4__vulnerable_viewmodel_actions__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Targeting action handlers within ViewModels that are responsible for state updates.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the logic or input handling of these action handlers.
    *   Specifically focusing on input validation flaws and logic errors within ViewModel actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Input Validation Flaws in ViewModel Actions (High Risk)](./attack_tree_paths/5__input_validation_flaws_in_viewmodel_actions__high_risk_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Inject Malicious Data via UI Input (High Risk):**
        *   Crafting malicious input through the application's user interface.
        *   Submitting input that is not properly validated by ViewModel action handlers.
        *   Exploiting lack of input sanitization or type checking in ViewModel actions.
        *   Examples:
            *   Sending excessively long strings to cause buffer overflows (less likely in Kotlin/JVM but conceptually similar).
            *   Injecting special characters or control sequences that are not handled correctly.
            *   Providing data in unexpected formats that bypass validation logic.
    *   **Exploit Logic Flaws in ViewModel Actions (High Risk):**
        *   Identifying and exploiting logical errors in the code of ViewModel action handlers.
        *   Finding flaws in state transition logic, business rule enforcement, or authorization checks within actions.
        *   Examples:
            *   Race conditions in asynchronous operations within actions leading to incorrect state.
            *   Incorrect conditional logic allowing unauthorized state transitions.
            *   Bypassing authorization checks if they are implemented within the ViewModel action logic itself and are flawed.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. State Persistence Vulnerabilities (If Persisted) (Critical Node & High-Risk Path if Persistence Used)](./attack_tree_paths/6__state_persistence_vulnerabilities__if_persisted___critical_node_&_high-risk_path_if_persistence_u_6c8c2b63.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Targeting vulnerabilities related to how the application persists MvRx state (if it does).
    *   Focusing on weaknesses in storage mechanisms and serialization/deserialization processes.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Insecure Storage of Persisted State (High Risk)](./attack_tree_paths/7__insecure_storage_of_persisted_state__high_risk_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploiting the use of insecure storage locations for persisted state data.
    *   Accessing storage mediums where persisted state is stored in plain text or without adequate protection.
    *   Examples:
        *   Reading state data from unencrypted shared preferences on Android.
        *   Accessing local storage in a web browser where state is stored without encryption.
        *   Exploiting file system permissions to read persisted state files.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Deserialization Vulnerabilities (If Serialized) (High Risk)](./attack_tree_paths/8__deserialization_vulnerabilities__if_serialized___high_risk_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the process of deserializing persisted state data.
    *   If custom serialization/deserialization is used, targeting flaws in its implementation.
    *   Potentially injecting malicious serialized data to be deserialized by the application.
    *   Examples:
        *   If using custom deserialization logic, exploiting vulnerabilities like injection attacks if the deserialization process is not secure.
        *   Exploiting known vulnerabilities in serialization libraries if they are used incorrectly or are outdated.
        *   Attempting to provide maliciously crafted serialized data from external sources if the application deserializes data from untrusted origins.
