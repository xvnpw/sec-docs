# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Goal: To enhance the efficiency and maintainability of Android application development.
 - Goal: To improve the user experience of Android applications by ensuring consistent and predictable UI behavior.
 - Goal: To accelerate the development lifecycle for new features and updates in Android applications.
 - Priority: Focus on developer productivity and code quality in Android projects.
 - Priority: Ensure the stability and reliability of Android applications.

- Business Risks:
 - Business Risk: Potential learning curve for development teams adopting a new framework like MvRx.
 - Business Risk: Risk of introducing bugs or instability if MvRx is not implemented correctly.
 - Business Risk: Dependency on an open-source framework, which may have its own vulnerabilities or become unmaintained in the future.
 - Business Risk: Compatibility issues with other libraries or SDKs used in Android projects.
 - Business Risk: Performance overhead if MvRx is not used efficiently, impacting application responsiveness.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) - Implemented and described in company's internal security policies and development guidelines.
 - security control: Code Reviews - Implemented as part of the standard development workflow, using tools like GitHub pull requests.
 - security control: Dependency Management - Implemented using Gradle dependency management in Android projects, with potential for dependency scanning tools integrated into CI/CD pipelines.
 - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Potentially implemented using tools integrated into CI/CD pipelines to scan code for vulnerabilities.
 - security control: Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) - Potentially implemented as part of the QA and testing process, although less directly related to MvRx framework itself.
 - security control: Regular Security Updates - Implemented as part of the ongoing maintenance of Android applications and their dependencies.
 - accepted risk: Reliance on open-source components - Accepted risk inherent in using open-source libraries like MvRx, with the understanding that vulnerabilities may be discovered and need to be addressed.
 - accepted risk: Complexity of Android ecosystem - Accepted risk associated with the inherent complexity of the Android platform and its diverse ecosystem of devices and OS versions.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA) - Implement SCA tools to continuously monitor MvRx and its dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Integrate SCA into the CI/CD pipeline to fail builds on detection of high-severity vulnerabilities.
 - security control: Security Training for Developers - Provide specific training to Android developers on secure coding practices when using MvRx, focusing on state management and data handling within the framework.
 - security control: Automated UI Testing with Security Checks - Integrate automated UI testing frameworks with security checks to ensure that UI components built with MvRx are not vulnerable to common UI-related attacks (e.g., input injection through UI elements).
 - security control: Regular Penetration Testing - Conduct periodic penetration testing of Android applications that utilize MvRx to identify potential vulnerabilities in the application logic and UI implementation.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Requirement: Authentication is typically handled at the application level, outside of the MvRx framework itself. MvRx should not introduce any vulnerabilities that could compromise application authentication mechanisms.
  - Requirement: If MvRx is used to display or handle authentication tokens or credentials in the UI (which is generally discouraged), it must do so securely, avoiding storage in insecure locations or logging sensitive information.
 - Authorization:
  - Requirement: Authorization logic is also typically implemented at the application level. MvRx should not bypass or weaken application authorization controls.
  - Requirement: Ensure that UI components built with MvRx correctly reflect the user's authorization level and do not expose unauthorized data or functionality.
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement: MvRx is used to manage and display UI state, which often includes user inputs. Input validation should be performed at the application level, before data is passed to MvRx state management.
  - Requirement: UI components built with MvRx should be designed to handle invalid or unexpected input gracefully, preventing application crashes or unexpected behavior.
 - Cryptography:
  - Requirement: MvRx itself is not directly involved in cryptographic operations. However, if sensitive data is displayed or handled in the UI managed by MvRx, standard Android cryptographic APIs should be used for encryption and decryption at the application level.
  - Requirement: Avoid storing sensitive cryptographic keys or secrets within MvRx state or UI components. Use secure key storage mechanisms provided by the Android platform.
