# Threat Model Analysis for airbnb/mvrx

## Threat: [Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Data in State](./threats/accidental_exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_state.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might gain unauthorized access to the application's memory or persisted storage (if state persistence is used) and discover sensitive information directly stored within the MvRx state. This could occur through debugging tools on a compromised device, memory dumps, or insecure backups. The direct storage of sensitive data within the MvRx state increases the attack surface.
    *   **Impact:** Confidential information like API keys, user credentials, personal data, or business secrets could be exposed, leading to identity theft, financial loss, privacy violations, or reputational damage.
    *   **Affected MvRx Component:** The `MvRxState` interface implementation and the specific data classes used to represent the application's state within a `BaseMvRxViewModel`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive data directly in the MvRx state.
        *   Use dedicated secure storage mechanisms like the Android Keystore or encrypted SharedPreferences for sensitive information.
        *   Implement data masking or redaction for sensitive information when debugging.
        *   Regularly review the data included in the MvRx state to ensure no sensitive information is inadvertently present.

## Threat: [State Corruption Leading to Malicious Behavior](./threats/state_corruption_leading_to_malicious_behavior.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could potentially manipulate the application's state, either through vulnerabilities in the ViewModel logic *that directly modify the MvRx state* or by directly modifying persisted state (if insecure persistence is used). This manipulation leverages MvRx's central role in managing the application's truth.
    *   **Impact:** The application might perform unauthorized actions, display incorrect information, bypass security checks, or even crash, leading to data loss or service disruption. In severe cases, it could enable privilege escalation or remote code execution if the state controls critical functionalities.
    *   **Affected MvRx Component:** `BaseMvRxViewModel`, `setState` function, and any custom functions within the ViewModel that directly modify the state. Also affects any persistence mechanisms used in conjunction with MvRx.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within ViewModels before updating the state using `setState`.
        *   Ensure proper error handling in asynchronous operations to prevent state inconsistencies managed by MvRx.
        *   Use immutable data structures for the state to prevent accidental or unauthorized modifications via MvRx's state management.
        *   Securely implement any state persistence mechanisms, including encryption and integrity checks.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom ViewModel Logic Leading to Exploitation](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_viewmodel_logic_leading_to_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in the custom business logic implemented within MvRx ViewModels. This directly targets the logic that manipulates and reacts to the MvRx state. This could involve flaws in data processing, API interactions driven by state changes, or any other custom code that manipulates the state or performs actions based on the state.
    *   **Impact:** The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability. It could range from information disclosure and data manipulation to denial of service or even remote code execution if the ViewModel logic interacts with native code or external systems insecurely based on the MvRx state.
    *   **Affected MvRx Component:** Custom functions and logic within `BaseMvRxViewModel` implementations that interact with and modify the MvRx state.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Apply secure coding practices when developing ViewModel logic that interacts with the MvRx state.
        *   Perform regular security code reviews of ViewModel implementations.
        *   Implement proper input validation and sanitization within ViewModels before updating or reacting to the MvRx state.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting permissions or accessing resources within ViewModels based on the MvRx state.
