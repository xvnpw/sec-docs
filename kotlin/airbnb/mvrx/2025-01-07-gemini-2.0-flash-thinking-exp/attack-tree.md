# Attack Tree Analysis for airbnb/mvrx

Objective: Compromise application functionality or data by exploiting weaknesses within the MvRx framework.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
* Compromise Application Using MvRx Weaknesses
    * OR: Exploit State Management Vulnerabilities ***HIGH RISK PATH***
        * AND: Inject Malicious Data into State ***HIGH RISK PATH***
            * Exploit Insecure Data Handling in Reducers ***CRITICAL NODE***
    * OR: Exploit Information Disclosure via State ***HIGH RISK PATH***
        * AND: Access Sensitive Data in State ***HIGH RISK PATH***
            * Exploit Debugging Features in Production ***CRITICAL NODE***
    * OR: Exploit Vulnerabilities in MvRx's Asynchronous Handling ***HIGH RISK PATH***
        * AND: Cause Denial of Service through Async Operations ***CRITICAL NODE***
