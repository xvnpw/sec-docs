# Attack Surface Analysis for airbnb/mvrx

## Attack Surface: [Accidental State Exposure via Debugging Tools](./attack_surfaces/accidental_state_exposure_via_debugging_tools.md)

**Description:** Sensitive application state information is unintentionally exposed through MvRx's debugging features in production builds.

**How MvRx Contributes to the Attack Surface:** MvRx provides powerful debugging tools like `debugSubscribe` and state inspection capabilities that, if left enabled in production, can log or display internal application state, potentially containing sensitive data.

**Example:** A developer forgets to disable `debugSubscribe` in a release build. An attacker gains physical access to the device or uses developer tools to inspect logs and observes sensitive user data or API keys within the logged state changes.

**Impact:** Information Disclosure

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure debugging features like `debugSubscribe` and state inspection are strictly disabled in release/production builds.
* Utilize build configurations or conditional compilation to completely remove debugging code in production.
* Implement robust logging practices that avoid logging sensitive information, even in debug builds.

## Attack Surface: [Unintended Side Effects in `execute` Blocks with Security Implications](./attack_surfaces/unintended_side_effects_in__execute__blocks_with_security_implications.md)

**Description:** `execute` blocks within ViewModels perform actions with security implications, and improper handling of states or errors leads to vulnerabilities.

**How MvRx Contributes to the Attack Surface:** MvRx's `execute` DSL simplifies asynchronous operations. However, if these operations involve sensitive actions (like API calls with credentials), improper state management within the `execute` block can create risks.

**Example:** An `execute` block attempts to refresh an authentication token. If the API call fails and the error state is not handled correctly, the application might proceed with an expired token, leading to unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Unauthorized Access, Data Manipulation

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully manage the loading, success, and error states within `execute` blocks, especially for operations with security implications.
* Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms that do not expose sensitive information or lead to insecure states.
* Ensure that security-sensitive operations are only performed when the application is in a valid and authenticated state.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via State-Driven UI Rendering](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_state-driven_ui_rendering.md)

**Description:** User-provided data stored in the MvRx state is not properly sanitized before being rendered in the UI, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.

**How MvRx Contributes to the Attack Surface:** MvRx facilitates the flow of data from backend sources into the application state and then to the UI. If this data includes unsanitized user input, MvRx can indirectly contribute to XSS risks.

**Example:** A user's comment containing a malicious `<script>` tag is stored in the MvRx state and then rendered directly in a TextView without proper encoding, allowing the script to execute.

**Impact:**  Arbitrary Code Execution in the User's Browser (if a web view is involved), Session Hijacking, Data Theft

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement proper output encoding/escaping in the UI layer when rendering data derived from the MvRx state.
* Sanitize user input on the backend before it reaches the application state.
* Utilize UI frameworks' built-in mechanisms for preventing XSS.

## Attack Surface: [Logic Errors in State Management Leading to Insecure States](./attack_surfaces/logic_errors_in_state_management_leading_to_insecure_states.md)

**Description:** Flaws in the logic defining state transitions within ViewModels result in the application entering insecure or vulnerable states.

**How MvRx Contributes to the Attack Surface:** MvRx provides the framework for managing application state. Errors in the logic that updates this state can create security vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A bug in the state update logic for handling password changes allows a user to successfully "change" their password to an empty string without proper validation.

**Impact:** Unauthorized Access, Data Manipulation

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement thorough unit and integration tests for ViewModel logic, specifically focusing on state transitions and edge cases.
* Conduct code reviews to identify potential flaws in state management logic.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when updating state, ensuring only necessary changes are made.
