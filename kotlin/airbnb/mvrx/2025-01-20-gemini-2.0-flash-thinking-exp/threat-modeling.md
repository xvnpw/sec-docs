# Threat Model Analysis for airbnb/mvrx

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Unsecured State](./threats/information_disclosure_through_unsecured_state.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within the MvRx ViewModel's state by exploiting insecure logging practices, debugging tools, or by gaining access to the application's memory. This directly involves how MvRx manages and exposes state.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of confidential user data, API keys, authentication tokens, or other sensitive information, leading to privacy violations, account compromise, or further attacks.
    *   **Affected MvRx Component:** `BaseMvRxViewModel`, `MvRxState`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing highly sensitive data directly in the ViewModel's state.
        *   Implement secure logging practices, redacting or masking sensitive information before logging state changes.
        *   Disable debug logging in production builds.
        *   Utilize secure storage mechanisms (e.g., Android Keystore, Keychain) for sensitive data and only store references or identifiers in the MvRx state.
        *   Regularly review the data included in the ViewModel's state to ensure no unnecessary sensitive information is present.

## Threat: [Insecure State Persistence Leading to Data Exposure](./threats/insecure_state_persistence_leading_to_data_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might gain access to sensitive data persisted by MvRx if the persistence mechanism is not properly secured. This directly involves MvRx's state persistence features.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data stored in the persisted state, potentially accessible by other applications on the device or through physical access to the device.
    *   **Affected MvRx Component:** `persistState` function (if used), underlying persistence mechanisms (e.g., SharedPreferences).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Encrypt sensitive data before persisting it using appropriate encryption libraries.
        *   Avoid persisting highly sensitive information if possible.
        *   Choose secure persistence mechanisms provided by the platform (e.g., EncryptedSharedPreferences on Android).
        *   Implement appropriate access controls for the persisted data.

## Threat: [Side Effect Vulnerabilities Leading to External Attacks](./threats/side_effect_vulnerabilities_leading_to_external_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in the implementation of side effects triggered by ViewModels. This directly involves how MvRx facilitates asynchronous operations and state updates.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to external resources, denial of service attacks against external services, or other vulnerabilities stemming from insecure external interactions.
    *   **Affected MvRx Component:** `execute` blocks for side effects within `BaseMvRxViewModel`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Treat side effects as potential attack vectors and implement them with security in mind.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization before initiating any external actions within side effects.
        *   Securely configure and authenticate all external services used by the application.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when implementing side effects, such as avoiding hardcoding credentials and using parameterized queries.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in MvRx Library](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_mvrx_library.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might exploit known security vulnerabilities present in the MvRx library itself or its dependencies. This is a direct risk introduced by using the MvRx library.
    *   **Impact:** Applications using a vulnerable version of MvRx could be susceptible to various attacks depending on the nature of the vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected MvRx Component:** The entire MvRx library and its dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical, High, or Medium depending on the specific vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with the latest MvRx releases and security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to MvRx and its dependencies.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the MvRx library and its dependencies.
        *   Implement a process for promptly updating dependencies when security vulnerabilities are identified.
