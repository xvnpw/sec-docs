# Attack Surface Analysis for airbnb/mvrx

## Attack Surface: [Improper State Handling Leading to Data Exposure](./attack_surfaces/improper_state_handling_leading_to_data_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Logic errors within MvRx ViewModels can lead to sensitive data being unintentionally exposed in the application's state. This could involve displaying private information in the UI or making it accessible to other parts of the application.
*   **How MvRx Contributes:** MvRx's core functionality revolves around managing application state within ViewModels. If the logic within these ViewModels is flawed, it can directly result in incorrect or insecure state representation.
*   **Example:** A ViewModel responsible for displaying user profile information might incorrectly include the user's private email address in a publicly accessible state property, leading to it being displayed in the UI unintentionally.
*   **Impact:** Privacy breach, unauthorized access to sensitive information.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement thorough input validation and sanitization within ViewModel logic before updating the state.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when designing state, ensuring only necessary data is included in publicly accessible properties.
    *   Conduct rigorous code reviews focusing on state management logic within ViewModels.
    *   Utilize data masking or transformation techniques within ViewModels to prevent direct exposure of sensitive data in the UI.

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated Intent Parameters Triggering ViewModel Actions](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_intent_parameters_triggering_viewmodel_actions.md)

*   **Description:** If ViewModel actions are triggered by Intents or other external events without proper validation of the parameters passed, attackers could craft malicious Intents to trigger unintended actions or manipulate the application state.
*   **How MvRx Contributes:** MvRx ViewModels often react to events, including those originating from outside the ViewModel itself (e.g., via `setEvent`). If the data associated with these events isn't validated within the ViewModel, it becomes a potential entry point for malicious input.
*   **Example:** A ViewModel has an action to delete a user based on a user ID passed in an Intent. If this ID isn't validated, an attacker could craft an Intent with a different user ID, potentially deleting the wrong user.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized actions, potential privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation within ViewModel action handlers to verify the integrity and validity of all parameters received from external sources.
    *   Use type-safe mechanisms for passing data between components to reduce the risk of type mismatch vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using sealed classes or enums to restrict the possible values for certain parameters.
