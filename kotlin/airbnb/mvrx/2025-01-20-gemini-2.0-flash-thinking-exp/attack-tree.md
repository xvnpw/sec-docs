## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via MvRx Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_mvrx_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

* This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. It signifies successfully leveraging vulnerabilities within the MvRx framework to negatively impact the application. This could involve data breaches, unauthorized actions, denial of service, or other forms of compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit State Management Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_state_management_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

* This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in how MvRx manages the application's state. The core idea is to manipulate or corrupt the state to achieve the attacker's goals. This is a high-risk area because the state is central to the application's functionality and data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Unintended State Mutation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_unintended_state_mutation__critical_node_.md)

* This node represents the action of causing the application's state to change in a way not intended by the developers. This is a critical step towards compromising the application, as manipulating the state can directly affect the application's behavior and data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK STEP] Manipulate Input Data Leading to Malicious State](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_step__manipulate_input_data_leading_to_malicious_state.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides carefully crafted input data to the application. This input is processed by the ViewModel logic, and due to insufficient input validation or sanitization, it leads to the application's state being updated in a harmful or unintended way.
* **Example:**  Imagine an e-commerce app using MvRx to manage the shopping cart. An attacker might manipulate the quantity field of a product to a negative value. If the ViewModel doesn't properly validate this input, it could lead to incorrect calculations, negative stock levels, or even financial discrepancies.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Dependencies or Integrations (Indirectly via MvRx)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_dependencies_or_integrations__indirectly_via_mvrx_.md)

* This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in external libraries that are used by the ViewModels within the MvRx framework. The attacker doesn't directly target MvRx, but rather uses it as a conduit by exploiting weaknesses in its dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK STEP] Leverage Vulnerabilities in Libraries Used by ViewModels](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_step__leverage_vulnerabilities_in_libraries_used_by_viewmodels.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  ViewModels often rely on external libraries for various functionalities (e.g., networking, data parsing, image loading). If these libraries have known vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit them. The impact of this exploitation can then affect the application's state managed by MvRx.
* **Example:** A ViewModel uses a networking library with a known vulnerability that allows for remote code execution. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute malicious code within the application's context. This code could then directly manipulate the application's state, steal data, or perform other malicious actions. The MvRx framework itself isn't the direct target, but it's the context within which the vulnerable library is used, making it a relevant threat.
