* **Improper `setState` Usage Leading to State Exposure**
    * **Description:** Developers might unintentionally include sensitive data directly within the `MavericksState` or update the state with more information than necessary, making it accessible to all observers.
    * **How MvRx Contributes:** MvRx's core mechanism for state updates, `setState`, directly modifies the `MavericksState`. If developers are not careful about what data they put into the state, it becomes broadly available.
    * **Example:** A developer includes a user's raw, unencrypted password in the `UserState` during a login process, even temporarily. Any UI component observing this state could potentially access this sensitive information.
    * **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, potential for credential theft or misuse if the exposed data is sensitive.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid storing sensitive data directly in `MavericksState`.
        * Use data classes with appropriate visibility modifiers (e.g., `private`) for sensitive fields within the state.
        * Only update the necessary parts of the state. Avoid broad, unnecessary state updates.
        * Sanitize or encrypt sensitive data before including it in the state if absolutely necessary (though generally discouraged).

* **Vulnerabilities in Custom State Reducers**
    * **Description:** Custom logic within state reducers (used with `setState`) might contain security flaws, such as injection vulnerabilities or insecure data manipulation, allowing attackers to manipulate the state in unintended ways.
    * **How MvRx Contributes:** MvRx allows developers to define custom logic within `setState` using lambda functions. If this logic is not carefully implemented, it can introduce vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** A reducer that updates a user's profile takes user input directly and uses it in a database query without proper sanitization. An attacker could inject malicious SQL code through this input, potentially compromising the database.
    * **Impact:** Integrity compromise (state manipulation), potential for data breaches or application crashes depending on the vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization within state reducers.
        * Follow secure coding practices when writing reducer logic.
        * Avoid directly using user input in database queries or other sensitive operations without proper sanitization.
