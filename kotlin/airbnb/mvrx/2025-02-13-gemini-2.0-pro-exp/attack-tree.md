## Attack Tree Path: [[Manipulate Application State]***](./attack_tree_paths/_manipulate_application_state_.md)

*   **Description:** The overarching objective of the attacker.  Successful manipulation leads to a significant compromise of the application.
*   **Likelihood:** (Dependent on the success of sub-nodes)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** (Dependent on the success of sub-nodes)
*   **Skill Level:** (Dependent on the success of sub-nodes)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** (Dependent on the success of sub-nodes)

## Attack Tree Path: [[Exploit State Management Logic] (HIGH)](./attack_tree_paths/_exploit_state_management_logic___high_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks targeting the core of how MvRx manages the application's state. This is a high-risk area due to the prevalence of input vectors and the potential for logic errors.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [[Invalid State Transitions] (HIGH)](./attack_tree_paths/_invalid_state_transitions___high_.md)

*   **Description:** Attempts to force the application into an invalid or unexpected state, violating the intended state machine logic.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (with validation) / Medium (without)

## Attack Tree Path: [[Fragment Argument Passing] (HIGH)](./attack_tree_paths/_fragment_argument_passing___high_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting how arguments are passed to Fragments.  If arguments are used to initialize or update state and are not properly validated, an attacker can inject malicious data.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (with validation) / Medium (without)

## Attack Tree Path: [[ViewModel Initialization State] (HIGH)](./attack_tree_paths/_viewmodel_initialization_state___high_.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to Fragment arguments, but focusing on the initial state set up within the ViewModel. If this initial state is derived from external sources without validation, it's vulnerable.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (with validation) / Medium (without)

## Attack Tree Path: [[Fragment/ViewModel Subscription] (HIGH)](./attack_tree_paths/_fragmentviewmodel_subscription___high_.md)

*   **Description:** If external data sources are compromised, this becomes a high-risk path.
* Likelihood: Low to Medium
* Impact: High
* Effort: Medium
* Skill Level: Advanced
* Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [[Unintended State Updates] (HIGH)](./attack_tree_paths/_unintended_state_updates___high_.md)

*   **Description:** Triggering state updates that should not occur, or with incorrect data, even if the resulting state itself isn't inherently "invalid."
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (with validation) / Medium (without)

## Attack Tree Path: [[Bypass State Validation] (HIGH)](./attack_tree_paths/_bypass_state_validation___high_.md)

*   **Description:** Circumventing the validation logic that is intended to ensure the integrity of the application's state. This is *critical* because it removes a primary defense.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (if validation is good) / Medium (if weak)
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires code review and testing)
