# Threat Model Analysis for airbnb/mvrx

## Threat: [State Spoofing via Persisted State Manipulation](./threats/state_spoofing_via_persisted_state_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the device's storage and modifies the persisted MvRx state file. They alter values like `isLoggedIn`, `userId`, or permission flags to impersonate a legitimate user or gain elevated privileges. This directly exploits MvRx's persistence mechanism.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality; complete account takeover; bypassing security controls.
    *   **Affected MvRx Component:** `MvRxPersistedStateSaver` (or custom persistence implementation), `initialState` (during state restoration). This is a *direct* attack on MvRx's persistence feature.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **EncryptedSharedPreferences:** Use Android's `EncryptedSharedPreferences` to store the persisted state.
        *   **State Integrity Verification:** Implement a checksum or digital signature to verify the integrity of the loaded state. Reject the state and revert to a safe default if the checksum fails.
        *   **Minimal Persisted Data:** Persist only the *absolute minimum* necessary data. Avoid persisting sensitive tokens.
        *   **Key Management:** Securely manage encryption keys using the Android Keystore System.

## Threat: [State Tampering via Reflection/Debugging (Targeting MvRx State)](./threats/state_tampering_via_reflectiondebugging__targeting_mvrx_state_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uses debugging tools or reflection to *directly* modify the in-memory `MvRxViewModel`'s state object, bypassing MvRx's state update mechanisms (reducers). This is a targeted attack on the core of MvRx's state management.
    *   **Impact:**  Bypassing security checks; triggering unintended actions; data corruption; potentially gaining elevated privileges.
    *   **Affected MvRx Component:** `MvRxViewModel` (the state object itself). This is a *direct* attack on the in-memory state managed by MvRx.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immutability Enforcement:** Ensure strict immutability of the state object using Kotlin's `data class` and avoiding mutable collections. This makes modification *harder*, but not impossible.
        *   **Obfuscation and Anti-Tampering:** Use code obfuscation (ProGuard/R8) and anti-tampering techniques.
        *   **Root Detection:** Implement root detection and limit functionality or warn users on rooted devices.
        *   **Debuggable Flag:** Set `android:debuggable` to `false` in release builds.

## Threat: [State-Driven Privilege Escalation via Invalid State Transitions (Exploiting Reducers)](./threats/state-driven_privilege_escalation_via_invalid_state_transitions__exploiting_reducers_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a flaw *within* the application's MvRx reducers (`setState` logic) to transition the application into an invalid state that grants them higher privileges. This is a direct attack on the logic *within* the MvRx state update flow.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality; bypassing security controls.
    *   **Affected MvRx Component:** `MvRxViewModel` (reducers), `setState`. The vulnerability lies *within* the MvRx state update logic defined by the developer.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Comprehensive State Validation:** Implement thorough validation *within* the reducers. Ensure all state changes are valid and consistent.
        *   **Authorization Checks:** Perform authorization checks *before* allowing state changes that affect privileges. Base these on a secure source of truth, not solely on the MvRx state.
        *   **Finite State Machine (FSM):** Consider using an FSM pattern to explicitly define valid state transitions.
        *   **Testing:** Write comprehensive unit and integration tests to verify state transitions and prevent unauthorized changes.

## Threat: [State Leakage via Logging (Directly Logging State)](./threats/state_leakage_via_logging__directly_logging_state_.md)

*   **Description:** Developers accidentally log the *entire* MvRx `state` object to Logcat or a file, exposing sensitive data. This is a direct misuse of the MvRx state object.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data; privacy violations; aiding attackers.
    *   **Affected MvRx Component:** `MvRxViewModel` (the `state` object), any component that logs state information. The issue is the *direct* logging of the MvRx state.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Selective Logging:** *Never* log the entire `state` object. Log only specific, non-sensitive fields.
        *   **Logging Library with Redaction:** Use a logging library that allows filtering and redaction of sensitive data.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Enforce code reviews to prevent accidental logging of sensitive data.
        *   **Production Logging Configuration:** Configure logging levels appropriately for production.
