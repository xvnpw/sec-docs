## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicit Encryption of Persisted State (MvRx-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/explicit_encryption_of_persisted_state__mvrx-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify MvRx State:** Analyze all classes extending `MvRxState` and identify fields containing sensitive data.
2.  **Encryption Key Management:** Use the Android Keystore System for secure key generation and storage (symmetric encryption, e.g., AES).  Do *not* hardcode keys.
3.  **Override `persistState` Handling:**  The core MvRx-specific step.  Instead of directly using the default `persistState` behavior (which likely uses `SharedPreferences` or similar), you *must* intercept the persistence process.  This is best done by:
    *   Creating a custom base `MvRxViewModel` class that all your ViewModels inherit from.
    *   Overriding the mechanism MvRx uses to persist state. This might involve providing a custom implementation of the persistence logic, or wrapping the existing mechanism. The goal is to inject encryption *before* the data reaches the underlying storage.
    *   Within this overridden mechanism, encrypt sensitive fields *before* they are passed to the underlying persistence layer (e.g., `SharedPreferences`).
    *   Similarly, decrypt the fields *after* they are retrieved from the underlying persistence layer, but *before* they are used to populate the `MvRxState`.
4.  **Key Rotation:** Implement a mechanism for key rotation.
5.  **Transparent Handling:** The encryption/decryption should be transparent to the individual `MvRxViewModel` implementations.  They should interact with the state as usual, without needing to be aware of the encryption.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Improper State Persistence and Exposure (Severity: High):**  Directly addresses the risk of sensitive data in MvRx's `persistState` being exposed.
    *   **Unintentional State Exposure via Logging (Severity: Medium):**  Indirectly mitigates this, as the persisted (and potentially logged) data is encrypted.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Improper State Persistence and Exposure:** Reduces risk from High to Low.
    *   **Unintentional State Exposure via Logging:** Reduces risk from Medium to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: A custom base `MvRxViewModel` (`SecureMvRxViewModel`) overrides the persistence logic to encrypt/decrypt specific fields annotated with `@Sensitive`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Not all ViewModels inherit from `SecureMvRxViewModel`.
    *   Example: Key rotation is not yet implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [State Sanitization for Logging (MvRx-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/state_sanitization_for_logging__mvrx-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify `MvRxState` Classes:** Focus on classes extending `MvRxState`.
2.  **Create `toSafeString()` in Base Class:**  Add a `toSafeString()` method to a custom base `MvRxState` class (or interface) that all your state classes inherit from. This method should:
    *   Return a string representation of the state.
    *   Redact or omit sensitive fields.
    *   Provide a default implementation that can be overridden by subclasses.
3.  **Override `toSafeString()`:** In each specific `MvRxState` subclass, override `toSafeString()` to provide a tailored, safe representation of *that* state.
4.  **Integrate with MvRx Logging:** The crucial MvRx-specific part.  You need to ensure that MvRx's internal logging (when `debugMode` is enabled) uses your `toSafeString()` method. This likely requires:
    *   Examining the MvRx source code to understand how it logs state.
    *   Potentially creating a custom `MvRxViewModel` base class that overrides the logging behavior.
    *   Within the overridden logging, call `toSafeString()` on the state object *before* it's passed to the logging framework.
5.  **Disable `debugMode` in Production:**  Ensure `MvRxViewModel.debugMode` is *always* false in production builds.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintentional State Exposure via Logging (Severity: Medium):**  Specifically targets MvRx's state logging.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unintentional State Exposure via Logging:** Reduces risk from Medium to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: A base `SafeMvRxState` interface defines `toSafeString()`.
    *   Example: `debugMode` is disabled in production builds.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Not all `MvRxState` classes implement `toSafeString()` correctly.
    *   Example: The custom `MvRxViewModel` to integrate `toSafeString()` with MvRx's logging is not yet implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Correct Usage of `withState` and `setState` (MvRx-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/correct_usage_of__withstate__and__setstate___mvrx-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Code Review (MvRx Focus):**  Review all classes extending `MvRxViewModel`, paying *specific* attention to how the MvRx state is accessed and modified.
2.  **Enforce `withState`:**  *Every* read and modification of the state within RxJava streams *must* use the `withState` operator. This is a fundamental rule of MvRx.
3.  **Enforce `setState`:**  *Every* state update, regardless of whether it's inside an RxJava stream or not, *must* use the `setState` method provided by `MvRxViewModel`.  Direct modification of the state object is prohibited.
4.  **Training (MvRx Focus):**  Train developers specifically on the correct usage of `withState` and `setState` within the context of MvRx.  Emphasize the importance of these methods for thread safety and state consistency.
5. **Static Analysis (Optional):** Explore the possibility of using static analysis tools (e.g., custom lint rules) to automatically detect violations of the `withState` and `setState` rules.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Race Conditions in Async Operations (Severity: Medium):**  Directly addresses race conditions caused by improper state access within MvRx.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Race Conditions in Async Operations:** Reduces risk from Medium to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Most ViewModels follow the `withState` and `setState` rules.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: A recent code review specifically focused on `withState` and `setState` has not been conducted.
    *   Example: Static analysis rules to enforce these rules are not in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Comprehensive Error Handling in RxJava Streams (MvRx-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/comprehensive_error_handling_in_rxjava_streams__mvrx-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify MvRx ViewModels:** Focus on classes extending `MvRxViewModel`.
2.  **RxJava Streams within ViewModels:** Identify all RxJava streams *within* these ViewModels. These are the streams that interact with the MvRx state.
3.  **`onError` Handlers (MvRx Context):** Implement `onError` handlers for all RxJava subscriptions within the ViewModels. These handlers *must*:
    *   Log the error (using the sanitized logging approach from the previous strategy).
    *   Use `setState` to update the MvRx state to a safe and consistent state. This is the crucial MvRx-specific part. The error handler must interact with the MvRx state management system.
    *   Consider retrying (using `retry` or `retryWhen`) *if appropriate for the specific operation and state*.
4.  **`onErrorReturn` / `onErrorResumeNext` (MvRx Context):** Use these operators to provide default values or fallback streams, and then use `setState` to update the MvRx state accordingly.
5. **Fail-Safe State Updates:** Ensure that *even if an error occurs*, the MvRx state is transitioned to a well-defined, safe state. Avoid leaving the state in an inconsistent or undefined condition.
6. **Test MvRx Error Scenarios:** Write unit tests that specifically target the MvRx ViewModels and simulate error conditions to verify that the error handling logic correctly updates the MvRx state.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unhandled Exceptions in Async Operations (Severity: Medium):**  Focuses on how unhandled exceptions affect the MvRx state.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unhandled Exceptions in Async Operations:** Reduces risk from Medium to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Some ViewModels have basic `onError` handlers that update the state.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Not all RxJava streams within ViewModels have comprehensive error handling that interacts correctly with `setState`.
    *   Example: Thorough testing of error scenarios specifically within the MvRx context is lacking.
