## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Sensitive Data in MvRx State](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_sensitive_data_in_mvrx_state.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all data points being stored within MvRx state objects across the application.
    2.  Categorize each data point as either sensitive (e.g., PII, credentials, financial data) or non-sensitive.
    3.  For data identified as sensitive, evaluate if storing it in MvRx state is absolutely necessary. If not, avoid storing it in MvRx state and consider alternative, more secure handling methods outside of MvRx state management.
    4.  If storing sensitive data in MvRx state is necessary, implement sanitization techniques *immediately before* updating the MvRx state using `setState` or similar MvRx state update mechanisms. This includes:
        *   **PII Removal:** Remove personally identifiable information (PII) if it's not essential for the UI state managed by MvRx.
        *   **Masking/Redaction:** Mask or redact sensitive parts of data like credit card numbers, API keys, or passwords if they must be temporarily held in MvRx state for UI display (ideally, avoid storing passwords or API keys in MvRx state).
        *   **Encoding:** Encode data to prevent injection attacks if the MvRx state is used in contexts where injection is possible, such as displaying data in WebViews or constructing dynamic queries based on state.
    5.  Implement these sanitization steps within the ViewModel or the component responsible for updating the MvRx state, ensuring it happens before any MvRx state update function is called.
    6.  During code reviews, specifically verify that sanitization is consistently applied to all sensitive data being placed into MvRx state and that new state updates also incorporate sanitization where needed.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Exposure (High Severity) - Unauthorized access to sensitive data if MvRx state is inadvertently logged, persisted insecurely (if MvRx persistence is used), or accessed by malicious components within the application that observe the MvRx state.
    *   Injection Attacks (Medium Severity) - Exploiting unsanitized data in MvRx state to inject malicious code or data into other parts of the application, especially if MvRx state is used to render UI components like WebViews.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Exposure: Significantly Reduces - Sanitization minimizes the sensitive information present in MvRx state, reducing the impact of potential exposure through MvRx state mechanisms.
    *   Injection Attacks: Moderately Reduces - Encoding and sanitization can prevent certain types of injection attacks by neutralizing malicious payloads within the data held in MvRx state.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Unknown - Needs Assessment. Check ViewModels and components updating MvRx state for existing sanitization logic applied before `setState` calls, particularly for user inputs and API responses that become part of the MvRx state.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Needs Assessment. Review all ViewModels and components that update MvRx state. Identify areas where sensitive data is directly placed into MvRx state without sanitization. Focus on data sources that feed into MvRx state, such as user input fields, API responses, and any other data that could be considered sensitive and is managed by MvRx.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for MvRx State Access](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_mvrx_state_access.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Analyze the application's architecture and component dependencies in relation to MvRx state usage. Understand which components truly need to observe or modify specific parts of the MvRx state.
    2.  Utilize MvRx's state scoping mechanisms (if provided by the MvRx version and architecture in use) to limit the visibility of state to only those components that legitimately require it. Avoid making the entire application state globally and universally observable if not strictly necessary.
    3.  Structure MvRx state objects in a modular and granular way. Break down large, monolithic state objects into smaller, more focused units of state. This allows for finer-grained control over access and reduces the risk of unintended information disclosure through overly broad state observation.
    4.  When designing MvRx state access patterns, explicitly define which components should have read access (observe state changes) and which should have write access (update state) to specific parts of the MvRx state. Enforce these access controls through code structure, component design, and architectural patterns within the MvRx framework.
    5.  During code reviews, specifically examine MvRx state access patterns. Ensure that components are only observing and modifying the parts of the MvRx state they absolutely need and that state access is not unnecessarily broad, potentially exposing data to unintended parts of the application.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Exposure (Medium Severity) - Unintentional exposure of MvRx state data to components that do not require it, increasing the attack surface and potential for accidental or malicious data leaks within the application's MvRx state management.
    *   Data Integrity (Low Severity) - Reduced risk of unintended MvRx state modifications from components that should not have write access, contributing to overall application stability and data integrity within the MvRx state management system.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Exposure: Moderately Reduces - Limiting MvRx state access reduces the number of components that could potentially expose or misuse state data obtained through MvRx state observation.
    *   Data Integrity: Minimally Reduces - Contributes to better code organization within the MvRx framework and reduces the chance of accidental state corruption due to unintended modifications from components that should only be observing state.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Unknown - Needs Assessment. Review the application's architecture and MvRx state management patterns. Check how MvRx state is observed and updated across different components. Determine if state access is broadly available or if there are mechanisms in place (within the MvRx usage patterns) to restrict access to specific components. Examine how `withState` and state observation patterns are used in relation to component scopes.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Needs Assessment. Analyze the current MvRx state access patterns. Identify areas where MvRx state access is overly permissive. Explore if MvRx provides scoping mechanisms that can be utilized to restrict state visibility. If not, consider architectural refactoring within the MvRx framework to enforce clearer boundaries and reduce state coupling between unrelated components that interact with MvRx state.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Persisting Sensitive Data in MvRx State Persistence](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_persisting_sensitive_data_in_mvrx_state_persistence.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Determine if MvRx state persistence is enabled in the application. If so, identify all data currently being persisted by MvRx's state persistence mechanisms.
    2.  Categorize the persisted MvRx state data as sensitive or non-sensitive.
    3.  For data identified as sensitive within the persisted MvRx state:
        *   Critically evaluate if persisting this sensitive data through MvRx's persistence mechanism is absolutely necessary for the application's core functionality and user experience.
        *   If persistence of sensitive data via MvRx is not essential, disable persistence for the sensitive data within the MvRx state configuration or avoid including it in the parts of the MvRx state that are configured for persistence.
        *   If persistence of sensitive data is deemed necessary, *do not use MvRx's built-in state persistence for this sensitive data*. Instead, explore alternative secure storage solutions specifically designed for sensitive data persistence, such as Android Keystore or Encrypted Shared Preferences, *outside of the MvRx state persistence mechanism*.
    4.  Refactor the application to use these secure storage mechanisms for sensitive data persistence instead of relying on MvRx's state persistence for such data. Ensure that sensitive data is handled and persisted separately from the general MvRx state persistence.
    5.  Regularly review the data being persisted by MvRx to ensure no new sensitive data is inadvertently being persisted through MvRx's persistence features as the application evolves and MvRx state structures change.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Exposure (High Severity) - Sensitive data persisted insecurely by MvRx's persistence mechanism (e.g., in plain text files or unencrypted databases, depending on MvRx's persistence implementation) is vulnerable to unauthorized access if the device is compromised or if backups containing persisted MvRx state are not properly secured.
    *   Data Breach (High Severity) - If persisted MvRx state containing sensitive data is compromised, it could lead to a data breach, especially if it contains PII or credentials that were inadvertently persisted through MvRx's state persistence.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Exposure: Significantly Reduces - Avoiding persistence of sensitive data through MvRx's persistence mechanism eliminates a major attack vector related to insecure storage of sensitive information managed by MvRx.
    *   Data Breach: Significantly Reduces - Reduces the risk of a data breach originating from compromised persisted MvRx state that inadvertently contained sensitive user data.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Unknown - Needs Assessment. Determine if MvRx state persistence is enabled in the application. If so, identify what parts of the MvRx state are configured for persistence. Check the codebase for configuration related to MvRx state persistence and examine the types of data included in persisted MvRx state objects.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Needs Assessment. If MvRx state persistence is enabled and sensitive data is being persisted through it, refactor the application to prevent sensitive data from being included in the persisted MvRx state. Implement secure storage solutions like Android Keystore or Encrypted Shared Preferences for handling sensitive data that needs to be persisted across sessions, ensuring this sensitive data is managed and persisted *separately* from MvRx state persistence.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Serialization and Input Validation for MvRx State Persistence](./mitigation_strategies/secure_serialization_and_input_validation_for_mvrx_state_persistence.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  If MvRx state persistence is used, identify the serialization libraries used by MvRx for persisting and restoring state.
    2.  Ensure that the serialization libraries used by MvRx for state persistence are reputable, actively maintained, and have a strong security track record. Check for known vulnerabilities in the versions of these libraries used by MvRx and consider updating MvRx or the serialization libraries (if possible and applicable) to the latest secure versions.
    3.  If feasible, investigate if MvRx allows configuration to use more secure serialization libraries that are less prone to vulnerabilities, such as those that avoid dynamic class loading or arbitrary code execution during deserialization, for its state persistence mechanism.
    4.  Implement robust input validation whenever MvRx deserializes persisted state data during application startup or state restoration. This is crucial to protect against malicious or malformed persisted state data. Input validation should include:
        *   **Schema Validation:** Validate the structure and data types of the deserialized MvRx state data against an expected schema to ensure it conforms to the expected format defined by the MvRx state classes.
        *   **Data Range and Format Validation:** Validate that data values within the deserialized MvRx state fall within expected ranges and adhere to expected formats (e.g., date formats, numerical ranges, string lengths) as defined by the MvRx state properties.
        *   **Sanitization (Post-Deserialization):** After MvRx state is deserialized and restored, apply sanitization techniques (as described in the "Sanitize Sensitive Data in MvRx State" mitigation) to further protect against potential injection attacks or data exposure, even if the data originated from persisted MvRx state.
    5.  Regularly monitor security advisories for the serialization libraries used by MvRx for state persistence and promptly apply any necessary updates or patches to address newly discovered vulnerabilities in these libraries or in MvRx's usage of them.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Deserialization Attacks (High Severity) - Exploiting vulnerabilities in serialization libraries used by MvRx for state persistence to execute arbitrary code, gain unauthorized access, or cause denial of service when MvRx deserializes persisted state.
    *   Data Corruption (Medium Severity) - Malicious or malformed serialized MvRx state data could lead to data corruption within the application's MvRx state management or unexpected application behavior upon state restoration.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Deserialization Attacks: Significantly Reduces - Using secure serialization libraries for MvRx state persistence and implementing input validation during MvRx state deserialization significantly reduces the risk of deserialization attacks targeting MvRx's persistence mechanism.
    *   Data Corruption: Moderately Reduces - Input validation during MvRx state deserialization helps prevent data corruption and unexpected behavior caused by malformed or malicious persisted MvRx state data.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Unknown - Needs Assessment. Identify the serialization libraries used by MvRx for state persistence. Check MvRx documentation or source code to determine the serialization mechanism. Assess if input validation is performed by MvRx or the application after deserializing persisted state, especially when the application starts up and restores MvRx state from persistence.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Needs Assessment. Review the serialization library versions used by MvRx for state persistence and update if necessary. Implement input validation logic specifically for deserialized MvRx state data. This validation should be applied immediately after MvRx restores state from persistence and before the application starts using the restored MvRx state. Focus on schema validation, data type checks, and range/format validation of the deserialized MvRx state.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Logging Practices for MvRx State](./mitigation_strategies/secure_logging_practices_for_mvrx_state.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Review all logging statements in the application that involve logging MvRx state objects or parts of the MvRx state.
    2.  Identify logging statements that might inadvertently log sensitive data contained within MvRx state objects.
    3.  Modify logging statements to avoid logging sensitive data from MvRx state directly. Instead of logging entire MvRx state objects, log only relevant, non-sensitive information or sanitized versions of sensitive data derived from the MvRx state.
    4.  Implement log sanitization techniques specifically for logging MvRx state information:
        *   **Data Masking/Redaction in MvRx State Logs:** Mask or redact sensitive parts of data within MvRx state before logging (e.g., replace sensitive parts with asterisks or placeholders in log messages).
        *   **Selective Logging of MvRx State:** Log only specific, non-sensitive properties of the MvRx state object instead of logging the entire state.
        *   **Contextual Logging for MvRx State:** Log only the context or relevant identifiers related to the MvRx state change or observation, without logging the sensitive data payload itself.
    5.  Configure logging frameworks to securely store logs that might contain sanitized MvRx state information. Avoid storing logs in publicly accessible locations.
    6.  Restrict access to application logs that might contain MvRx state information to authorized personnel only. Implement access controls and audit logging for log access.
    7.  Regularly review logging practices related to MvRx state and log outputs to ensure that sensitive data from MvRx state is not being inadvertently logged in an unsanitized form and that logs containing MvRx state information are being handled securely.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Exposure (Medium Severity) - Sensitive data from MvRx state inadvertently logged can be exposed if logs are accessed by unauthorized individuals or systems. This is especially relevant if MvRx state is logged for debugging or monitoring purposes.
    *   Privacy Violations (Medium Severity) - Logging PII or sensitive user data from MvRx state can lead to privacy violations and regulatory non-compliance if these logs are not handled securely.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Exposure: Moderately Reduces - Secure logging practices for MvRx state minimize the risk of sensitive data exposure through logs that might contain MvRx state information.
    *   Privacy Violations: Moderately Reduces - Reduces the risk of privacy violations by avoiding logging of PII and sensitive user data from MvRx state in unsanitized logs.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Unknown - Needs Assessment. Review the codebase for logging statements that involve MvRx state. Check if sensitive data from MvRx state is being logged directly. Assess if log levels are used appropriately for MvRx state logging and if log storage and access are secured for logs containing MvRx state information.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Needs Assessment. Review all logging locations that involve MvRx state. Implement log sanitization techniques to mask or redact sensitive data from MvRx state in logs. Configure appropriate log levels to avoid logging sensitive details from MvRx state in production logs. Secure log storage and restrict access to logs that might contain MvRx state information to authorized personnel.
