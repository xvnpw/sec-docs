Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving the Facebook Android SDK, with high and critical risk severity:

*   **Access Token Theft/Exposure**
    *   Description: An attacker gains unauthorized access to a user's Facebook access token.
    *   How facebook-android-sdk contributes to the attack surface: The SDK handles the retrieval and storage of access tokens. If the application doesn't implement secure storage practices *after* the SDK provides the token, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   Example: An application stores the access token in `SharedPreferences` without encryption. Malware on the device reads this file and extracts the token.
    *   Impact: The attacker can impersonate the user, access their Facebook data, post on their behalf, and potentially access other services connected through Facebook Login.
    *   Risk Severity: Critical
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Use the Android Keystore system to securely store sensitive data like access tokens.
        *   Avoid storing access tokens in plain text or easily accessible locations like `SharedPreferences` without encryption.
        *   Implement proper session management and token revocation mechanisms.

*   **OAuth 2.0 Redirect URI Manipulation**
    *   Description: An attacker manipulates the redirect URI during the Facebook Login flow to intercept the authorization code.
    *   How facebook-android-sdk contributes to the attack surface: The SDK initiates the OAuth flow and relies on the application to correctly configure and validate the redirect URI. If the application's configuration is too broad or doesn't strictly validate the redirect, it's vulnerable.
    *   Example: An attacker registers a malicious application with a redirect URI that matches a loosely defined pattern in the legitimate app's configuration. When the user logs in, the authorization code is sent to the attacker's server.
    *   Impact: The attacker can obtain the authorization code and exchange it for an access token, gaining unauthorized access to the user's Facebook account.
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Strictly define and validate the redirect URI in the Facebook Developer Console and within the application.
        *   Avoid using wildcard characters or overly broad patterns in the redirect URI configuration.
        *   Use HTTPS for all communication during the OAuth flow.

*   **SDK Vulnerabilities (Third-Party Dependencies)**
    *   Description: Vulnerabilities exist in the third-party libraries used by the Facebook Android SDK.
    *   How facebook-android-sdk contributes to the attack surface: The SDK relies on other libraries. If these libraries have known vulnerabilities, they can indirectly expose the application.
    *   Example: A vulnerability is discovered in a networking library used by the Facebook SDK. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack.
    *   Impact: The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency but could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Keep the Facebook Android SDK updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Regularly review the release notes and changelogs of the SDK for security-related updates.
        *   Consider using tools that scan your application's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
