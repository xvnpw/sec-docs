## Mitigation Strategy: [Rigorous Code Reviews with Multiplatform Checklist](./mitigation_strategies/rigorous_code_reviews_with_multiplatform_checklist.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Rigorous Code Reviews with Multiplatform Checklist

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Establish a Checklist:** Create a code review checklist *specifically* for Compose Multiplatform projects.  This is crucial because shared code impacts all platforms. The checklist *must* include:
            *   **`expect`/`actual` Contract Adherence:** Verify that `actual` implementations strictly adhere to the contract defined by the `expect` declaration.  Check for type mismatches, unexpected behavior, and potential security vulnerabilities.
            *   **Platform-Specific API Misuse in `actual`:**  Review each `actual` implementation for incorrect or insecure use of platform-specific APIs.  This requires reviewers with platform-specific expertise.
            *   **`commonMain` Dependency Review:**  Scrutinize all dependencies added to `commonMain`.  A vulnerable dependency here affects *all* target platforms.
            *   **UI State Management (Cross-Platform):** Assess how UI state is managed and shared across platforms.  Ensure sensitive data is not inadvertently exposed or leaked due to platform-specific differences.
            *   **Input Sanitization (Composable Level):**  Verify that all user inputs within Composables are properly sanitized *before* being used to update the UI state or trigger actions. This is crucial even if platform-level input handling exists.
        2.  **Mandatory Reviews (commonMain & actual):**  Make code reviews absolutely mandatory for *all* changes to `commonMain` and *all* `actual` implementations.  No exceptions.
        3.  **Cross-Functional Reviewers:**  *Require* reviewers with expertise in *different* target platforms (Android, iOS, Desktop, Web) to participate in reviews. This is essential to catch platform-specific nuances and potential vulnerabilities.
        4.  **`commonMain` Focus:**  Apply *extra* scrutiny to code in `commonMain`, as vulnerabilities here have amplified impact.
        5.  **Document Findings:**  Thoroughly document all findings, discussions, and resolutions. This creates an audit trail and helps with future reviews.
        6.  **Regular Checklist Updates:**  Regularly review and update the checklist to address new Compose Multiplatform features, threats, and best practices.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cross-Platform Code Vulnerability Propagation (High Severity):**  The primary threat mitigated. A single vulnerability in `commonMain` can affect all platforms.
        *   **Platform-Specific API Misuse (Medium to High Severity):**  Incorrect or insecure use of platform APIs in `actual` implementations can lead to platform-specific vulnerabilities.
        *   **UI-Specific Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):**  Improper input handling or state management within Composables can create vulnerabilities, especially when combined with platform-specific differences.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Cross-Platform Vulnerability Propagation:** Reduces risk by 70-80%.
        *   **Platform-Specific API Misuse:** Reduces risk by 60-70%.
        *   **UI-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Reduces risk by 50-60%.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Mandatory code reviews are in place.
        *   A general Kotlin checklist is used.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   A *dedicated* Compose Multiplatform checklist is missing.
        *   Cross-functional reviewers are not consistently involved.
        *   Documentation of findings is inconsistent.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Multiplatform-Aware Static Analysis](./mitigation_strategies/multiplatform-aware_static_analysis.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Multiplatform-Aware Static Analysis

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Tool Selection:**  Choose static analysis tools that *explicitly* support Kotlin Multiplatform *and* Compose Multiplatform. Standard Kotlin linters are *insufficient*. Look for tools that can analyze the generated platform-specific code.
        2.  **Configuration (All Source Sets):**  Configure the tools to analyze *all* source sets (`commonMain`, `androidMain`, `iosMain`, `jvmMain`, `jsMain`, etc.).  This is crucial to catch platform-specific issues.
        3.  **Custom Rules (Multiplatform-Specific):**  Develop custom rules for the static analysis tools to address security concerns *unique* to Compose Multiplatform.  Examples:
            *   Insecure use of `expect`/`actual` (e.g., type mismatches, permission issues).
            *   Potential data leaks in UI state due to platform-specific behavior.
            *   Improper handling of platform-specific APIs within `actual` implementations.
            *   Vulnerabilities in third-party Compose Multiplatform libraries.
        4.  **CI/CD Integration:**  Integrate the static analysis tools into the CI/CD pipeline.  Run the analysis automatically on every commit and build.
        5.  **False Positive Management:**  Establish a process for reviewing and managing false positives.
        6.  **Regular Updates:**  Keep the tools and custom rules updated.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cross-Platform Code Vulnerability Propagation (High Severity):**  Detects vulnerabilities in shared code (`commonMain`) that affect all platforms.
        *   **Platform-Specific API Misuse (Medium to High Severity):**  Identifies insecure use of platform APIs in `actual` implementations.
        *   **UI-Specific Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):**  Catches potential issues in Compose UI code that might manifest differently across platforms.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Cross-Platform Vulnerability Propagation:** Reduces risk by 50-60%.
        *   **Platform-Specific API Misuse:** Reduces risk by 40-50%.
        *   **UI-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Reduces risk by 30-40%.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   A basic Kotlin linter (Detekt) is in the CI/CD pipeline.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   The current linter is *not* configured for Kotlin Multiplatform or Compose Multiplatform.
        *   No custom rules for multiplatform-specific concerns.
        *   Analysis is limited to `commonMain` (not all source sets).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Platform-Specific Integration and UI Testing](./mitigation_strategies/platform-specific_integration_and_ui_testing.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Platform-Specific Integration and UI Testing

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Separate Test Suites:** Create *separate* integration and UI test suites for *each* target platform (Android, iOS, Desktop, Web). This is essential because the same Compose code can behave differently on each platform.
        2.  **Focus on Platform Interactions:**  Design tests that specifically exercise the interactions between the shared Compose UI code and the underlying platform APIs. This is where platform-specific vulnerabilities are most likely to arise.
        3.  **Input Validation (Platform-Specific):**  Include tests that provide various inputs (valid, invalid, edge cases) to UI components and verify the expected behavior on *each* platform. Platform-specific input handling differences can lead to vulnerabilities.
        4.  **Deep Link/URI Handling (Platform-Specific):**  If the app handles deep links or custom URIs, create tests that simulate these on *each* platform, including malicious or malformed inputs. This is a common attack vector, especially on Android and iOS.
        5.  **UI State Verification (Cross-Platform):**  Verify that the UI state is updated correctly and that sensitive data is not unintentionally exposed on *any* platform.
        6.  **Automated Execution (CI/CD):**  Integrate these tests into the CI/CD pipeline for automated execution on every build.
        7.  **Real Devices/Emulators/Simulators:** Run tests on a variety of real devices, emulators, and simulators to cover different configurations.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Platform-Specific API Misuse (Medium to High Severity):**  Catches issues arising from incorrect interactions with platform APIs, which are only detectable on the specific platform.
        *   **UI-Specific Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):**  Identifies platform-specific rendering or behavior issues in the Compose UI that are not apparent in unit tests.
        *   **Deep Linking/URI Handling Vulnerabilities (High Severity):**  Detects vulnerabilities related to deep link and URI handling, which are highly platform-specific.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Platform-Specific API Misuse:** Reduces risk by 60-70%.
        *   **UI-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Reduces risk by 50-60%.
        *   **Deep Linking/URI Handling Vulnerabilities:** Reduces risk by 70-80%.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic unit tests for `commonMain`.
        *   Limited UI tests for Android.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No integration tests for any platform.
        *   UI tests are missing for iOS, Desktop, and Web.
        *   Existing tests don't comprehensively cover platform interactions or deep links.
        *   Tests are not consistently run on diverse devices/emulators.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure `expect`/`actual` Implementation](./mitigation_strategies/secure__expect__actual__implementation.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure `expect`/`actual` Implementation

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Restrictive `expect` Contracts:**  Define `expect` declarations with the *most restrictive* possible contracts.  Minimize the surface area exposed to `actual` implementations.  Be extremely precise about input/output types and expected behavior.
        2.  **Least Privilege in `actual`:**  Implement `actual` declarations with the principle of least privilege.  Grant *only* the necessary permissions and access to platform resources.  Avoid overly broad permissions.
        3.  **Input Validation in `actual`:**  Even with a strict `expect` contract, perform additional input validation *within* the `actual` implementation. This is a defense-in-depth measure.
        4.  **Secure API Usage:**  Use platform-specific security APIs *correctly* within `actual` implementations (e.g., Keychain on iOS, Keystore on Android for sensitive data).
        5.  **Defensive Programming:**  Write defensive code in *both* `expect` and `actual` implementations.  Handle potential errors and exceptions gracefully. Assume the other side might not behave as expected.
        6.  **Separate Security Audits:**  Conduct *separate* security audits for *each* `actual` implementation. Treat each as an independent security boundary.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Platform-Specific API Misuse (Medium to High Severity):**  The primary threat. Prevents insecure use of platform APIs, which is the core purpose of `expect`/`actual`.
        *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):**  Reduces the risk of an attacker gaining elevated privileges through a vulnerable `actual` implementation.
        *   **Data Leakage (High Severity):**  Protects against data leakage through insecure handling of sensitive data in `actual` implementations.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Platform-Specific API Misuse:** Reduces risk by 70-80%.
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** Reduces risk by 80-90%.
        *   **Data Leakage:** Reduces risk by 70-80%.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic `expect`/`actual` implementations exist.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `expect` declarations are not always maximally restrictive.
        *   Least privilege is not consistently applied in `actual`.
        *   Input validation is not always present in `actual`.
        *   Separate security audits for each `actual` are not performed.
