# Deep Analysis: Deserialization Issues in Compose Multiplatform Shared Code

## 1. Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the potential for deserialization vulnerabilities within the shared code of a Compose Multiplatform application, specifically focusing on the use of `kotlinx.serialization`.  We aim to:

*   Identify specific scenarios where deserialization vulnerabilities could arise.
*   Understand the nuances of how `kotlinx.serialization` handles different data types and structures.
*   Assess the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies and identify potential gaps.
*   Provide concrete recommendations for secure coding practices and library usage.
*   Determine the feasibility and impact of exploiting such vulnerabilities.
*   Develop a testing strategy to proactively identify and prevent deserialization issues.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on the following areas:

*   **Shared Code:**  Only code within the `commonMain` source set (or equivalent shared modules) of a Compose Multiplatform project is considered.  Platform-specific code is out of scope, *unless* it interacts directly with the shared code's deserialization processes.
*   **kotlinx.serialization:**  The primary focus is on the `kotlinx.serialization` library, as it's the recommended and most likely serialization library to be used in a Compose Multiplatform project.  If other serialization libraries are used in the shared code, they will be briefly considered, but the deep dive will remain on `kotlinx.serialization`.
*   **Untrusted Data Sources:**  We will analyze various potential sources of untrusted data, including:
    *   Network requests (HTTP responses, WebSocket messages, etc.)
    *   User input (although typically less direct in deserialization contexts)
    *   Inter-process communication (IPC)
    *   Data read from external storage (if shared code handles this)
    *   Data received from third-party libraries or SDKs.
*   **Data Formats:**  The analysis will consider common data formats used with `kotlinx.serialization`, such as JSON, Protobuf, and CBOR.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review:**  Manual inspection of the shared codebase to identify instances of `kotlinx.serialization` usage and potential data flow paths from untrusted sources.
*   **Static Analysis:**  Leveraging static analysis tools (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA's built-in inspections, Detekt, or specialized security-focused tools) to automatically detect potential deserialization vulnerabilities.
*   **Dynamic Analysis:**  Developing and executing test cases that feed crafted malicious payloads to the application to observe its behavior and identify exploitable vulnerabilities.  This includes fuzzing techniques.
*   **Library Analysis:**  Examining the `kotlinx.serialization` library's source code, documentation, and known issues to understand its security features and limitations.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Creating threat models to systematically identify potential attack vectors and assess the likelihood and impact of successful exploits.
*   **Best Practices Review:**  Comparing the application's code against established secure coding guidelines for deserialization.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface

### 4.1.  `kotlinx.serialization` Specifics

`kotlinx.serialization` is generally designed with security in mind, but vulnerabilities can still arise from improper usage.  Here's a breakdown of key areas:

*   **Polymorphic Deserialization:** This is the *highest risk area*.  `kotlinx.serialization` supports polymorphic serialization (serializing and deserializing objects of different classes based on a type discriminator).  If not configured carefully, an attacker could inject a malicious class name, leading to the instantiation and execution of arbitrary code.  The `@Serializable` annotation with `with = ...` on an interface or abstract class, and the use of `SerializersModule` are key indicators of polymorphic serialization.

    *   **Example (Vulnerable):**
        ```kotlin
        @Serializable
        sealed class Message

        @Serializable
        data class TextMessage(val text: String) : Message()

        @Serializable
        data class EvilMessage(val command: String) : Message() {
            init {
                // Execute arbitrary code here!  This is the vulnerability.
                Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command)
            }
        }

        // ... later, in deserialization code ...
        val message: Message = Json.decodeFromString(serializer(), untrustedJsonString)
        ```
        If `untrustedJsonString` contains a type discriminator indicating `EvilMessage`, the `init` block will execute.

    *   **Mitigation (Polymorphic):**
        *   **Sealed Classes/Interfaces:**  Use `sealed` classes or interfaces whenever possible.  This restricts the possible subclasses to those defined within the same file, providing a built-in allowlist.  This is the *best* defense.
        *   **`SerializersModule` with Explicit Registration:** If you *must* use open polymorphism (non-sealed classes), use a `SerializersModule` and *explicitly* register only the allowed subclasses.  *Do not* rely on automatic class discovery.
            ```kotlin
            val module = SerializersModule {
                polymorphic(Message::class) {
                    subclass(TextMessage::class)
                    // EvilMessage is NOT registered, preventing its instantiation.
                }
            }
            val format = Json { serializersModule = module }
            val message: Message = format.decodeFromString(Message.serializer(), untrustedJsonString)
            ```
        *   **Avoid `allowStructuredMap`:** Be very cautious with the use of `allowStructuredMap` in the `JsonConfiguration`. This can open up attack vectors if not used carefully.

*   **Data Validation:** Even with non-polymorphic deserialization, validating the *content* of the deserialized data is crucial.  `kotlinx.serialization` itself doesn't perform semantic validation.

    *   **Example (Vulnerable):**
        ```kotlin
        @Serializable
        data class UserProfile(val username: String, val age: Int)

        // ... later ...
        val profile: UserProfile = Json.decodeFromString(UserProfile.serializer(), untrustedJsonString)
        // No validation on profile.age!  Could be negative or excessively large.
        ```

    *   **Mitigation (Data Validation):**
        *   **`init` Block Validation:** Use the `init` block within your data classes to perform validation checks.
            ```kotlin
            @Serializable
            data class UserProfile(val username: String, val age: Int) {
                init {
                    require(age in 0..150) { "Invalid age: $age" }
                    require(username.isNotBlank()) { "Username cannot be blank" }
                }
            }
            ```
        *   **Custom Serializers:** For complex validation logic, create custom serializers that perform thorough checks during deserialization.
        *   **Validation Libraries:** Consider using a dedicated validation library (e.g., Konform) to define and enforce validation rules.

*   **Unexpected Data Types:**  Ensure that the expected data types match the actual data being deserialized.  For example, if you expect an integer but receive a string, `kotlinx.serialization` might attempt a conversion, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

    *   **Mitigation (Unexpected Types):**
        *   **Strict Mode:** Use strict mode in the `JsonConfiguration` (`isLenient = false`) to prevent unexpected type conversions.
        *   **Explicit Type Checks:**  If you need to handle different data types, use explicit type checks and handle each case appropriately.

* **Deeply Nested Structures:** Very deeply nested JSON or other structured data can lead to stack overflow errors during deserialization.

    * **Mitigation (Deep Nesting):**
        * **Limit Nesting Depth:** Configure a maximum nesting depth for your deserializer.  `kotlinx.serialization` doesn't have a built-in mechanism for this, so you might need to implement a custom solution (e.g., a pre-parser that checks the depth).
        * **Iterative Parsing:** For very large or deeply nested structures, consider using an iterative parsing approach instead of fully deserializing the entire structure at once.

* **External Libraries:** If your shared code uses external libraries that themselves perform deserialization, those libraries also become part of the attack surface.

    * **Mitigation (External Libraries):**
        * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan your project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check.
        * **Library Selection:** Choose well-maintained libraries with a good security track record.

### 4.2.  Untrusted Data Source Analysis

*   **Network Requests:** This is the most common and highest-risk source.  Any data received from a network request should be treated as untrusted.
*   **User Input:** While less direct, user input could influence the data that is eventually serialized and sent to another component, which then deserializes it.
*   **IPC:**  If your application uses IPC to communicate with other processes, the data received from those processes should be treated as untrusted.
*   **External Storage:** Data read from external storage (e.g., shared preferences, files) could have been tampered with by other applications.
*   **Third-Party Libraries/SDKs:**  Data received from third-party libraries or SDKs should be treated with caution, especially if the library's source code is not available for review.

### 4.3. Testing Strategy

A robust testing strategy is crucial for identifying and preventing deserialization vulnerabilities.  This should include:

*   **Unit Tests:**  Create unit tests that specifically target the deserialization logic with various valid and invalid inputs, including edge cases and boundary conditions.
*   **Integration Tests:**  Test the entire data flow, from the source of untrusted data to the point where it is deserialized and used.
*   **Fuzzing:**  Use fuzzing techniques to automatically generate a large number of malformed inputs and test the deserialization process for crashes or unexpected behavior.  Tools like `kotlinx-fuzzer` can be adapted for this purpose.
*   **Security Audits:**  Regular security audits, including penetration testing, should be conducted to identify potential vulnerabilities that might have been missed during development.

## 5. Recommendations

*   **Prioritize Sealed Classes/Interfaces:**  Use sealed classes or interfaces for polymorphic deserialization whenever possible. This is the strongest defense against class injection attacks.
*   **Explicitly Register Subclasses:** If you must use open polymorphism, use a `SerializersModule` and explicitly register only the allowed subclasses.
*   **Validate Deserialized Data:**  Always validate the content of deserialized data using `init` blocks, custom serializers, or validation libraries.
*   **Use Strict Mode:**  Enable strict mode in the `JsonConfiguration` (`isLenient = false`) to prevent unexpected type conversions.
*   **Limit Nesting Depth:** Implement a mechanism to limit the nesting depth of deserialized data.
*   **Regularly Scan Dependencies:**  Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:**  Implement a comprehensive testing strategy that includes unit tests, integration tests, fuzzing, and security audits.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the code performing the deserialization operates with the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the potential damage from a successful exploit.
* **Input Validation Before Deserialization:** If possible, perform some level of input validation *before* passing the data to the deserializer. This can help filter out obviously malicious payloads. This is a defense-in-depth measure.

## 6. Conclusion

Deserialization vulnerabilities are a serious threat to the security of Compose Multiplatform applications. By understanding the risks associated with `kotlinx.serialization` and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, developers can significantly reduce the likelihood of these vulnerabilities being exploited.  Continuous vigilance, thorough testing, and adherence to secure coding practices are essential for maintaining the security of applications that rely on deserialization.
