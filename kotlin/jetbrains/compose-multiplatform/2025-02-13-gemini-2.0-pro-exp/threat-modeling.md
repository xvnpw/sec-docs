# Threat Model Analysis for jetbrains/compose-multiplatform

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection in Shared UI Logic](./threats/malicious_code_injection_in_shared_ui_logic.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the source code repository or a dependency and injects malicious code into a shared Compose UI component (e.g., a custom `Composable` function responsible for rendering a form or handling user input).  The attacker could modify the component to subtly alter its behavior, such as redirecting a form submission to a malicious server or capturing user input without their knowledge. The key here is that the *shared* nature of the component propagates the attack across *all* target platforms.
    *   **Impact:** Data theft (credentials, personal information), phishing, execution of arbitrary code on user devices, application compromise.
    *   **Component Affected:** Shared Compose UI components (`Composable` functions, UI-related classes in the common module).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Code Reviews:** Mandatory multi-person code reviews for *all* changes to shared UI components, with a focus on identifying potential injection points.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Rigorous dependency audits, vulnerability scanning, and use of a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track and vet all dependencies.
        *   **Input Validation:** Rigorous input validation *within* the shared UI logic, specifically tailored to the expected data types and formats, to prevent injection attacks. This is *in addition* to any platform-specific validation.
        *   **Repository Access Control:** Strong access controls on the source code repository (MFA, principle of least privilege, audit logs).

## Threat: [Tampering with Platform-Specific `expect`/`actual` Implementations](./threats/tampering_with_platform-specific__expect__actual__implementations.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the source code and modifies the platform-specific implementation of an `expect`/`actual` declaration.  This is a *direct* Compose Multiplatform threat because it exploits the mechanism for platform-specific code. For example, if there's an `expect` function for secure storage, the attacker could alter the Android `actual` implementation to store data insecurely, while leaving the iOS implementation untouched.  This makes the attack harder to detect and leverages the cross-platform nature of the project.
    *   **Impact:** Data leakage, privilege escalation, platform-specific compromise (potentially affecting only *one* platform, making it insidious).
    *   **Component Affected:** Platform-specific modules containing `actual` implementations of `expect` declarations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Separate Code Reviews:** Treat `expect`/`actual` implementations as separate, high-risk components requiring *independent* code reviews, with reviewers possessing platform-specific security expertise.
        *   **Platform-Specific Security Expertise:** Ensure reviewers have in-depth knowledge of the security best practices and common vulnerabilities for *each* target platform.
        *   **Automated Testing:** Implement comprehensive automated tests that *specifically* target the `actual` implementations on *each* platform, including security-focused tests.
        *   **Runtime Checks:** If feasible, add runtime checks *within* the `actual` implementations to verify expected behavior and detect anomalies (e.g., checking for unexpected file permissions or API return values).

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Shared Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service_via_shared_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input or exploits a logic flaw in a *shared* Compose component (e.g., a function that processes data or performs calculations) to cause excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory, network).  The crucial point is that this flaw exists in the *shared* code, thus impacting *all* platforms simultaneously.  An example is a recursive Compose function without proper termination, leading to a stack overflow on all platforms.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability on *all* platforms, degraded user experience, potential data loss (if unsaved data is present).
    *   **Component Affected:** Shared Compose components (functions, classes) in the common module that handle data processing, network requests, or complex calculations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate *all* input within the shared code to prevent excessively large or malformed data from being processed, focusing on inputs that could trigger resource-intensive operations.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits (e.g., timeouts for network requests, memory allocation limits) *within the shared code* to prevent unbounded resource consumption.
        *   **Performance Testing:** Conduct regular performance and stress testing, specifically targeting the *shared* components, to identify potential resource exhaustion vulnerabilities *across all platforms*.
        *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in the shared code to gracefully handle unexpected conditions and prevent crashes due to resource exhaustion.
        *   **Asynchronous Operations:** Use asynchronous operations (coroutines) strategically within the shared code to avoid blocking the main thread and maintain responsiveness, even under heavy load.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Compose Multiplatform Libraries](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_compose_multiplatform_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** A third-party library used by the Compose Multiplatform project (either a core Compose library or a community-maintained library *specifically designed for Compose Multiplatform*) contains a vulnerability.  An attacker exploits this vulnerability to compromise the application.  The *direct* involvement is that the vulnerability affects *all* platforms due to the shared nature of the Compose Multiplatform ecosystem.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from data leakage to remote code execution, and crucially, affects *all* platforms.
    *   **Component Affected:** Any shared Compose component that uses the vulnerable library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the vulnerability, but the cross-platform impact elevates the risk)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use automated dependency scanning tools (e.g., Dependabot, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check) configured to specifically analyze the Compose Multiplatform project and its dependencies.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep all dependencies, including Compose Multiplatform itself and third-party libraries, up-to-date, paying close attention to security releases.
        *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists for Compose Multiplatform and its dependencies, focusing on vulnerabilities that affect multiple platforms.
        *   **SBOM:** Maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track all dependencies and their versions, enabling rapid identification of vulnerable components.

## Threat: [Insecure Data Transmission in Shared Network Logic (using Ktor or similar)](./threats/insecure_data_transmission_in_shared_network_logic__using_ktor_or_similar_.md)

*   **Description:** The *shared* Compose code handles network communication (e.g., making API requests using a multiplatform library like Ktor) but does not properly secure the data in transit. For example, it might use HTTP instead of HTTPS, or fail to validate server certificates *within the shared Ktor client configuration*. This affects *all* platforms using the shared networking logic.
    *   **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, data interception, data modification, affecting *all* platforms.
    *   **Component Affected:** Shared Compose components that perform network communication (e.g., using Ktor or other multiplatform networking libraries) within the common module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **HTTPS Enforcement:** *Always* use HTTPS for all network communication within the shared networking logic.
        *   **Certificate Pinning:** Implement certificate pinning *within the shared client configuration* to prevent MITM attacks using forged certificates. This is crucial to do in the *shared* code, not just platform-specific configurations.
        *   **Secure Network Libraries:** Use well-vetted and secure multiplatform networking libraries (e.g., Ktor) and ensure they are configured securely *within the shared code*.
        *   **Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data *before* transmitting it over the network, even if using HTTPS, within the shared logic. This adds an extra layer of protection.
