# Attack Surface Analysis for jetbrains/compose-multiplatform

## Attack Surface: [Kotlin/Native Interoperability Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/kotlinnative_interoperability_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** When interacting with platform-specific native code (e.g., using `expect`/`actual` or platform-specific APIs), vulnerabilities in the native code or the interop layer can be exploited.
    *   **How Compose-Multiplatform Contributes:** Compose encourages the use of Kotlin/Native for platform-specific implementations. This introduces the risk of vulnerabilities in the native code being exposed or triggered through the Compose layer.
    *   **Example:** A native iOS library used for a specific feature might have a buffer overflow vulnerability. If Compose passes unsanitized input to this library, it could trigger the overflow.
    *   **Impact:**  Memory corruption, crashes, arbitrary code execution, or privilege escalation depending on the nature of the native vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly audit and test all native code used in the application.
        *   Use secure coding practices in native code, including memory safety and input validation.
        *   Implement robust error handling and boundary checks when interacting with native code from Compose.
        *   Keep native dependencies updated with the latest security patches.
        *   Consider using safer interop mechanisms or wrappers where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Build and Dependency Management Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/build_and_dependency_management_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the Compose libraries themselves or their transitive dependencies can be exploited if not properly managed and updated.
    *   **How Compose-Multiplatform Contributes:** Compose relies on a set of libraries and dependencies managed through build tools like Gradle. Vulnerabilities in these components directly impact the security of the application.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in a specific version of the Kotlin compiler or a UI rendering library used by Compose could be exploited by an attacker if the application uses that vulnerable version.
    *   **Impact:**  Can range from denial of service to remote code execution, depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Compose Multiplatform and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
        *   Implement a secure software supply chain by verifying the integrity of dependencies.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Compose and its related libraries.
