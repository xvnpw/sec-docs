# Threat Model Analysis for jetbrains/compose-multiplatform

## Threat: [Inconsistent Input Validation Across Platforms](./threats/inconsistent_input_validation_across_platforms.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might craft malicious input that is not properly validated on one platform (e.g., iOS) due to platform-specific differences in input handling or rendering *within Compose Multiplatform's UI framework*, but is successfully blocked on another platform (e.g., Android). This allows the attacker to bypass security measures on the vulnerable platform due to inconsistencies in how Compose handles input across different targets.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, injection attacks (like XSS on web), unexpected application behavior, potential for privilege escalation if the unvalidated input is used in sensitive operations.
    *   **Affected Component:** Shared UI components *provided by Compose Multiplatform*, input fields, data processing logic within shared modules *interacting with Compose UI elements*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization within the shared Kotlin code, ensuring it's effective across all target platforms, paying close attention to how Compose handles input events and rendering on each platform.
        *   Perform platform-specific UI testing of input handling and validation logic within Compose components.
        *   Utilize platform-agnostic validation libraries where possible, ensuring compatibility with Compose's data binding and state management.
        *   Consider server-side validation as a secondary layer of defense.

## Threat: [Platform-Specific API Vulnerability Exposure Through Compose's `expect`/`actual`](./threats/platform-specific_api_vulnerability_exposure_through_compose's__expect__actual_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit a known vulnerability in a platform-specific API (e.g., a vulnerable networking library on Android) that is directly accessed through the `expect`/`actual` mechanism in the shared Compose Multiplatform code. This vulnerability, though not in the core Compose code itself, becomes exploitable due to *Compose's mechanism for platform-specific implementations*.
    *   **Impact:**  Depends on the nature of the underlying API vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure and denial of service to remote code execution on the affected platform.
    *   **Affected Component:** Platform-specific implementations (`actual` declarations) of shared interfaces or functions *defined within Compose Multiplatform modules*, particularly those interacting with system APIs or external libraries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the underlying API vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly audit and keep platform-specific dependencies and SDKs used in `actual` implementations up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when implementing platform-specific logic within `actual` declarations.
        *   Minimize the direct use of potentially vulnerable platform-specific APIs from shared code, abstracting them behind secure interfaces within the `expect` declarations.
        *   Regularly scan platform-specific dependencies used in `actual` implementations for known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Native Interoperability via Compose's Kotlin/Native Integration](./threats/insecure_native_interoperability_via_compose's_kotlinnative_integration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in native code (written in C++, Objective-C/Swift) that is integrated with the Compose Multiplatform application through *Compose's support for Kotlin/Native interop*. This could involve memory corruption bugs, insecure data handling, or other native code vulnerabilities exposed through the interop bridge.
    *   **Impact:**  Memory corruption, crashes, arbitrary code execution, data breaches, and potential compromise of the entire application or device.
    *   **Affected Component:** Kotlin/Native interop bridge *facilitated by Compose Multiplatform*, native libraries or code integrated with the application *through Compose's mechanisms*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Treat native code integrations with the same level of security scrutiny as external dependencies within the context of Compose Multiplatform.
        *   Conduct thorough security reviews and penetration testing of native components integrated with the Compose application.
        *   Implement secure coding practices in native code, including memory safety and input validation, paying attention to the data exchange with Kotlin/Native.
        *   Ensure secure data passing and communication between Kotlin and native code through the Compose interop layer.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Kotlin/JS Compiled Output Leading to Web Exploits](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_kotlinjs_compiled_output_leading_to_web_exploits.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities introduced during the compilation of shared Kotlin code to JavaScript (Kotlin/JS) *as part of the Compose Multiplatform build process for web targets*. This might involve issues in how the compiler handles certain Compose UI constructs or optimizations, leading to exploitable JavaScript code.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), arbitrary code execution in the user's browser, information disclosure, and other web-specific vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** Kotlin/JS compiler output *generated from Compose Multiplatform code*, JavaScript code generated from shared Kotlin code *used for the web target*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with the latest Kotlin and Kotlin/JS compiler versions, as updates often include security fixes relevant to Compose Multiplatform web targets.
        *   Follow secure coding practices in the shared Kotlin code, particularly when dealing with UI elements and data binding that will be translated to JavaScript by Compose.
        *   Implement standard web security measures like Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities in the Compose-generated JavaScript.
        *   Regularly audit the generated JavaScript code for potential security issues arising from the Compose compilation process.
