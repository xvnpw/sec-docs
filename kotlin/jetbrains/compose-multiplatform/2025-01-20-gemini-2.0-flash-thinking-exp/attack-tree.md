## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Platform-Specific Vulnerabilities Introduced by Compose](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_platform-specific_vulnerabilities_introduced_by_compose.md)

This path encompasses exploiting vulnerabilities that arise due to the way Compose Multiplatform interacts with and renders UI on different platforms. The risk is high because it targets the core functionality of the framework across multiple environments.

* **Target Android Platform -> Exploit Insecure Data Storage Practices Enabled by Compose [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Developers might misunderstand Android's secure storage mechanisms (like Keystore) and instead store sensitive data in easily accessible locations (e.g., plain text files in internal storage) believing Compose provides cross-platform security for this. An attacker gaining access to the device's file system (through other vulnerabilities or physical access) can then easily retrieve this sensitive data.
* **Target iOS Platform -> Exploit Insecure Data Storage Practices Enabled by Compose [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Similar to Android, developers might incorrectly assume Compose handles secure storage across platforms and bypass iOS's Keychain or other secure storage options, storing sensitive data insecurely. An attacker with access to the device's file system can then compromise this data.
* **Target Desktop Platform (JVM) -> Exploit File System Access Enabled by Compose [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Compose applications on desktop platforms have file system access. If the application doesn't properly validate or sanitize file paths provided by users or external sources, an attacker could potentially craft malicious paths to access sensitive files or directories outside the intended scope. This could lead to data breaches or privilege escalation if the accessed files contain sensitive information or executable code.
* **Target Web Platform (JS/Wasm):**
    * **Exploit Interoperability with Browser APIs -> Exploit Vulnerabilities in JS Interop Layer [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** The communication bridge between the Kotlin/Wasm code and JavaScript in the browser can be a point of vulnerability. If the interop layer doesn't properly sanitize data passed between the two, an attacker might inject malicious JavaScript code that gets executed in the user's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
    * **Exploit Compose-Specific Rendering Issues on Web -> DOM Manipulation Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Vulnerabilities in how Compose renders UI elements on the web could allow attackers to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM). By injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript through these vulnerabilities, attackers can alter the appearance or behavior of the web page, potentially leading to phishing attacks or the execution of malicious scripts.
    * **Exploit Compose-Specific Rendering Issues on Web -> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Compose Output [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** If user-provided data is not properly encoded or sanitized before being rendered in the Compose web application, an attacker can inject malicious script tags or attributes into the HTML output. When a victim's browser renders this output, the malicious script will execute, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting the user, or performing other harmful actions.
    * **Exploit WebAssembly (Wasm) Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** While less common, vulnerabilities can exist in the compiled WebAssembly code itself. These could be memory corruption bugs, logic errors, or other flaws that an attacker could exploit to gain control of the application's execution within the browser sandbox, potentially leading to code execution or other forms of compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Compose Multiplatform Libraries/Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_compose_multiplatform_librariesdependencies.md)

This path focuses on the risks associated with using third-party libraries and dependencies within the Compose Multiplatform project.

* **Exploit Vulnerability -> Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** If a dependency used by the Compose Multiplatform application has a known remote code execution vulnerability, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine or the server hosting the application. This is a critical vulnerability as it allows the attacker to gain complete control over the system.
* **Exploit Vulnerability -> Information Disclosure [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** A vulnerable dependency might expose sensitive information, either through direct access to data structures or through logging or error messages. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could gain access to confidential data, such as API keys, user credentials, or other sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Misconfigurations or Misuse of Compose Multiplatform Features](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_misconfigurations_or_misuse_of_compose_multiplatform_features.md)

This path highlights risks arising from incorrect usage or configuration of the framework's features.

* **Exploit Insecure Communication Between Platforms [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** If the application needs to transmit sensitive data between different platform implementations (e.g., Android and iOS versions), and this communication is not properly secured using encryption (like HTTPS or platform-specific secure communication channels), an attacker intercepting the network traffic could eavesdrop and steal the sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit the Build Process Specific to Compose Multiplatform](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_the_build_process_specific_to_compose_multiplatform.md)

This path targets the integrity of the application's build and deployment process.

* **Compromise the Kotlin/Native Compilation Process (iOS, Desktop) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:**  When building for iOS or native desktop platforms, Kotlin code is compiled to native code using Kotlin/Native. If an attacker can compromise the build environment or the compilation process itself, they could inject malicious code into the compiled binaries. This injected code would then run with the privileges of the application, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
* **Compromise the Gradle Build Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** The Gradle build configuration files define the dependencies and build tasks for the project. An attacker who gains access to and modifies these files could introduce malicious dependencies (which might contain vulnerabilities or malware) or add malicious build tasks that execute during the build process. This can lead to a supply chain attack, where the built application is compromised before it's even deployed.
