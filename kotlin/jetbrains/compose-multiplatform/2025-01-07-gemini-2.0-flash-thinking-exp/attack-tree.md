## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Build Process Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_build_process_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Code during Compilation
    *   Description: An attacker aims to insert malicious code into the application during the compilation process. This can be achieved by compromising build scripts or exploiting vulnerabilities in the Compose compiler plugin.
    *   Critical Node: Compromise Build Scripts (Gradle, etc.)
        *   Description: Attackers target the build scripts (e.g., Gradle files) to inject malicious logic. This allows them to manipulate the build process and introduce vulnerabilities.
        *   Critical Node: Modify Dependencies to Include Malicious Libraries
            *   Description: A key tactic within build script compromise. Attackers modify the dependency declarations to include malicious libraries, either replacing legitimate ones or adding new, harmful dependencies. This injects malicious code directly into the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Supply Malicious Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_supply_malicious_dependencies.md)

*   Attack Vector: Introduce Vulnerable or Backdoored Compose Libraries
    *   Description: Attackers attempt to introduce malicious dependencies into the project. This can involve using publicly available but compromised libraries or creating their own backdoored libraries that mimic legitimate ones.
    *   Critical Node: Introduce Vulnerable or Backdoored Compose Libraries
        *   Description: This node represents the successful introduction of a malicious or vulnerable library into the application's dependency tree. This can have severe consequences, depending on the nature of the malicious code or vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path (Conditional): Exploit Vulnerabilities in Kotlin/Native Interop Layer (if native interop is heavily used)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__conditional__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_kotlinnative_interop_layer__if_native_intero_c652a06d.md)

*   Attack Vector: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Kotlin/Native Interop Layer
    *   Description: When the application heavily relies on interoperability between Kotlin code and native iOS code (using Kotlin/Native), vulnerabilities in this layer can be exploited. These vulnerabilities might stem from incorrect memory management, unsafe data marshalling, or flaws in the Kotlin/Native runtime.
    *   Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Kotlin/Native Interop Layer
        *   Description: Successful exploitation here can lead to crashes, memory corruption, and potentially arbitrary code execution within the application's iOS component.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path (Conditional): Exploit Interoperability Layer Vulnerabilities (if native interop is used)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__conditional__exploit_interoperability_layer_vulnerabilities__if_native_interop_is_us_8fbfa103.md)

*   Attack Vector: Insecure Native Code Integration
    *   Description: If the application integrates with custom native code (using JNI on Android or Kotlin/Native on iOS), vulnerabilities in this integration can be exploited. This often involves flaws in the native code itself or insecure ways of passing data between the Compose layer and the native layer.
    *   Critical Node: Insecure Native Code Integration
        *   Description: This node represents a weakness in how the Compose Multiplatform application interacts with native code. This can be a significant point of vulnerability due to the inherent complexities and potential for memory safety issues in native languages.
        *   Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Manually Written Native Code (JNI, Kotlin/Native)
            *   Description: The most critical point within native code integration. Vulnerabilities in the custom-written native code (e.g., buffer overflows, format string bugs, use-after-free) can be directly exploited to gain control of the application or the underlying system.
