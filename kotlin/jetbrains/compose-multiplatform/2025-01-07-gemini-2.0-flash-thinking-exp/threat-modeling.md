# Threat Model Analysis for jetbrains/compose-multiplatform

## Threat: [UI Element Misinterpretation Across Platforms Leading to Unintended Actions](./threats/ui_element_misinterpretation_across_platforms_leading_to_unintended_actions.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might exploit subtle differences in how Compose Multiplatform renders UI elements or handles user interactions across different platforms (e.g., Android, iOS, Desktop, Web). This could lead to a situation where a UI element appears or behaves in a way on one platform that tricks the user into performing an action they did not intend when using the application on a different platform. For example, a button that looks disabled on one platform might be interactable on another due to inconsistencies in Compose's platform-specific rendering implementations.
*   **Impact:** Unintended actions by the user, potentially leading to data modification, privilege escalation within the application, or exposure of sensitive information, depending on the nature of the tricked action.
*   **Affected Component:** Compose UI rendering engine, platform-specific implementations within `compose-multiplatform`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rigorous cross-platform UI testing, specifically focusing on interaction behavior and visual consistency of key UI elements.
    *   Adhere to platform-agnostic UI design principles and patterns as much as possible within Compose.
    *   Utilize explicit state management and data binding to ensure UI elements accurately reflect the application's state regardless of the underlying platform.
    *   Consider using accessibility testing tools, which can sometimes highlight interaction inconsistencies across platforms.

## Threat: [UI Rendering Vulnerabilities Leading to Information Disclosure or Client-Side Injection](./threats/ui_rendering_vulnerabilities_leading_to_information_disclosure_or_client-side_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities within Compose Multiplatform's UI rendering engine itself could be exploited to inject malicious content or expose sensitive information. While not directly analogous to DOM-based XSS in web applications, flaws in how Compose handles specific UI constructs or data binding could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the rendered UI in unexpected ways. This could involve displaying data that should be hidden, injecting fake UI elements to phish for information, or even, in theory, executing limited code within the application's context if a severe rendering flaw exists.
*   **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive information displayed within the application's UI, potential for client-side phishing attacks within the application, or, in severe cases, limited code execution within the application's context.
*   **Affected Component:** Compose UI rendering engine core, platform-specific rendering implementations within `compose-multiplatform`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Compose Multiplatform libraries updated to the latest versions to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when handling user-provided data that influences the UI.
    *   Be cautious with complex or dynamic UI structures that might introduce unexpected rendering behavior.
    *   Report any suspected UI rendering vulnerabilities to the JetBrains team.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities within Compose Multiplatform Libraries Leading to Remote Code Execution or Denial of Service](./threats/vulnerabilities_within_compose_multiplatform_libraries_leading_to_remote_code_execution_or_denial_of_c73443ca.md)

*   **Description:**  Security vulnerabilities might be discovered within the core Compose Multiplatform libraries themselves (e.g., in the compiler plugin, runtime libraries, or platform integrations). An attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities if the application uses a vulnerable version of the framework. This could lead to remote code execution if a critical flaw exists in how Compose processes certain data or instructions, or denial of service if a vulnerability allows an attacker to crash the application or consume excessive resources.
*   **Impact:**  Remote code execution on the user's device, allowing the attacker to gain control of the system, or denial of service, making the application unusable.
*   **Affected Component:** Core Compose Multiplatform libraries, compiler plugin, runtime components.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediately update** to the latest stable version of Compose Multiplatform as soon as security updates are released.
    *   Monitor the JetBrains security advisories and release notes for any reported vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement a robust dependency management strategy to ensure timely updates of the framework.
    *   Consider using static analysis tools that can scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
