# Attack Surface Analysis for jetbrains/compose-multiplatform

## Attack Surface: [Kotlin/Native Interoperability Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/kotlinnative_interoperability_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Exploitation of weaknesses in the bridge between Kotlin code and platform-specific native code (C, Objective-C, Swift). This can involve memory corruption, type mismatch issues, or incorrect function call conventions.
    * **How Compose Multiplatform Contributes:** Compose Multiplatform relies on Kotlin/Native to interact with underlying operating system APIs and native UI components on different platforms. This interop layer introduces potential vulnerabilities if not handled carefully.
    * **Example:** A vulnerability in a native library called through Kotlin/Native within a Compose Multiplatform application could be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the target device.
    * **Impact:** Code execution, application crash, information disclosure, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly audit and test native code interactions within the Compose Multiplatform application.
        * Use memory-safe native libraries where possible when interacting through Kotlin/Native.
        * Employ secure coding practices in Kotlin/Native interop code (e.g., proper memory management, bounds checking).
        * Keep Kotlin/Native and related tooling updated to patch known vulnerabilities that could affect Compose Multiplatform projects.

## Attack Surface: [Compose UI Rendering Engine Exploits](./attack_surfaces/compose_ui_rendering_engine_exploits.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities within the Compose UI rendering engine itself, potentially leading to unexpected behavior, crashes, or information disclosure. This could involve crafted UI elements or interactions that trigger bugs in the rendering process.
    * **How Compose Multiplatform Contributes:** Compose Multiplatform uses a shared codebase for UI rendering, but the actual rendering is delegated to platform-specific implementations (e.g., Skia on desktop/Android, HTML Canvas on web). Bugs or vulnerabilities in these implementations or the shared Compose rendering logic can be exploited.
    * **Example:** A specially crafted SVG image rendered by a Compose Multiplatform web application could trigger a vulnerability in the browser's rendering engine or the Compose-to-HTML translation layer, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS).
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, UI corruption, potential for client-side code execution (especially on web), information disclosure (e.g., leaking data through rendering artifacts).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep Compose Multiplatform and its dependencies updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in the rendering engine.
        * Sanitize any user-provided data that influences UI rendering within the Compose Multiplatform application (e.g., text content, image URLs).
        * Implement input validation to prevent unexpected or malicious data from being processed by the Compose UI.
        * For web targets, adhere to web security best practices, including output encoding and Content Security Policy (CSP), to mitigate XSS risks arising from Compose rendering.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Chain Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_chain_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or SDKs that Compose Multiplatform or the application directly relies upon.
    * **How Compose Multiplatform Contributes:** Compose Multiplatform applications depend on various libraries, including Kotlin standard libraries and potentially other Compose-related libraries. Vulnerabilities in these direct dependencies can be exploited.
    * **Example:** A vulnerable version of a networking library used directly by a Compose Multiplatform application for making API calls could be exploited to perform man-in-the-middle attacks.
    * **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update all direct dependencies of the Compose Multiplatform application, including Compose Multiplatform itself and Kotlin.
        * Use dependency management tools (e.g., Gradle with dependency resolution strategies) to identify and manage vulnerable direct dependencies.
        * Employ software composition analysis (SCA) tools to scan for known vulnerabilities in the direct dependencies of the Compose Multiplatform project.

## Attack Surface: [Compose Web Specific Vulnerabilities (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/compose_web_specific_vulnerabilities__xss_.md)

* **Description:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities arising from improper handling of user input when rendering UI on the web platform using Compose Multiplatform.
    * **How Compose Multiplatform Contributes:** When targeting the web, Compose UI is translated into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If user-provided data is directly embedded into the rendered HTML by Compose without proper sanitization, it can lead to XSS attacks.
    * **Example:** A user-provided comment containing malicious JavaScript is rendered directly into the DOM by the Compose Multiplatform web application, allowing the script to execute in other users' browsers.
    * **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the application.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict output encoding/escaping for all user-provided data rendered in the Compose Multiplatform web UI.
        * Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources for the Compose Multiplatform web application.
        * Avoid directly injecting raw HTML strings into Compose UI elements in web applications.
        * Regularly review and test the Compose Multiplatform web application for XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Build Process and Artifact Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/build_process_and_artifact_manipulation.md)

* **Description:** Injection of malicious code or tampering with application artifacts during the build process of a Compose Multiplatform application.
    * **How Compose Multiplatform Contributes:** The build process involves compiling Kotlin code for different platforms. Vulnerabilities in the Kotlin compiler, Gradle plugins specifically used for Compose Multiplatform, or other build tools could be exploited to insert malicious code.
    * **Example:** A compromised Gradle plugin used in a Compose Multiplatform project could inject malicious code into the application's APK, IPA, or desktop executable during the build process.
    * **Impact:** Distribution of compromised applications, potential for widespread malware infection.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Secure the build environment and restrict access to build servers used for Compose Multiplatform projects.
        * Use trusted and verified build tools and Gradle plugins specifically designed for Compose Multiplatform.
        * Implement integrity checks for build artifacts produced by the Compose Multiplatform build process.
        * Regularly audit the build process and dependencies specific to Compose Multiplatform.
        * Employ code signing to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the application binaries built with Compose Multiplatform.
