## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Regularly Audit and Update Dependencies (Compose Multiplatform Focus)](./mitigation_strategies/1__regularly_audit_and_update_dependencies__compose_multiplatform_focus_.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Focus on Compose and Kotlin Ecosystem:** Prioritize auditing and updating dependencies within the Compose Multiplatform ecosystem, including:
        *   Compose UI libraries (e.g., `org.jetbrains.compose.ui:*`)
        *   Kotlin standard libraries and coroutines
        *   Platform-specific Kotlin libraries used in your multiplatform project.
    2.  **Utilize Dependency Scanning Tools:** Employ dependency scanning tools (like Gradle's dependency verification, OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk) configured to specifically monitor Kotlin and Compose Multiplatform dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    3.  **Automated Updates and Testing:**  Establish a process for automatically checking for updates to Compose Multiplatform and related libraries. Implement automated testing (UI and unit tests) to verify compatibility and security after updates before deploying changes.
    4.  **Monitor Compose Multiplatform Security Advisories:**  Actively monitor JetBrains' Compose Multiplatform release notes, security advisories, and community forums for announcements of security patches or recommended updates for Compose Multiplatform libraries.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks via Compose/Kotlin Ecosystem (High Severity):** Compromised or vulnerable Compose Multiplatform or Kotlin libraries can directly introduce vulnerabilities into your application across all platforms.
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Compose/Kotlin Framework (High Severity):** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated Compose Multiplatform or Kotlin libraries can lead to application compromise.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks via Compose/Kotlin Ecosystem (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk by proactively identifying and patching vulnerabilities within the core framework and its dependencies.
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Compose/Kotlin Framework (High Impact):** Substantially lowers the attack surface by ensuring the application uses the latest secure versions of Compose Multiplatform and Kotlin libraries.
*   **Currently Implemented:** *Example: Regular Kotlin and Compose library updates are part of the general dependency management process.*
*   **Missing Implementation:** *Example: No dedicated process to specifically prioritize and expedite security updates for Compose Multiplatform libraries.  Security advisories from JetBrains are not actively monitored as a dedicated task.*

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Verify Dependency Integrity (Compose Multiplatform Focus)](./mitigation_strategies/2__verify_dependency_integrity__compose_multiplatform_focus_.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Checksum and Signature Verification for Kotlin/Compose:** Ensure that your build system (e.g., Gradle) is configured to verify checksums (SHA-256 or stronger) for downloaded Compose Multiplatform and Kotlin dependencies from trusted repositories (like Maven Central, JetBrains Space).
    2.  **Dependency Lock Files for Compose Projects:**  Utilize dependency lock files (e.g., `gradle.lockfile`) specifically for Compose Multiplatform projects to guarantee consistent versions of Compose and Kotlin libraries across builds and prevent unexpected changes that could introduce compromised versions.
    3.  **Secure Repository Configuration:**  Strictly configure your dependency resolution to only use trusted and secure repositories for Compose Multiplatform and Kotlin dependencies. Avoid using untrusted or mirrors without thorough vetting.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Compose/Kotlin Dependencies (Medium Severity):** Mitigates the risk of using tampered Compose Multiplatform or Kotlin dependencies if checksum or signature verification is bypassed or compromised.
    *   **Accidental Corruption of Compose/Kotlin Libraries (Low Severity):** Protects against using corrupted Compose or Kotlin libraries due to download errors or repository issues.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Compose/Kotlin Dependencies (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk by adding a verification layer, relying on the security of checksum/signature infrastructure for Compose and Kotlin artifacts.
    *   **Accidental Corruption of Compose/Kotlin Libraries (Low Impact):** Effectively eliminates the risk of using corrupted Compose or Kotlin libraries.
*   **Currently Implemented:** *Example: Checksum verification is generally enabled in Gradle. Dependency lock files are used for some modules but not consistently for all Compose Multiplatform modules.*
*   **Missing Implementation:** *Example: Signature verification for Compose Multiplatform dependencies is not explicitly enforced. Dependency lock files need to be consistently applied across all Compose Multiplatform modules to ensure version consistency for framework libraries.*
