# Threat Model Analysis for jetbrains/compose-multiplatform

## Threat: [Platform API Misuse through Abstraction](./threats/platform_api_misuse_through_abstraction.md)

- **Description:** Attacker exploits vulnerabilities arising from incorrect or incomplete abstraction of platform-specific APIs by Compose Multiplatform. An attacker might leverage inconsistencies in API behavior across platforms to bypass security checks or gain unintended access. For example, file path handling differences could be exploited to access files outside intended directories.
- **Impact:** Data Breach, Privilege Escalation, Unauthorized Access, Data Modification.
- **Affected Component:** Compose Multiplatform Core Libraries (Abstraction Layer), Platform Interop APIs.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Thoroughly test application on all target platforms.
    - Carefully review and understand platform-specific API documentation.
    - Implement robust input validation and sanitization, especially when interacting with platform APIs.
    - Use platform-specific code where necessary to handle platform differences securely instead of relying solely on abstractions for security-sensitive operations.

## Threat: [Platform Rendering Engine Vulnerabilities](./threats/platform_rendering_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** Attacker exploits vulnerabilities in underlying platform rendering engines (e.g., Skia, native UI toolkits) used by Compose Multiplatform. An attacker could trigger crashes, denial of service, or potentially remote code execution by exploiting flaws in these engines through crafted UI elements or rendering instructions.
- **Impact:** Denial of Service, Remote Code Execution, Application Crash, UI Spoofing.
- **Affected Component:** Compose Desktop Runtime, Compose Android Runtime, Compose iOS Runtime, Compose Web Runtime, Skia Library, Platform UI Toolkits.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Keep Compose Multiplatform and its dependencies updated to the latest versions, including rendering engine libraries.
    - Monitor security advisories for underlying rendering engines (e.g., Skia).
    - Implement input validation to prevent rendering engines from processing malicious data.
    - Consider using sandboxing or isolation techniques to limit the impact of rendering engine vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Native Interop Vulnerabilities](./threats/native_interop_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** Attacker exploits vulnerabilities introduced through insecure or incorrect usage of native platform APIs from shared Kotlin code via Compose Multiplatform's interoperability mechanisms. An attacker could inject malicious code or data into native functions, leading to buffer overflows, injection attacks, or privilege escalation.
- **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Privilege Escalation, Data Breach, Denial of Service.
- **Affected Component:** `expect`/`actual` mechanism, Platform Interop APIs, Kotlin/Native Interop.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Carefully sanitize and validate all data passed to native functions.
    - Use secure coding practices when writing native code.
    - Minimize the use of native interop for security-sensitive operations if possible.
    - Implement robust error handling and input validation at the boundary between Kotlin and native code.
    - Regularly audit native interop code for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Bridge Vulnerabilities](./threats/bridge_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** Attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the bridge between Compose Multiplatform runtime and native platform components. This could involve flaws in data serialization/deserialization, communication protocols, or access control mechanisms within the bridge. An attacker might manipulate data in transit or bypass security checks in the bridge to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code.
- **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Privilege Escalation, Data Breach, Data Corruption.
- **Affected Component:** Compose Multiplatform Runtime, Platform-Specific Bridges (e.g., Kotlin/JS bridge, Kotlin/Native bridge).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Ensure secure serialization/deserialization practices are used in the bridge implementation.
    - Implement robust input validation and sanitization at bridge boundaries.
    - Regularly audit the bridge implementation for potential vulnerabilities.
    - Use secure communication protocols for data exchange between Compose runtime and native components.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Compose Multiplatform Dependencies](./threats/vulnerable_compose_multiplatform_dependencies.md)

- **Description:** Attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in dependencies used by Compose Multiplatform libraries. An attacker could leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in libraries like Kotlin, Compose UI libraries, or platform-specific dependencies to compromise applications using vulnerable versions.
- **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Data Breach, Denial of Service, Application Compromise.
- **Affected Component:** Compose Multiplatform Libraries (e.g., `org.jetbrains.compose.ui`, Kotlin Standard Library), Transitive Dependencies.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Regularly update Compose Multiplatform libraries and all dependencies to the latest versions.
    - Use dependency scanning tools to identify and remediate vulnerable dependencies.
    - Monitor security advisories for Compose Multiplatform and its dependencies.
    - Implement a robust dependency management process.
