# Attack Surface Analysis for jetbrains/compose-multiplatform

## Attack Surface: [Platform-Specific Renderer Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/platform-specific_renderer_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the underlying platform rendering engines (Skia, Android Views, UIKit) used by Compose Multiplatform to display UI.
*   **Compose Multiplatform Contribution:** Compose Multiplatform directly relies on these renderers, inheriting their vulnerabilities and potentially exposing applications to exploits through crafted UI content.
*   **Example:** A maliciously crafted SVG image, when rendered by Skia in a Compose Desktop application, triggers a buffer overflow leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, application crash, information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly update platform SDKs:** Keep the underlying platform SDKs (Skia, Android SDK, iOS SDK) updated to patch known renderer vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input validation and sanitization:** Sanitize and validate external resources (images, fonts, etc.) before rendering them in Compose UI to prevent injection of malicious content.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Utilize platform-specific sandboxing to limit the impact of renderer exploits.

## Attack Surface: [Interoperability Layer Weaknesses](./attack_surfaces/interoperability_layer_weaknesses.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities within Kotlin/Native, Kotlin/JS, and Kotlin/JVM interoperability layers, which bridge Kotlin code to platform-specific environments in Compose Multiplatform.
*   **Compose Multiplatform Contribution:** Compose Multiplatform's architecture heavily relies on these interoperability layers for platform access, making it vulnerable to flaws in these bridges.
*   **Example:** A memory corruption vulnerability in Kotlin/Native's interaction with native libraries is exploited through a Compose iOS application's native interop, allowing an attacker to gain control of the application process.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, memory corruption, denial of service, information disclosure, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Kotlin tooling updated:** Regularly update Kotlin and related tooling (Kotlin/Native, Kotlin/JS, Kotlin/JVM) to benefit from security patches in interoperability layers.
    *   **Secure native interop practices:** When using native interop, implement secure coding practices to prevent memory leaks, buffer overflows, and validate data passed between Kotlin and native code.
    *   **Minimize native interop:** Limit native interop usage to essential functionalities and explore safer alternatives where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Compose Compiler and Runtime Bugs](./attack_surfaces/compose_compiler_and_runtime_bugs.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities stemming from bugs or flaws within the Compose compiler and runtime environment itself.
*   **Compose Multiplatform Contribution:** As the core framework, any vulnerability in the Compose compiler or runtime directly impacts all applications built with Compose Multiplatform.
*   **Example:** A bug in the Compose compiler's optimization process introduces a vulnerability that allows crafting specific UI layouts causing a denial-of-service condition in the application runtime.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, unexpected application behavior, potential information disclosure, in rare cases, code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use stable Compose versions:** Utilize stable releases of Compose Multiplatform and avoid alpha/beta versions in production unless necessary and with thorough testing.
    *   **Monitor Compose issue trackers:** Stay informed about reported issues and security advisories related to Compose Multiplatform and apply updates promptly.
    *   **Thorough testing:** Conduct comprehensive testing, including UI and security testing, to identify potential runtime issues or unexpected behavior.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Compose Specific Libraries)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__compose_specific_libraries_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities present in external libraries and dependencies *specifically* used by Compose Multiplatform framework itself (e.g., Compose UI libraries).
*   **Compose Multiplatform Contribution:** Compose Multiplatform relies on a set of specific libraries, and vulnerabilities in these directly impact the security of applications.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in a specific version of a Compose UI library used for handling text input allows for injection of malicious code when processing user input in a Compose application.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, arbitrary code execution, denial of service, depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency scanning and management:** Regularly scan Compose Multiplatform dependencies for known vulnerabilities using dependency scanning tools.
    *   **Keep Compose dependencies updated:** Update Compose Multiplatform dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Principle of least privilege for dependencies:** Evaluate and minimize the number of Compose-specific dependencies used.

## Attack Surface: [JavaScript Interop Security (Compose Web Target)](./attack_surfaces/javascript_interop_security__compose_web_target_.md)

*   **Description:** Security risks associated with JavaScript interoperability when targeting the web platform with Compose Multiplatform, specifically related to how Compose Web interacts with the JavaScript environment.
*   **Compose Multiplatform Contribution:** Compose Web relies on Kotlin/JS and JavaScript interop, inheriting web application attack surfaces and introducing potential vulnerabilities in the bridge between Compose and JavaScript.
*   **Example:** User input in a Compose Web application is not properly sanitized before being passed to a JavaScript function for processing, leading to a JavaScript injection vulnerability and potential XSS.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), session hijacking, website defacement, redirection to malicious sites, information theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input sanitization and output encoding:** Sanitize all user inputs and encode outputs properly, especially when interacting with JavaScript, to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy to mitigate XSS and other web-based attacks in Compose Web applications.
    *   **Secure JavaScript interop practices:** Carefully review and secure any JavaScript code used in interop with Compose Web, ensuring proper validation and sanitization of data exchanged.

## Attack Surface: [Native Interop Security (Compose Native Targets)](./attack_surfaces/native_interop_security__compose_native_targets_.md)

*   **Description:** Security risks introduced by interoperating with native APIs and libraries on desktop, Android, and iOS platforms from Compose Multiplatform applications, specifically through Compose's native interop mechanisms.
*   **Compose Multiplatform Contribution:** Compose Multiplatform allows access to native platform functionalities, and insecure native interop within Compose applications can introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A Compose Android application uses native interop to call a native library with a known buffer overflow. This vulnerability is exploited through the Compose application's interop, leading to code execution on the Android device.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, memory corruption, denial of service, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure native library selection:** Use reputable and well-maintained native libraries. Conduct security audits of native libraries if possible.
    *   **Secure interop coding practices:** Follow secure coding practices when writing native interop code within Compose applications, focusing on memory management, data validation, and error handling.
    *   **Principle of least privilege for native access:** Limit the scope of native API access within Compose applications to only what is strictly necessary.
