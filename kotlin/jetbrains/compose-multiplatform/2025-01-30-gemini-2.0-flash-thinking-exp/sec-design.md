# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Compose Multiplatform project aims to provide a declarative UI framework that allows developers to share UI code across multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, desktop (JVM), and web, primarily using Kotlin.

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Enable cross-platform UI development: Reduce development time and costs by allowing code reuse across different platforms.
*   Enhance developer productivity: Provide a modern, declarative UI framework that is easy to learn and use, improving developer efficiency.
*   Expand the Kotlin ecosystem: Attract more developers to the Kotlin ecosystem by offering a compelling cross-platform UI solution.
*   Maintain performance and native look-and-feel: Ensure applications built with Compose Multiplatform perform well and integrate seamlessly with the native UI of each target platform.
*   Foster community adoption and growth: Build a strong community around Compose Multiplatform to ensure its long-term sustainability and evolution.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Security vulnerabilities in the framework: If vulnerabilities are discovered in Compose Multiplatform, applications built upon it could be vulnerable across all supported platforms, leading to widespread impact.
*   Performance issues: Poor performance of applications built with Compose Multiplatform could lead to negative user experiences and hinder adoption.
*   Platform compatibility issues: Inconsistencies or bugs across different target platforms could frustrate developers and limit the framework's usability.
*   Lack of community adoption: Insufficient community support and contributions could slow down development, bug fixing, and feature enhancements, potentially leading to project stagnation.
*   Supply chain compromise: If the build or distribution process of Compose Multiplatform is compromised, malicious code could be injected, affecting all users of the framework.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Open Source Codebase: The source code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny. Implemented: GitHub repository.
*   security control: Dependency Management: Uses Gradle for dependency management, allowing for control over included libraries. Implemented: build.gradle.kts files.
*   security control: Code Reviews:  Likely employs code review processes within the JetBrains development team. Implemented: Internal JetBrains development process.
*   security control: Static Analysis:  Likely uses static analysis tools as part of JetBrains' development practices. Implemented: Internal JetBrains development process.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on Third-Party Libraries:  The project depends on various third-party libraries, which may introduce vulnerabilities. Mitigation: Dependency scanning and updates.
*   accepted risk: Community Contributions:  While beneficial, community contributions need careful review to prevent malicious code injection. Mitigation: Thorough code review process for external contributions.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Automated Dependency Scanning: Implement automated scanning of dependencies for known vulnerabilities in the CI/CD pipeline.
*   security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Integrate SCA tools to identify and manage open-source components and their associated risks.
*   security control: Regular Security Audits: Conduct periodic security audits of the codebase by internal or external security experts.
*   security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Program: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Secure Build Pipeline: Harden the build pipeline to prevent tampering and ensure the integrity of build artifacts.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable to the framework itself. Authentication is a concern for applications built using Compose Multiplatform. Applications should use secure authentication mechanisms appropriate for their target platforms and use cases.
*   Authorization: Not directly applicable to the framework itself. Authorization is a concern for applications built using Compose Multiplatform. Applications should implement robust authorization mechanisms to control access to resources and functionalities.
*   Input Validation: Compose Multiplatform framework should encourage and facilitate secure input handling in applications built with it. The framework itself should be resilient to malformed inputs where applicable (e.g., in resource loading, configuration parsing). Applications built with Compose Multiplatform must implement thorough input validation to prevent vulnerabilities like injection attacks.
*   Cryptography: Compose Multiplatform framework might utilize cryptography for secure storage or communication in specific scenarios (e.g., handling resources, network requests). Applications built with Compose Multiplatform may need to implement cryptography for data protection. The framework should not introduce cryptographic weaknesses or vulnerabilities.

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer commits code changes to the Source Code repository (GitHub).
2.  A webhook triggers the CI Environment (e.g., GitHub Actions).
3.  The CI Environment executes Build Scripts (Gradle) to build the project.
4.  Build Scripts use Dependency Management to resolve and download dependencies from Package Repositories.
5.  Security Scanners (SAST, SCA) are integrated into the CI pipeline to analyze the code and dependencies for vulnerabilities.
6.  Build Scripts compile the code, package the artifacts (libraries, plugins), and store them in the Artifact Repository.
7.  The Artifact Repository may publish release artifacts to public Package Repositories (e.g., Maven Central).
8.  Internal Storage is used to store build artifacts and logs for auditing and traceability.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Development and Release of Compose Multiplatform Framework: Ensuring the framework is developed, built, and released securely and reliably is critical for its adoption and the security of applications built with it.
*   Distribution of Compose Multiplatform Framework: Secure distribution of the framework to developers is essential to prevent supply chain attacks and ensure developers are using a legitimate and untampered version.
*   Community Engagement and Contributions: Maintaining a healthy and secure community contribution process is important for the long-term development and security of the project.

Data Sensitivity:

*   Source Code: Highly sensitive. Compromise of the source code could lead to the discovery of vulnerabilities, intellectual property theft, and malicious modifications.
*   Build Artifacts: Sensitive. Compromised build artifacts could lead to the distribution of malware to developers and end-users.
*   Developer Credentials and Secrets: Highly sensitive. Compromise could lead to unauthorized access to repositories, build systems, and publishing infrastructure.
*   Build Logs and Audit Logs: Moderately sensitive. Logs can contain information about build processes, potential errors, and security events, which could be valuable for attackers.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific SAST and SCA tools are currently used in the build pipeline?
*   Is there a formal vulnerability disclosure program in place for Compose Multiplatform?
*   Are regular penetration tests or security audits conducted on the framework?
*   What is the process for handling and mitigating vulnerabilities discovered in dependencies?
*   What security training is provided to developers working on Compose Multiplatform?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to promote cross-platform development and expand the Kotlin ecosystem. Security is a high priority to maintain trust and prevent widespread vulnerabilities.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: JetBrains, as the developer, follows secure development practices, including code reviews and static analysis. However, specific security controls for Compose Multiplatform might need further definition and formalization.
*   DESIGN: The C4 diagrams represent a simplified but reasonable high-level architecture of Compose Multiplatform. The deployment scenario focuses on desktop applications as one representative example. The build process is assumed to be automated and include basic security checks.
