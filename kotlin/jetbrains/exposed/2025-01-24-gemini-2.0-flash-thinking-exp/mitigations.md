# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for jetbrains/exposed

## Mitigation Strategy: [SQL Injection Prevention - Parameterized Queries and DSL Usage](./mitigation_strategies/sql_injection_prevention_-_parameterized_queries_and_dsl_usage.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Parameterized Queries and DSL Usage with Exposed
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Strictly Enforce Exposed DSL:** Mandate the exclusive use of Exposed's Domain Specific Language (DSL) for all database query construction within the application. This should be a core coding standard, enforced through code reviews and potentially static analysis tools configured to detect raw SQL usage.
    2.  **Prohibit Raw SQL Fragments:**  Explicitly forbid the use of raw SQL fragments or string-based query building within Exposed contexts. Code reviews must rigorously reject any instances where developers attempt to bypass the DSL for query construction.
    3.  **Promote Exposed `Op` and `Expression` Mastery:**  Invest in developer training to ensure proficiency in utilizing Exposed's `Op` and `Expression` builders. Emphasize how these tools enable complex, type-safe, and parameterized queries, eliminating the need for risky raw SQL. Provide comprehensive documentation and code examples showcasing advanced DSL features.
    4.  **Secure Dynamic Queries with Exposed DSL Features:** For dynamic query requirements (e.g., user-driven filtering), strictly utilize Exposed's DSL features designed for dynamic query construction. This includes conditional operators (`andWhere`, `orWhere`, `adjustSlice`) and safe fragment builders (`CustomFunction`, `CustomOperator`) ensuring parameterization is maintained even in dynamic scenarios.  Implement thorough code reviews specifically for dynamic query logic to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
    5.  **Static Analysis for Exposed Usage:** Explore and implement static analysis tools or linters specifically designed to analyze Kotlin code using Exposed. Configure these tools to detect patterns indicative of potential SQL injection vulnerabilities, such as string concatenation within Exposed query contexts or misuse of DSL features.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (High Severity): Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or unauthorized access. This is directly mitigated by using Exposed's DSL correctly.
*   **Impact:** High reduction in SQL Injection risk. By consistently and correctly leveraging Exposed's DSL for all database interactions, the application becomes significantly more resilient to SQL injection attacks. The DSL's design inherently promotes parameterized queries, minimizing this threat.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. DSL is the primary method for new data access code using Exposed.
    *   Location: Data access layer modules, specifically in repository classes and database interaction functions using Exposed.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Enforcement is not strict enough. Some legacy code or quick scripts might still use less secure methods. Static analysis tools specifically for Exposed DSL usage are not yet integrated.
    *   Location: Older modules, ad-hoc scripts, and lack of automated enforcement in the CI/CD pipeline.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Management and Vulnerability Scanning - Regularly Update Exposed](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_management_and_vulnerability_scanning_-_regularly_update_exposed.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update Exposed Library
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Track Exposed Version:**  Maintain a clear record of the current Exposed library version used in the project. Document this version in project documentation and dependency management files (e.g., `build.gradle.kts`).
    2.  **Monitor Exposed Releases:** Regularly monitor the JetBrains Exposed GitHub repository ([https://github.com/jetbrains/exposed](https://github.com/jetbrains/exposed)) for new releases, security advisories, and bug fixes. Subscribe to release notifications or check the repository's release page periodically.
    3.  **Establish Exposed Update Cadence:** Define a schedule for reviewing and updating the Exposed library version. This could be triggered by new releases, security advisories, or as part of regular dependency update cycles.
    4.  **Test Exposed Updates Thoroughly:** Before deploying updated Exposed versions to production, conduct thorough testing to ensure compatibility and that the update has not introduced regressions or conflicts with other libraries. Focus testing on data access layers and functionalities that heavily rely on Exposed.
    5.  **Prioritize Security Updates for Exposed:**  Treat security-related updates for Exposed with high priority. Apply security patches and version updates promptly to address known vulnerabilities in the library itself.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Exposed (High Severity): Reduces the risk of attackers exploiting known security vulnerabilities that might be discovered and patched in the Exposed library itself.
*   **Impact:** Significant reduction in risk of exploiting known Exposed vulnerabilities. Keeping Exposed updated ensures the application benefits from security fixes and improvements made by the library developers.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Developers are generally aware of the need to update dependencies, including Exposed, but lack a formal, scheduled process specifically for Exposed updates.
    *   Location: Dependency management files (`build.gradle.kts`), informal awareness among developers.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  No formal process for regularly checking for Exposed updates and applying them. No automated alerts for new Exposed releases or security advisories. No specific policy for prioritizing Exposed security updates.
    *   Location: Project management processes, CI/CD pipeline, security policy documentation regarding dependency updates, specifically for Exposed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Denial of Service (DoS) Considerations - Optimize Exposed Queries](./mitigation_strategies/denial_of_service__dos__considerations_-_optimize_exposed_queries.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Optimize Exposed DSL Queries for Performance
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Exposed Query Performance Analysis:** Regularly analyze the performance of database queries constructed using Exposed DSL within the application. Utilize database-specific profiling tools and query analyzers to identify slow or resource-intensive queries generated by Exposed.
    2.  **Efficient Exposed Query Design:** Design Exposed DSL queries to be as efficient as possible. Leverage Exposed's features to minimize data retrieval and processing. Avoid unnecessary joins, subqueries, or overly complex `WHERE` clauses when using Exposed. Utilize projections (`slice` in Exposed) to select only the required columns, reducing data transfer and processing overhead.
    3.  **Indexing Awareness in Exposed Queries:** When writing Exposed queries, be mindful of database indexes. Ensure that `WHERE` clauses and `JOIN` conditions in Exposed queries utilize indexed columns effectively to improve query performance. Review database schema and indexing strategy in conjunction with Exposed query design.
    4.  **Pagination with Exposed:** Implement pagination for Exposed queries that retrieve large datasets. Utilize Exposed's `limit` and `offset` functions to retrieve data in manageable chunks, preventing overwhelming the database and application with massive result sets.
    5.  **Connection Pooling Considerations with Exposed:**  While connection pooling is generally a JDBC concern, understand how Exposed interacts with connection pools. Ensure that connection pool settings are appropriately configured for the application's workload and query patterns generated by Exposed to prevent connection exhaustion or performance bottlenecks.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity): Prevents inefficient queries generated by Exposed from consuming excessive database resources, potentially leading to performance degradation or denial of service.
    *   Performance Degradation (Medium Severity): Improves application performance and responsiveness by ensuring efficient database query execution through optimized Exposed DSL usage.
*   **Impact:** Medium reduction in DoS risk and significant improvement in application performance. Writing optimized Exposed queries contributes to overall system stability and efficient resource utilization when using Exposed.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Developers are generally encouraged to write efficient queries using Exposed, but no formal performance analysis or optimization process specifically for Exposed queries is in place. Basic indexing is applied to database tables. Pagination is used in some API endpoints built with Exposed.
    *   Location: Exposed query implementations in data access layers, database schema definitions.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  No systematic performance analysis process specifically targeting Exposed queries. No formal guidelines or training on writing highly performant Exposed DSL queries. Indexing strategy might not be fully optimized for all Exposed query patterns.
    *   Location: Query optimization processes, developer training materials, database performance monitoring and analysis tools focused on Exposed query performance.
