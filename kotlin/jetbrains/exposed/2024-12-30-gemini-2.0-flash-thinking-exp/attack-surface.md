Here's the updated list of high and critical attack surfaces that directly involve Exposed:

* **Attack Surface: SQL Injection via Dynamic Query Construction**
    * **Description:**  Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into dynamically constructed queries if user input is not properly sanitized or parameterized when using Exposed's API for query building.
    * **How Exposed Contributes:** Exposed provides flexibility in building queries, and if developers use string concatenation or fail to utilize parameterized query features, it directly opens the door for SQL injection.
    * **Example:**
        ```kotlin
        // Insecure example:
        val userId = params["userId"] // User-provided input
        val users = Users.select { Users.id eq userId.toInt() } // Potential SQL injection if userId is malicious
        ```
        A malicious user could provide input like `1 OR 1=1` to bypass the intended query logic.
    * **Impact:**  Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion; potential for privilege escalation or even remote code execution on the database server.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Always use parameterized queries:** Utilize Exposed's type-safe query building features like `eq`, `like`, `inList`, and other operators that handle parameterization automatically.
        * **Avoid string concatenation for query building:**  Do not manually construct SQL fragments using user input.

* **Attack Surface: Data Exposure through Insecure Logging Practices**
    * **Description:**  If the application logs the SQL queries generated by Exposed without proper redaction, sensitive data embedded within those queries can be exposed in log files.
    * **How Exposed Contributes:** Exposed is directly responsible for generating the SQL queries that might contain sensitive data.
    * **Example:**  Logging a query like `SELECT * FROM Users WHERE password = 'secretPassword'` in production logs.
    * **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive user data, credentials, or other confidential information stored in the database.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid logging sensitive data:**  Refrain from logging SQL queries containing sensitive information in production environments.
        * **Implement log redaction:** If logging queries is necessary for debugging, implement mechanisms to automatically redact sensitive data (e.g., parameter values) before logging.

* **Attack Surface: Potential for ORM-Specific Exploits**
    * **Description:**  Like any software library, Exposed might contain undiscovered vulnerabilities within its code, such as bugs in query parsing, data mapping, or transaction handling.
    * **How Exposed Contributes:**  The inherent complexity of an ORM like Exposed introduces the possibility of implementation flaws within its own codebase that could be exploited.
    * **Example:**  A vulnerability in Exposed's handling of specific data types leading to unexpected behavior or a security bypass within the ORM itself.
    * **Impact:**  The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability, potentially ranging from data corruption to remote code execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (potential to be critical if a severe vulnerability is found)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep Exposed updated:** Regularly update to the latest stable version of Exposed to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        * **Monitor security advisories:** Stay informed about any reported security vulnerabilities in Exposed.
        * **Security testing:** Include Exposed-specific considerations in security testing (static and dynamic analysis) to identify potential issues within the ORM's functionality.
