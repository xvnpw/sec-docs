Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

High-Risk Path 1: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Query Construction leading to SQL Injection

* Attack Vector: SQL Injection via String Interpolation
    * Description: Attackers exploit code where SQL queries are constructed by directly embedding user-controlled strings. This allows them to inject malicious SQL commands that are then executed by the database.
    * Steps:
        1. Identify vulnerable code: Analyze the application's codebase to find instances where string concatenation or formatting is used to build SQL queries with user-supplied data.
        2. Inject malicious SQL: Craft specific input strings that, when interpolated into the SQL query, alter the query's intended logic or introduce new commands.
        3. Execute arbitrary SQL commands: The injected SQL commands are executed by the database, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete data, bypass authentication, or even execute operating system commands in some database configurations.

Critical Node 1: SQL Injection via String Interpolation

* Significance: This node represents the initial point of exploitation in a classic SQL injection attack. Success at this stage allows the attacker to proceed with injecting malicious SQL.

Critical Node 2: Execute arbitrary SQL commands (within SQL Injection paths)

* Significance: This node represents the direct consequence of successful SQL injection. The attacker has achieved the ability to run any SQL command they choose, leading to immediate and severe impact on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Critical Node 4: SQL Injection via Insecure DSL Usage

* Significance: Similar to SQL Injection via String Interpolation, but arises from the misuse of Exposed's Domain Specific Language (DSL). While the DSL aims to prevent SQL injection, improper use, especially with dynamic elements derived from user input without proper validation, can still create vulnerabilities leading to arbitrary SQL execution. The impact is the same as traditional SQL injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Data Mapping and Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_data_mapping_and_handling.md)

* Exploit Vulnerabilities in Data Mapping and Handling
    * Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if custom serializers are used)
        * Identify custom serializers
        * Inject malicious serialized data
        * *** CRITICAL NODE *** Gain remote code execution on the server ***
        * Mitigation: Avoid custom serialization; use secure libraries; review implementation.

Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

High-Risk Path 2: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Data Mapping and Handling leading to Remote Code Execution

* Attack Vector: Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if custom serializers are used)
    * Description: If the application uses custom serialization mechanisms with Exposed entities, attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the deserialization process. By providing malicious serialized data, they can potentially execute arbitrary code on the server when the data is deserialized.
    * Steps:
        1. Identify custom serializers: Determine if the application uses custom serialization for Exposed entities, which is less common but possible.
        2. Inject malicious serialized data: Craft a serialized payload containing malicious code or instructions.
        3. Gain remote code execution: When the application deserializes the malicious payload, the injected code is executed, granting the attacker control over the server.

Critical Node 3: Gain remote code execution on the server (Deserialization Vulnerabilities)

* Significance: This node represents the highest level of compromise. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the application server, potentially leading to complete system takeover, data breaches, and further attacks on internal networks.
