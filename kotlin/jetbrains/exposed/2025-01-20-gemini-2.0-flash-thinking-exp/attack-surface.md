# Attack Surface Analysis for jetbrains/exposed

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection via Dynamic Query Construction](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_via_dynamic_query_construction.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into dynamically constructed queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
*   **How Exposed Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  Exposed provides flexibility in building queries, including the ability to construct them dynamically using `SqlExpressionBuilder` or even raw SQL. If user input is directly incorporated into these dynamic parts without proper sanitization or parameterization, it creates an entry point for SQL injection.
*   **Example:**
    ```kotlin
    val userInput = '' DROP TABLE users; --''
    val tableName = Table("my_table")
    val columnName = tableName.varchar("name", 50)

    // Vulnerable code: Directly embedding user input
    val query = "SELECT * FROM ${tableName.tableName} WHERE ${columnName.name} = '$userInput'"
    // Execution using Exposed's `exec` or similar
    ```
*   **Impact:** Critical. Full database compromise, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always use parameterized queries:** Utilize Exposed's DSL and functions that automatically handle parameterization (e.g., `eq`, `like`, `insert`, `update`).
    *   **Avoid direct string concatenation of user input into SQL:**  Treat user input as data, not code.
    *   **Sanitize and validate user input:** Implement robust input validation to ensure data conforms to expected formats and does not contain malicious characters.
    *   **Use Exposed's DSL for query building:** Rely on the type-safe DSL to minimize the risk of manual SQL construction errors.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource-Intensive Queries](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource-intensive_queries.md)

**Description:** Attackers craft complex or inefficient queries using Exposed's API that consume excessive database resources (CPU, memory, I/O), leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.
*   **How Exposed Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Exposed provides powerful query building capabilities. If not used carefully, especially when dealing with user-controlled filtering or sorting, it can be exploited to generate resource-intensive queries.
*   **Example:** A user providing overly broad or unindexed search terms could lead to a query that scans the entire database table.
*   **Impact:** High. Application unavailability, performance degradation, potential database crashes.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement query timeouts:** Configure database connection settings or application-level logic to limit the execution time of queries.
    *   **Optimize database schema and indexes:** Ensure proper indexing to improve query performance.
    *   **Implement pagination and limits:**  Restrict the number of results returned in queries, especially for user-facing endpoints.
    *   **Monitor database performance:**  Track query execution times and resource usage to identify potentially malicious or inefficient queries.
    *   **Rate limiting and request throttling:**  Limit the number of requests from a single user or IP address to prevent abuse.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Schema Migrations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_schema_migrations.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities introduced during database schema migrations defined using Exposed's DSL can lead to unintended changes or security flaws in the database structure.
*   **How Exposed Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Exposed's `SchemaUtils` and migration features allow developers to programmatically manage database schema. Errors or malicious intent in these migration definitions can have significant consequences.
*   **Example:** A migration script might inadvertently drop a crucial table or introduce a column with insecure default values.
*   **Impact:** High. Data loss, data corruption, introduction of vulnerabilities, application instability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thoroughly review all migration scripts:** Implement a code review process for all schema migration changes.
    *   **Use version control for migration scripts:** Track changes and allow for rollbacks if necessary.
    *   **Test migrations in a non-production environment:**  Apply migrations to a staging or development database before deploying to production.
    *   **Implement rollback strategies:** Have a plan to revert migrations in case of errors.
    *   **Limit access to migration tools:** Restrict who can create and execute schema migrations.
