### Deep Analysis of SQL Injection via `CustomFunction` or Raw SQL

**Introduction:**

The ability to execute custom SQL functions or raw SQL queries directly within an ORM like Exposed provides flexibility but introduces significant security risks if not handled carefully. The core issue lies in the potential for untrusted data to be incorporated directly into the SQL query string without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code, altering the intended query and potentially gaining unauthorized access or control over the database.

**Detailed Explanation of the Vulnerability:**

* **`CustomFunction`:**  Exposed allows developers to define custom SQL functions that can be used within their queries. If the arguments passed to these `CustomFunction` instances are derived from user input or any other untrusted source and are directly concatenated into the SQL query, it creates a direct injection point.

    **Vulnerable Code Example:**

    ```kotlin
    import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.*
    import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.SqlExpressionBuilder.eq

    object Users : Table("users") {
        val id = integer("id").autoIncrement()
        val username = varchar("username", 50)
        val email = varchar("email", 100)

        override val primaryKey = PrimaryKey(id)
    }

    fun searchUsersByUsernameCustom(usernamePart: String): List<ResultRow> {
        val customLike = object : CustomFunction<Boolean>("LIKE", BooleanColumnType(), Users.username, stringParam("%$usernamePart%")) {}
        return Users.select { customLike }.toList()
    }

    // Potentially vulnerable usage:
    fun findUsers(userInput: String): List<ResultRow> {
        return searchUsersByUsernameCustom(userInput)
    }
    ```

    In this example, if `userInput` contains malicious SQL (e.g., `'; DROP TABLE users; --`), it will be directly incorporated into the `LIKE` clause, potentially leading to unintended database operations.

* **Raw SQL Execution:** Exposed provides mechanisms to execute raw SQL queries directly. While sometimes necessary for complex or database-specific operations, this approach bypasses the safety mechanisms of the DSL if not handled with extreme caution. Concatenating untrusted input into raw SQL strings is a classic SQL injection vulnerability.

    **Vulnerable Code Example:**

    ```kotlin
    import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.*
    import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.transactions.transaction

    fun findUsersByRawSql(sortOrder: String): List<ResultRow> = transaction {
        val tableName = Users.tableName
        val columnName = Users.username.name
        val rawQuery = "SELECT * FROM $tableName ORDER BY $columnName $sortOrder"
        exec(rawQuery) { rs ->
            val result = mutableListOf<ResultRow>()
            while (rs.next()) {
                result.add(ResultRow.create(rs))
            }
            result
        }
    }

    // Potentially vulnerable usage:
    fun sortUsers(userSortInput: String): List<ResultRow> {
        return findUsersByRawSql(userSortInput)
    }
    ```

    If `userSortInput` is something like `"ASC; DELETE FROM users; --"`, the raw SQL query becomes `SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY username ASC; DELETE FROM users; --`, leading to data loss.

**Attack Vectors:**

Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities through various entry points where user-controlled data is used in conjunction with `CustomFunction` or raw SQL:

* **Web Form Inputs:**  Data entered in web forms (e.g., search fields, sorting options) can be directly used as arguments for `CustomFunction` or concatenated into raw SQL queries.
* **API Parameters:**  Values passed through API endpoints can be manipulated to inject malicious SQL.
* **URL Parameters:**  Data within URL parameters can be used to construct vulnerable queries.
* **Indirect Input:**  Data sourced from databases, configuration files, or other external systems that are themselves compromised can be used to inject SQL.

**Impact Assessment:**

The impact of a successful SQL injection attack via `CustomFunction` or raw SQL can be severe, mirroring the impacts of general SQL injection vulnerabilities:

* **Data Breach:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive data, including user credentials, personal information, and confidential business data.
* **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data, leading to data corruption, loss of integrity, and disruption of services.
* **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can potentially gain access to higher privileges within the database, allowing them to perform administrative tasks.
* **Command Execution:** In some database configurations, attackers can execute operating system commands on the database server, leading to complete system compromise.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can execute resource-intensive queries to overload the database server, causing service disruptions.

**Mitigation Strategies (Detailed):**

* **Prioritize Exposed's DSL:**  The most effective way to mitigate this risk is to **avoid using raw SQL and `CustomFunction` whenever possible**. Exposed's DSL provides a safer way to construct queries by abstracting away the direct SQL string manipulation. Leverage the DSL's features for filtering, sorting, and other common operations.

* **Strict Input Sanitization and Validation:**  If using `CustomFunction` or raw SQL is unavoidable, **rigorously sanitize and validate all input** that will be used as arguments or incorporated into the SQL string. This includes:
    * **Whitelisting:**  Define allowed characters, patterns, or values and reject any input that doesn't conform.
    * **Encoding:**  Encode special characters that have meaning in SQL (e.g., single quotes, double quotes) to prevent them from being interpreted as SQL syntax. However, encoding alone is often insufficient for complete protection against SQL injection.
    * **Data Type Validation:** Ensure that the input matches the expected data type.

* **Parameterized Queries (for Raw SQL):**  When raw SQL is absolutely necessary, **always use parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements)**. This mechanism separates the SQL structure from the data, preventing the interpretation of data as executable code. Exposed leverages the underlying JDBC driver's parameter binding capabilities.

    **Secure Raw SQL Example:**

    ```kotlin
    import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.*
    import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.transactions.transaction

    fun findUsersByUsernameSecure(usernamePart: String): List<ResultRow> = transaction {
        val tableName = Users.tableName
        val rawQuery = "SELECT * FROM $tableName WHERE username LIKE ?"
        exec(rawQuery) { stmt ->
            stmt.setString(1, "%$usernamePart%")
            val rs = stmt.resultSet
            val result = mutableListOf<ResultRow>()
            while (rs.next()) {
                result.add(ResultRow.create(rs))
            }
            result
        }
    }
    ```

    In this secure example, the `?` acts as a placeholder, and the `setString(1, "%$usernamePart%")` method safely binds the user-provided data as a parameter, preventing SQL injection.

* **Careful Construction of `CustomFunction` Arguments:** When using `CustomFunction`, avoid directly concatenating untrusted input into the arguments. If possible, use constants or values derived from trusted sources. If user input is necessary, apply strict sanitization and validation before passing it to the `CustomFunction`.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user account used by the application has only the necessary permissions to perform its intended operations. This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause even if SQL injection is successful.

* **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. Pay close attention to areas where `CustomFunction` or raw SQL is used.

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Implement a WAF to filter out malicious SQL injection attempts before they reach the application. While not a foolproof solution, it provides an additional layer of defense.

**Specific Recommendations for Developers:**

* **Default to DSL:**  Make it a standard practice to use Exposed's DSL for query construction. Only resort to raw SQL or `CustomFunction` when absolutely necessary and after careful consideration of the security implications.
* **Treat Raw SQL and `CustomFunction` as High-Risk Areas:**  When these features are used, treat the code blocks as critical security points requiring extra scrutiny during development and review.
* **Educate Developers:** Ensure that all developers on the team are aware of the risks associated with SQL injection and understand how to use `CustomFunction` and raw SQL securely.
* **Establish Secure Coding Guidelines:**  Implement and enforce coding guidelines that explicitly address the prevention of SQL injection, particularly in the context of Exposed.
* **Utilize Static Analysis Tools:**  Employ static analysis tools that can help identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in the codebase.

**Conclusion:**

SQL Injection via `CustomFunction` or raw SQL represents a significant threat to applications using the Exposed framework. While these features offer flexibility, they introduce vulnerabilities if not handled with extreme care. By prioritizing the use of Exposed's DSL, rigorously sanitizing inputs, utilizing parameterized queries for raw SQL, and adhering to secure coding practices, development teams can effectively mitigate this critical risk and protect their applications and data. A proactive and security-conscious approach is essential to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the application and its underlying database.
