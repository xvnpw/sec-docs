# Threat Model Analysis for jetbrains/exposed

## Threat: [SQL Injection via DSL](./threats/sql_injection_via_dsl.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when used in a dynamically constructed Exposed DSL query, alters the intended SQL statement. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands against the database. For example, manipulating a `WHERE` clause to bypass authentication or extract sensitive data.
    * **Impact:** Data breach (access to sensitive information), data manipulation (modification or deletion of data), potential privilege escalation within the database, and in some cases, command execution on the database server.
    * **Affected Exposed Component:** `exposed-dao` module, specifically the DSL components used for query building (e.g., `Query.where`, `Op.build`).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Always use parameterized queries:** Leverage Exposed's parameter binding features when incorporating user input into queries.
        * **Avoid string concatenation:** Do not directly concatenate user input into DSL query fragments.
        * **Input validation and sanitization:** Validate and sanitize all user-provided data before using it in Exposed queries.
        * **Principle of least privilege:** Ensure the database user used by the application has only the necessary permissions.

## Threat: [SQL Injection via `CustomFunction` or Raw SQL](./threats/sql_injection_via__customfunction__or_raw_sql.md)

* **Description:** An attacker injects malicious SQL code through the use of `CustomFunction` or raw SQL execution within Exposed. If the arguments passed to these features are not properly sanitized, it can lead to the execution of arbitrary SQL commands.
    * **Impact:** Similar to SQL Injection via DSL - data breach, data manipulation, privilege escalation, potential command execution.
    * **Affected Exposed Component:** `exposed-core` module, specifically the `CustomFunction` class and the functions for executing raw SQL (e.g., `exec`).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid raw SQL where possible:** Prefer using Exposed's DSL for query construction.
        * **Strictly sanitize inputs for `CustomFunction` and raw SQL:** Treat these as potential injection points and apply rigorous input validation and sanitization.
        * **Parameterize raw SQL:** If raw SQL is unavoidable, utilize parameter binding mechanisms provided by the underlying database driver.

## Threat: [Race Conditions in Concurrent Transactions](./threats/race_conditions_in_concurrent_transactions.md)

* **Description:** When multiple concurrent requests attempt to modify the same data using Exposed's transaction management without proper synchronization, race conditions can occur. This can lead to data corruption, inconsistent state, or the violation of business logic. For example, two concurrent updates might overwrite each other's changes.
    * **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, business logic errors, and potential financial loss or security vulnerabilities arising from inconsistent data.
    * **Affected Exposed Component:** `exposed-core` module, specifically the transaction management features (e.g., `transaction`, `TransactionManager`).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Use appropriate transaction isolation levels:** Choose the appropriate isolation level for transactions to prevent concurrency issues (e.g., `SERIALIZABLE` for the highest level of protection).
        * **Implement optimistic or pessimistic locking:** Employ locking mechanisms to ensure data integrity during concurrent modifications.
        * **Careful transaction management:** Ensure transactions are properly started, committed, and rolled back, and that the scope of transactions is well-defined.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass due to Logic in Exposed Queries](./threats/authorization_bypass_due_to_logic_in_exposed_queries.md)

* **Description:** Developers might mistakenly implement authorization checks directly within Exposed queries (e.g., adding `WHERE user_id = current_user_id` to every query). If these checks are implemented inconsistently or incorrectly, an attacker might be able to bypass authorization by manipulating query parameters or exploiting flaws in the logic.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data or functionality, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.
    * **Affected Exposed Component:** `exposed-dao` module, specifically the query building components and how developers implement authorization logic within them. This is more of a developer practice issue than an inherent Exposed vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Centralize authorization logic:** Implement authorization checks in a dedicated layer of the application, separate from the data access layer.
        * **Use role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC):** Employ established authorization models for better security and maintainability.
        * **Avoid embedding authorization logic directly in database queries:** Keep data access logic separate from authorization concerns.
