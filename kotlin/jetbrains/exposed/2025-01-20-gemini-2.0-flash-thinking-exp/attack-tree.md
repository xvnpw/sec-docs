## Attack Tree Path: [1.0 Compromise Application via Exposed ORM [!]](./attack_tree_paths/1_0_compromise_application_via_exposed_orm__!_.md)

*   **1.0 Compromise Application via Exposed ORM [!]**
    *   This is the overarching goal of the attacker. It represents the successful exploitation of one or more vulnerabilities within the Exposed ORM to gain unauthorized control or access to the application and its data.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities [!]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities__!_.md)

*   **1.1 Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities [!]**
    *   This high-risk path focuses on leveraging weaknesses in how the application constructs and executes SQL queries using Exposed, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Inject Malicious SQL via Dynamic Queries [!]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_inject_malicious_sql_via_dynamic_queries__!_.md)

    *   **1.1.1 Inject Malicious SQL via Dynamic Queries [!]**
        *   This attack vector targets scenarios where the application dynamically builds SQL queries using user-provided input without proper sanitization or parameterization.
            *   **1.1.1.1 Manipulate User Input in `where` clauses:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when incorporated into a `where` clause, alters the query's logic to retrieve unintended data or perform unauthorized actions.
            *   **1.1.1.2 Inject SQL in `orderBy` or `limit` clauses:** Attackers inject SQL code into `orderBy` or `limit` clauses to potentially extract additional data, bypass intended limitations, or even execute arbitrary SQL statements depending on the database system.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1 Manipulate User Input in `where` clauses](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1_manipulate_user_input_in__where__clauses.md)

            *   **1.1.1.1 Manipulate User Input in `where` clauses:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when incorporated into a `where` clause, alters the query's logic to retrieve unintended data or perform unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.2 Inject SQL in `orderBy` or `limit` clauses](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_2_inject_sql_in__orderby__or__limit__clauses.md)

            *   **1.1.1.2 Inject SQL in `orderBy` or `limit` clauses:** Attackers inject SQL code into `orderBy` or `limit` clauses to potentially extract additional data, bypass intended limitations, or even execute arbitrary SQL statements depending on the database system.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Exploit SQL Injection in Exposed's DSL Features [!]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_exploit_sql_injection_in_exposed's_dsl_features__!_.md)

    *   **1.1.2 Exploit SQL Injection in Exposed's DSL Features [!]**
        *   This critical node highlights the risk of vulnerabilities within the Exposed Domain Specific Language (DSL) itself, or in how developers use it, leading to SQL injection.
            *   **1.1.2.3 Bypass input validation within the application but exploit lack of sanitization in Exposed's query building:**  Even if the application attempts input validation, vulnerabilities in how Exposed processes data or builds queries can still allow for SQL injection if the validation is insufficient or if Exposed doesn't adequately sanitize internally.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2.3 Bypass input validation within the application but exploit lack of sanitization in Exposed's query building](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_3_bypass_input_validation_within_the_application_but_exploit_lack_of_sanitization_in_exposed's_ff14e806.md)

            *   **1.1.2.3 Bypass input validation within the application but exploit lack of sanitization in Exposed's query building:**  Even if the application attempts input validation, vulnerabilities in how Exposed processes data or builds queries can still allow for SQL injection if the validation is insufficient or if Exposed doesn't adequately sanitize internally.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3 Exploit Second-Order SQL Injection](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_exploit_second-order_sql_injection.md)

    *   **1.1.3 Exploit Second-Order SQL Injection**
        *   This high-risk path involves injecting malicious data into the database through one part of the application, which is then later used in an Exposed query in another part of the application without proper sanitization, leading to SQL injection.
            *   **1.1.3.1 Inject malicious data into the database that is later used in an Exposed query without proper sanitization:** An attacker injects malicious code into a database field. Subsequently, when this data is retrieved and used in an Exposed query without proper escaping or parameterization, the malicious code is executed as part of the SQL query.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3.1 Inject malicious data into the database that is later used in an Exposed query without proper sanitization](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_1_inject_malicious_data_into_the_database_that_is_later_used_in_an_exposed_query_without_prope_f45fb6c8.md)

            *   **1.1.3.1 Inject malicious data into the database that is later used in an Exposed query without proper sanitization:** An attacker injects malicious code into a database field. Subsequently, when this data is retrieved and used in an Exposed query without proper escaping or parameterization, the malicious code is executed as part of the SQL query.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.5 Exploit Vulnerabilities in Exposed's Dependencies (Transitive Dependencies) [!]](./attack_tree_paths/1_5_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_exposed's_dependencies__transitive_dependencies___!_.md)

*   **1.5 Exploit Vulnerabilities in Exposed's Dependencies (Transitive Dependencies) [!]**
    *   This critical node and high-risk path focuses on the risk introduced by vulnerabilities in the libraries that Exposed depends on, including transitive dependencies (libraries that Exposed's dependencies rely on).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.5.1 Leverage known vulnerabilities in libraries used by Exposed](./attack_tree_paths/1_5_1_leverage_known_vulnerabilities_in_libraries_used_by_exposed.md)

    *   **1.5.1 Leverage known vulnerabilities in libraries used by Exposed**
        *   Attackers exploit publicly known security flaws in the underlying libraries used by Exposed. This can include database drivers or other utility libraries.
            *   **1.5.1.1 Exploit security flaws in underlying database drivers or other dependencies:**  Attackers utilize existing exploits for vulnerabilities in database drivers (like JDBC drivers) or other libraries that Exposed relies on. This can potentially lead to various forms of compromise, including remote code execution or data breaches, depending on the specific vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.5.1.1 Exploit security flaws in underlying database drivers or other dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/1_5_1_1_exploit_security_flaws_in_underlying_database_drivers_or_other_dependencies.md)

            *   **1.5.1.1 Exploit security flaws in underlying database drivers or other dependencies:**  Attackers utilize existing exploits for vulnerabilities in database drivers (like JDBC drivers) or other libraries that Exposed relies on. This can potentially lead to various forms of compromise, including remote code execution or data breaches, depending on the specific vulnerability.
