### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.1 Inject Malicious SQL via Dynamic Queries

#### 1.1.1 Inject Malicious SQL via Dynamic Queries [!]

This attack vector highlights a critical vulnerability arising from the construction of SQL queries using dynamically generated strings that incorporate user-provided input without proper sanitization or parameterization. Exposed, while providing tools for safe query building, does not inherently prevent developers from writing vulnerable code.

**Understanding the Risk:** When user input is directly concatenated into SQL query strings, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code that will be executed by the database. This can lead to various security breaches, including data breaches, data manipulation, and even unauthorized access to the underlying operating system in some database configurations.

#### 1.1.1.1 Manipulate User Input in `where` clauses

**Vulnerability Description:** This sub-path focuses on scenarios where user-provided input is used to construct the `where` clause of a SQL query. If this input is not properly sanitized or parameterized, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code to alter the query's logic.

**Example Scenario (Vulnerable Code):**

```kotlin
import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.*
import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.transactions.transaction

object Users : Table("users") {
    val id = integer("id").autoIncrement()
    val username = varchar("username", 50)
    val email = varchar("email", 100)

    override val primaryKey = PrimaryKey(id)
}

fun findUserByUsernameUnsafe(username: String): List<ResultRow> = transaction {
    val query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username'" // Vulnerable: String concatenation
    return@transaction exec(query) { it.toList() } ?: emptyList()
}

fun main() {
    val userInput = "'; DELETE FROM users; --"
    val results = findUserByUsernameUnsafe(userInput)
    println(results)
}
```

**Attack Explanation:** In the vulnerable code above, the `findUserByUsernameUnsafe` function directly embeds the `username` parameter into the SQL query string. An attacker can provide input like `'; DELETE FROM users; --` which, when incorporated into the query, becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ''; DELETE FROM users; --'
```

The database will execute this as two separate statements: first selecting users with an empty username (likely none), and then executing `DELETE FROM users`, effectively wiping the entire `users` table. The `--` comments out the remaining part of the original query.

**Potential Impact:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can bypass intended filtering and retrieve sensitive data.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, attackers might be able to execute stored procedures or functions with elevated privileges.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Parameterization (Prepared Statements):**  Exposed strongly encourages the use of parameterization, which treats user input as data rather than executable code. This is the most effective way to prevent SQL injection.

    ```kotlin
    fun findUserByUsernameSafe(username: String): List<ResultRow> = transaction {
        Users.select { Users.username eq username }.toList()
    }
    ```

    Exposed handles the parameterization behind the scenes when using its DSL.

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While not a primary defense against SQL injection, validating and sanitizing user input can help reduce the attack surface. However, relying solely on this is dangerous.

*   **Escaping Special Characters:**  Manually escaping special characters can be error-prone and is generally discouraged in favor of parameterization.

#### 1.1.1.2 Inject SQL in `orderBy` or `limit` clauses

**Vulnerability Description:** This sub-path focuses on the risks associated with dynamically constructing `orderBy` or `limit` clauses using user-provided input. While these clauses might seem less dangerous than `where` clauses, they can still be exploited for SQL injection.

**Example Scenario (Vulnerable Code):**

```kotlin
import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.*
import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.transactions.transaction

object Products : Table("products") {
    val id = integer("id").autoIncrement()
    val name = varchar("name", 100)
    val price = decimal("price", 10, 2)

    override val primaryKey = PrimaryKey(id)
}

fun getProductsOrderedByUnsafe(orderByColumn: String): List<ResultRow> = transaction {
    val query = "SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY $orderByColumn" // Vulnerable: String concatenation
    return@transaction exec(query) { it.toList() } ?: emptyList()
}

fun main() {
    val userInput = "name; SELECT version(); --"
    val results = getProductsOrderedByUnsafe(userInput)
    println(results)
}
```

**Attack Explanation:** In this example, the `getProductsOrderedByUnsafe` function allows the user to specify the column to order by. An attacker can inject SQL code into the `orderByColumn` parameter. Providing input like `"name; SELECT version(); --"` results in the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY name; SELECT version(); --
```

The database might execute the `SELECT version()` statement, revealing information about the database server. Depending on the database system and permissions, more harmful statements could potentially be injected.

**Another Example (Bypassing Limits):**

If the application uses dynamic `LIMIT` clauses:

```kotlin
fun getLatestProductsUnsafe(limit: String): List<ResultRow> = transaction {
    val query = "SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT $limit" // Vulnerable
    return@transaction exec(query) { it.toList() } ?: emptyList()
}
```

An attacker could provide a large number or even inject subqueries to bypass intended limitations.

**Potential Impact:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive information about the database structure or server.
*   **Performance Degradation:** Injecting complex queries or large limits can impact database performance.
*   **Bypassing Intended Limitations:** Attackers can retrieve more data than intended by manipulating the `limit` clause.
*   **Potential for More Complex Injection:** While less common, in some database systems, injecting into `ORDER BY` or `LIMIT` might open doors for more advanced injection techniques.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Whitelisting Allowed Columns/Values:**  Instead of directly using user input, provide a predefined list of allowed columns for ordering and validate the user's input against this list.

    ```kotlin
    fun getProductsOrderedBySafe(orderByColumn: String): List<ResultRow> = transaction {
        val allowedColumns = listOf("name", "price")
        val column = when (orderByColumn) {
            "name" -> Products.name
            "price" -> Products.price
            else -> Products.name // Default or throw an error
        }
        Products.selectAll().orderBy(column).toList()
    }
    ```

*   **Mapping User Input to Safe Values:**  Map user-provided strings to predefined safe values or database columns.
*   **Avoid Dynamic Construction:** If possible, avoid dynamically constructing `ORDER BY` or `LIMIT` clauses based on direct user input.
*   **Be Cautious with Raw SQL:** When using `exec` or other raw SQL execution methods in Exposed, exercise extreme caution and ensure proper sanitization or parameterization. Parameterization for `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses is often database-specific and might not be directly supported by all ORMs in the same way as `WHERE` clauses.

### 5. General Mitigation Strategies for Dynamic Queries in Exposed

*   **Prioritize Exposed's DSL:**  Exposed's Domain Specific Language (DSL) provides built-in mechanisms for safe query construction and parameterization. Favor using the DSL over raw SQL whenever possible.
*   **Use Parameterization Consistently:**  Ensure that all user-provided input used in `where` clauses or as values in `insert` or `update` statements is properly parameterized.
*   **Exercise Caution with Raw SQL:**  When using `exec` or other raw SQL execution methods, meticulously sanitize or parameterize all user-provided input.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Educate Developers:**  Ensure that developers are aware of the risks of SQL injection and understand how to use Exposed securely.
*   **Consider Using an ORM's Built-in Features:** Exposed provides features like `Op.build` for constructing dynamic `WHERE` clauses safely, but developers need to use them correctly.

### 6. Conclusion

The "Inject Malicious SQL via Dynamic Queries" attack path poses a significant risk to applications built with Exposed if developers do not adhere to secure coding practices. While Exposed provides tools for safe query construction, it is ultimately the developer's responsibility to use them correctly. By understanding the specific vulnerabilities within `where`, `orderBy`, and `limit` clauses, and by implementing robust mitigation strategies like parameterization and input validation, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks. Prioritizing the use of Exposed's DSL and exercising caution with raw SQL are crucial steps in building secure applications.
