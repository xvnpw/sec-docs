# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for jetbrains/exposed

## Mitigation Strategy: [Always use Parameterized Queries](./mitigation_strategies/always_use_parameterized_queries.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all database interactions:** Review the codebase and pinpoint every location where SQL queries are constructed using Exposed.
    2.  **Replace string interpolation/concatenation:**  For each identified query, ensure that user-supplied input is *never* directly embedded into the SQL string using string interpolation (e.g., `${variable}`) or concatenation (`+ variable +`).
    3.  **Utilize Exposed DSL functions:**  Refactor queries to use Exposed's DSL functions like `eq`, `like`, `inList`, `greater`, `less`, etc., for filtering and conditions. These functions automatically handle parameterization provided by Exposed.
    4.  **Verify parameterization for custom functions:** If using custom SQL functions or fragments within Exposed, double-check that parameters are correctly passed and handled by Exposed's parameterization mechanism.
    5.  **Code review and testing:** Conduct code reviews to ensure all queries are parameterized using Exposed's features. Perform security testing, including SQL injection vulnerability scans, to validate the effectiveness of parameterization.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (Severity: High) - Allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and complete system compromise.
*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: Significantly reduces the risk. Parameterization, facilitated by Exposed, is the primary defense against SQL injection.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in data access layer classes and repository functions using Exposed DSL.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Needs to be consistently applied across all new features and during refactoring of legacy code. Requires ongoing code review to maintain adherence to parameterized queries when using Exposed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review and Audit Dynamic Query Construction (in Exposed context)](./mitigation_strategies/review_and_audit_dynamic_query_construction__in_exposed_context_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify dynamic query locations:** Locate sections of code where SQL queries are built dynamically using Exposed based on user input or application logic (e.g., using `Op.OR`, `Op.AND` with variable conditions, or building fragments dynamically).
    2.  **Analyze dynamic query logic:** Carefully examine the logic for constructing dynamic queries within Exposed. Understand how user inputs influence the generated SQL through Exposed's DSL or fragment building.
    3.  **Enforce parameterization in dynamic parts:** Ensure that even in dynamic query construction within Exposed, all user-provided values are parameterized using Exposed's mechanisms. Avoid building dynamic `Op` structures by directly embedding unparameterized user input.
    4.  **Implement input validation and sanitization:**  Validate and sanitize user inputs *before* they are used in dynamic query construction within Exposed. This adds an extra layer of defense, although parameterization via Exposed remains the primary protection.
    5.  **Regular security audits:** Conduct periodic security audits specifically focused on dynamic query generation logic within Exposed to identify potential vulnerabilities or oversights in parameterization.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (Severity: High) - Especially in complex dynamic queries built with Exposed, the risk of overlooking proper parameterization within the Exposed DSL or fragment construction is higher.
*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: Significantly reduces the risk, especially in complex scenarios using Exposed's dynamic query features. Audits and reviews provide ongoing assurance of correct Exposed usage.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Code review process includes checks for dynamic query construction using Exposed in critical modules.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Formalized audit schedule for dynamic query logic built with Exposed. Static analysis tools need to be configured to specifically flag dynamic query patterns in Exposed for review.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Exposed's Type-Safe DSL](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_exposed's_type-safe_dsl.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Prioritize DSL usage:**  Encourage developers to primarily use Exposed's Domain Specific Language (DSL) for query construction instead of resorting to raw SQL strings or manual query building outside of Exposed's intended usage.
    2.  **Train developers on DSL:** Provide training and documentation to developers on effectively using Exposed's DSL features for various query types (select, insert, update, delete, joins, etc.). Emphasize the security benefits of using the DSL.
    3.  **Refactor raw SQL queries (if any):**  Identify and refactor any existing raw SQL queries in the codebase that bypass Exposed's DSL and instead utilize the type-safe DSL where feasible to leverage Exposed's built-in security features.
    4.  **Enforce DSL usage in coding standards:** Include guidelines in coding standards that promote the use of Exposed's DSL for database interactions to encourage secure coding practices within the framework.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (Severity: Medium) - Type safety of Exposed's DSL reduces accidental injection risks by guiding developers towards parameterized approaches inherent in the DSL design.
    *   Data Type Mismatches (Severity: Medium) - Exposed's DSL helps prevent errors related to incorrect data types in queries, which can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: Partially reduces the risk by making safe query construction easier and more natural through Exposed's DSL.
    *   Data Type Mismatches: Significantly reduces the risk by leveraging Exposed's type system.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Project coding guidelines recommend DSL usage. New development heavily relies on Exposed DSL.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Enforcement of DSL usage through automated linters or static analysis rules that specifically check for direct SQL usage instead of Exposed DSL.  Complete refactoring of older modules to fully utilize Exposed DSL.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Exposed and Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_exposed_and_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Dependency tracking:** Use dependency management tools (e.g., Maven, Gradle for Kotlin/Java projects) to track the version of Exposed and its dependencies (JDBC drivers, Kotlin libraries) used in the project.
    2.  **Monitor for Exposed updates:** Regularly check for new versions of Exposed specifically. Subscribe to security advisories and release notes from JetBrains related to Exposed.
    3.  **Apply Exposed updates promptly:** When updates for Exposed are available, especially security updates, apply them promptly. Test the application after Exposed updates to ensure compatibility and stability with the new Exposed version.
    4.  **Automate dependency updates:** Consider using automated dependency update tools or processes to streamline the update process for Exposed and its dependencies and reduce manual effort.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Exposed (Severity: High to Critical) - Outdated versions of Exposed may contain known security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Exposed: Significantly reduces the risk. Patching vulnerabilities in Exposed itself is crucial for preventing exploitation of framework-specific flaws.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Dependency management is in place using Gradle. Regular manual checks for updates are performed, including for Exposed.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Automated dependency update process specifically for Exposed and its direct dependencies. Integration with vulnerability scanning tools to proactively identify vulnerable Exposed versions.
