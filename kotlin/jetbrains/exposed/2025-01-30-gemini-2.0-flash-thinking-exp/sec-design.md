# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Exposed, is a Kotlin SQL Framework designed to provide a more Kotlin-idiomatic way to interact with databases. It aims to simplify database access for Kotlin developers, offering type-safe query construction and reducing boilerplate code compared to traditional JDBC or other ORM solutions.

Business Priorities and Goals:

- Goal: Enhance Kotlin developer experience by providing a user-friendly and efficient SQL framework.
- Goal: Increase adoption of Kotlin in backend development by addressing database interaction needs.
- Goal: Offer a robust and reliable SQL framework that can be used in various Kotlin projects, from small applications to large enterprise systems.
- Priority: Developer productivity and ease of use.
- Priority: Performance and efficiency of database interactions.
- Priority: Compatibility with various SQL databases.
- Priority: Maintainability and long-term support of the framework.

Business Risks:

- Risk: Security vulnerabilities in the framework could lead to data breaches in applications using Exposed.
- Risk: Performance bottlenecks in Exposed could negatively impact application performance.
- Risk: Incompatibility issues with certain databases or database versions could limit adoption.
- Risk: Lack of community support or slow response to bug fixes and feature requests could deter users.
- Risk: Complex or poorly documented API could hinder developer adoption and productivity.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

- security control: Code review process within JetBrains during development. (Location: Internal JetBrains development process)
- security control: Public GitHub repository allowing community review and contributions. (Location: GitHub repository)
- security control: Unit and integration tests to ensure code correctness and prevent regressions. (Location: Test suite within the GitHub repository)
- security control: Use of Kotlin language features that promote type safety and reduce certain classes of errors. (Location: Kotlin language and compiler)

Accepted Risks:

- accepted risk: Open-source nature implies potential for public vulnerability disclosure before a patch is available.
- accepted risk: Reliance on the security of underlying database drivers and database systems.
- accepted risk: Potential for misuse of the framework by developers leading to insecure application code.

Recommended Security Controls:

- security control: Implement Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools in the development pipeline to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities in the codebase.
- security control: Integrate Dependency Scanning tools to identify and manage vulnerable dependencies used by Exposed.
- security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of Exposed to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.
- security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for developers using Exposed to build secure applications, focusing on topics like input validation and secure query construction.
- security control: Establish a clear vulnerability reporting and response process for security issues identified in Exposed.

Security Requirements:

- Authentication:
    - Requirement: Exposed itself does not handle application-level authentication. Applications using Exposed are responsible for implementing their own authentication mechanisms.
    - Requirement: Database connections should be authenticated using strong credentials and secure connection protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL).
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: Exposed does not enforce application-level authorization. Applications must implement authorization logic to control access to data based on user roles and permissions.
    - Requirement: Database user accounts used by applications should have least privilege access, limited to the necessary operations on the database.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Exposed should encourage and facilitate parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: Developers using Exposed should be educated on the importance of input validation and sanitization in their application code.
    - Requirement: Exposed should provide mechanisms to easily validate and sanitize user inputs before they are used in database queries.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Exposed should support secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL) for database connections to protect data in transit.
    - Requirement: If Exposed handles sensitive data in memory or logs, consider encryption at rest and in transit for these elements. (Note: As a framework, direct data handling is minimal, but applications using it will handle data).
    - Requirement: Exposed should not implement custom cryptography but rely on well-established and vetted cryptographic libraries provided by the underlying platform or database drivers.

```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer: A software developer writes and modifies the Kotlin and Gradle build files for the Exposed project.
2. Code Changes (Kotlin, Gradle): The developer commits code changes, including Kotlin source code and Gradle build configurations.
3. Version Control (e.g., GitHub): Code changes are pushed to a version control system like GitHub, triggering the CI/CD pipeline.
4. CI/CD System (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins): A CI/CD system automatically detects code changes and initiates the build process.
5. Build Process (Compilation, Testing, Packaging): The build process involves:
    - Compilation: Compiling Kotlin source code into bytecode.
    - Testing: Running unit tests and integration tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
    - Packaging: Packaging the compiled code and resources into distributable artifacts (e.g., JAR files).
6. Security Checks (SAST, Dependency Scanning, Linting): Automated security checks are performed:
    - Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Scans the source code for potential security vulnerabilities.
    - Dependency Scanning: Analyzes project dependencies to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
    - Linting: Code linters check for code style issues and potential code quality problems.
7. Artifact Repository (e.g., Maven Central, Nexus): If all checks pass, the build artifacts (Exposed library JAR files) are published to an artifact repository like Maven Central or a private repository (e.g., Nexus).

Build Process Security Controls:

- security control: Version Control (GitHub): Code changes are tracked and auditable, enabling review and rollback if necessary. Access control to the repository limits who can contribute code.
- security control: CI/CD System (GitHub Actions, Jenkins): Automates the build and test process, ensuring consistent and repeatable builds. Provides a centralized and auditable build environment.
- security control: Automated Testing (Unit and Integration Tests): Ensures code quality and reduces the likelihood of bugs, including security-related bugs.
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Proactively identifies potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase early in the development lifecycle.
- security control: Dependency Scanning: Helps manage supply chain security risks by identifying and alerting on vulnerable dependencies.
- security control: Code Linting: Improves code quality and consistency, indirectly contributing to security by reducing potential for errors.
- security control: Artifact Repository (Maven Central, Nexus): Provides a secure and reliable location for storing and distributing build artifacts. Access control to the repository can limit who can publish and consume artifacts.
- security control: Code Signing (Optional): Signing build artifacts can provide integrity and authenticity verification for consumers of the library.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes We Are Trying to Protect:

- For users of Exposed: The critical business process is reliable and secure data access and manipulation within their Kotlin applications. This includes ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.
- For JetBrains (Exposed maintainers): The critical business process is maintaining the reputation and trustworthiness of the Exposed framework as a high-quality, secure, and reliable open-source project within the Kotlin ecosystem.

Data We Are Trying to Protect and Their Sensitivity:

- Data handled by applications using Exposed: This data can vary widely depending on the application. It can include highly sensitive data such as:
    - Personally Identifiable Information (PII): User names, addresses, emails, phone numbers, etc.
    - Financial Data: Credit card numbers, bank account details, transaction history.
    - Healthcare Data: Patient records, medical history, diagnoses.
    - Intellectual Property: Proprietary algorithms, trade secrets, confidential business data.
    - Authentication Credentials: Passwords, API keys, tokens.

- Sensitivity Level: The sensitivity of the data depends entirely on the application using Exposed. In many cases, the data handled can be highly sensitive and require strong security measures to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Exposed as a framework must be designed to facilitate secure data handling by applications, even though it does not directly manage the data itself in a business context.
