## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Exposed Framework [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_exposed_framework__critical_.md)

This is the ultimate attacker goal. Success means gaining unauthorized access, control, or causing damage to the application and potentially its underlying data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Exposed Weaknesses [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_exposed_weaknesses__critical_.md)

To achieve the root goal, attackers will focus on exploiting weaknesses specifically related to the Exposed framework or its usage. This node represents the overall strategy of targeting Exposed-related vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

This is a primary high-risk path. SQL injection allows attackers to directly manipulate database queries, potentially leading to full database compromise.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Bypassing application logic to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
        *   Reading sensitive data from the database.
        *   Modifying or deleting data in the database.
        *   Potentially gaining control over the database server itself in advanced scenarios.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unsafe Query Construction [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/unsafe_query_construction__critical_.md)

This node highlights a common source of SQL injection vulnerabilities: building queries in an unsafe manner.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **String Concatenation in Raw Queries [CRITICAL]:**
            *   Directly embedding user-controlled input into raw SQL queries constructed using string concatenation.
            *   Example: `SqlExpressionBuilder.raw("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + userInput + "'")`
            *   **Inject Malicious SQL via User Input in Raw Queries [CRITICAL]:**
                *   Crafting malicious input strings that, when concatenated, alter the intended SQL query structure.
                *   Example malicious input: `' OR '1'='1` which could turn `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'userInput'` into `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1'` retrieving all users.
        *   **Improper Parameterization in Custom Queries [CRITICAL]:**
            *   Incorrectly using or bypassing parameterization mechanisms provided by Exposed.
            *   For example, attempting to parameterize parts of the query that should not be parameterized (like table or column names) or making mistakes in parameter placement.
            *   **Bypass Parameterization Mechanisms in Exposed [CRITICAL]:**
                *   Finding edge cases or vulnerabilities in how Exposed handles parameterization.
                *   Exploiting developer errors in parameter usage to inject SQL code despite attempted parameterization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Exposed Functions [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_exposed_functions__critical_.md)

This path focuses on potential vulnerabilities arising from the misuse or inherent risks associated with specific Exposed functions.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **`SqlExpressionBuilder.raw()` misuse [CRITICAL]:**
            *   Using `SqlExpressionBuilder.raw()` without proper input sanitization or validation. While powerful for complex queries, `raw()` bypasses Exposed's safety mechanisms if not used carefully.
            *   **Inject SQL via `raw()` with Unsanitized Input [CRITICAL]:**
                *   Directly incorporating user input into `raw()` queries without adequate escaping or validation.
                *   This is essentially a direct path to SQL injection if user input is not meticulously handled.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication/Authorization Bypass (Indirectly related to Exposed usage) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/authenticationauthorization_bypass__indirectly_related_to_exposed_usage___critical_.md)

While not directly vulnerabilities *in* Exposed itself, flaws in application-level authentication and authorization logic *using* Exposed are a high-risk path. Attackers exploit weaknesses in how the application uses Exposed to manage access control.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Logic Flaws in Application Code Using Exposed [CRITICAL]:**
            *   General weaknesses in the application's code that handles authentication and authorization when interacting with the database via Exposed.
        *   **Insecure Data Filtering based on User Roles [CRITICAL]:**
            *   Implementing authorization checks by filtering data *after* it's retrieved from the database based on user roles, instead of securely filtering the query itself.
            *   **Bypass Authorization Checks by Manipulating Query Parameters [CRITICAL]:**
                *   Manipulating request parameters or API calls to bypass client-side or easily circumvented authorization checks.
                *   For example, if user roles are checked only after fetching all data and then filtering, an attacker might be able to modify parameters to retrieve unfiltered data.
        *   **Inadequate Input Validation in Application Logic [CRITICAL]:**
            *   Insufficiently validating user input before using it in Exposed queries for filtering or data retrieval related to authorization.
            *   **Exploit Input Validation Gaps to Access Unauthorized Data [CRITICAL]:**
                *   Providing unexpected or malicious input that bypasses application-level validation checks.
                *   This allows attackers to craft queries that retrieve data they are not authorized to access, by exploiting weaknesses in how the application validates and uses input in Exposed queries for authorization purposes.
