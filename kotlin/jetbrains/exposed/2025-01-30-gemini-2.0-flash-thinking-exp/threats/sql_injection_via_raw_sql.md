### 4. Deep Analysis of Threat: SQL Injection via Raw SQL

#### 4.1. Introduction

SQL Injection is a critical vulnerability that arises when user-controlled input is incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. In the context of Exposed, while the framework strongly encourages and facilitates the use of its Domain Specific Language (DSL) for query construction, developers might still resort to raw SQL for various reasons, such as complex queries, leveraging database-specific features, or when integrating legacy SQL code.

The "SQL Injection via Raw SQL" threat specifically targets these instances where developers use raw SQL fragments or expressions within their Exposed applications. If not handled carefully, this practice can create openings for attackers to inject malicious SQL code, leading to severe security breaches.

#### 4.2. Mechanism of Exploitation in Exposed

Exposed provides several ways to incorporate raw SQL, which, if misused, can become injection points:

*   **`SqlExpressionBuilder.raw()`:** This function allows embedding raw SQL fragments directly within Exposed queries. If the arguments passed to `raw()` are not properly handled (i.e., not parameterized or sanitized), they can be manipulated by attackers.

    **Vulnerable Example:**

    ```kotlin
    import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.*
    import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.transactions.transaction

    fun findUserByNameRaw(name: String): String? {
        var userName: String? = null
        transaction {
            val result = exec("SELECT name FROM Users WHERE name = '${name}'") { rs ->
                if (rs.next()) {
                    userName = rs.getString("name")
                }
            }
        }
        return userName
    }

    fun main() {
        val database = Database.connect("jdbc:h2:mem:test", driver = "org.h2.Driver")
        transaction(database) {
            SchemaUtils.create(Users)
            Users.insert {
                it[Users.name] = "Alice"
            }
        }

        val userInput = "Alice' OR '1'='1" // Malicious input
        val vulnerableUser = findUserByNameRaw(userInput)
        println("User found (vulnerable): $vulnerableUser") // Will likely return "Alice" or potentially more users if table structure allows.

        val userInputAttack = "'; DROP TABLE Users; --" // More malicious input
        try {
            findUserByNameRaw(userInputAttack) // Potentially disastrous if permissions allow
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            println("Error during vulnerable query (attack): ${e.message}") // Likely an SQL exception, but damage might be done.
        }
    }

    object Users : Table("Users") {
        val id = integer("id").autoIncrement()
        val name = varchar("name", 50)

        override val primaryKey = PrimaryKey(id)
    }
    ```

    In this example, the `findUserByNameRaw` function directly concatenates the `name` parameter into the SQL query string. An attacker can provide input like `' OR '1'='1` to bypass the intended query logic or even inject commands like `'; DROP TABLE Users; --` to potentially delete the entire table.

*   **Custom DSL Extensions using Raw SQL:** Developers might create custom DSL extensions to encapsulate complex or database-specific SQL logic. If these extensions internally use raw SQL without proper parameterization, they can become vulnerable.

    **Conceptual Vulnerable Custom DSL Extension:**

    ```kotlin
    // Hypothetical vulnerable custom DSL extension
    fun Table.searchByNameRaw(name: String): Query {
        return CustomQuery(SqlExpressionBuilder.raw("SELECT * FROM ${tableName} WHERE name = '${name}'"))
    }

    // ... Usage in application code ...
    // val users = Users.searchByNameRaw(userInput) // Vulnerable if userInput is not sanitized
    ```

    If a custom DSL extension like `searchByNameRaw` directly embeds user input into a raw SQL fragment, it inherits the same vulnerability as direct `SqlExpressionBuilder.raw()` usage.

*   **`exec()` function with String Interpolation:** While less direct, using `exec()` with string interpolation to build SQL queries can also lead to vulnerabilities if user input is not properly handled before being interpolated. The example above with `findUserByNameRaw` already demonstrates this using `exec()`.

#### 4.3. Detailed Impact Analysis

Successful SQL Injection via Raw SQL in Exposed applications can have severe consequences:

*   **Data Breach (Confidentiality Breach):** Attackers can craft SQL queries to bypass intended access controls and retrieve sensitive data from the database. This includes user credentials, personal information, financial records, and any other confidential data stored in the database. In the example above, by injecting `' OR '1'='1`, an attacker could potentially retrieve all user names instead of just a specific user. More complex injections could retrieve entire tables.
*   **Data Integrity Compromise (Data Modification/Deletion):** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database. This can range from altering user profiles to deleting critical business records. The `'; DROP TABLE Users; --` example demonstrates the potential for complete data loss. Malicious updates or inserts can also corrupt data integrity, leading to application malfunction and unreliable data.
*   **Account Takeover (Authentication Bypass):** By manipulating SQL queries related to authentication, attackers can bypass login mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to user accounts. For instance, an attacker might inject SQL to always return true for authentication checks, regardless of the actual credentials provided.
*   **Authorization Bypass:** Even if authentication is not directly bypassed, attackers can manipulate queries to circumvent authorization checks. They might be able to elevate their privileges or access resources they are not supposed to, by altering conditions in SQL queries that control access rights.
*   **Code Execution (in severe cases):** In the most critical scenarios, depending on the database system, its configuration, and the permissions of the database user the application uses, attackers might be able to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the database server. This is often achieved through database-specific stored procedures or functions that allow interaction with the operating system. While less common in typical web applications, this is a potential risk, especially if the database user has elevated privileges.

#### 4.4. In-depth Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate SQL Injection via Raw SQL in Exposed applications, the following strategies are crucial:

*   **Prioritize DSL and Parameterized Queries:** **Always favor Exposed's DSL for query construction whenever possible.** The DSL is designed to be inherently safe from SQL injection when used correctly. It automatically handles parameterization, preventing user input from being directly interpreted as SQL code.

    **Secure DSL Example (using Exposed DSL - Parameterized by Default):**

    ```kotlin
    import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.*
    import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.transactions.transaction

    fun findUserByNameDSL(name: String): String? {
        var userName: String? = null
        transaction {
            val user = Users.select { Users.name eq name }.singleOrNull()
            userName = user?.get(Users.name)
        }
        return userName
    }

    fun main() {
        val database = Database.connect("jdbc:h2:mem:test", driver = "org.h2.Driver")
        transaction(database) {
            SchemaUtils.create(Users)
            Users.insert {
                it[Users.name] = "Alice"
            }
        }

        val userInput = "Alice' OR '1'='1" // Malicious input
        val secureUser = findUserByNameDSL(userInput)
        println("User found (secure DSL): $secureUser") // Will return null as no user with the literal name "Alice' OR '1'='1" exists.

        val userInputAttack = "'; DROP TABLE Users; --" // More malicious input
        val secureUserAttack = findUserByNameDSL(userInputAttack)
        println("User found (secure DSL - attack): $secureUserAttack") // Will return null, no table drop will occur.
    }

    object Users : Table("Users") {
        val id = integer("id").autoIncrement()
        val name = varchar("name", 50)

        override val primaryKey = PrimaryKey(id)
    }
    ```

    In the `findUserByNameDSL` example, using `Users.select { Users.name eq name }` leverages Exposed's DSL. The `name` parameter is treated as a value, not as SQL code, effectively preventing injection.

*   **Parameterization for Raw SQL (when absolutely necessary):** If raw SQL is unavoidable (e.g., for very specific database features not supported by the DSL), **always use parameterized queries**. Exposed provides mechanisms for parameterization even with raw SQL.  Avoid string concatenation or interpolation of user input directly into raw SQL strings.

    **Secure Raw SQL Example with Parameterization (using `SqlExpressionBuilder.raw()` with parameters):**

    ```kotlin
    import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.*
    import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.transactions.transaction

    fun findUserByNameRawParameterized(name: String): String? {
        var userName: String? = null
        transaction {
            val result = exec("SELECT name FROM Users WHERE name = ?", listOf(name)) { rs -> // Parameterized query
                if (rs.next()) {
                    userName = rs.getString("name")
                }
            }
        }
        return userName
    }

    fun main() {
        val database = Database.connect("jdbc:h2:mem:test", driver = "org.h2.Driver")
        transaction(database) {
            SchemaUtils.create(Users)
            Users.insert {
                it[Users.name] = "Alice"
            }
        }

        val userInput = "Alice' OR '1'='1" // Malicious input
        val parameterizedUser = findUserByNameRawParameterized(userInput)
        println("User found (parameterized raw): $parameterizedUser") // Will return null as no user with the literal name "Alice' OR '1'='1" exists.

        val userInputAttack = "'; DROP TABLE Users; --" // More malicious input
        val parameterizedUserAttack = findUserByNameRawParameterized(userInputAttack)
        println("User found (parameterized raw - attack): $parameterizedUserAttack") // Will return null, no table drop will occur.
    }

    object Users : Table("Users") {
        val id = integer("id").autoIncrement()
        val name = varchar("name", 50)

        override val primaryKey = PrimaryKey(id)
    }
    ```

    In `findUserByNameRawParameterized`, the `?` placeholder and the `listOf(name)` argument ensure that the `name` is treated as a parameter value, not as SQL code. This effectively prevents SQL injection even when using raw SQL.

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While parameterization is the primary defense, **input validation and sanitization provide an additional layer of security.** Validate user inputs to ensure they conform to expected formats and lengths. Sanitize inputs by escaping or removing potentially harmful characters, especially if you are dealing with legacy code or situations where parameterization might be overlooked. However, **input validation should not be considered a replacement for parameterization.** It's a supplementary measure.

    *   **Example Validation:** Check if the `name` input only contains alphanumeric characters and spaces, and is within a reasonable length limit.
    *   **Example Sanitization (less recommended as primary defense):**  Escape single quotes and other special SQL characters in the input string before using it in raw SQL (though parameterization is strongly preferred).

*   **Strict Code Review Processes:** Implement rigorous code review processes, specifically focusing on identifying any instances of raw SQL usage or custom DSL extensions that might be vulnerable to SQL injection. Code reviewers should be trained to recognize potential injection points and ensure that parameterization or other appropriate mitigation techniques are in place.

*   **Static and Dynamic Analysis Tools:** Utilize static analysis security testing (SAST) tools to automatically scan the codebase for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. These tools can identify patterns of raw SQL usage and flag potential risks. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools can also be used to test the running application for SQL injection vulnerabilities by injecting malicious payloads and observing the application's behavior.

*   **Principle of Least Privilege for Database Users:** Ensure that the database user account used by the application has only the necessary permissions required for its operation. Avoid granting excessive privileges like `DROP TABLE` or `EXECUTE` unless absolutely necessary. Limiting database user privileges can reduce the potential damage from a successful SQL injection attack.

#### 4.5. Detection and Prevention

*   **Code Audits:** Regularly conduct manual code audits, specifically looking for raw SQL usage and ensuring proper parameterization is in place.
*   **Static Analysis Tools:** Integrate SAST tools into the development pipeline to automatically detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities during code commits or builds.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Perform DAST on deployed applications to identify runtime SQL injection vulnerabilities. Tools can automatically inject various payloads to test for weaknesses.
*   **Penetration Testing:** Engage security professionals to conduct penetration testing, including SQL injection testing, to identify vulnerabilities in a realistic attack scenario.
*   **Security Training:** Provide regular security training to developers, focusing on secure coding practices, SQL injection prevention, and the proper use of Exposed's DSL and parameterization features.

#### 4.6. Conclusion

SQL Injection via Raw SQL is a critical threat in Exposed applications that must be taken seriously. While Exposed's DSL provides a robust and secure way to interact with databases, the temptation to use raw SQL for complex or database-specific tasks can introduce significant vulnerabilities if not handled with extreme care.

By prioritizing the use of Exposed's DSL, rigorously parameterizing raw SQL when absolutely necessary, implementing input validation, conducting thorough code reviews, and utilizing security testing tools, development teams can effectively mitigate the risk of SQL Injection via Raw SQL and build secure and resilient Exposed-based applications.  **The key takeaway is to treat raw SQL with extreme caution and always prefer the parameterized and DSL-driven approach offered by Exposed for safe and secure database interactions.**
