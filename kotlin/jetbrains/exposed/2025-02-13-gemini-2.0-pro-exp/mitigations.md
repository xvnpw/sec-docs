## Mitigation Strategy: [Prioritize Exposed DSL over Raw SQL](./mitigation_strategies/prioritize_exposed_dsl_over_raw_sql.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Use Exposed's type-safe DSL for all database interactions whenever possible.

**Description:**
1.  **Identify all existing database interactions:** Review the codebase to find all instances where database queries are made.
2.  **Convert raw SQL to DSL:** For each instance of raw SQL, rewrite the query using Exposed's DSL functions (e.g., `select`, `insert`, `update`, `delete`, `where`, etc.).
3.  **Test thoroughly:** After each conversion, rigorously test the functionality to ensure it behaves identically to the original raw SQL query.  Include unit and integration tests.
4.  **Code Reviews:**  Mandate code reviews for *all* database interaction code, with a specific focus on ensuring the DSL is used correctly and no raw SQL is introduced without explicit justification and review.
5.  **Establish Coding Standards:**  Create and enforce coding standards that require the use of the DSL and prohibit raw SQL except in exceptional, documented cases.
6.  **Regular Audits:** Periodically audit the codebase to identify any instances of raw SQL that may have slipped through.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **SQL Injection (Severity: Critical):** The primary threat.  The DSL generates parameterized queries, preventing attackers from injecting malicious SQL code.
*   **Data Type Mismatches (Severity: Medium):** The DSL's type safety helps prevent errors caused by passing incorrect data types to the database.

**Impact:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Risk reduced from *Critical* to *Very Low* (assuming proper DSL usage and no raw SQL).
*   **Data Type Mismatches:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Implemented in the `User` and `Product` modules (e.g., `src/main/kotlin/com/example/models/User.kt`, `src/main/kotlin/com/example/services/ProductService.kt`).  All database interactions in these modules use the Exposed DSL.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   The `Reporting` module (`src/main/kotlin/com/example/reporting/ReportGenerator.kt`) still uses some raw SQL for complex report generation. This needs to be refactored to use the DSL or, if absolutely necessary, carefully parameterized raw SQL with thorough validation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe Handling of Raw SQL (When Unavoidable) with `exec()`](./mitigation_strategies/safe_handling_of_raw_sql__when_unavoidable__with__exec___.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** If raw SQL is absolutely necessary, use Exposed's `exec()` function with parameterized queries.

**Description:**
1.  **Justification:**  Document *why* raw SQL is required.  Explain why the DSL cannot be used.
2.  **Parameterized Queries:** Use Exposed's `exec()` function with placeholders (`?`) for all user-provided data.  Pass the data as separate parameters to the `exec()` function *within the lambda provided to `exec`*.  This is crucial for Exposed to handle the parameterization correctly.
3.  **Code Review:**  Subject all raw SQL code to rigorous code review by a security expert.
4.  **Testing:**  Create specific test cases to attempt SQL injection attacks against the raw SQL, even with parameterization, to ensure its robustness.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **SQL Injection (Severity: Critical):** Even with raw SQL, parameterization using `exec()` significantly reduces the risk.

**Impact:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Risk reduced from *Critical* to *Low* (assuming proper parameterization).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Partially implemented in the `Admin` module (`src/main/kotlin/com/example/admin/DatabaseUtils.kt`), where a helper function for parameterized raw SQL execution using `exec()` exists.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   The `Reporting` module (mentioned above) uses raw SQL without consistent parameterization using `exec()`. This is a high-priority area for remediation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure `like()`, `regexp()`, and Similar DSL Functions](./mitigation_strategies/secure__like______regexp_____and_similar_dsl_functions.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Properly handle user input within Exposed's `like()` and `regexp()` DSL functions.

**Description:**
1.  **`like()` Escaping:** Create a utility function to escape special characters (`%` and `_`) in user input used with Exposed's `like()` function.  Apply this function consistently *before* passing the input to `like()`.
2. **Code Review:** Pay close attention to the use of `like()` and `regexp()` in code reviews, ensuring that user input is properly handled.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **SQL Injection (Severity: Medium):**  Improperly escaped `like()` patterns can lead to injection, even within the DSL.

**Impact:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   No specific implementation for escaping `like()` patterns.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   `like()` escaping needs to be implemented and consistently applied to all uses of the `like()` function within the Exposed DSL.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Prevent Dynamic Table/Column Names within the DSL](./mitigation_strategies/prevent_dynamic_tablecolumn_names_within_the_dsl.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Never use user input to construct table or column names, even within Exposed's DSL.

**Description:**
1.  **Hardcode Table/Column Names:** Table and column names should be hardcoded as references to Exposed `Table` objects and their `Column` properties.
2.  **Whitelist (If Necessary):**  If dynamic selection is *absolutely* unavoidable, create an enum or a strictly controlled list of allowed table/column *objects* (not strings).  Validate user input against this whitelist and use the corresponding *object* in your Exposed query.  Do *not* construct strings.
3.  **Code Review:** Flag any code that dynamically constructs table or column names based on user input, even if it appears to be within the DSL.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **SQL Injection (Severity: Critical):** Dynamic table/column names are a major injection vector.

**Impact:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Risk reduced from *Critical* to *Very Low* (if whitelisting is properly implemented using object references).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Generally followed throughout the project. Table and column names are mostly hardcoded as object references.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   One instance identified in a legacy reporting function (`src/main/kotlin/com/example/reporting/LegacyReport.kt`) where a column name is partially constructed from user input. This needs to be refactored.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicit Column Selection with `select`](./mitigation_strategies/explicit_column_selection_with__select_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Always explicitly list the required columns using Exposed's `select` function.

**Description:**
1.  **Avoid `selectAll()`:** Use `select(column1, column2, ...)` instead of `selectAll()` or omitting the `select` call entirely.  Explicitly name the `Column` objects you need.
2.  **Code Review:** Ensure that all `select` statements explicitly list the required columns.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Leakage (Severity: Medium):** Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data or internal database structure by only retrieving necessary columns.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Leakage:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Mostly implemented. Most queries use `select` with explicit column names.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Some older queries might be missing explicit `select` calls, potentially retrieving all columns.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Eager Loading with `with()`](./mitigation_strategies/eager_loading_with__with___.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Use Exposed's `with()` function for eager loading of related entities.

**Description:**
1.  **Identify N+1 Queries:** Use profiling tools or database monitoring to identify instances of the N+1 query problem, where fetching a list of entities results in separate queries for each related entity.
2.  **Use `with()`:** When fetching entities with relationships, use the `with(relatedTable)` function within your `select` or other query building functions to eagerly load related entities in a single query.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** The N+1 problem can make the application vulnerable to DoS attacks by overwhelming the database.

**Impact:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `with()` is used in some parts of the codebase, but not consistently.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   A comprehensive review of database interactions is needed to identify and fix all N+1 query problems by applying `with()` appropriately.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Correct Transaction Management with `transaction` Blocks](./mitigation_strategies/correct_transaction_management_with__transaction__blocks.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Use Exposed's `transaction` blocks correctly.

**Description:**
1.  **`transaction` Blocks:** Wrap all database operations within `transaction { ... }` blocks.  This ensures that operations are atomic and that connections are managed correctly.
2.  **Nested Transactions:** If nested transactions are needed, use `TransactionManager.manager.newTransaction()` to create a new, independent transaction *within* the outer `transaction` block.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Inconsistency (Severity: High):** Incorrect transaction management can lead to inconsistent data.
*   **Resource Leaks (Severity: Medium):** Uncommitted transactions can hold database resources indefinitely.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Inconsistency:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Low*.
*   **Resource Leaks:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `transaction` blocks are generally used correctly.

**Missing Implementation:**
    *   Nested transactions are used in one module without `TransactionManager.manager.newTransaction()`.
