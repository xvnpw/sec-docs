## Attack Tree Path: [[!!! Attacker's Goal: Unauthorized Data Access/Modification/Exfiltration/Disruption !!!]](./attack_tree_paths/_!!!_attacker's_goal_unauthorized_data_accessmodificationexfiltrationdisruption_!!!_.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker is to gain unauthorized access to the database, modify its contents, exfiltrate sensitive data, or disrupt the application's database operations. This is the overarching goal driving all other attack steps.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Complete compromise of data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
*   **Why Critical:** This is the root of the entire attack tree and defines the attacker's objective.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1. SQL Injection via Exposed]](./attack_tree_paths/_1__sql_injection_via_exposed_.md)

*   **Description:** This branch represents attacks that attempt to inject malicious SQL code through the Exposed framework. Even though Exposed is designed to prevent SQL injection, vulnerabilities can arise from improper usage.
*   **Why High-Risk:** SQL injection is a well-known and highly impactful attack vector.  It can lead to complete database compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.1 Insufficient Input Validation]](./attack_tree_paths/_1_1_insufficient_input_validation_.md)

*   **Description:** This node represents vulnerabilities arising from inadequate validation of user-supplied data before it's used in database queries.
*   **Why High-Risk:** This is a common source of SQL injection vulnerabilities.  It's the gateway to the critical node 1.1.1.

## Attack Tree Path: [[!!! 1.1.1 Raw SQL in `exec` with Unsafe Input !!!]](./attack_tree_paths/_!!!_1_1_1_raw_sql_in__exec__with_unsafe_input_!!!_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most critical vulnerability within the SQL injection branch. It involves using the `exec` function in Exposed with raw SQL strings that incorporate unsanitized user input. This allows an attacker to directly inject and execute arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Developers might use `exec` for various reasons, despite the risks.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Complete database compromise, including data theft, modification, and deletion.
*   **Effort:** Low - Standard SQL injection techniques are applicable.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires understanding of SQL injection and the target database.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Detectable through code reviews, static analysis, and potentially IDS.
*   **Why Critical:** Direct and complete control over the database is achieved upon successful exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [[2. Misconfiguration of Exposed Features]](./attack_tree_paths/_2__misconfiguration_of_exposed_features_.md)

*   **Description:** This branch represents attacks that exploit misconfigurations in how Exposed is set up and used, rather than direct code vulnerabilities.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Misconfigurations can create significant security weaknesses, often with low effort required for exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [[!!! 2.2 Overly Permissive Database User Permissions !!!]](./attack_tree_paths/_!!!_2_2_overly_permissive_database_user_permissions_!!!_.md)

*   **Description:** This node represents the critical vulnerability of granting excessive permissions to the database user account that the Exposed application uses to connect to the database.
*   **Why Critical:** This drastically lowers the barrier to entry for *any* other attack.  Even a minor vulnerability can be escalated to a full compromise if the database user has excessive privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [[!!! 2.2.1 Granting Excessive Database Privileges to Non-Admin Users !!!]](./attack_tree_paths/_!!!_2_2_1_granting_excessive_database_privileges_to_non-admin_users_!!!_.md)

*   **Description:** This specific misconfiguration involves granting privileges like CREATE, DROP, ALTER, or excessive SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE permissions to the database user account used by the application. This allows an attacker, who has compromised the application in some way (even a minor way), to perform actions far beyond what the application is intended to do.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - A common oversight, especially in development or poorly managed environments.
*   **Impact:** High - Significantly increases the damage potential of any other vulnerability.
*   **Effort:** Very Low - Trivial to exploit if another vulnerability is present.
*   **Skill Level:** Novice - Requires minimal technical skill.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy - Easily detected through database configuration checks.
*   **Why Critical:** This directly amplifies the impact of other vulnerabilities, making even minor flaws highly dangerous.
