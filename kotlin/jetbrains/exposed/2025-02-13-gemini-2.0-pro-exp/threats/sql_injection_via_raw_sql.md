# Deep Analysis: SQL Injection via Raw SQL in JetBrains Exposed

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "SQL Injection via Raw SQL" threat within the context of a JetBrains Exposed-based application.  This includes:

*   Identifying the specific mechanisms by which this vulnerability can be exploited.
*   Analyzing the potential impact of a successful attack.
*   Evaluating the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies.
*   Providing concrete examples and recommendations to developers to prevent this vulnerability.
*   Determining how to detect this vulnerability through code review and testing.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on SQL injection vulnerabilities arising from the *misuse* of raw SQL execution functions within the JetBrains Exposed framework (e.g., `exec`, `execAndGet`, `prepareSQL`).  It does *not* cover:

*   SQL injection vulnerabilities in other parts of the application (e.g., external libraries, direct database connections bypassing Exposed).
*   Other types of injection attacks (e.g., command injection, LDAP injection).
*   General database security best practices unrelated to Exposed (e.g., database user permissions).

### 1.3 Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review:** Examination of hypothetical and real-world code examples using Exposed to identify vulnerable patterns.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Extending the provided threat model with detailed attack scenarios.
*   **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Analyzing the Exposed source code (if necessary) to understand the underlying mechanisms of raw SQL execution.
*   **Mitigation Verification:**  Testing and demonstrating the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies.
*   **Best Practices Research:**  Consulting OWASP guidelines, security documentation, and community best practices for preventing SQL injection.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1 Attack Vectors and Exploitation Scenarios

The primary attack vector is user-supplied input that is directly incorporated into a raw SQL query string without proper sanitization or parameterization.  Here are several scenarios:

**Scenario 1:  Direct Concatenation**

```kotlin
// VULNERABLE CODE
val userInput = request.getParameter("id") // Assume this comes from a web request
TransactionManager.current().exec("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $userInput") { rs ->
    // Process the result set
}
```

*   **Exploitation:** An attacker could provide `1; DROP TABLE users; --` as the `id` parameter.  This would result in the following SQL being executed:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1; DROP TABLE users; --
    ```
    This would delete the `users` table.

**Scenario 2:  Slightly "Safer" but Still Vulnerable Concatenation**

```kotlin
// VULNERABLE CODE
val userInput = request.getParameter("username")
TransactionManager.current().exec("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$userInput'") { rs ->
    // Process the result set
}
```

*   **Exploitation:**  An attacker could provide `' OR '1'='1` as the `username`. This results in:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1'
    ```
    This bypasses authentication and returns all users.  More sophisticated attacks could extract data using `UNION SELECT`.

**Scenario 3:  Using `prepareSQL` Incorrectly**

```kotlin
// VULNERABLE CODE
val userInput = request.getParameter("id")
val sql = TransactionManager.current().connection.prepareSQL("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $userInput")
// ... execute the prepared statement
```

*   **Exploitation:**  `prepareSQL` by itself does *not* provide protection against SQL injection if you are still concatenating user input into the SQL string.  It simply prepares the statement; it doesn't parameterize it in a safe way in this usage.  The same attacks as Scenario 1 apply.

**Scenario 4:  Bypassing Weak Input Validation**

```kotlin
// VULNERABLE CODE
fun isValidId(id: String): Boolean {
    return id.matches(Regex("\\d+")) // Only allows digits
}

val userInput = request.getParameter("id")
if (isValidId(userInput)) {
    TransactionManager.current().exec("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $userInput") { ... }
}
```

*   **Exploitation:** While the regex attempts to validate the input, it's insufficient.  An attacker could still inject SQL using techniques like:
    *   `1 UNION SELECT ...` (if the database allows stacked queries)
    *   `1; WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'; --` (for time-based attacks)
    *   Exploiting database-specific functions or features.

### 2.2 Impact Analysis

The impact of a successful SQL injection attack via raw SQL in Exposed is severe and can include:

*   **Data Breach:**  Attackers can read sensitive data from any table in the database.
*   **Data Modification:**  Attackers can insert, update, or delete data, potentially corrupting the database or causing application malfunctions.
*   **Data Loss:** Attackers can drop tables or entire databases.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Attackers can execute resource-intensive queries or shut down the database server.
*   **Authentication Bypass:**  Attackers can bypass login mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to the application.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Attackers might be able to gain administrative privileges within the database.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  In some database systems (e.g., through functions like `xp_cmdshell` in SQL Server), SQL injection can lead to RCE on the database server itself, giving the attacker complete control of the server.

### 2.3 Mitigation Strategy Evaluation

Let's evaluate the provided mitigation strategies:

*   **Primary: Avoid raw SQL whenever possible. Use Exposed's DSL for all database interactions.**  This is the **most effective** mitigation.  The DSL inherently uses parameterized queries, eliminating the risk of SQL injection.  This should be the default approach.

*   **If raw SQL is unavoidable: Use parameterized queries *exclusively*.  Use `?` placeholders and pass values as a separate list.  *Never* concatenate user input directly into the SQL string.** This is the **correct** way to use raw SQL safely.  Here's a correct example:

    ```kotlin
    // CORRECT - Parameterized Query
    val userInput = request.getParameter("id")
    TransactionManager.current().exec("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?") {
        setString(1, userInput) // Set the parameter value
        // ... process the result set
    }

    //Alternative with exec with args
    val userInput = request.getParameter("id")
    TransactionManager.current().exec("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", listOf(userInput)) {
        // ... process the result set
    }
    ```

*   **Implement strict input validation and sanitization *before* any data is used, even with parameterized queries (defense in depth).** This is a good **supplementary** measure, but it should *never* be the *primary* defense.  Input validation is complex and prone to errors.  Rely on parameterization as the first line of defense.  Sanitization (e.g., escaping special characters) is generally *not recommended* for SQL; parameterization handles this correctly.

*   **Use static analysis tools to detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.**  This is **highly recommended**.  Tools like FindBugs, SpotBugs, SonarQube, and IntelliJ IDEA's built-in inspections can often detect string concatenation in SQL queries.

*   **Regularly update Exposed to the latest version.**  This is a general good practice, as security vulnerabilities are sometimes discovered and patched in libraries.

### 2.4 Detection and Testing

*   **Code Review:**  Manually inspect all uses of `exec`, `execAndGet`, `prepareSQL`, and related functions.  Look for any instance where user input is concatenated into the SQL string.  This is the most crucial detection method.

*   **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools (as mentioned above) to automatically flag potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Dynamic Analysis (Penetration Testing):**  Use penetration testing tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) to attempt SQL injection attacks against the running application.  This can help identify vulnerabilities that might be missed during code review.

*   **Unit/Integration Tests:**  Write tests that specifically attempt to inject malicious SQL.  These tests should *fail* if the application is properly protected.  For example:

    ```kotlin
    @Test
    fun testSqlInjectionAttempt() {
        // Attempt to inject SQL
        val maliciousInput = "1; DROP TABLE users; --"
        assertThrows<Exception> { // Or a more specific exception
            // Call the function that uses raw SQL, passing the malicious input
            myService.getUserById(maliciousInput)
        }
    }
    ```

## 3. Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize the DSL:**  Make it a strict rule to use Exposed's DSL for *all* database interactions unless absolutely impossible.

2.  **Mandatory Code Reviews:**  Enforce code reviews for *any* code that uses raw SQL functions, with a specific focus on identifying potential injection vulnerabilities.

3.  **Parameterized Queries Only:**  If raw SQL is unavoidable, *never* concatenate user input.  Use parameterized queries with `?` placeholders and pass values separately.

4.  **Static Analysis Integration:**  Integrate static analysis tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

5.  **Penetration Testing:**  Regularly conduct penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities that might be missed during code review and static analysis.

6.  **Training:**  Provide developers with training on secure coding practices, specifically focusing on SQL injection prevention in the context of JetBrains Exposed.

7.  **Documentation:** Clearly document the risks of using raw SQL and the proper way to use parameterized queries within the project's coding guidelines.

8. **Database User Permissions:** Even with perfect code, limit database user permissions. The application's database user should only have the minimum necessary privileges (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE on specific tables). It should *never* have permissions like DROP TABLE or CREATE USER. This limits the damage from a successful SQL injection attack.

By following these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities in their Exposed-based application.
