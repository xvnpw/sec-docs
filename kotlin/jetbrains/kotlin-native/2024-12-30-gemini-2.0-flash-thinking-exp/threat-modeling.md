*   **Threat:** Binary Patching and Tampering
    *   **Description:** An attacker could directly modify the compiled native binary *generated by Kotlin/Native* to inject malicious code, bypass security checks, or alter the application's functionality. This could be done using binary editing tools after the application is built and distributed.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution, data breaches, denial of service, or complete compromise of the application's integrity and functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:** Compiled native binary.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement code signing to verify the integrity of the binary.
        *   Employ anti-tampering techniques (though these can be bypassed with sufficient effort).
        *   Distribute the application through secure channels.
        *   Regularly check the integrity of the deployed binary.

*   **Threat:** Reverse Engineering and Information Disclosure
    *   **Description:** Attackers can analyze the compiled native binary *produced by the Kotlin/Native compiler* using disassemblers and decompilers to understand the application's logic, identify vulnerabilities, and potentially extract sensitive information like API keys, cryptographic secrets, or business logic.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, intellectual property theft, identification of exploitable vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** Compiled native binary.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Apply code obfuscation techniques (though Kotlin/Native's obfuscation capabilities might be less mature than JVM).
        *   Avoid embedding sensitive information directly in the code.
        *   Implement security-by-design principles to minimize the impact of information disclosure.
        *   Use platform-specific security features to protect sensitive data at rest.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Linked Native Libraries
    *   **Description:** Kotlin/Native applications often interoperate with C/C++ libraries. If these native libraries contain security vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit them *through the Kotlin/Native application's interop mechanism*.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution, data breaches, denial of service, depending on the vulnerability in the native library.
    *   **Affected Component:** Native interop boundary, linked native libraries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet and select native libraries from trusted sources.
        *   Keep all native library dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Use static analysis tools on native code where possible.
        *   Implement sandboxing or isolation techniques to limit the impact of vulnerabilities in native libraries.

*   **Threat:** Memory Corruption through Native Interop
    *   **Description:** Incorrect handling of memory or data types when interacting with native C/C++ code *using Kotlin/Native's foreign function interface* can lead to memory corruption vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or use-after-free errors. Attackers could exploit these to gain control of the application.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution, crashes, data corruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** Native interop boundary, Kotlin/Native foreign function interface (FFI).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Exercise extreme caution when writing and reviewing native interop code.
        *   Use safe memory management practices in native code.
        *   Employ memory safety tools and techniques (e.g., AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer) during development and testing.
        *   Thoroughly validate data passed between Kotlin/Native and native code.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in the Kotlin/Native Runtime Library
    *   **Description:** The Kotlin/Native runtime library itself could contain security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution, crashes, unexpected behavior.
    *   **Affected Component:** Kotlin/Native runtime library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Kotlin/Native compiler and runtime environment updated to the latest stable version, which includes security fixes.
        *   Monitor security advisories related to Kotlin/Native.
