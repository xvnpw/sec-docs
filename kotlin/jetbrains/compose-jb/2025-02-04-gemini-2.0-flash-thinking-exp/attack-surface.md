# Attack Surface Analysis for jetbrains/compose-jb

## Attack Surface: [1. Compose-jb Library Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/1__compose-jb_library_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of bugs and security flaws directly within the Compose-jb framework libraries. This includes vulnerabilities in core functionalities like UI rendering, input handling, state management, and framework APIs.
*   **Compose-jb Contribution:**  These vulnerabilities are inherent to the Compose-jb framework code itself. Using Compose-jb directly introduces this attack surface.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in Compose-jb's layout algorithm could be exploited by crafting a specific UI structure that triggers a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issue during rendering. This could lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, significant application instability or compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if code execution is possible), **High** (for significant data breach or denial of service).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers & Users:**  **Crucially, keep Compose-jb library dependencies updated to the latest stable versions.** Monitor JetBrains security advisories and Compose-jb release notes for vulnerability patches.
    *   **Developers:**  Perform rigorous security testing specifically targeting Compose-jb framework interactions. Participate in the Compose-jb community and report any potential security issues found. Consider static and dynamic analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in Compose-jb usage within the application.

## Attack Surface: [2. Canvas API/Compose-jb Web Renderer Vulnerabilities (Web Targets)](./attack_surfaces/2__canvas_apicompose-jb_web_renderer_vulnerabilities__web_targets_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the *Compose-jb web renderer code* that translates Compose UI instructions into Canvas API calls, or vulnerabilities specifically arising from *Compose-jb's interaction* with the browser's Canvas API. This is distinct from general browser Canvas vulnerabilities, focusing on issues introduced by Compose-jb's rendering process.
*   **Compose-jb Contribution:** Compose-jb for Web's rendering pipeline directly relies on the Compose-jb web renderer and its interaction with the Canvas API. Vulnerabilities here are directly related to the framework's web implementation.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in the Compose-jb web renderer could allow for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the renderer incorrectly handles user-controlled data when drawing text or images on the Canvas.  For instance, if Compose-jb fails to properly sanitize SVG data rendered on the canvas, malicious SVG code could be injected and executed in the browser context.
*   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, website defacement, or further malicious actions within the user's browser context.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (due to XSS potential).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers & Users:** Keep web browsers updated to benefit from general browser security patches, including Canvas API fixes.
    *   **Developers:**  **Focus on secure coding practices within Compose-jb web application development, especially when handling user-provided data that is rendered on the Canvas.**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate any external data before using it in Compose UI that gets rendered via Canvas. Be aware of potential XSS vectors when dynamically generating Canvas content through Compose-jb.

## Attack Surface: [3. JavaScript Interop Vulnerabilities (Web Targets, High Impact Scenarios)](./attack_surfaces/3__javascript_interop_vulnerabilities__web_targets__high_impact_scenarios_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the bridge between Kotlin/WebAssembly and JavaScript *specifically when insecure JavaScript interop practices are used within a Compose-jb web application.* This focuses on vulnerabilities *introduced by the developer's use of interop in a Compose-jb context*, rather than general JS interop risks.
*   **Compose-jb Contribution:** While Compose-jb minimizes JavaScript, developers might choose to use interop for specific functionalities.  *Improperly secured interop within a Compose-jb application* becomes a Compose-jb related attack surface.
*   **Example:** A Compose-jb web application uses JavaScript interop to interact with a sensitive browser API (e.g., accessing cookies or local storage). If the Kotlin/WebAssembly code doesn't properly validate data received from JavaScript, or if the JavaScript code is vulnerable to injection, an attacker could manipulate the interop bridge to execute malicious JavaScript, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), code injection, unauthorized access to browser APIs and data, session hijacking, data theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (due to XSS and potential for sensitive data access).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** **Minimize JavaScript interop usage in Compose-jb web applications.** If interop is necessary, **implement strict input validation and sanitization on both the Kotlin/WebAssembly and JavaScript sides of the bridge.** Follow secure coding practices for JavaScript interop. Carefully design the interop interface to limit the exposed surface and potential for abuse. Consider alternative approaches that minimize or eliminate JavaScript dependency.

## Attack Surface: [4. Native Interoperability (JNI) Vulnerabilities (Desktop Targets, High Impact Scenarios)](./attack_surfaces/4__native_interoperability__jni__vulnerabilities__desktop_targets__high_impact_scenarios_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities arising from the use of Java Native Interface (JNI) *specifically when insecure native libraries or JNI practices are employed within a Compose-jb desktop application.*  This focuses on vulnerabilities *introduced by the developer's choice to use JNI in a Compose-jb context*, rather than general native code vulnerabilities.
*   **Compose-jb Contribution:** Compose-jb desktop applications can utilize JNI. *Insecure JNI usage within a Compose-jb application* directly contributes to the attack surface.
*   **Example:** A Compose-jb desktop application uses JNI to call a custom native library for performance reasons. If this native library contains a buffer overflow vulnerability, and the JNI interface doesn't properly validate input passed from the Compose-jb application to the native library, an attacker could exploit this buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code within the application's process.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, memory corruption, privilege escalation, complete system compromise depending on the privileges of the Compose-jb application.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (due to potential for code execution and privilege escalation).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** **Minimize JNI usage in Compose-jb desktop applications.** If JNI is essential, **use well-vetted, security-audited native libraries.** Implement robust security testing of native code, including static and dynamic analysis. **Design secure JNI interfaces with rigorous input validation and boundary checks at the JNI boundary.** Follow secure coding practices in native code to prevent memory corruption and other native code vulnerabilities. Apply the principle of least privilege to the Compose-jb application to limit the impact of potential native code exploits.
