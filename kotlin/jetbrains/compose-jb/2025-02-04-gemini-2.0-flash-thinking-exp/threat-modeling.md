# Threat Model Analysis for jetbrains/compose-jb

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation in Core Compose-jb Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation_in_core_compose-jb_dependencies.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a critical vulnerability within core dependencies of Compose-jb, such as the bundled Skia library or the Kotlin runtime libraries as distributed with Compose-jb. This could be achieved by crafting specific inputs or interactions that trigger the vulnerability within the application. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code, gain unauthorized access to system resources, or cause a denial of service.
**Impact:** Critical. Remote Code Execution, full application compromise, data breach, system takeover, denial of service.
**Affected Compose-jb Component:**  Compose-jb distribution, build system, core runtime environment, specifically dependencies like bundled Skia and Kotlin libraries.
**Risk Severity:** Critical.
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Immediately update Compose-jb** to the latest version upon release, especially when security updates are announced.
*   Monitor Compose-jb release notes and security advisories for dependency updates and security patches.
*   Implement dependency scanning to detect known vulnerabilities in Compose-jb's dependencies (although direct access to Compose-jb's internal dependencies might be limited, general dependency scanning practices are still valuable for application-level dependencies).

## Threat: [Skia Rendering Engine Remote Code Execution](./threats/skia_rendering_engine_remote_code_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker leverages a critical vulnerability within the Skia graphics rendering engine, which is integral to Compose-jb for UI rendering. By providing specially crafted graphical data (e.g., a malicious image, SVG, or drawing command processed by Compose-jb), the attacker can trigger the Skia vulnerability. This could lead to remote code execution within the application's process, allowing the attacker to gain full control over the application and potentially the user's system.
**Impact:** Critical. Remote Code Execution, full application compromise, potential system takeover.
**Affected Compose-jb Component:**  `compose.ui.graphics` module, core rendering pipeline, Skia integration within Compose-jb.
**Risk Severity:** Critical.
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Keep Compose-jb updated** to ensure the bundled Skia library is patched against known vulnerabilities. Compose-jb updates are the primary way to receive Skia security updates in this context.
*   Exercise extreme caution when processing untrusted or externally sourced graphical data within the Compose-jb application. Avoid displaying or processing images or vector graphics from unknown or untrusted origins if possible.
*   Consider implementing robust input validation and sanitization for any graphical data processed by the application, although this might be complex for binary graphical formats.

## Threat: [Native Interoperability Privilege Escalation](./threats/native_interoperability_privilege_escalation.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the way Compose-jb interacts with the underlying native operating system. This could involve weaknesses in the platform-specific code within Compose-jb that handles system calls, window management, or access to native APIs. By manipulating application behavior or providing specific inputs, an attacker could potentially escalate privileges, bypass security restrictions enforced by the operating system, or gain unauthorized access to system resources beyond the application's intended sandbox.
**Impact:** High. Privilege escalation, sandbox escape, unauthorized access to system resources, potential system compromise.
**Affected Compose-jb Component:**  Platform-specific modules (`compose.desktop.currentOs`, `compose.ui.platform`), native integration layer, bridging between JVM and native code.
**Risk Severity:** High.
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Stay updated with Compose-jb releases** as these may include fixes for native interoperability issues and security enhancements in platform-specific code.
*   Minimize the application's reliance on platform-specific APIs and native code where possible to reduce the attack surface.
*   Carefully review and audit any usage of platform-specific APIs within the application code, ensuring secure coding practices are followed.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege to application permissions and system access requirements.

## Threat: [WebView Remote Code Execution via Compose-jb Integration (If WebView is Used)](./threats/webview_remote_code_execution_via_compose-jb_integration__if_webview_is_used_.md)

**Description:** If the application utilizes `WebView` components, an attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the WebView implementation itself or in Compose-jb's integration of the WebView. This could involve delivering malicious web content that exploits browser engine vulnerabilities within the WebView, or finding flaws in the communication bridge between the Compose-jb application and the embedded WebView. Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution within the WebView context, potentially allowing the attacker to escape the WebView sandbox and compromise the entire Compose-jb application.
**Impact:** Critical. Remote Code Execution, WebView sandbox escape, full application compromise, potential system takeover.
**Affected Compose-jb Component:**  `compose.ui.awt.ComposePanel` (if using AWT WebView), WebView integration components within Compose-jb, communication channels between Compose-jb and WebView.
**Risk Severity:** Critical (if WebView is used and vulnerable).
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strongly consider avoiding `WebView` if possible** and implement UI natively in Compose-jb to eliminate WebView-related risks.
*   If `WebView` is absolutely necessary:
    *   **Keep Compose-jb updated** to benefit from any potential security updates related to WebView integration.
    *   Ensure the underlying WebView implementation (e.g., browser engine) is kept up-to-date with security patches (this might be indirectly managed by Compose-jb updates or require manual updates depending on the platform and WebView implementation).
    *   Strictly control the content loaded in the `WebView` and only load from highly trusted sources. Implement robust Content Security Policy (CSP).
    *   Sanitize and carefully validate any data passed between the Compose-jb application and the `WebView` to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
