# Attack Surface Analysis for jetbrains/compose-jb

## Attack Surface: [Native Interoperability Layer Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/native_interoperability_layer_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from the interaction between Compose-JB's JVM-based code and the underlying native platform APIs.
    * **How Compose-JB Contributes:** Compose-JB relies on native interop to render UI elements and interact with the operating system. Bugs or insecure practices in *Compose-JB's own* interop layer can be exploited.
    * **Example:** A crafted Compose UI element triggers a call through Compose-JB's JNI bridge to a native OS function with an overly long string, causing a buffer overflow in the native code due to insufficient bounds checking *within Compose-JB's interop logic*.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the application, system crashes, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Adhere to secure coding practices when writing or interacting with native code *within the Compose-JB application*.
            * Thoroughly validate and sanitize any data passed to native functions *through Compose-JB's interop layer*.
            * Regularly update Compose-JB to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in *its* interop layer.
            * Utilize memory-safe languages or libraries when implementing native components *integrated with Compose-JB*.

## Attack Surface: [Rendering Engine Exploits](./attack_surfaces/rendering_engine_exploits.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities within Compose-JB's rendering engine that could be exploited to cause unexpected behavior or security issues.
    * **How Compose-JB Contributes:** Compose-JB uses its own rendering engine to draw UI elements. Bugs *within this engine* can be triggered by specific UI configurations or data processed by Compose-JB.
    * **Example:** A specially crafted image or font displayed within a Compose UI triggers a memory corruption bug *in the Compose-JB rendering engine*, leading to a crash or potential code execution within the rendering process.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, information disclosure (e.g., leaking pixel data), potential remote code execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Stay updated with the latest versions of Compose-JB to benefit from rendering engine bug fixes *within the framework*.
            * Report any suspected rendering issues or crashes to the Compose-JB development team.
            * Be cautious when displaying external or untrusted content that could trigger rendering vulnerabilities *within the Compose-JB rendering pipeline*.
        * **Users:**
            * Keep the application updated to receive patches for rendering engine vulnerabilities *in the Compose-JB framework*.
