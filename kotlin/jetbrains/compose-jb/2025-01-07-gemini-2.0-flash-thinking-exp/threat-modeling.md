# Threat Model Analysis for jetbrains/compose-jb

## Threat: [Local Code Tampering](./threats/local_code_tampering.md)

*   **Threat:** Local Code Tampering
    *   **Description:** An attacker with local access modifies the installed Compose for Desktop application's files (e.g., JAR files, native libraries). This could involve injecting malicious code or replacing legitimate functionality.
    *   **Impact:** The tampered application could perform actions the user didn't intend, such as stealing data or installing malware.
    *   **Which `https://github.com/jetbrains/compose-jb` component is affected:** Application Packaging and Distribution (the structure of the built application), potentially interacting with the Kotlin/JVM runtime environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Developers should implement code signing.
        *   Consider implementing integrity checks within the application.
        *   Operating system level file permissions should be set appropriately.

## Threat: [Exploiting Native Interoperability Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_native_interoperability_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Native Interoperability Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** If the Compose for Desktop application interacts with native code (e.g., through JNI), vulnerabilities in that native code could be exploited. An attacker might leverage these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could potentially gain control over the user's system or steal data.
    *   **Which `https://github.com/jetbrains/compose-jb` component is affected:** The Interoperability layer between Kotlin/JVM and native code (JNI).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and audit any native libraries used.
        *   Use secure coding practices when writing JNI code.
        *   Employ sandboxing techniques if possible.

## Threat: [Compose Framework Vulnerabilities Leading to Privilege Escalation](./threats/compose_framework_vulnerabilities_leading_to_privilege_escalation.md)

*   **Threat:** Compose Framework Vulnerabilities Leading to Privilege Escalation
    *   **Description:** Potential vulnerabilities within the Compose for Desktop framework itself could be discovered and exploited. An attacker might leverage these vulnerabilities to gain elevated privileges beyond what the application should normally have.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to system resources or perform actions that should be restricted.
    *   **Which `https://github.com/jetbrains/compose-jb` component is affected:** Core components of the Compose for Desktop framework.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with the latest Compose for Desktop releases and security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories from JetBrains and the Kotlin community.
