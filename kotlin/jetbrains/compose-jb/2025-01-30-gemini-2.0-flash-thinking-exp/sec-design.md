# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Enable developers to build cross-platform desktop applications using Kotlin and a modern declarative UI framework.
 - Provide a productive and efficient development experience for desktop application development, leveraging existing Kotlin and JVM ecosystem knowledge.
 - Offer a cross-platform solution to reach users on Windows, macOS, and Linux from a single codebase.
 - Foster a vibrant community around Kotlin desktop development.
 - Reduce the cost and complexity of developing and maintaining desktop applications across multiple platforms.

- Most Important Business Risks:
 - Adoption risk: Developers may not adopt Compose for Desktop if it lacks features, has performance issues, or is not well-supported.
 - Platform compatibility risk: Changes in underlying operating systems or JVM versions could break compatibility and require significant rework.
 - Security vulnerabilities in the framework itself could impact all applications built with it.
 - Ecosystem maturity risk: The ecosystem of libraries and tools around Compose for Desktop might be less mature compared to established desktop UI frameworks.
 - Dependency risk: Reliance on JetBrains for the framework's development and maintenance.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Code hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's security features for repository access control and vulnerability scanning. Implemented: GitHub repository settings and GitHub security features.
 - security control: Open-source project, allowing community review and contribution to identify and fix potential security issues. Implemented: Open source nature of the project.
 - security control: Reliance on Kotlin and JVM security features. Implemented: Kotlin language and JVM platform security mechanisms.
 - accepted risk: Dependency on third-party libraries and components, which may introduce vulnerabilities. Accepted risk: inherent to software development and dependency management.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning) in the CI/CD pipeline.
 - security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the framework.
 - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process.
 - security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for developers using Compose for Desktop to build secure applications.
 - security control: Implement code signing for released artifacts to ensure integrity and authenticity.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication: Not directly applicable to the framework itself, but applications built with Compose for Desktop will need to implement their own authentication mechanisms if required.
 - Authorization: Similar to authentication, authorization is application-specific and needs to be implemented by developers using the framework.
 - Input Validation: Applications built with Compose for Desktop must implement robust input validation to prevent vulnerabilities like injection attacks. Framework should provide tools and guidance to facilitate secure input handling.
 - Cryptography: Applications may need to use cryptography for data protection. The framework should not impose restrictions on cryptographic libraries and should ideally provide secure defaults or recommendations where applicable (though unlikely for a UI framework).
