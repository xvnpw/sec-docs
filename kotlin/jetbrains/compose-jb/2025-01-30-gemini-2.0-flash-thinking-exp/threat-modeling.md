# Threat Model Analysis for jetbrains/compose-jb

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in a dependency used directly by Compose for Desktop, such as Skia or a specific Kotlin library used internally. They might craft malicious input or trigger specific application behavior that exploits the vulnerability within the Compose-jb framework, leading to code execution or other malicious outcomes within the desktop application.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Privilege Escalation, Information Disclosure.
*   **Compose-jb Component Affected:** Compose for Desktop framework core, including its internal dependencies like Skia rendering engine and Kotlin libraries.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Compose for Desktop framework to the latest versions.
    *   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) specifically to monitor dependencies used by Compose for Desktop.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories related to JetBrains Compose for Desktop and its core dependencies.
    *   Apply security patches released by JetBrains or upstream dependencies promptly.

## Threat: [Platform-Specific Implementation Bug Exploitation](./threats/platform-specific_implementation_bug_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages a critical bug or vulnerability specific to a particular operating system's native integration within Compose for Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux). This could involve exploiting flaws in how Compose-jb interacts with platform-specific APIs for window management, input handling, or accessibility, leading to crashes, unexpected behavior, or potentially privilege escalation on the target platform.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Platform-specific crashes, Privilege Escalation (in severe cases).
*   **Compose-jb Component Affected:** Platform-specific native bindings and integration modules within Compose for Desktop framework.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly test the application on all target platforms, focusing on platform-specific features and integrations of Compose for Desktop.
    *   Stay updated with Compose for Desktop releases and bug fixes, prioritizing platform-related security updates.
    *   Implement platform-specific security hardening measures where applicable to mitigate potential exploitation of OS-level vulnerabilities exposed through Compose-jb integration.
    *   Report any platform-specific bugs or unexpected behavior to the Compose for Desktop development team for investigation and patching.

## Threat: [Insecure Native Code Integration via Compose-jb Interoperability](./threats/insecure_native_code_integration_via_compose-jb_interoperability.md)

*   **Description:** If a Compose for Desktop application utilizes Compose-jb's interoperability features to integrate with native code (e.g., using `LocalWindow.current.rootPane.contentPane.add(...)` for AWT/Swing integration or platform channels for direct native calls), vulnerabilities in the *integrated native code* can be exploited through the Compose-jb application. An attacker could leverage the Compose-jb application as an entry point to trigger vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or insecure system calls within the custom native code, gaining control over the system.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Privilege Escalation, Data Corruption, System Compromise.
*   **Compose-jb Component Affected:** Compose for Desktop interoperability APIs and mechanisms that facilitate integration with external native code or libraries.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Minimize the necessity for native code integration within Compose for Desktop applications.
    *   Conduct rigorous security audits and penetration testing of all native code components integrated with Compose-jb applications.
    *   Enforce secure coding practices for all native code, including memory safety, robust input validation, and least privilege principles.
    *   Isolate native code execution with appropriate sandboxing or security boundaries to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Carefully review and restrict the permissions granted to native code integrations within the Compose-jb application context.

## Threat: [UI Rendering Engine (Skia) Vulnerability Exploitation via Compose-jb](./threats/ui_rendering_engine__skia__vulnerability_exploitation_via_compose-jb.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts specific UI elements or interactions within a Compose for Desktop application that exploit a critical vulnerability in the Skia rendering engine, which is a core component of Compose-jb responsible for UI rendering. By manipulating the UI through user input or application logic, the attacker could trigger a vulnerability in Skia's rendering process, potentially leading to code execution within the application's context or a denial of service due to rendering engine crashes.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (rendering engine crashes), UI manipulation leading to application instability.
*   **Compose-jb Component Affected:** Skia rendering engine as integrated and utilized by Compose for Desktop framework for UI rendering.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Compose for Desktop framework and its bundled Skia version updated to the latest releases, ensuring timely application of security patches for Skia vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor security advisories specifically related to Skia and graphics rendering engines, especially in the context of Compose for Desktop usage.
    *   Avoid utilizing experimental or potentially unstable UI features within Compose for Desktop that might rely on less hardened or more vulnerable parts of the Skia rendering engine.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the application, even for UI-related inputs, to prevent potential injection attacks that could trigger rendering engine vulnerabilities.
