# Attack Surface Analysis for jetbrains/compose-jb

## Attack Surface: [1. Compose UI Event Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/1__compose_ui_event_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs in Compose-jb's event handling logic can be exploited by sending malformed or unexpected UI events.
*   **Compose-jb Contribution:** Compose-jb uses its own event system, distinct from native platform event handling. Vulnerabilities within this custom system are specific to Compose-jb applications.
*   **Example:**  Sending a crafted sequence of mouse events that triggers an out-of-bounds access in the event processing code, leading to a crash or potentially memory corruption.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (application crash), potential for memory corruption or unexpected behavior.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Compose-jb Updates:** Keep Compose-jb libraries updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in the event handling system.
    *   **Fuzzing & Testing:**  Perform thorough testing, including fuzzing of UI event inputs, to identify potential vulnerabilities in event handling logic.

## Attack Surface: [2. Custom Component Vulnerabilities (Specific High-Risk Cases)](./attack_surfaces/2__custom_component_vulnerabilities__specific_high-risk_cases_.md)

*   **Description:** Insecurely implemented custom UI components can introduce vulnerabilities into the application, especially when they interact with platform APIs or handle sensitive data.
*   **Compose-jb Contribution:** Compose-jb's component-based architecture encourages custom UI elements.  While not inherently a Compose-jb vulnerability, the framework facilitates the creation of components that *can* become high-risk attack vectors if not developed securely, particularly when they bridge Compose-jb UI with native platform functionalities.
*   **Example:** A custom component in a Compose for Desktop application that directly uses JNI to interact with native code and has a command injection vulnerability due to improper input sanitization within the component's logic. This vulnerability is exposed through the Compose-jb UI.
*   **Impact:**  Code Execution, Privilege Escalation, System Compromise (in desktop scenarios), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in web scenarios if components handle web-related inputs unsafely.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature of the vulnerability and the component's role).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Follow secure coding guidelines when developing custom Compose-jb components, especially when interacting with native APIs or handling external data.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough security-focused code reviews of custom components, paying close attention to platform interactions and data handling.
    *   **Component Isolation & Sandboxing:**  Design components to be as isolated as possible and consider sandboxing techniques if components handle untrusted data or interact with sensitive resources.

## Attack Surface: [3. Compose Rendering Engine Bugs](./attack_surfaces/3__compose_rendering_engine_bugs.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs in the Compose-jb rendering engine can lead to crashes, resource exhaustion, or in more severe cases, potentially information disclosure or unexpected code execution paths.
*   **Compose-jb Contribution:** The rendering engine is a core, proprietary part of Compose-jb. Vulnerabilities within it are directly and uniquely related to using the framework.
*   **Example:**  Crafting a complex UI layout or animation that triggers a critical error in the rendering engine, leading to a crash or potentially exploitable memory corruption. In a theoretical worst-case scenario, a rendering bug could be exploited to influence program flow or memory in an unintended way.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, potentially Information Disclosure or in very rare scenarios, Code Execution (though less likely, the rendering engine is a complex component).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (DoS is likely, potential for more severe impacts cannot be entirely ruled out given the complexity of rendering engines).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Compose-jb Updates:**  Keep Compose-jb libraries updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in the rendering engine. This is the primary mitigation as rendering engine vulnerabilities are framework-level issues.
    *   **Resource Limits (Application Level):** Implement application-level resource limits to mitigate the impact of rendering-related resource exhaustion DoS attacks (e.g., limits on animation complexity, UI element count).

## Attack Surface: [4. Kotlin/JVM/Native Interop Vulnerabilities (Desktop - High Risk Scenarios)](./attack_surfaces/4__kotlinjvmnative_interop_vulnerabilities__desktop_-_high_risk_scenarios_.md)

*   **Description:**  While the interop itself isn't *inherently* a Compose-jb vulnerability, Compose for Desktop's reliance on Kotlin/JVM/Native interop means that vulnerabilities in *this specific interaction layer* become relevant to Compose-jb desktop applications, especially if Compose-jb code facilitates or exposes these interactions in a risky way.
*   **Compose-jb Contribution:** Compose for Desktop applications are built upon this interop. If Compose-jb code or patterns encourage or necessitate insecure native interactions, it contributes to the attack surface.
*   **Example:**  A Compose for Desktop application uses JNI to call native code for performance reasons, and a vulnerability exists in how data is passed between Kotlin/JVM and native code through JNI, potentially leading to buffer overflows or other memory safety issues exploitable from the Compose-jb application.
*   **Impact:** Code Execution, Privilege Escalation, System Compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (due to potential for code execution and system-level impact).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Native Code Development & JNI Usage:**  If using native code, rigorously apply secure coding practices for native development and JNI interactions. Thoroughly validate data passed across the JNI boundary.
    *   **JNI Security Reviews:**  Conduct dedicated security reviews of JNI interfaces and the native code they interact with.
    *   **Minimize Native Code Usage:**  Reduce reliance on native code where possible. Explore Kotlin/JVM alternatives to minimize the attack surface introduced by JNI.

## Attack Surface: [5. JavaScript Interop Vulnerabilities (Web - XSS via DOM manipulation)](./attack_surfaces/5__javascript_interop_vulnerabilities__web_-_xss_via_dom_manipulation_.md)

*   **Description:**  Incorrect or unsafe DOM manipulation by Compose-jb code in web applications can directly lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
*   **Compose-jb Contribution:** Compose for Web applications compile to JavaScript and interact with the DOM through Compose-jb's generated code. If Compose-jb's DOM manipulation logic is flawed or doesn't adequately handle user-controlled data, it directly contributes to XSS risks.
*   **Example:**  Compose-jb code dynamically generates UI elements based on user input and directly inserts this input into the DOM without proper sanitization or encoding, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the user's browser.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), potential for session hijacking, data theft, and other web-based attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (XSS vulnerabilities are typically considered high severity).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure DOM Manipulation Practices (within Compose-jb development):**  Ensure that Compose-jb development practices and generated code prioritize secure DOM manipulation.  (This is primarily a framework-level concern, but developers should be aware of potential pitfalls).
    *   **Output Encoding (Application Level):**  Even with framework-level best practices, developers must ensure proper output encoding of user-generated content within their application logic to prevent XSS.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strong Content Security Policy to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities, even if they arise from framework-level issues.
    *   **Regular Web Security Testing:**  Perform regular web security testing, specifically including XSS testing, on Compose for Web applications.
