## Mitigation Strategy: [Platform-Specific Code Isolation with `expect`/`actual`](./mitigation_strategies/platform-specific_code_isolation_with__expect__actual_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Platform-Specific Code Isolation using `expect`/`actual`.

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Compose-Related Platform Differences:** Analyze your Compose code for any areas where behavior or required APIs differ between Desktop and Web (or other future targets). This includes:
    *   **Window Management:**  Desktop applications have windows, while web applications run within a browser tab.  Window size, position, and state management are handled differently.
    *   **Input Handling:**  Mouse, keyboard, and touch events may have subtle differences across platforms.
    *   **Rendering:**  While Compose abstracts much of the rendering, there might be platform-specific rendering quirks or limitations.
    *   **Resource Loading:**  Loading images, fonts, or other resources might require platform-specific approaches.
    *   **Clipboard Access:** Accessing the system clipboard is platform-specific.
    *   **File System Access:** As previously mentioned, file system access is handled very differently.
2.  **Create `expect` Declarations:** In the common code, define `expect` declarations for any Compose-related functions or classes that need platform-specific implementations.
3.  **Implement `actual` Declarations:** In each platform-specific module (`desktopMain`, `webMain`), provide `actual` implementations that use the appropriate Compose APIs and platform-specific logic.
4.  **Use Common Code:** The rest of your Compose UI code interacts with these platform-specific features *only* through the `expect` declarations.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility Exploits (Medium Severity):** Prevents vulnerabilities that might arise from using platform-specific Compose APIs incorrectly on a different platform.  For example, attempting to directly manipulate a window handle in web code would be prevented.
*   **Inconsistent UI Behavior (Low Severity):** Ensures that the UI behaves consistently across platforms, reducing the risk of unexpected behavior that could be exploited.
*   **Resource Loading Issues (Low Severity):** Prevents issues with loading resources that might be handled differently on different platforms.

**Impact:**
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility Exploits:** Risk reduced moderately (60-70%). The `expect`/`actual` mechanism forces developers to consider platform-specific differences.
*   **Inconsistent UI Behavior:** Risk reduced significantly (70-80%).
*   **Resource Loading Issues:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Example: `src/commonMain/kotlin/ClipboardUtils.kt` (contains `expect` declarations for clipboard access).
*   Example: `src/desktopMain/kotlin/ClipboardUtils.kt` (contains `actual` implementation using AWT).
*   Example: `src/jsMain/kotlin/ClipboardUtils.kt` (contains `actual` implementation using the browser Clipboard API).

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Example: Window management (resizing, minimizing, etc.) is currently handled directly in the common code using desktop-specific APIs.  This needs to be refactored to use `expect`/`actual`.
*   Example: Image loading is done using a common library, but it might have platform-specific performance or security implications that need to be addressed with `expect`/`actual`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure State Management with `remember` and `rememberSaveable`](./mitigation_strategies/secure_state_management_with__remember__and__remembersaveable_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Understand and correctly use `remember` and `rememberSaveable`. Implement custom `Saver` for sensitive data. Clear sensitive state.

**Description:**
1.  **`remember` vs. `rememberSaveable`:** Use `remember` for in-memory state that *should* be cleared on recomposition or configuration changes. Use `rememberSaveable` *only* when state *must* persist across configuration changes or process death (e.g., user input in a form that should be preserved if the screen rotates).
2.  **Avoid Sensitive Data in `rememberSaveable`:** Do not store sensitive data (passwords, API keys, personal information) directly in `rememberSaveable` without additional protection.
3.  **Custom `Saver`:** If you *must* use `rememberSaveable` with sensitive data, implement a custom `Saver` that encrypts the data before saving and decrypts it when restoring.  Use platform-appropriate secure storage for the encryption keys (e.g., Keychain on macOS, Credential Manager on Windows, or a secure server-side solution for web).
4.  **Clear Sensitive State:** In `onDispose` blocks of Composables or within a ViewModel's `onCleared` method, explicitly clear sensitive state (e.g., set variables to `null` or empty strings). This is crucial to prevent data leaks.
5. **Consider Snapshot State:** For more complex state management, consider using `mutableStateOf` or `mutableStateListOf` within a ViewModel. This provides better control over state updates and allows for easier integration with unidirectional data flow patterns.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Leakage (Medium Severity):** Prevents sensitive data from being unintentionally persisted or exposed across configuration changes, application restarts, or even in memory dumps.
*   **Data Tampering (Low Severity):** Makes it more difficult for an attacker to modify persisted state if a custom `Saver` with encryption is used.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Leakage:** Risk reduced significantly (70-80%) with proper use of `remember`, `rememberSaveable`, custom `Saver` and clearing of sensitive state.
*   **Data Tampering:** Risk reduced moderately (50-60%) with a custom `Saver` and encryption.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Example: `remember` is used extensively for UI state.
*   Example: `rememberSaveable` is used in a few places to preserve form input.
*   Example: No custom `Saver` is implemented.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Example: Need to audit all uses of `rememberSaveable` and determine if they are truly necessary and if they involve sensitive data.
*   Example: Implement a custom `Saver` with encryption for any `rememberSaveable` usage that involves sensitive data.
*   Example: Add `onDispose` blocks to Composables and `onCleared` to ViewModels to clear sensitive state variables.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Management of Side Effects and Composition Lifecycle](./mitigation_strategies/careful_management_of_side_effects_and_composition_lifecycle.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Understand and carefully manage side effects and the Compose composition lifecycle.

**Description:**
1.  **`LaunchedEffect`:** Use `LaunchedEffect` to perform side effects (e.g., network requests, database operations) that should be tied to the lifecycle of a Composable.  Ensure that any cleanup (e.g., canceling network requests, closing database connections) is performed in the `onDispose` block of the `LaunchedEffect`.
2.  **`DisposableEffect`:** Use `DisposableEffect` for side effects that require more fine-grained control over their lifecycle, especially when dealing with resources that need to be acquired and released.
3.  **Avoid Side Effects in Composition:** Do *not* perform side effects directly within the body of a Composable function.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior and make it difficult to reason about the application's state.
4.  **Understand Recomposition:** Be aware of how recomposition works in Compose.  Avoid unnecessary recompositions, as they can impact performance and potentially trigger unintended side effects.
5. **Keying:** Use appropriate keys with `remember` and `LaunchedEffect` to control when they are re-executed. Incorrect keying can lead to unexpected behavior and potential memory leaks.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Resource Leaks (Low Severity):** Prevents memory leaks, file handle leaks, or other resource leaks caused by improperly managed side effects.
*   **Unintended Behavior (Low Severity):** Reduces the risk of unexpected behavior caused by side effects being triggered at the wrong time or multiple times.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Low - in specific cases):** In extreme cases, uncontrolled side effects (e.g., repeatedly launching network requests) could lead to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact:**
*   **Resource Leaks:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%) with proper use of `LaunchedEffect` and `DisposableEffect`.
*   **Unintended Behavior:** Risk reduced significantly (70-80%) by avoiding side effects in composition and understanding recomposition.
*   **DoS:** Risk reduction is context-dependent, but generally helps prevent uncontrolled resource consumption.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Example: `LaunchedEffect` is used in some places to fetch data from a network.
*   Example: No `DisposableEffect` is used.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Example: Need to review all Composables and ensure that side effects are handled correctly using `LaunchedEffect` or `DisposableEffect`.
*   Example: Need to add cleanup logic (e.g., canceling network requests) to the `onDispose` blocks of `LaunchedEffect`.
*   Example: Need to investigate potential resource leaks and address them using `DisposableEffect` where appropriate.
*   Example: Need to review keying of `remember` and `LaunchedEffect`.
