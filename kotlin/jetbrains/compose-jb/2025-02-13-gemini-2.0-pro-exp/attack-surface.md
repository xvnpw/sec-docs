# Attack Surface Analysis for jetbrains/compose-jb

## Attack Surface: [Skia Graphics Engine Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/skia_graphics_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities within the Skia graphics library, used for rendering on Desktop and Android.  This is a *direct* dependency of Compose Multiplatform.
    *   **How Compose Multiplatform Contributes:** Compose Multiplatform's rendering pipeline is *fundamentally* built upon Skia.  Any Skia vulnerability is inherently a Compose vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A crafted malicious image (e.g., a specially designed PNG or SVG) is loaded and rendered by a Compose `Image` composable, triggering a buffer overflow in Skia's image decoding code, leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution, denial-of-service, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Maintain the *absolute latest* version of Compose Multiplatform.  This is the *primary* defense, as JetBrains updates Skia with Compose releases.  Monitor security advisories *closely*.
            *   *Strictly* validate and sanitize *all* user-supplied data that influences rendering, *especially* images, fonts, and vector graphics.  Assume *all* such data is potentially malicious.  Do *not* render untrusted SVG or other complex formats directly.
            *   Consider pre-processing images with a separate, robust image processing library *before* passing them to Compose, to further reduce the attack surface (e.g., resizing, format conversion).
            *   If feasible (and for high-security applications), explore isolating the rendering of untrusted content in a separate process or sandbox (advanced technique).
        *   **User:** (Limited direct mitigation; relies on developers)
            *   Avoid opening or interacting with files/content from untrusted sources within applications built with Compose Multiplatform.

## Attack Surface: [Platform-Specific API Misuse via `expect`/`actual` (When Directly Exposed)](./attack_surfaces/platform-specific_api_misuse_via__expect__actual___when_directly_exposed_.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from incorrect or insecure use of platform-specific APIs accessed through Compose's `expect`/`actual` mechanism.  This is only *direct* if the `actual` implementation is part of the core Compose library or a first-party extension. If it's a *custom* `actual` implementation by the application developer, it's *indirect* (covered in the previous, broader list).  This entry focuses on the *direct* case.
    *   **How Compose Multiplatform Contributes:** The `expect`/`actual` system is a core feature of Compose Multiplatform, providing the bridge to platform-specific functionality. The security of this bridge is *directly* tied to the quality of the `actual` implementations provided by JetBrains.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in a Compose Multiplatform-provided `actual` implementation for accessing the clipboard on a specific platform allows an attacker to read or write arbitrary clipboard data.  (This is hypothetical; the actual risk depends on the specific `actual` implementations.)
    *   **Impact:** Varies significantly depending on the specific platform API and the nature of the vulnerability.  Could range from information disclosure (e.g., reading clipboard data) to privilege escalation or even code execution in extreme cases.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** (Potentially Critical, depending on the API and vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Rely on the official Compose Multiplatform libraries and their `actual` implementations as much as possible. Avoid writing custom `actual` implementations unless absolutely necessary.
            *   If you *must* write a custom `actual` implementation, treat it as a *critical* security component.  Apply *extreme* scrutiny, thorough testing, and secure coding practices.
            *   Keep Compose Multiplatform updated to the latest version to receive security patches for any vulnerabilities discovered in the official `actual` implementations.
        *   **User:** (Limited direct mitigation; relies on developers and JetBrains)
