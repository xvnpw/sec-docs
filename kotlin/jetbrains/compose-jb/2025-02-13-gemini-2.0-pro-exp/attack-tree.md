## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Rendering/UI Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_renderingui_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **1.1 Injection (Compose HTML-like injection in text fields) `[CRITICAL]`**

    *   **Description:** This vulnerability arises when user-supplied input is directly incorporated into Compose UI elements, particularly text fields, without proper sanitization.  It's crucial to understand this is *not* traditional HTML injection, but a Compose-specific variant. If the input contains Compose-specific styling directives or characters that are misinterpreted by the Compose rendering engine, it could lead to unexpected UI behavior, and potentially, a pathway to more severe exploits if those directives are cleverly crafted.
    *   **Example:** Imagine a `Text` composable displaying user comments. If a user enters a comment containing something that *looks like* a Compose modifier (even if it's not valid HTML), and that input isn't sanitized, Compose might try to interpret it, leading to unexpected styling or, in a worst-case scenario, a way to influence the composable's behavior.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **1.3 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (If using Compose HTML) `[HIGH RISK]` `[CRITICAL]`**

    *   **Description:** This is a classic XSS vulnerability that becomes relevant if the application utilizes Compose HTML (a subset of HTML for web targets) and fails to sanitize user input rendered within this HTML context.  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which will then be executed in the context of the victim's browser.
    *   **Example:** If a user's profile description is rendered using Compose HTML and an attacker injects `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, this script will execute when another user views the attacker's profile.  More sophisticated attacks could steal cookies, redirect the user, or modify the page content.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Interop Issues](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_interop_issues.md)

*   **3.1 JS Interop Vulnerabilities (e.g., prototype pollution) `[HIGH RISK]` `[CRITICAL]`**

    *   **Description:** (Compose for Web specific) This category encompasses vulnerabilities that arise when the Kotlin/JS code interacts with JavaScript.  Prototype pollution is a particularly dangerous example.  An attacker can modify the properties of built-in JavaScript objects (like `Object.prototype`), affecting the behavior of *all* objects in the application, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Example:** If the Kotlin code receives an object from JavaScript and doesn't properly validate its structure, an attacker could add unexpected properties to the object.  If the Kotlin code later relies on the absence of certain properties, this could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.  Prototype pollution can make this even more widespread.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

*   **3.2 Native Interop Vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows) `[HIGH RISK]` `[CRITICAL]`**

    *   **Description:** (Compose for Desktop specific) This category covers vulnerabilities that arise when the Kotlin/Native code interacts with native libraries (e.g., through JNI).  Classic native code vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, format string bugs, and integer overflows can be exploited to gain arbitrary code execution on the host system.
    *   **Example:** If the Kotlin code calls a native function that takes a string as input, and the Kotlin code doesn't properly check the length of the string before passing it to the native function, a buffer overflow could occur.  An attacker could provide a string that is longer than the buffer allocated in the native code, overwriting adjacent memory and potentially hijacking control of the application.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
