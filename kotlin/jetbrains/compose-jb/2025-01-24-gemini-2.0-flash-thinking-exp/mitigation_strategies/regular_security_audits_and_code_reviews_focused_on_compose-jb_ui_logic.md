#### 2.2 Threat Mitigation Assessment

The strategy directly addresses the identified threats:

*   **Logic Errors in Compose-jb UI Leading to Security Vulnerabilities (Severity - Medium):**
    *   **Effectiveness:** **Moderately to Highly Effective.** Code reviews are particularly well-suited for identifying logic errors. Human reviewers can understand the intended logic of the Compose-jb UI code and spot deviations or flaws that might lead to security vulnerabilities. By focusing on UI-specific logic (input handling, state management, etc.), the strategy directly targets this threat. The involvement of experts further enhances the effectiveness in identifying subtle or complex logic flaws.
    *   **Justification:** Logic errors are often context-dependent and require human understanding of the application's functionality. Automated tools might struggle to identify these nuanced issues, making manual code review a crucial mitigation.

*   **Unintentional Introduction of Vulnerabilities in Compose-jb UI (Severity - Low):**
    *   **Effectiveness:** **Moderately Effective.** Code reviews act as a "second pair of eyes," catching unintentional mistakes made by developers during Compose-jb UI implementation.  Checklists and guidelines further reduce the likelihood of common errors. While not foolproof, code reviews significantly decrease the probability of introducing simple, unintentional vulnerabilities.
    *   **Justification:**  Human error is inevitable in software development. Code reviews provide a safety net to catch these errors before they become security issues. Focusing on Compose-jb UI specifically ensures that reviewers are looking for errors relevant to the UI context.

#### 2.3 Impact Analysis

The strategy's impact aligns with the described impact levels:

*   **Logic Errors in Compose-jb UI Leading to Security Vulnerabilities:** **Moderately Reduces.**  Proactive identification and remediation of logic errors during audits and reviews directly reduces the presence of these vulnerabilities in the codebase. The reduction is moderate because code reviews are not exhaustive and might not catch every single logic error, especially in very complex UIs.
*   **Unintentional Introduction of Vulnerabilities in Compose-jb UI:** **Moderately Reduces.**  Code reviews significantly lower the chance of unintentional vulnerabilities slipping through. However, the reduction is moderate as even with reviews, some subtle or complex unintentional errors might still be missed.

#### 2.4 Implementation Feasibility
