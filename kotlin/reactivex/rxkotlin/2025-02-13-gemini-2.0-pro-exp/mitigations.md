# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for reactivex/rxkotlin

## Mitigation Strategy: [Backpressure Handling](./mitigation_strategies/backpressure_handling.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Critical Observables:** Analyze Observables interacting with high-volume sources (network, files, user input).
2.  **Choose a Backpressure Strategy:** Select the appropriate RxKotlin operator:
    *   `onBackpressureBuffer`: Buffers events (configure buffer size).
    *   `onBackpressureDrop`: Discards events.
    *   `onBackpressureLatest`: Keeps only the latest event.
    *   `sample`: Emits the most recent item within a time window.
3.  **Apply the Operator:** Insert the operator into the Observable chain (near the source).
4.  **Consider Flowable:** Refactor to `Flowable` for built-in backpressure support.
5.  **Monitor and Tune:** Monitor performance and adjust parameters.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (DoS):** (Severity: High)
*   **Application Crashes:** (Severity: High)
*   **Performance Degradation:** (Severity: Medium)

**Impact:**
*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (DoS):** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Application Crashes:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Performance Degradation:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:** *[Example: `NetworkDataFetcher.kt` (onBackpressureBuffer), `UserActivityStream.kt` (onBackpressureLatest)]*

**Missing Implementation:** *[Example: `LogFileReader.kt` (needs onBackpressureBuffer or Flowable)]*

**Description:**
1.  **Identify External Interactions:** Find Observables interacting with external services.
2.  **Apply `timeout`:** Add the RxKotlin `timeout` operator, specifying a time limit.
3.  **Apply `retry` (with Limits):** Add the RxKotlin `retry` operator. Limit retries: `retry(maxRetries)` or `retryWhen` (with backoff).
4.  **Error Handling:** Ensure the `onError` handler manages timeout/retry failures.

2.  **Choose a Rate Limiting Operator:** Select the appropriate RxKotlin operator:
    *   `throttleFirst`: First item in a time window.
    *   `throttleLast`: Last item in a time window.
    *   `debounce`: Emits after inactivity.
    *   `sample`: Most recent item in a time window.
3.  **Apply the Operator:** Insert the operator into the chain (near the source).
4.  **Tune the Time Window:** Adjust the time window parameter.

**Missing Implementation:** *[Example: `SensorDataStream.kt` (needs throttleFirst or sample)]*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Management with `using`](./mitigation_strategies/resource_management_with__using_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Resource Acquisition:** Find Observables acquiring resources.
2.  **Use the `using` Operator:** Wrap resource acquisition and Observable creation in RxKotlin's `using` operator:
    *   **Resource Factory:** Creates the resource.
    *   **Observable Factory:** Takes the resource, returns an Observable.
    *   **Resource Disposer:** Releases the resource.
3.  **Ensure Proper Disposal:** The `Resource Disposer` *must* reliably release the resource.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Resource Leaks:** (Severity: Medium)
*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (DoS):** (Severity: Medium)
*   **Application Instability:** (Severity: Medium)

**Impact:**
*   **Resource Leaks:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (DoS):** Risk indirectly reduced.
*   **Application Instability:** Risk reduced.

**Currently Implemented:** *[Example: `DatabaseConnectionManager.kt`]*

**Missing Implementation:** *[Example: `FileDownloader.kt`]*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Subscription Management](./mitigation_strategies/careful_subscription_management.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Subscriptions:** Find all Observable subscriptions.
2.  **Dispose Subscriptions:** Ensure every `Disposable` is disposed of when no longer needed (e.g., `onDestroy`).
3.  **Use `CompositeDisposable`:** Manage multiple subscriptions with `CompositeDisposable`; call `dispose()` on it.
4.  **Avoid Long-Lived Subscriptions:** Be cautious with long-lived subscriptions in short-lived components.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Memory Leaks:** (Severity: Medium)
*   **Unexpected Behavior:** (Severity: Medium)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Observable Chains:** Examine all Observable chains.
2.  **Implement `onError` Handlers:** *Every* subscription *must* have an `onError` handler:
    *   Log the error (without sensitive data).
    *   Attempt recovery (if possible).
    *   Inform the user appropriately.
3.  **Use Error Handling Operators:** Consider RxKotlin operators: `onErrorResumeNext` (fallback Observable), `onErrorReturnItem` (default value). Choose carefully.
4.  **Centralized Error Handling (Optional):** Consider a centralized mechanism.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Application Crashes:** (Severity: High)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Shared Mutable State:** Find mutable data accessed by multiple Observables/threads.
2.  **Prefer Immutability:** Refactor to use immutable data structures (if possible).
3.  **Use `observeOn` and `subscribeOn`:** *Explicitly* specify threads with RxKotlin's `observeOn` (downstream) and `subscribeOn` (Observable's work).
4.  **Synchronization (If Necessary):** If mutable state is *required*, use synchronization (e.g., `synchronized`, `AtomicReference`).
5. **Thread Confinement:** Consider confining mutable state to a single thread.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Races:** (Severity: High)
*   **Application Crashes:** (Severity: High)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Side Effects:** Identify all side effects within Observable chains.
2.  **Use `doOn...` Operators Carefully:** Use RxKotlin operators like `doOnNext`, `doOnError`, and `doOnComplete` for side effects, but minimize their complexity.
