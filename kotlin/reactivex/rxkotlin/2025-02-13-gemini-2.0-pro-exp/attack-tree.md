## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Backpressure Violation](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_backpressure_violation.md)

**Description:** This attack exploits the lack of proper backpressure handling in RxKotlin streams. When a fast-producing Observable emits items faster than a slow consumer can process them, and backpressure mechanisms (like `onBackpressureBuffer`, `onBackpressureDrop`, `onBackpressureLatest`) are not used, it can lead to either a `MissingBackpressureException` (crashing the application) or excessive memory consumption if events are buffered internally.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        *   **O (Overflow):** The attacker triggers a fast-producing Observable (e.g., by sending a flood of requests that generate events). Without backpressure, the system attempts to buffer all emitted items, leading to memory overflow.
        *   **S (Slow Subscriber):** The attacker identifies or creates a slow subscriber (e.g., one that performs blocking operations in `onNext`). This exacerbates the backpressure problem.
        *   **I (Infinite Stream):** The attacker targets an Observable that generates an infinite stream of data without a proper termination condition (e.g., `Observable.generate` used incorrectly). Combined with a lack of backpressure, this guarantees resource exhaustion.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (DoS, application crash, resource exhaustion)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Improper Error Handling](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_improper_error_handling.md)

*   **Description:** This attack exploits the lack of proper error handling within RxKotlin streams. If errors are not caught and handled using operators like `onError`, `retry`, or `onErrorResumeNext`, they can propagate and crash the application or lead to unexpected behavior.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        *   **C (Crash) [Critical Node]:** The attacker provides input that causes an unhandled exception within an RxKotlin operator (e.g., in `onNext`, `onError`, or `onComplete`). This exception propagates and terminates the application, resulting in a Denial of Service.
        *   **D (Deadlock):** While less directly related to *unhandled* errors, improper error handling combined with incorrect threading can contribute to deadlocks. If an error occurs and resources are not released properly, it can lead to a deadlock situation.
        *   **U (Unexpected Behavior):** The attacker provides input that triggers an error, but the error is not handled correctly, leading to inconsistent application state or incorrect data processing.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Application crash, unexpected behavior, data corruption)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Insecure Deserialization of RxKotlin Objects](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_insecure_deserialization_of_rxkotlin_objects.md)

*   **Description:** This is a critical vulnerability, although less likely in practice. If the application serializes and deserializes RxKotlin objects (like `Observable`, `Subject`, `Disposable`) that contain or reference untrusted data, it becomes vulnerable to deserialization attacks. These attacks can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        *   **U (Unsafe Deserialization) [Critical Node]:** The attacker provides a crafted serialized object. When the application deserializes this object, it triggers the execution of malicious code embedded within the serialized data. This gives the attacker control over the application.
    *   **Likelihood:** Very Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Remote Code Execution (RCE))
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
