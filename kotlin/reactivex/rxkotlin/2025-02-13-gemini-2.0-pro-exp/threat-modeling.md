# Threat Model Analysis for reactivex/rxkotlin

## Threat: [Deadlock Exploitation via Malicious Input](./threats/deadlock_exploitation_via_malicious_input.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that triggers specific combinations of `subscribeOn`, `observeOn`, and blocking operations within the reactive stream.  The attacker aims to create a deadlock situation by causing threads to wait indefinitely for each other, effectively performing a Denial of Service (DoS).  The attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in external libraries interacted with via RxKotlin, but the *root cause* is improper RxKotlin threading management.
*   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).  Users cannot interact with the application.
*   **Affected RxKotlin Component:** `subscribeOn`, `observeOn`, `Scheduler` implementations, and any operators that interact with external resources (e.g., custom operators wrapping blocking calls).  The core issue is the misuse of RxKotlin's concurrency features.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Strictly validate and sanitize all user input *before* it enters the reactive stream.  This prevents malicious data from triggering unexpected behavior, although the primary mitigation is correct RxKotlin usage.
    *   **Timeout Mechanisms:** Use the `timeout` operator to set a maximum duration for operations within the stream.  This prevents indefinite blocking, a key component of deadlocks.
    *   **Non-Blocking Operations:** Favor non-blocking I/O operations and asynchronous APIs whenever possible.  Avoid blocking calls within the reactive stream. This is a direct RxKotlin best practice.
    *   **Resource Management:** Carefully manage Schedulers.  Avoid creating unbounded Schedulers.  Use the built-in Schedulers (e.g., `Schedulers.io()`, `Schedulers.computation()`) appropriately. This is specific to RxKotlin's threading model.
    *   **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify potential deadlock scenarios *within the RxKotlin code*.
    *   **Testing:** Implement stress tests and penetration tests that specifically target concurrency and resource management *within the context of RxKotlin usage*.

## Threat: [Race Condition Exploitation for Data Corruption](./threats/race_condition_exploitation_for_data_corruption.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends concurrent requests or manipulates input in a way that exploits race conditions in the handling of shared mutable state *within the reactive stream*.  The attacker aims to corrupt data or cause inconsistent application state.  This is most likely if shared mutable state is accessed without proper synchronization *within the RxKotlin operators*.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities or incorrect application behavior.  The specific impact depends on the nature of the corrupted data.
*   **Affected RxKotlin Component:** Operators that process data concurrently (e.g., `flatMap`, `concatMap`, `merge`), especially when combined with shared mutable state accessed *within the stream's lambda expressions*. The vulnerability stems from how RxKotlin handles concurrency.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immutability:** Prefer immutable data structures within the reactive stream.  Avoid shared mutable state. This is a direct recommendation for safe RxKotlin usage.
    *   **Synchronization:** If shared mutable state is unavoidable, use appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., `synchronized` blocks, atomic variables, concurrent data structures) *outside* the reactive stream.  Crucially, avoid blocking *within* the stream, which would negate RxKotlin's benefits.
    *   **Serialization:** Use the `serialize` operator to ensure that emissions from an Observable are processed sequentially, even if they originate from different threads. This is a specific RxKotlin operator to address concurrency issues.
    *   **Code Review:** Carefully review code for potential race conditions, especially when dealing with shared resources *within the context of RxKotlin operators*.
    *   **Testing:** Implement concurrency tests to identify and address race conditions *specifically triggered by RxKotlin's asynchronous nature*.

## Threat: [Backpressure Bypass Leading to Resource Exhaustion](./threats/backpressure_bypass_leading_to_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a flood of data to an `Observable` that is *not properly configured for backpressure using RxKotlin's mechanisms*.  The attacker aims to overwhelm the application, causing memory exhaustion or other resource depletion, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). The core issue is the *failure to use RxKotlin's backpressure features*.
*   **Impact:** Application crashes or becomes unresponsive due to resource exhaustion (memory, CPU, etc.), resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Affected RxKotlin Component:** `Observable` (when used without backpressure handling), any custom operators that produce data without considering backpressure *as defined by RxKotlin*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Flowable:** Use `Flowable` instead of `Observable` when backpressure is required. This is a fundamental choice within RxKotlin.
    *   **Backpressure Operators:** Implement appropriate backpressure strategies using operators like `onBackpressureBuffer`, `onBackpressureDrop`, `onBackpressureLatest`, `sample`, `throttleFirst`, `throttleLast`, or `debounce`. These are all RxKotlin-specific operators.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** While rate limiting can be done outside RxKotlin, using RxKotlin operators like `throttle` provides a reactive way to manage the flow *within the stream*.
    *   **Input Validation:** Limit the size and frequency of data accepted from external sources. While this is a general practice, it's relevant here as a supporting measure to RxKotlin's backpressure.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor resource usage (memory, CPU) to detect potential backpressure issues *related to RxKotlin stream processing*.

## Threat: [Code Injection via Unsafe Operator Usage](./threats/code_injection_via_unsafe_operator_usage.md)

*   **Description:** If *custom RxKotlin operators* are created that dynamically execute code based on user input without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious code. This is a direct threat related to *extending RxKotlin functionality incorrectly*.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Affected RxKotlin Component:** *Custom operators* that handle user input or interact with external systems without proper sanitization. This is specifically about *new code written to work with RxKotlin*.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Strictly validate and sanitize all user input *before* it is used within *custom RxKotlin operators*.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Code Execution:** Avoid dynamically generating or executing code based on user input *within the context of custom RxKotlin operators*.
    *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review *custom RxKotlin operators* for potential injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, paying special attention to *extensions of RxKotlin*.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges.
