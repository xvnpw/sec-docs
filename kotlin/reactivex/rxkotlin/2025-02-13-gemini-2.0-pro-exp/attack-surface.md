# Attack Surface Analysis for reactivex/rxkotlin

## Attack Surface: [1. Uncontrolled Stream Emission (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/1__uncontrolled_stream_emission__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers trigger excessive event emissions in an RxKotlin stream, overwhelming the application.
*   **RxKotlin Contribution:** RxKotlin's core functionality is built around event streams, making it easy to create sources that can emit rapidly.  The library provides the *mechanisms* for this attack, even if the attacker's input is external.
*   **Example:** An attacker manipulates a web form input that controls the frequency of an `Observable.interval` used to fetch data. They set the interval to a very small value, flooding the application.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application unavailability, resource exhaustion.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Rigorously validate and sanitize all inputs that affect Observable emission rates (e.g., timer intervals, retry counts). Use whitelisting.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Employ operators like `throttleFirst`, `throttleLast`, `debounce`, `sample` to control the rate of event processing, *regardless* of the source emission rate.
    *   **Backpressure Handling:** Use `Flowable` and appropriate `BackpressureStrategy` (e.g., `BUFFER`, `DROP`, `LATEST`) to manage situations where the subscriber cannot keep up.  Choose the strategy carefully, as `ERROR` can itself be a DoS vector.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage related to Observable processing. Set alerts for anomalies.

## Attack Surface: [2. Unbounded Buffers/Memory Leaks (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/2__unbounded_buffersmemory_leaks__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit operators that buffer data internally, causing unbounded memory growth and eventual application crash.
*   **RxKotlin Contribution:** Operators like `buffer`, `window`, `replay`, and `cache` *inherently* accumulate data.  Their misuse, combined with attacker-controlled input, directly leads to the vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a continuous stream of data to an `Observable.window` without ever triggering the window closing condition (which might be based on attacker-controlled data), leading to an ever-growing buffer.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application crash, memory exhaustion.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Bounded Buffers:** *Always* use operators with built-in size or time limits (e.g., `buffer(count)`, `buffer(timespan)`, `window(timespan)`). Avoid unbounded variants unless absolutely necessary and tightly controlled by trusted logic.
    *   **Subscription Management:** Ensure all subscriptions are properly disposed of using `CompositeDisposable` or similar to prevent memory leaks.  Leaked subscriptions are a direct cause of unbounded buffer growth.
    *   **Memory Profiling:** Regularly profile the application's memory usage to detect leaks related to RxKotlin operators.

## Attack Surface: [3. Concurrency/Threading Issues (Logic Errors)](./attack_surfaces/3__concurrencythreading_issues__logic_errors_.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect use of RxKotlin's concurrency features leads to race conditions, deadlocks, or data corruption, potentially exploitable.
*   **RxKotlin Contribution:** RxKotlin provides `subscribeOn` and `observeOn` for managing concurrency.  *Misuse* of these operators is the direct cause of the vulnerability. The threading model is a core RxKotlin feature.
*   **Example:** A security check is performed on one thread (`subscribeOn`), and the action is taken on another (`observeOn`), without proper synchronization. An attacker exploits the timing window.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, security bypass, unpredictable application behavior.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Threading Model Understanding:** Thoroughly understand RxKotlin's threading model and the use of Schedulers (e.g., `Schedulers.io()`, `Schedulers.computation()`).  Incorrect Scheduler choice is a direct misuse.
    *   **Avoid Shared Mutable State:** Minimize shared mutable state between threads. If unavoidable, use synchronization mechanisms (locks, atomic variables) *provided by the underlying platform*, not RxKotlin itself.
    *   **Immutability:** Prefer immutable data structures to inherently avoid many concurrency issues.
    *   **Concurrency Testing:** Test concurrent code rigorously to identify race conditions and deadlocks.

## Attack Surface: [4. Error Handling Bypass](./attack_surfaces/4__error_handling_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Unhandled errors in RxKotlin streams are silently ignored, potentially bypassing security checks.
*   **RxKotlin Contribution:** RxKotlin streams *require* explicit error handling via `onError`.  The absence or incorrect implementation of `onError` is a direct misuse of the RxKotlin error handling mechanism.
*   **Example:** An exception during a security check within an Observable is not caught by an `onError` handler, allowing the attacker to proceed.
*   **Impact:** Security bypass, inconsistent application state, data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Implement `onError` handlers for *all* Observables, especially those in security-critical paths.  This is a direct RxKotlin requirement.
    *   **Fail Fast:** Design error handling to fail fast and prevent the application from continuing in an invalid state.
    *   **Logging and Auditing:** Log all errors, even handled ones, for auditing and debugging.
