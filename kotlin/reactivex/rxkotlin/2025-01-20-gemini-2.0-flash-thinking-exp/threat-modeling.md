# Threat Model Analysis for reactivex/rxkotlin

## Threat: [Unhandled Exception Leading to Information Disclosure](./threats/unhandled_exception_leading_to_information_disclosure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might trigger an unexpected error within an RxKotlin stream that is not properly caught and handled. This could lead to the application logging or displaying detailed error messages, including stack traces, internal state, or potentially sensitive data. This directly involves RxKotlin's error handling mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of internal application details, potentially including API keys, database credentials, or business logic, which could be used for further attacks.
*   **Affected RxKotlin Component:** Observable/Flowable `onError` path, global exception handlers.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust error handling for all Observables and Flowables using operators like `onErrorReturn`, `onErrorResumeNext`, and `doOnError`.
    *   Log errors securely, avoiding the inclusion of sensitive information in log messages.
    *   Implement global exception handling mechanisms to catch and handle unexpected errors gracefully.
    *   Consider using dedicated error reporting services that sanitize error details.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Unbounded Stream](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_unbounded_stream.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could potentially trigger a scenario where an Observable or Flowable emits data at a rate faster than the consumer can process, or emits an unbounded number of items. This directly involves RxKotlin's stream processing capabilities.
*   **Impact:** Application slowdown, instability, or complete unavailability due to resource exhaustion.
*   **Affected RxKotlin Component:** Observable/Flowable creation, operators without backpressure handling (for Flowable).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   For `Flowable`, implement proper backpressure strategies using operators like `onBackpressureBuffer`, `onBackpressureDrop`, `onBackpressureLatest`, or custom backpressure handling.
    *   For `Observable`, be mindful of the rate of emission and consider using operators that limit the rate or buffer items.
    *   Implement timeouts and resource limits on long-running streams.
    *   Monitor resource usage and implement alerts for unusual consumption patterns.

## Threat: [Subscription Leak Leading to Memory Exhaustion](./threats/subscription_leak_leading_to_memory_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might exploit scenarios where subscriptions to Observables or Flowables are not properly disposed of when they are no longer needed. This directly involves RxKotlin's subscription management.
*   **Impact:** Gradual degradation of application performance, eventually leading to out-of-memory errors and application crashes.
*   **Affected RxKotlin Component:** `subscribe()` method, `Disposable` interface.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always ensure that subscriptions are disposed of when they are no longer needed, typically in lifecycle methods (e.g., `onDestroy` in Android, component unmount in web frameworks).
    *   Use `CompositeDisposable` to manage multiple subscriptions and dispose of them all at once.
    *   Utilize operators like `takeUntil` or `takeWhile` to automatically unsubscribe based on certain conditions.
    *   Employ memory leak detection tools to identify and fix subscription leaks during development.

## Threat: [Race Condition in Concurrent Streams](./threats/race_condition_in_concurrent_streams.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could potentially manipulate the timing of events in concurrent RxKotlin streams that operate on shared mutable state without proper synchronization. This directly involves RxKotlin's concurrency mechanisms (Schedulers).
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, and potentially exploitable vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected RxKotlin Component:** Schedulers, operators that perform side effects on shared state (e.g., `doOnNext`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid sharing mutable state between concurrent streams whenever possible.
    *   If shared mutable state is necessary, use appropriate synchronization mechanisms like `synchronized` blocks, locks, or thread-safe data structures.
    *   Carefully choose the appropriate `Scheduler` for operations that interact with shared state.
    *   Thoroughly test concurrent code to identify and fix potential race conditions.
