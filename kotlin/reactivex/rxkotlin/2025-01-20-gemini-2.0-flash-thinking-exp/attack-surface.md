# Attack Surface Analysis for reactivex/rxkotlin

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection through Uncontrolled Subjects/Processors](./attack_surfaces/data_injection_through_uncontrolled_subjectsprocessors.md)

* **Attack Surface: Data Injection through Uncontrolled Subjects/Processors**
    * **Description:** External entities can inject arbitrary data into the application's reactive streams if `Subjects` or `Processors` are exposed without proper access control or input validation.
    * **How RxKotlin Contributes:** RxKotlin provides `Subjects` and `Processors` as a mechanism for both emitting and subscribing to events. If the ability to emit is not restricted, malicious actors can inject data directly into the reactive flow.
    * **Example:** An API endpoint or internal component exposes a `PublishSubject`. A malicious actor gains access and sends a crafted event that, when processed by downstream operators, triggers a vulnerability like a buffer overflow or leads to unauthorized data modification.
    * **Impact:** Data corruption, unexpected application behavior, potential for remote code execution if the injected data is used unsafely in subsequent operations.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Restrict access to `Subjects` and `Processors` to only authorized components within the application.
        * Implement strict input validation and sanitization on any data emitted into `Subjects` or `Processors` before it's processed further.
        * Consider using immutable data structures within the reactive streams to limit the impact of malicious data modification.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion via Unbounded Streams/Operators](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_via_unbounded_streamsoperators.md)

* **Attack Surface: Resource Exhaustion via Unbounded Streams/Operators**
    * **Description:** A malicious actor can trigger the creation of an unbounded stream of events or manipulate RxKotlin operators to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory), leading to denial of service.
    * **How RxKotlin Contributes:** RxKotlin allows for the creation of streams that can emit an unlimited number of items. Operators like `buffer()` or `window()` without size limits can accumulate large amounts of data in memory.
    * **Example:** An attacker triggers an event that causes a `PublishSubject` to emit a large number of events rapidly without any backpressure mechanism in place. This overwhelms downstream consumers, leading to excessive memory consumption and potentially crashing the application.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application instability, performance degradation making the application unusable.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement backpressure strategies (using `Flowable` and appropriate backpressure operators like `onBackpressureBuffer()`, `onBackpressureDrop()`, `onBackpressureLatest()`) to handle scenarios where producers emit data faster than consumers can process it.
        * Set explicit limits on buffer sizes and window sizes in operators like `buffer()` and `window()`.
        * Use time-based operators like `debounce()` or `throttle()` to control the rate of event processing and prevent overwhelming consumers.
        * Implement timeouts and circuit breakers to prevent runaway processes from consuming excessive resources.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in RxKotlin Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_rxkotlin_dependencies.md)

* **Attack Surface: Vulnerabilities in RxKotlin Dependencies**
    * **Description:** RxKotlin relies on other libraries (like `kotlinx.coroutines`). Critical vulnerabilities in these underlying dependencies can be exploited through the application using RxKotlin.
    * **How RxKotlin Contributes:** RxKotlin directly depends on these libraries, and any critical vulnerabilities within them become part of the application's attack surface when using RxKotlin.
    * **Example:** A critical remote code execution vulnerability is discovered in a specific version of `kotlinx.coroutines` that RxKotlin depends on. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability through interactions with the application that utilize RxKotlin's functionalities.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update RxKotlin and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * Use dependency management tools to track and manage dependencies effectively.
        * Monitor security advisories for vulnerabilities in RxKotlin's dependencies and promptly update if necessary.
        * Consider using tools that perform static analysis or security scanning of dependencies.
