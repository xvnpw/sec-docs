## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via RxKotlin Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_rxkotlin_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

**Description:** The ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access, disrupting functionality, stealing data, or otherwise harming the application through vulnerabilities related to its use of RxKotlin.
* **Risk Assessment:**
    * Likelihood: Varies depending on specific vulnerabilities.
    * Impact: High (Complete compromise of application).
    * Effort: Varies depending on the specific attack path.
    * Skill Level: Varies depending on the specific attack path.
    * Detection Difficulty: Varies depending on the specific attack path.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Observable Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_observable_manipulation.md)

**Description:**  Attacks focused on interfering with the flow and processing of data within RxKotlin Observables. This involves manipulating the data itself, the timing of events, or the lifecycle of the streams.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Inject Malicious Data into Observable Stream (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_inject_malicious_data_into_observable_stream__critical_node_.md)

**Description:**  The attacker aims to insert harmful data into an Observable stream. This data, when processed by subsequent operators, can trigger vulnerabilities, lead to code execution, or corrupt application state.
* **Risk Assessment:**
    * Likelihood: Varies depending on the data source.
    * Impact: High (Data corruption, code execution, application malfunction).
    * Effort: Varies depending on the data source.
    * Skill Level: Varies depending on the data source.
    * Detection Difficulty: Varies depending on the data source and implemented defenses.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: User Input Streams (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_user_input_streams__critical_node_.md)

**Description:**  A specific instance of data injection where the attacker leverages user-provided input that is directly or indirectly fed into an Observable stream. If this input is not properly validated and sanitized, it can be used to inject malicious payloads.
* **Risk Assessment:**
    * Likelihood: High.
    * Impact: High (Code injection, XSS-like vulnerabilities within the reactive stream).
    * Effort: Low.
    * Skill Level: Low to Medium.
    * Detection Difficulty: Low (If proper input validation is missing) to Medium (with some validation).

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Error Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_error_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Attacks targeting weaknesses in how the application handles errors within its reactive streams. This can involve triggering errors to cause crashes or exploiting error messages to gain information.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Trigger Unhandled Exceptions Leading to Application Crash](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_trigger_unhandled_exceptions_leading_to_application_crash.md)

**Description:** The attacker crafts input or conditions that cause RxKotlin operators or custom logic to throw exceptions that are not caught and handled, leading to application termination.
* **Risk Assessment:**
    * Likelihood: Medium.
    * Impact: Medium (Application downtime).
    * Effort: Low to Medium.
    * Skill Level: Low to Medium.
    * Detection Difficulty: Low.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Leak Sensitive Information via Error Messages (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_leak_sensitive_information_via_error_messages__critical_node_.md)

**Description:** By intentionally triggering errors, the attacker aims to force the application to expose sensitive information (internal state, configuration, data) within error messages.
* **Risk Assessment:**
    * Likelihood: Medium.
    * Impact: Medium (Information disclosure).
    * Effort: Low.
    * Skill Level: Low.
    * Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom RxKotlin Operators or Logic (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_custom_rxkotlin_operators_or_logic__critical_node_.md)

**Description:**  Attacks targeting flaws introduced by the development team in custom RxKotlin operators or the specific reactive logic implemented within the application. This is where unique, application-specific vulnerabilities are most likely to reside.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Security Oversights (within Custom Logic) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_security_oversights__within_custom_logic___critical_node_.md)

**Description:** A specific type of vulnerability within custom RxKotlin code where security best practices are not followed. This can lead to various high-impact issues like code injection, insecure data handling, or privilege escalation within the reactive streams.
* **Risk Assessment:**
    * Likelihood: Medium.
    * Impact: High (Can introduce various vulnerabilities like code injection, data breaches).
    * Effort: Low to Medium.
    * Skill Level: Low to Medium.
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium.
