# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, RxKotlin, provides a Kotlin language binding for ReactiveX (Reactive Extensions). ReactiveX is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences. The primary business goal of RxKotlin is to simplify the development of asynchronous and reactive applications in Kotlin, enabling developers to write more efficient, responsive, and maintainable code.

Business priorities addressed by RxKotlin include:

- Improving application responsiveness and user experience by enabling non-blocking operations and efficient handling of asynchronous events.
- Simplifying complex asynchronous logic through declarative operators and reactive streams.
- Enhancing code maintainability and readability by providing a structured approach to asynchronous programming.
- Increasing developer productivity by offering a well-defined and widely adopted reactive programming paradigm.
- Enabling the development of scalable and resilient applications capable of handling high volumes of data and events.

Key business risks associated with using RxKotlin include:

- Dependency risk: Reliance on an external library introduces a dependency that needs to be maintained and updated. Bugs or vulnerabilities in RxKotlin could impact applications using it.
- Learning curve: Reactive programming concepts can be complex, potentially requiring developer training and time to adopt effectively.
- Performance overhead: While designed for efficiency, improper use of reactive programming or RxKotlin operators could introduce performance bottlenecks.
- Compatibility issues:  Potential compatibility issues with other libraries or frameworks used in conjunction with RxKotlin.
- Security vulnerabilities: Although less direct for a library, vulnerabilities in RxKotlin itself could be exploited if not properly addressed.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:

- security control: Open Source project with public code repository on GitHub. This allows for community review and scrutiny of the codebase. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
- security control: Unit and integration tests. These tests help ensure the library functions as expected and reduce the likelihood of bugs, including security-related bugs. (Implemented: Project's test suite)
- security control: Reliance on ReactiveX core library. RxKotlin is a binding for ReactiveX, inheriting some of the maturity and scrutiny of the core ReactiveX project. (Implemented: Dependency on ReactiveX)
- accepted risk:  Vulnerability in dependencies. RxKotlin depends on other libraries, and vulnerabilities in those dependencies could indirectly affect RxKotlin.
- accepted risk:  Community-driven security. Security relies on the open-source community to identify and report vulnerabilities. Response time to security issues may vary.

Recommended security controls:

- security control: Dependency scanning. Implement automated dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in RxKotlin's dependencies.
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST). Integrate SAST tools into the development process to automatically analyze the RxKotlin codebase for potential security flaws.
- security control: Security vulnerability reporting process. Establish a clear process for security researchers and users to report potential vulnerabilities in RxKotlin.
- security control: Regular security audits. Conduct periodic security audits of the RxKotlin codebase by security experts.

Security requirements:

- Authentication: Not directly applicable to a library. Authentication is the responsibility of applications using RxKotlin.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to a library. Authorization is the responsibility of applications using RxKotlin.
- Input validation: While RxKotlin itself doesn't directly handle user input, applications using RxKotlin must perform input validation on data streams processed by RxKotlin to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
- Cryptography: RxKotlin itself does not implement cryptographic functions. If applications using RxKotlin require cryptography, they should use established and secure cryptographic libraries. RxKotlin should not introduce any weaknesses that could undermine the security of cryptographic operations performed by consuming applications.

Build Process Security Controls:

- Supply Chain Security:
    - Control: Secure code repository (GitHub). Access control and audit logs for code changes.
    - Control: Secure CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions or similar).  Restrict access to pipeline configuration and secrets.
    - Control: Dependency management. Use dependency management tools (Gradle) to manage and track dependencies.
    - Control: Dependency scanning. Automated scanning of dependencies for known vulnerabilities during the build process.
- Build Automation:
    - Control: Automated build process using CI/CD. Reduces manual steps and potential for errors.
    - Control: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for build environment configuration (if applicable).
- Security Checks during Build:
    - Control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST). Automated SAST tools integrated into the build pipeline to detect potential code-level vulnerabilities.
    - Control: Unit and integration tests. Automated tests to verify functionality and reduce bugs.
    - Control: Code linters and formatters. Enforce code quality and consistency, which can indirectly improve security.
    - Control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA) / Dependency Scanning. Identify vulnerable dependencies.
- Artifact Signing and Verification:
    - Control: Sign release artifacts (JAR files) with a digital signature.
    - Control: Publish checksums (SHA-256) of artifacts for integrity verification.
    - Control: Secure publishing to Maven Central using appropriate credentials and protocols.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes protected:

- Development of responsive and efficient Kotlin applications.
- Simplification of asynchronous programming in Kotlin.
- Improved maintainability and readability of Kotlin code dealing with asynchronous operations.
- Faster development cycles for reactive applications in Kotlin.

Data being protected and sensitivity:

- RxKotlin library code itself: Sensitivity is high, as vulnerabilities in the library could impact many applications using it. Integrity and availability of the code are crucial.
- Build and release artifacts (JAR files): Sensitivity is high. Integrity and authenticity of release artifacts are critical to prevent supply chain attacks.
- Developer credentials and secrets used in the build process: Sensitivity is very high. Compromise could lead to unauthorized code changes or malicious releases.
- Metadata about the library (version numbers, dependencies): Sensitivity is low to medium. Integrity is important for dependency management.
