    *   **Drawbacks/Considerations:**
        *   **Complexity of Implementation:**  Designing and implementing idempotent and thread-safe side effects can be challenging and require specialized knowledge.
        *   **Performance Overhead:**  Synchronization mechanisms required for thread-safety can introduce performance overhead. Careful consideration is needed to balance safety and performance.
        *   **Testing Complexity:**  Testing for thread-safety and idempotency requires specific testing strategies and tools.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:** Directly mitigates **Concurrency Issues** and **Unexpected Behavior** arising from non-thread-safe or non-idempotent side effects.

#### 2.5 Description Point 5: Document RxKotlin side effects clearly

*   **Description:** If custom RxKotlin operators with side effects are created, thoroughly document these side effects and their implications in reactive pipelines.
