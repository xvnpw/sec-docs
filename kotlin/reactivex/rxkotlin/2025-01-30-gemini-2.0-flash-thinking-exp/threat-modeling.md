# Threat Model Analysis for reactivex/rxkotlin

## Threat: [Race Condition in Shared Mutable State](./threats/race_condition_in_shared_mutable_state.md)

- **Description:** An attacker might exploit race conditions by sending concurrent requests or triggering concurrent events that manipulate shared mutable state within RxKotlin Observables or Subscribers. This could lead to data corruption if operations are not properly synchronized. For example, in an application managing user sessions, concurrent updates to session data could lead to session hijacking or privilege escalation.
- **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, potential security bypass if data integrity is crucial for authorization or access control, privilege escalation, session hijacking.
- **RxKotlin Component Affected:** Observables, Subscribers, Shared State accessed within reactive streams.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Use thread-safe data structures (e.g., `ConcurrentHashMap`, immutable data).
    - Employ RxKotlin operators for thread confinement like `observeOn` and `subscribeOn` to control execution context.
    - Minimize shared mutable state and favor immutable data patterns.
    - Implement proper synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks, atomic operations) if mutable state is unavoidable.
    - Thoroughly test concurrent scenarios, especially around security-sensitive operations.

## Threat: [Deadlock due to Blocking Operations in Reactive Streams](./threats/deadlock_due_to_blocking_operations_in_reactive_streams.md)

- **Description:** An attacker could trigger a deadlock by sending requests or inputs that cause the application to perform blocking operations within RxKotlin reactive streams, especially if these operations are chained in a circular dependency or improperly scheduled. For instance, blocking database calls within a `Schedulers.computation()` thread pool could exhaust the pool and lead to deadlocks, preventing legitimate user requests from being processed.
- **Impact:** Application hangs, denial of service, unresponsive application, inability to process legitimate requests, complete system unavailability.
- **RxKotlin Component Affected:** Schedulers, Operators (especially those involving blocking operations), Reactive Streams design.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Avoid blocking operations within reactive streams at all costs.
    - Use non-blocking asynchronous operations for I/O and long-running tasks.
    - Carefully design reactive workflows to prevent circular dependencies in asynchronous operations.
    - Use appropriate schedulers for different types of tasks (e.g., `Schedulers.io()` for I/O-bound, `Schedulers.computation()` only for short CPU-bound tasks).
    - Implement timeouts and circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures and deadlocks.
    - Monitor thread pool usage and resource consumption proactively.

## Threat: [Backpressure Overflow leading to Denial of Service](./threats/backpressure_overflow_leading_to_denial_of_service.md)

- **Description:** An attacker could intentionally flood the application with a high volume of requests or data, exceeding the consumer's processing capacity. If backpressure is not correctly implemented or configured in RxKotlin, this can lead to unbounded buffering, memory exhaustion, and ultimately a denial of service. For example, in a real-time data processing pipeline, a malicious data source could overwhelm the system.
- **Impact:** Denial of service, application crashes due to out-of-memory errors, performance degradation, system unavailability, financial loss due to service disruption.
- **RxKotlin Component Affected:** Backpressure Operators (`onBackpressureBuffer`, `onBackpressureDrop`, `onBackpressureLatest`), Buffers, Reactive Stream flow control.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement robust backpressure strategies using RxKotlin's backpressure operators.
    - Carefully choose and configure backpressure strategies and buffer sizes based on expected load and resource limits.
    - Implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms at the application ingress points to control incoming request rates.
    - Monitor resource usage (memory, CPU, network) and proactively scale resources or adjust backpressure strategies under heavy load.
    - Consider using reactive streams with inherent backpressure support from underlying frameworks (if applicable).

## Threat: [Logic Errors due to Operator Misuse leading to Security Bypass](./threats/logic_errors_due_to_operator_misuse_leading_to_security_bypass.md)

- **Description:** Developers might incorrectly use or combine RxKotlin operators, creating logical flaws in reactive streams that can be exploited. An attacker could craft specific inputs or event sequences to trigger these flaws, leading to security bypasses. For example, a flawed filtering operator might allow unauthorized access to sensitive data, or incorrect transformation logic could corrupt security tokens.
- **Impact:** Security bypass, unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, data corruption, privilege escalation, potential for further exploitation of compromised systems.
- **RxKotlin Component Affected:** All Operators, Reactive Stream Logic, Data Transformation pipelines, Security-critical reactive flows.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Thoroughly understand the behavior of all RxKotlin operators used, especially in security-critical paths.
    - Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests to verify the logical correctness of reactive streams, focusing on security requirements.
    - Conduct rigorous code reviews, specifically looking for potential misuse of operators and logical vulnerabilities in reactive code.
    - Employ static analysis tools to detect potential logical errors and operator misconfigurations in RxKotlin code.
    - Follow secure coding practices and design principles when building reactive applications.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in RxKotlin or RxJava enabling Remote Code Execution](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_rxkotlin_or_rxjava_enabling_remote_code_execution.md)

- **Description:** Critical security vulnerabilities might be discovered in the RxKotlin library or its core dependency, RxJava. If exploited, these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or client running the application. This could be achieved by sending specially crafted requests or data that trigger the vulnerability in the RxKotlin/RxJava library.
- **Impact:** Full application compromise, remote code execution, complete system takeover, data breach, confidentiality and integrity loss, denial of service, severe reputational damage.
- **RxKotlin Component Affected:** RxKotlin Library, RxJava Library (Dependency), potentially all parts of the application using RxKotlin.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Immediately** update RxKotlin and RxJava libraries to the latest patched versions upon security advisories.
    - Implement automated dependency scanning and vulnerability monitoring to detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    - Subscribe to security mailing lists and advisories for RxKotlin and RxJava to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.
    - Implement a rapid patch management process to quickly deploy security updates.
    - Consider using a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to manage and monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities.
