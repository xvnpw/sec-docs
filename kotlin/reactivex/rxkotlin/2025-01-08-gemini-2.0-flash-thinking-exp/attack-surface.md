# Attack Surface Analysis for reactivex/rxkotlin

## Attack Surface: [Reactive Stream Data Injection](./attack_surfaces/reactive_stream_data_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious data into a reactive stream that is then processed by subsequent operators.

**How RxKotlin Contributes:** RxKotlin's core functionality revolves around processing data streams. If input sources are not sanitized before entering the stream, RxKotlin provides the mechanism to propagate and process malicious data.

**Example:** An HTTP request handler uses `Observable.fromCallable` to process user input. If the input is directly used in a database query within a subsequent `map` operator without sanitization, it's vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact:** Can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, or denial of service depending on the operations performed on the injected data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Sanitize and validate all external input *before* it enters the reactive stream.
* Use parameterized queries or ORM features to prevent injection vulnerabilities when interacting with databases.
* Implement input validation rules that are appropriate for the expected data type and format.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion via Unbounded Streams](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_via_unbounded_streams.md)

**Description:** A reactive stream is created without proper termination or backpressure, leading to unbounded growth and resource exhaustion (memory or CPU).

**How RxKotlin Contributes:** RxKotlin provides operators for creating and transforming streams, some of which can potentially produce an infinite or very large number of items if not handled carefully.

**Example:**  An `Observable.interval` is used without a `takeUntil` or similar operator to limit its duration, continuously emitting values and consuming resources. A `buffer` operator accumulates these values indefinitely.

**Impact:** Denial of service (DoS) due to memory exhaustion or CPU overload, potentially crashing the application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement backpressure strategies using operators like `onBackpressureBuffer`, `onBackpressureDrop`, or `onBackpressureLatest`.
* Use operators like `take`, `takeUntil`, or `timeout` to limit the lifespan or number of items in a stream.
* Monitor resource usage and implement alerts for unusual consumption patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Operators](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_operators.md)

**Description:** Security flaws are introduced through the implementation of custom RxKotlin operators.

**How RxKotlin Contributes:** RxKotlin allows developers to create custom operators to encapsulate specific logic. If these operators are not implemented securely, they can introduce vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A custom operator performs complex string manipulation without proper bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow if the input data is maliciously crafted.

**Impact:**  Can range from data corruption and unexpected behavior to remote code execution depending on the nature of the vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Follow secure coding practices when implementing custom operators.
* Thoroughly test custom operators for potential vulnerabilities, including boundary conditions and error handling.
* Conduct code reviews of custom operator implementations.
* Consider the security implications of any external libraries or dependencies used within custom operators.
