# Threat Model Analysis for reactivex/rxkotlin

## Threat: [Race Condition leading to Data Corruption](./threats/race_condition_leading_to_data_corruption.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate the timing of asynchronous operations that access and modify shared mutable state within RxKotlin streams without proper synchronization. This could lead to data being written in the wrong order or inconsistent state, potentially corrupting critical application data or leading to incorrect business logic execution.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise, application malfunction, potential financial loss or reputational damage due to incorrect data processing.
    *   **Affected RxKotlin Component:** Schedulers, shared state within Observables, specific operators used for concurrency (e.g., `publish`, `share`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Favor immutability when dealing with data in reactive streams.
        *   Use thread-safe data structures (e.g., `ConcurrentHashMap`) for shared state.
        *   Employ appropriate synchronization primitives (e.g., `synchronized` blocks, locks) when sharing mutable state across reactive streams.
        *   Carefully consider the threading implications of different Schedulers.
        *   Thoroughly test concurrent scenarios to identify potential race conditions.

## Threat: [Unhandled Exception Causing Denial of Service](./threats/unhandled_exception_causing_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could trigger an unexpected condition within an RxKotlin stream that throws an exception which is not properly handled by `onError` operators. This unhandled exception could propagate up and crash the application, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **Impact:** Application downtime, denial of service, potential loss of revenue or productivity.
    *   **Affected RxKotlin Component:** Observables, operators, error handling mechanisms (`onError`, `onErrorReturn`, `onErrorResumeNext`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust error handling within all reactive streams using operators like `onErrorReturn`, `onErrorResumeNext`, or `doOnError`.
        *   Log unhandled exceptions for debugging and monitoring purposes.
        *   Consider using a global error handler for top-level exception catching.
        *   Implement circuit breaker patterns to prevent repeated failures from crashing the application.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion due to Subscription Leaks](./threats/resource_exhaustion_due_to_subscription_leaks.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could trigger actions that create many long-lived RxKotlin subscriptions that are not properly disposed of. This can lead to a gradual accumulation of resources (memory, threads, connections), eventually exhausting available resources and causing the application to slow down or crash.
    *   **Impact:** Performance degradation, application instability, eventual denial of service.
    *   **Affected RxKotlin Component:** `Observable.subscribe()`, `Disposable`, `CompositeDisposable`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always manage subscriptions properly by disposing of them when they are no longer needed.
        *   Use operators like `takeUntil` or `takeWhile` to automatically unsubscribe based on certain conditions.
        *   Utilize `CompositeDisposable` to manage multiple subscriptions and dispose of them collectively.
        *   Monitor application resource usage to detect potential subscription leaks.

## Threat: [Backpressure Exploitation leading to Resource Overload](./threats/backpressure_exploitation_leading_to_resource_overload.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could intentionally produce a rapid stream of events that overwhelms a Subscriber that is not equipped to handle the volume. This can lead to excessive buffering and memory consumption, potentially causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.
    *   **Impact:** Performance degradation, memory exhaustion, potential denial of service.
    *   **Affected RxKotlin Component:** Observables, Subscribers, backpressure operators (`onBackpressureBuffer`, `onBackpressureDrop`, `onBackpressureLatest`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement appropriate backpressure strategies using operators like `onBackpressureBuffer`, `onBackpressureDrop`, or `onBackpressureLatest`.
        *   Design Subscribers to handle expected event rates or implement mechanisms to slow down the emission rate.
        *   Consider using Reactive Streams specifications for interoperability and backpressure handling.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Unbounded Concurrency](./threats/denial_of_service_through_unbounded_concurrency.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could trigger actions that lead to the creation of a large number of concurrent RxKotlin streams or operations, potentially overwhelming system resources (CPU, memory, network connections) and causing the application to slow down or become unresponsive.
    *   **Impact:** Performance degradation, denial of service.
    *   **Affected RxKotlin Component:** Schedulers, operators that create new Observables (e.g., `flatMap`, `parallel`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use Schedulers with bounded thread pools to limit the number of concurrent operations.
        *   Implement mechanisms to limit the creation rate of new reactive streams.
        *   Monitor resource usage and implement safeguards to prevent excessive concurrency.

## Threat: [Misuse of Operators Leading to Unexpected Behavior](./threats/misuse_of_operators_leading_to_unexpected_behavior.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, by understanding the application's RxKotlin implementation, could craft inputs or trigger specific sequences of events that exploit the incorrect usage of certain operators, leading to unintended data transformations, filtering, or combining of streams, potentially bypassing security checks or causing logical errors.
    *   **Impact:** Security bypass, data corruption, unexpected application behavior.
    *   **Affected RxKotlin Component:** Various operators depending on the specific misuse.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure developers have a thorough understanding of RxKotlin operators and their behavior.
        *   Conduct thorough code reviews to identify potential misuse of operators.
        *   Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests to verify the correct behavior of reactive streams.
