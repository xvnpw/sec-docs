## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via RxKotlin Exploitation (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_rxkotlin_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker, signifying a successful exploitation of weaknesses within the RxKotlin implementation to gain unauthorized access, manipulate data, or disrupt the application's functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data into Reactive Streams (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_into_reactive_streams__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on the attacker's ability to introduce harmful data into the application's data flow. This can be achieved through various means and has a high potential for causing significant damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data via Subject (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_via_subject__critical_node_.md)

Subjects act as entry points into reactive streams. If a Subject is directly accessible to external input (e.g., through a WebSocket or API endpoint) and lacks proper validation, an attacker can inject crafted events. This could involve sending unexpected data types, excessively large payloads, or data designed to trigger vulnerabilities in downstream operators.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Denial of Service (DoS) through RxKotlin (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/cause_denial_of_service__dos__through_rxkotlin__high-risk_path_.md)

This path outlines how an attacker can leverage RxKotlin's features or misconfigurations to overwhelm the application and make it unavailable to legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion via Unbounded Streams (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion_via_unbounded_streams__critical_node_.md)

Reactive streams can process large volumes of data. If an application doesn't implement proper backpressure mechanisms, an attacker can flood the system with events, leading to memory exhaustion or CPU overload. This is particularly relevant when dealing with external data sources or user-generated content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Error Handling Mechanisms (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_error_handling_mechanisms__high-risk_path_.md)

This path targets weaknesses in how the application handles errors within its reactive streams. Exploiting these mechanisms can lead to crashes, information leaks, or security bypasses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Unhandled Exceptions (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_unhandled_exceptions__critical_node_.md)

If exceptions within RxKotlin operators or custom reactive logic are not properly caught and handled, they can lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior. Attackers can provide input that triggers these unhandled exceptions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Specific RxKotlin Features/Operators (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_specific_rxkotlin_featuresoperators__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from the specific features and operators provided by RxKotlin, particularly when misused or misconfigured.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misuse of Subjects (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/misuse_of_subjects__critical_node_.md)

Subjects act as both Observables and Observers, making them powerful but potentially dangerous if not used carefully. Attackers might exploit this dual nature to inject data or interfere with the intended data flow.

## Attack Tree Path: [Improper Backpressure Handling (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/improper_backpressure_handling__critical_node_.md)

Failing to implement proper backpressure can lead to the application being overwhelmed with events faster than it can process. This can result in dropped events, application instability, and contribute to denial-of-service scenarios.
