### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Shizuku

This list focuses on high and critical severity threats that directly involve the Shizuku library.

* **Threat:** Malicious Application Exploiting Shizuku Permissions
    * **Description:** A separate malicious application, once installed, leverages the already granted Shizuku service permissions to perform actions requiring elevated privileges. This malicious app could impersonate legitimate requests or exploit vulnerabilities within Shizuku itself to execute unauthorized commands.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to system resources, modification of sensitive data, installation of malware, or other harmful actions on the user's device, potentially without further explicit consent after the initial Shizuku permission grant.
    * **Affected Shizuku Component:** Shizuku Service, Shizuku API, Permission Granting Mechanism.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:** Adhere to the principle of least privilege when requesting Shizuku permissions.
        * **Developer:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for data/commands passed to Shizuku.
        * **User:** Be cautious about installing applications from untrusted sources.
        * **User:** Review permissions requested by applications, including those related to Shizuku.

* **Threat:** Shizuku Service Itself Being Compromised
    * **Description:** A vulnerability exists within the Shizuku application itself. If exploited, an attacker could gain control over the Shizuku service and the permissions granted to it. This allows them to perform any action that any application with Shizuku access could perform.
    * **Impact:** This is a critical vulnerability, compromising the central point of trust for privileged operations, potentially affecting all applications relying on Shizuku.
    * **Affected Shizuku Component:** Entire Shizuku Application (Shizuku Service, API, etc.).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Shizuku Developers:** Rigorous security audits and testing of the Shizuku application.
        * **Shizuku Developers:** Promptly address and release updates for discovered vulnerabilities.
        * **User:** Keep the Shizuku application updated to the latest version.

* **Threat:** Information Disclosure Through Shizuku's Capabilities
    * **Description:** A malicious application with Shizuku access exploits Shizuku's capabilities to access sensitive system information. This could occur through insecure handling of data accessed via Shizuku or by directly leveraging Shizuku's privileged access to retrieve protected information.
    * **Impact:** Sensitive user data or system information could be exposed, leading to privacy violations or further attacks.
    * **Affected Shizuku Component:** Depends on the specific information accessed, but involves various Shizuku API calls and the underlying system components Shizuku interacts with.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:** Minimize the amount of sensitive information accessed through Shizuku.
        * **Developer:** Implement strict access controls and data sanitization for sensitive information handled, even if accessed through Shizuku.
        * **Developer:** Avoid logging sensitive information accessed via Shizuku.
