* **Attack Surface:** Compromised Data Source
    * **Description:** The source of the chain data (`ethereum-lists/chains` repository on GitHub) could be compromised by malicious actors, leading to the injection of malicious or incorrect data.
    * **How Chains Contributes:** The application directly relies on the data provided by this external repository. If the repository is compromised, the application will inherently use the tainted data.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to the `ethereum-lists/chains` repository and modifies the `chains/vX.json` file for a popular chain, replacing the legitimate RPC endpoint with a phishing site or a node controlled by the attacker.
    * **Impact:** Applications using this data could connect to malicious networks, expose user credentials, or execute arbitrary code if the application logic processes the malicious data unsafely.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement integrity checks on the downloaded data, such as verifying cryptographic signatures (if available from the repository maintainers) or comparing hashes against known good states.
        * Regularly monitor the `ethereum-lists/chains` repository for unexpected changes or suspicious activity.
        * Consider forking the repository and maintaining a local, vetted copy, applying updates after careful review.
        * Implement a mechanism to allow users to report suspicious chain data.
