# Threat Model Analysis for drakeet/multitype

## Threat: [Malicious Data Types Leading to Crashes](./threats/malicious_data_types_leading_to_crashes.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject data with unexpected or malformed types that are not handled by the registered `ItemViewBinders`. This could occur if the data source is compromised or if the application doesn't properly validate data before passing it to the `multitype` adapter. The attacker exploits `multitype`'s type resolution mechanism by providing data it cannot process correctly.

**Impact:** The application could crash due to unhandled exceptions or errors within the `multitype` library's type resolution logic or within the `ItemViewBinders` when attempting to bind the unexpected data. This leads to a denial of service for the user.

**Affected Component:** `multitype` core logic for type resolution and `ItemViewBinder` selection.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data before passing it to the `multitype` adapter.
- Use `try-catch` blocks within `ItemViewBinders` to gracefully handle unexpected data types and prevent crashes.
- Consider using a schema or data contract to define expected data structures and validate against it before using `multitype`.
- Implement default or fallback `ItemViewBinders` for unexpected data types to prevent crashes.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `multitype` Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__multitype__library_itself.md)

**Description:** The `multitype` library itself might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if they exist in the library's code, potentially affecting how it handles type registration, `ItemViewBinder` management, or data binding. The attacker directly targets flaws within the `multitype` library's implementation.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability within the `multitype` library. It could range from denial of service and information disclosure (if the vulnerability allows bypassing intended data handling) to potentially more severe issues if the vulnerability allows for code execution or memory corruption within the application's process due to a flaw in `multitype`.

**Affected Component:** The `multitype` library code.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (if any), potentially Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Regularly update the `multitype` library to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
- Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues related to `multitype`.
- Consider alternative libraries if critical security vulnerabilities are found and not promptly addressed by the maintainers.
