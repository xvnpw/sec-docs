# Threat Model Analysis for drakeet/multitype

## Threat: [Incorrect Item View Type Association Leading to Data Leakage](./threats/incorrect_item_view_type_association_leading_to_data_leakage.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides specially crafted input data. Due to flaws in the `Linker` logic or `ItemViewBinder` registration, the *wrong* `ItemViewBinder` is selected for a data item. The attacker might manipulate an ID or type field, causing an "admin" view (with sensitive data) to be displayed instead of a "user" view. This is a *direct* misuse of MultiType's core functionality.

**Impact:** Sensitive data intended for a restricted view type is displayed to unauthorized users, resulting in a data breach.

**Affected MultiType Component:** `Linker` implementation (specifically, the logic within the `index` method), `MultiTypeAdapter.register` (and related registration methods).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Robust Linker Logic:** Rigorously test the `Linker`'s `index` method. Cover all possible input variations, edge cases, and boundary conditions. Ensure correct mapping of data items to `ItemViewBinder`s.
*   **Type-Safe Data Representation:** Use a strong type system (sealed classes, enums) to represent data types and corresponding view binders. This prevents accidental mismatches.
*   **Input Validation (Pre-MultiType):** While primarily the application's responsibility, validating input *before* it reaches `MultiType` is crucial to prevent manipulated data from exploiting `Linker` flaws.
*   **Code Reviews:** Thoroughly review the `Linker` implementation and `ItemViewBinder` registrations.
*   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to find potential type mismatches or logic errors.

## Threat: [Code Injection via Unsafe User-Generated Content Handling *within an ItemViewBinder*](./threats/code_injection_via_unsafe_user-generated_content_handling_within_an_itemviewbinder.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides user-generated content (e.g., text with malicious HTML or JavaScript). If an `ItemViewBinder` *directly* renders this unsanitized content (especially within a `WebView` or a custom view that handles HTML/JS), it leads to code injection. This is a direct threat if the `ItemViewBinder` itself doesn't sanitize the content it receives.

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code (HTML, JavaScript) within the application, potentially leading to data theft, privilege escalation, or other malicious actions.

**Affected MultiType Component:** `ItemViewBinder` (specifically, `onBindViewHolder` and any custom views or `WebView`s used within the layout).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Avoid Raw HTML/JavaScript in ItemViewBinders:** **Never** directly render raw, unsanitized HTML or JavaScript within an `ItemViewBinder`. This is the most important mitigation.
*   **Sanitization (within ItemViewBinder):** If user content *must* be displayed, the `ItemViewBinder` is responsible for using a robust HTML sanitization library to remove/escape dangerous tags and attributes *before* rendering.
*   **Escaping (within ItemViewBinder):** Use appropriate escaping functions (e.g., `Html.fromHtml` with correct flags) to ensure content is treated as text, not code, *within the ItemViewBinder*.
*   **WebView Security (if unavoidable):** If a `WebView` is *absolutely* necessary within the `ItemViewBinder`, disable JavaScript (`setJavaScriptEnabled(false)`), disable file access (`setAllowFileAccess(false)`), and load content *only* from trusted sources. Use a Content Security Policy (CSP). The `ItemViewBinder` is responsible for configuring the `WebView` securely.
*   **Input Validation (Pre-MultiType):** While primarily the application's responsibility, validating input *before* it reaches `MultiType` helps prevent malicious content from reaching the `ItemViewBinder`. However, the `ItemViewBinder` *must still* sanitize, as it cannot rely on external validation.
