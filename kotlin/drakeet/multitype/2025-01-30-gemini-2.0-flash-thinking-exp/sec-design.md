# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - The primary goal of the `multitype` library is to simplify the development of Android RecyclerViews that display diverse data types.
  - The project prioritizes developer productivity by providing a reusable and easy-to-use library.
  - Another priority is to enhance code maintainability in Android projects by promoting a structured approach to handling multiple view types in RecyclerViews.
  - The project aims to improve the user experience of Android applications by enabling developers to create more dynamic and engaging list-based interfaces efficiently.
- Business Risks:
  - Low adoption rate by Android developers, leading to wasted development effort.
  - Bugs or performance issues in the library could negatively impact applications that depend on it, damaging developer trust.
  - Security vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited in applications using it, leading to potential security breaches in those applications.
  - Lack of community support and maintenance could lead to the library becoming outdated and unusable over time.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Source code hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's infrastructure security. (Implemented by: GitHub)
  - security control: Publicly accessible repository, allowing for community review and contributions. (Implemented by: GitHub)
  - security control: Issue tracking system on GitHub for reporting and managing bugs and potential vulnerabilities. (Implemented by: GitHub)
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities in the library code.
  - accepted risk: Risk of supply chain attacks through dependencies, although this project appears to have minimal dependencies.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated static analysis security testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Integrate dependency scanning to monitor for known vulnerabilities in any external libraries used (though currently dependencies seem minimal).
  - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability reporting and response process, including a security policy file in the repository.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable. This is a library and does not handle user authentication.
  - Authorization: Not applicable. This is a library and does not handle user authorization.
  - Input Validation: While the library itself primarily processes configuration data (class types, item binders), input validation should be considered for any public APIs to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes due to malformed input from developers using the library.
  - Cryptography: Not applicable. This library is not expected to handle sensitive data or require cryptographic operations. However, if future features involve handling any data, appropriate encryption measures should be considered at the application level where this library is used.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Providing a functional and reliable Android library to developers.
  - Maintaining the integrity and availability of the library in distribution repositories.
  - Ensuring the library is free from vulnerabilities that could impact applications using it.
- Data Sensitivity:
