# Threat Model Analysis for drakeet/multitype

## Threat: [Data Binding Errors Exploited for Information Disclosure](./threats/data_binding_errors_exploited_for_information_disclosure.md)

* **Description:** An attacker might craft data that, when bound to a specific `ItemViewBinder` provided by the developer and used by `multitype`, triggers an error or unexpected behavior that reveals sensitive information. This could involve exploiting assumptions made in the data binding logic *within the `ItemViewBinder`*, leading to the display of data that should not be visible in that context. The vulnerability lies in how the developer implements the binding logic within the components managed by `multitype`.
* **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive information to the user, potentially including personal data, internal application details, or other confidential information.
* **Affected Component:** Individual `ItemViewBinder` implementations (specifically the `onBindViewHolder` method, which is a developer-provided component used by `multitype`).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement robust error handling within the `onBindViewHolder` method of your `ItemViewBinders` to prevent exceptions from revealing sensitive information.
    * Avoid directly displaying raw data without proper sanitization or filtering in your `ItemViewBinders`.
    * Follow the principle of least privilege when binding data to views, ensuring only necessary information is displayed within your `ItemViewBinders`.
    * Regularly review and audit the data binding logic in your `ItemViewBinder` implementations for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exploiting Insecure Deserialization of Item Data](./threats/exploiting_insecure_deserialization_of_item_data.md)

* **Description:** If the data being displayed by `multitype` is deserialized from an external source, an attacker could inject malicious data payloads. While `multitype` itself doesn't handle deserialization, it processes the resulting objects passed to its `MultiTypeAdapter`. The vulnerability arises when these maliciously crafted objects are then handled by the `ItemViewBinder` implementations registered with `multitype`, potentially leading to code execution or other vulnerabilities *within the context of how these binders process the data*.
* **Impact:** Remote code execution, data corruption, application crashes, or other security breaches depending on the nature of the injected malicious payload and how it's handled by the `ItemViewBinders` used by `multitype`.
* **Affected Component:** The data objects passed to `MultiTypeAdapter` and subsequently processed by `ItemViewBinder` implementations (developer-provided components used by `multitype`).
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Use secure deserialization libraries and configurations for data that will be displayed using `multitype`.
    * Implement input validation and sanitization for data received from external sources *before* passing it to `multitype`.
    * Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources that will be used with `multitype`.
    * Consider using immutable data classes to reduce the risk of unintended modifications after deserialization, especially for data managed by `multitype`.
