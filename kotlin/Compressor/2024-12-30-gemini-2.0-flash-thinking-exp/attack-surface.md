* **Malformed Image File Processing**
    * Description: The application processes user-provided image files using the `Compressor` library. Maliciously crafted image files can exploit vulnerabilities in the image decoding process.
    * How Compressor Contributes: `Compressor` takes image files as input and utilizes underlying image processing libraries to decode and manipulate them. If these underlying libraries have vulnerabilities in handling specific image formats or malformed data, `Compressor` becomes a conduit for exploiting them.
    * Example: A user uploads a PNG file with a specially crafted header that triggers a buffer overflow in the underlying PNG decoding library used by `Compressor`.
    * Impact: Denial of service (application crash), potential remote code execution on the server if the underlying library vulnerability allows it, or information disclosure.
    * Risk Severity: High
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Implement robust input validation to check file types and basic image integrity *before* passing them to `Compressor`.
        * Keep the `Compressor` library and its underlying image processing dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * Consider using a dedicated image validation and sanitization library *before* using `Compressor`.
        * Implement error handling to gracefully manage exceptions thrown by `Compressor` during image processing.

* **Dependency Vulnerabilities**
    * Description: The `Compressor` library relies on other libraries for its functionality. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited through the application using `Compressor`.
    * How Compressor Contributes: `Compressor` has dependencies (e.g., libraries for bitmap manipulation, specific image format handling). If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, the application using `Compressor` inherits those risks.
    * Example: `Compressor` depends on a bitmap processing library that has a known vulnerability allowing for arbitrary code execution. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted image processed by `Compressor`.
    * Impact: Remote code execution, information disclosure, denial of service, depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability.
    * Risk Severity: High
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Regularly audit the dependencies of the `Compressor` library for known vulnerabilities using software composition analysis (SCA) tools.
        * Keep the `Compressor` library updated to benefit from updates to its dependencies.
        * Implement a process for promptly updating dependencies when security vulnerabilities are discovered.
        * Consider using dependency pinning or lock files to ensure consistent and known versions of dependencies are used.
