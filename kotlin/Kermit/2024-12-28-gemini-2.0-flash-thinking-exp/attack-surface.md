* **Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs**
    * **Description:** Sensitive information is unintentionally included in log messages.
    * **How Kermit Contributes:** Kermit provides the mechanism for logging. If developers use Kermit to log data without proper consideration for sensitivity, it directly contributes to this attack surface.
    * **Example:** A developer logs the full request body containing a user's password during an authentication attempt for debugging purposes using Kermit's `d()` or `e()` functions.
    * **Impact:** Confidential data like credentials, personal information, or business secrets can be exposed to anyone with access to the logs, leading to identity theft, financial loss, or reputational damage.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict policies against logging sensitive data using Kermit.
        * Utilize Kermit's features (if available) or custom logic to redact or mask sensitive information *before* passing it to Kermit's logging functions.
        * Regularly review code where Kermit is used to identify and remove instances of sensitive data logging.
        * Educate developers on secure logging practices specifically related to using Kermit.

* **Log Injection Attacks**
    * **Description:** Attackers inject malicious data into log messages, potentially exploiting systems that process or display these logs.
    * **How Kermit Contributes:** If user-controlled input is directly included in log messages via Kermit's logging functions without proper sanitization, it creates an avenue for injection attacks.
    * **Example:** A user provides a malicious string containing control characters or code snippets in a form field. This string is then logged using `Kermit.d(message)` without sanitization. A log analysis tool parsing this log entry might execute the injected code.
    * **Impact:** Can lead to log manipulation, command injection on systems processing logs, or cross-site scripting (XSS) if logs are displayed in web interfaces.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Sanitize or encode user-provided input *before* logging it with Kermit's functions.
        * Avoid directly embedding user input into log messages passed to Kermit. Use parameterized logging or structured logging where possible, even when using Kermit.
        * Secure the systems that process and display logs to prevent exploitation of injected content, regardless of how Kermit was used.

* **Information Disclosure through Log Locations and Access**
    * **Description:** Log files are stored in insecure locations or accessed by unauthorized individuals.
    * **How Kermit Contributes:** While Kermit itself doesn't directly control log storage *location*, its configuration (or lack thereof) regarding *where* logs are written (e.g., to a file path) can contribute to this risk.
    * **Example:** The application's Kermit configuration is set to write logs to a directory that is publicly accessible on a web server.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information contained within the logs, potentially leading to further attacks or data breaches.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Configure the logging destination used by Kermit to write log files to secure locations with restricted access permissions.
        * Ensure that directories where Kermit writes logs are not accessible through web servers or other public interfaces.
        * Implement secure log shipping and storage solutions if logs generated by Kermit are sent to external systems.

* **Vulnerabilities in Kermit Library Itself (Dependency Risk)**
    * **Description:** Security flaws are discovered within the Kermit library or its dependencies.
    * **How Kermit Contributes:** By using Kermit, the application inherently relies on its code and any underlying libraries, thus inheriting any potential vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** A security vulnerability is found in a specific version of Kermit that allows for a denial-of-service attack by sending specially crafted data that Kermit attempts to log.
    * **Impact:** Can range from information disclosure to remote code execution, depending on the nature of the vulnerability within Kermit or its dependencies.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Kermit to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reports related to Kermit and its dependencies.
        * Employ dependency scanning tools to identify and manage vulnerable dependencies used by Kermit.
