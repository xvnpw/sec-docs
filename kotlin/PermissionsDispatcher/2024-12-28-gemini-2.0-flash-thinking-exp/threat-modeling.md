Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve the PermissionsDispatcher library:

*   **Threat:** Incorrect Permission Checks
    *   **Description:** An attacker could potentially trigger functionality requiring a specific permission even if that permission has not been granted by the user. This might happen due to a logical flaw in the code generated by PermissionsDispatcher, where the permission check is bypassed or incorrectly evaluated.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources like camera, microphone, location, or contacts. This could lead to privacy breaches, data theft, or malicious actions performed without user consent.
    *   **Affected Component:** PermissionsDispatcher - Generated Code (specifically the code implementing the permission check logic within methods annotated with `@NeedsPermission`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Developers should thoroughly test all permission-dependent functionalities to ensure they are correctly protected.
        *   Regularly update PermissionsDispatcher to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   Consider using static analysis tools to examine the generated code for potential flaws.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Generated Code
    *   **Description:** An attacker could potentially exploit a security vulnerability present in the code generated by PermissionsDispatcher's annotation processor. This vulnerability might not be directly visible in the developer's source code.
    *   **Impact:** The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the generated code. It could range from information disclosure and denial of service to more severe issues like remote code execution (though less likely in this context).
    *   **Affected Component:** PermissionsDispatcher - Annotation Processor and Generated Code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the nature of the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Trust in the security practices of the PermissionsDispatcher developers and their commitment to secure coding practices.
        *   Regularly update PermissionsDispatcher to receive fixes for any discovered vulnerabilities in the generated code.
        *   Consider using static analysis tools on the generated code if feasible to identify potential issues.
