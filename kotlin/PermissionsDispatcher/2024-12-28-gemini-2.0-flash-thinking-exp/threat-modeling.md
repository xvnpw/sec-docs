Here's the filtered list of high and critical threats directly involving the `PermissionsDispatcher` library:

* **Threat:** Missing Permission Checks due to Incorrect `@NeedsPermission` Annotation Usage
    * **Description:** An attacker could potentially trigger functionality that requires a sensitive permission without the permission being granted if the developer incorrectly uses or omits the `@NeedsPermission` annotation on the relevant method. This directly circumvents the intended permission enforcement provided by `PermissionsDispatcher`.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources (e.g., camera, microphone, location), potentially leading to privacy breaches, data theft, or malicious actions performed without user consent.
    * **Affected Component:** `@NeedsPermission` annotation, methods intended to be protected by permissions.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly review all methods that access sensitive resources and ensure they are correctly annotated with `@NeedsPermission` for the appropriate permissions.
        * Utilize static analysis tools or linters that can detect missing or incorrect annotation usage related to `PermissionsDispatcher`.
        * Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests specifically targeting the permission checks enforced by `PermissionsDispatcher`.
        * Conduct code reviews with a focus on the correct application of `PermissionsDispatcher` annotations.

* **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities within the `PermissionsDispatcher` Library
    * **Description:** The `PermissionsDispatcher` library itself might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities if they find a way to trigger them through specific inputs or interactions with the library's API. This directly targets the security mechanisms provided by the library.
    * **Impact:** The impact could range from unexpected application behavior and crashes to complete bypass of the permission system, depending on the nature of the vulnerability within `PermissionsDispatcher`.
    * **Affected Component:** Core modules and functions within the `PermissionsDispatcher` library itself (e.g., permission request handling logic, annotation processing).
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep the `PermissionsDispatcher` library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes released by the library maintainers.
        * Monitor the `PermissionsDispatcher` library's issue tracker and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities.
        * Consider using dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the `PermissionsDispatcher` library.
