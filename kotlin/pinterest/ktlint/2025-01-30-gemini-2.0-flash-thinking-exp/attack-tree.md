## Attack Tree Path: [Attack Goal: Compromise Application via ktlint [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/attack_goal_compromise_application_via_ktlint__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the overarching objective. Success in any of the paths below leads to achieving this goal.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of application development environment and potentially the application codebase itself.
*   **Mitigation Focus:** Implement comprehensive security measures across all identified high-risk paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit ktlint Software Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ktlint_software_vulnerabilities__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting inherent weaknesses within the ktlint software itself.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Rule Execution Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the logic of ktlint rules, especially custom rules. Poorly written rules might contain code execution flaws (e.g., command injection, regex injection).
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (higher for custom rules).
        *   **Impact:** Critical - Arbitrary code execution in the development environment.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Secure development practices for custom rules.
            *   Thorough code review of custom rules.
            *   Regularly update ktlint to patch potential vulnerabilities in built-in rules.
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries (dependencies) used by ktlint.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium.
        *   **Impact:** Varies to Critical - Can range from Denial of Service to Remote Code Execution depending on the dependency vulnerability.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Regularly scan ktlint's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like dependency-check.
            *   Keep ktlint and its dependencies updated to patched versions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit ktlint Configuration Issues [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ktlint_configuration_issues__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses arising from insecure or misconfigured ktlint settings.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Misconfigured Rules (Too Permissive) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Disabling or weakening security-relevant ktlint rules, allowing malicious or insecure code patterns to pass undetected.
        *   **Likelihood:** High.
        *   **Impact:** Moderate - Increased risk of insecure code entering the codebase, potentially leading to runtime vulnerabilities in the application.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Regularly review and enforce ktlint rule configurations.
            *   Centralize and version control ktlint configurations.
            *   Educate developers on the importance of security rules.
    *   **Insecure Configuration Files [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Tampering with ktlint configuration files (e.g., `.editorconfig`, `ktlint.yml`) to disable security rules or inject malicious plugins.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (depending on access controls).
        *   **Impact:** Moderate to Critical - Weakened security posture, potential for code execution via malicious plugins.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Protect ktlint configuration files with appropriate access controls.
            *   Store configuration files in version control and monitor for unauthorized changes.
            *   Include configuration changes in code review processes.
    *   **Untrusted Rule Sets/Plugins [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Introducing malicious custom rules or plugins from untrusted sources, leading to code execution during ktlint runs.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (depending on developer practices).
        *   **Impact:** Critical - Arbitrary code execution in the development environment.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Only use ktlint rules and plugins from trusted and reputable sources.
            *   Thoroughly code review any custom rules or plugins before deployment.
            *   Implement a process for vetting and approving external ktlint components.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit ktlint Execution Environment [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ktlint_execution_environment__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path focuses on compromising the environment where ktlint is executed, using ktlint as a vehicle for further attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Compromised Development Environment [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Developer Workstation Compromise [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Description:** Compromising a developer's machine (e.g., via phishing, malware) and then manipulating ktlint execution.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High.
            *   **Impact:** Critical - Full control over developer environment, ability to modify ktlint execution, inject malicious code.
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Robust endpoint security for developer workstations (anti-malware, patching, strong passwords, MFA).
                *   Security awareness training for developers to prevent phishing and malware infections.
        *   **CI/CD Pipeline Compromise [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Description:** Compromising the CI/CD system and modifying the pipeline to execute malicious ktlint or inject code during the ktlint step.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium.
            *   **Impact:** Critical - Full control over build and deployment process, ability to inject malicious code into application builds.
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Harden CI/CD systems with strong access controls and secure configurations.
                *   Implement secure credential management for CI/CD pipelines.
                *   Monitor CI/CD systems for suspicious activity and unauthorized changes.
