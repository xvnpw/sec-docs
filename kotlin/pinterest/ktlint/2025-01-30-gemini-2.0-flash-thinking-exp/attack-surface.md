# Attack Surface Analysis for pinterest/ktlint

## Attack Surface: [1. Dependency Vulnerabilities (Critical)](./attack_surfaces/1__dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  Critical attack surface arising from severe vulnerabilities in third-party libraries that ktlint directly depends on, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **How ktlint contributes:** ktlint relies on external libraries for core functionalities like Kotlin parsing and code manipulation. If a dependency has a critical vulnerability (e.g., RCE), ktlint becomes a vector for exploiting it.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability (e.g., CVE with CVSS score 9.0+) is discovered in a Kotlin parsing library used by ktlint. An attacker crafts a Kotlin code snippet that, when processed by ktlint, exploits this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system running ktlint. This could be triggered during a CI/CD pipeline execution or a developer's local linting process.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the system running ktlint. This can lead to complete compromise of the development environment, CI/CD pipeline, or developer machines. Attackers can steal source code, inject backdoors, modify build processes, or pivot to other systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediate Patching of Dependencies:**  Prioritize and immediately update ktlint and its dependencies when critical vulnerabilities are announced and patches are available.
    *   **Automated Dependency Scanning with Severity Alerts:** Implement automated dependency scanning tools that specifically flag critical vulnerabilities in ktlint's dependencies and trigger immediate alerts.
    *   **Security Monitoring and Incident Response:**  Establish security monitoring for ktlint execution environments and have incident response plans in place to handle potential exploitation of dependency vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [2. Custom Rule Vulnerabilities (High to Critical)](./attack_surfaces/2__custom_rule_vulnerabilities__high_to_critical_.md)

*   **Description:** High to Critical attack surface introduced by malicious or severely flawed user-defined custom rules for ktlint, potentially leading to data breaches or code injection.
*   **How ktlint contributes:** ktlint's extensibility allows users to create and integrate custom rules that execute within the ktlint process and have direct access to the codebase being analyzed. This powerful feature, if misused or exploited, becomes a significant attack vector.
*   **Example:** A malicious developer or attacker with access to the ktlint configuration introduces a custom rule designed to:
    *   **Data Exfiltration (High to Critical):**  Scan the codebase for sensitive information (API keys, credentials, secrets) and exfiltrate it to an external server.
    *   **Code Injection/Backdoor (Critical):**  Modify the code during the linting process to inject backdoors or malicious code into the project without being easily detected by standard code review processes.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exfiltration (High to Critical):** Loss of sensitive information, potential compliance violations, and reputational damage. Severity depends on the sensitivity of the exfiltrated data.
    *   **Code Injection/Backdoor (Critical):** Introduction of persistent vulnerabilities into the codebase, potentially leading to long-term compromise of the application and downstream systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High to Critical**. Severity depends on the capabilities of the malicious custom rule and the potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application and development environment.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Security Review for Custom Rules:** Implement a strict and mandatory security review process for all custom rules by security experts before they are deployed. This review should include static analysis, dynamic testing, and code inspection.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Custom Rules:** Design and enforce a security policy that restricts the capabilities of custom rules to the absolute minimum necessary. Avoid granting broad file system, network, or code modification permissions.
    *   **Code Signing and Integrity Checks for Custom Rules:** Implement code signing for custom rules and integrity checks to ensure that only authorized and verified rules are loaded and executed by ktlint.
    *   **Sandboxing and Isolation for Custom Rule Execution:** Explore sandboxing or containerization techniques to isolate the execution environment of custom rules and limit the potential damage from malicious rules.

## Attack Surface: [3. Input Processing Vulnerabilities - Parser RCE (Critical)](./attack_surfaces/3__input_processing_vulnerabilities_-_parser_rce__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Critical attack surface arising from exploitable vulnerabilities within ktlint's Kotlin code parsing logic that can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when processing maliciously crafted Kotlin code.
*   **How ktlint contributes:** ktlint's core function is to parse and analyze Kotlin code. A critical vulnerability in the parser can be directly exploited by providing specially crafted Kotlin code as input.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow or memory corruption vulnerability exists in ktlint's Kotlin parser. An attacker crafts a highly specific Kotlin code file that, when parsed by ktlint, triggers this vulnerability, allowing the attacker to overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code within the ktlint process with the privileges of the user running ktlint.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the system running ktlint. Similar to dependency vulnerabilities, this can lead to complete compromise of the development environment, CI/CD pipeline, or developer machines, enabling attackers to perform a wide range of malicious actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Proactive Security Testing of ktlint Parser (for ktlint developers and maintainers):**  ktlint developers should prioritize rigorous security testing of the Kotlin parser, including fuzzing, static analysis, and penetration testing to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities before release.
    *   **Rapid Patching and Updates:** Users should promptly update to the latest versions of ktlint as soon as security patches for parser vulnerabilities are released.
    *   **Input Sanitization and Validation (Limited Applicability):** While direct input sanitization of code for a linter is complex, consider general input validation practices in workflows that feed code to ktlint, although this is less effective against parser-level vulnerabilities.
    *   **Resource Monitoring and Anomaly Detection:** Monitor ktlint's resource usage during execution. Unusual spikes in CPU or memory consumption when processing specific code files might indicate a potential parsing vulnerability being exploited and should trigger investigation.
