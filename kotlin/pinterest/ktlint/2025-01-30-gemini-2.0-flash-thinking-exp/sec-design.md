# BUSINESS POSTURE

The ktlint project is a static code analysis tool for Kotlin. It is primarily focused on ensuring code style consistency and identifying potential code quality issues in Kotlin projects.

- Business Priorities:
  - Maintainability of Kotlin codebases.
  - Code style consistency across projects and teams.
  - Improved code quality and reduced technical debt.
  - Developer productivity by automating code style checks and formatting.

- Business Risks:
  - Inconsistent code style leading to reduced readability and increased maintenance costs.
  - Code quality issues potentially leading to bugs and security vulnerabilities in Kotlin applications.
  - Increased development time due to manual code style checks and formatting.
  - Difficulty onboarding new developers to projects with inconsistent code styles.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: GitHub repository access control (implemented by GitHub).
  - security control: Open source project with community review (implemented by GitHub and community).
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in dependencies used by ktlint.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Dependency scanning to identify vulnerabilities in ktlint's dependencies.
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to scan ktlint's codebase for potential vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Code review process for all contributions to ktlint, focusing on security aspects.
  - security control: Security awareness training for ktlint maintainers and contributors.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Authentication is required for contributors to the ktlint project to ensure accountability and control over code changes (implemented by GitHub).
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Authorization is required to control access to the ktlint repository and its resources, ensuring only authorized individuals can modify the codebase or release artifacts (implemented by GitHub).
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: ktlint needs to validate input Kotlin code to prevent crashes or unexpected behavior when processing malformed or malicious code. This is especially important for custom rule definitions and configurations.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Cryptography is not a primary requirement for ktlint's core functionality. However, if ktlint were to implement features like secure configuration storage or communication, cryptographic measures would be necessary. For now, it's not a direct requirement.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Maintaining code quality and style consistency in Kotlin projects that use ktlint.
  - Ensuring the integrity and availability of the ktlint tool itself for the Kotlin development community.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Kotlin Source Code: Sensitivity - Medium. While generally not highly sensitive in open-source projects, it represents intellectual property and potential vulnerabilities if code quality is poor.
  - ktlint Configuration Files: Sensitivity - Low to Medium. May contain project-specific style rules or configurations that could be considered project-specific knowledge.
  - ktlint Artifacts (JAR files): Sensitivity - Medium. Integrity and authenticity are important to prevent supply chain attacks.
  - ktlint Reports: Sensitivity - Low. Contain information about code style issues, generally not sensitive.
