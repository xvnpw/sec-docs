### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving ktlint

Here's an updated threat list focusing on high and critical severity threats that directly involve the ktlint library.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Rule Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker contributes a seemingly benign ktlint rule that, upon execution by ktlint, injects malicious code snippets into the formatted codebase. This could happen through subtle code transformations or by leveraging ktlint's formatting capabilities to insert harmful logic.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities (e.g., backdoors, data exfiltration), unexpected application behavior, potential compromise of the application and its users.
    *   **Affected ktlint Component:** `RuleProvider` interface, custom rule implementations, core formatting engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and vet all custom ktlint rules before integrating them into the project.
        *   Restrict the sources from which custom rules are loaded.
        *   Implement code review processes for any changes to ktlint rule configurations.
        *   Consider using static analysis tools on the ktlint rule definitions themselves.

*   **Threat:** Compromised ktlint Binary/Distribution
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the official ktlint distribution channels (e.g., GitHub releases, Maven Central) and replaces the legitimate binary with a malicious one. Developers downloading this compromised version unknowingly introduce malicious code into their development environment and potentially their applications.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of malware into the development environment, potential injection of malicious code into all projects using the compromised ktlint version, supply chain compromise affecting multiple applications.
    *   **Affected ktlint Component:** Entire ktlint distribution package.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Verify the integrity of downloaded ktlint artifacts using checksums or digital signatures provided by the ktlint maintainers.
        *   Use trusted package managers and repositories with security scanning capabilities.
        *   Monitor for any unusual changes in ktlint's release artifacts or distribution channels.
        *   Consider using a private artifact repository to host and control the ktlint version used within the organization.

*   **Threat:** Tampering with ktlint Execution Environment
    *   **Description:** An attacker with access to the development environment modifies the ktlint executable or its dependencies directly on a developer's machine or a build server. This could involve replacing legitimate files with malicious ones or altering existing files to introduce malicious behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of malware into the development environment, potential injection of malicious code during the linting process, compromising the integrity of the codebase.
    *   **Affected ktlint Component:** Entire ktlint installation directory and its contents.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls and security measures for development environments and build servers.
        *   Use checksum verification to ensure the integrity of the ktlint executable and its dependencies.
        *   Regularly scan development machines and build servers for malware and unauthorized software.
        *   Utilize containerization or virtual environments to isolate the ktlint execution environment.
