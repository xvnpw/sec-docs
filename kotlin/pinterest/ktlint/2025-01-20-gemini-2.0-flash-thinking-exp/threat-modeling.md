# Threat Model Analysis for pinterest/ktlint

## Threat: [Malicious ktlint Configuration Injection](./threats/malicious_ktlint_configuration_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious rules or configurations directly into ktlint configuration files (e.g., `.editorconfig`, `.ktlint`). This could be achieved by compromising the repository where these files are stored or a developer's machine. The malicious configuration could introduce subtle code changes that introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors by manipulating ktlint's formatting and linting behavior, or it could disable important security-related linting rules, allowing insecure code to pass unnoticed by ktlint.

**Impact:** Introduction of security vulnerabilities, backdoors, or reduced code quality leading to potential exploits due to ktlint's direct influence on the codebase.

**Affected Component:** ktlint core functionality, configuration loading mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Store ktlint configuration files in a version-controlled repository.
*   Implement code review processes for changes to ktlint configuration files.
*   Restrict write access to the repository containing ktlint configuration.
*   Use infrastructure-as-code to manage and deploy ktlint configurations.
*   Regularly audit ktlint configuration for unexpected or suspicious rules.

## Threat: [ktlint Plugin Exploitation](./threats/ktlint_plugin_exploitation.md)

**Description:** If the application uses custom ktlint plugins, an attacker could exploit vulnerabilities directly within these plugins. This could involve crafting specific code that, when processed by ktlint and the vulnerable plugin, triggers arbitrary code execution during the linting process. The malicious plugin code runs within the ktlint execution context.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the build environment, potentially leading to the injection of malicious code into the application or compromise of the build system, directly caused by a flaw in a ktlint extension.

**Affected Component:** ktlint plugin execution mechanism, the vulnerable custom plugin interface within ktlint.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Thoroughly review and audit custom ktlint plugins for security vulnerabilities.
*   Apply secure coding practices when developing custom ktlint plugins.
*   Implement input validation and sanitization within custom plugins.
*   Keep custom ktlint plugins updated with security patches.
*   Consider signing custom ktlint plugins to ensure their integrity before ktlint loads them.
