# Attack Surface Analysis for pinterest/ktlint

## Attack Surface: [Custom Rule Set Vulnerabilities (If Applicable)](./attack_surfaces/custom_rule_set_vulnerabilities__if_applicable_.md)

* **Description:** If using custom rule sets for `ktlint`, vulnerabilities within these rules can be exploited.
* **How ktlint Contributes:** `ktlint` executes the logic defined in custom rule sets. If these rules contain vulnerabilities, `ktlint` becomes the execution vehicle.
* **Example:** A custom rule designed to automatically fix certain code patterns contains a flaw that allows for arbitrary code execution when processing specific code constructs.
* **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the build environment, potential compromise of the development machine or CI/CD pipeline.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Thoroughly review and test custom rule sets for security vulnerabilities.
    * Follow secure coding practices when developing custom rules.
    * Limit the capabilities and permissions granted to custom rule sets.
    * Only use custom rule sets from trusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Build Process Integration Risks](./attack_surfaces/build_process_integration_risks.md)

* **Description:** The way `ktlint` is integrated into the build process can introduce vulnerabilities.
* **How ktlint Contributes:** `ktlint` is often executed as part of the build process. If this integration is not secure, it can be exploited to manipulate or compromise the `ktlint` execution itself or the surrounding build environment.
* **Example:** An attacker compromises the CI/CD pipeline and modifies the build script to replace the legitimate `ktlint` executable with a malicious one, which then runs with the build environment's permissions.
* **Impact:** Compromise of the build environment, potential for malicious code injection into the build artifacts.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Secure the build environment and CI/CD pipeline.
    * Implement proper access controls for build scripts and related infrastructure.
    * Use checksums or other integrity checks to ensure the `ktlint` executable and its dependencies haven't been tampered with.
    * Isolate the build environment to limit the impact of potential compromises.
