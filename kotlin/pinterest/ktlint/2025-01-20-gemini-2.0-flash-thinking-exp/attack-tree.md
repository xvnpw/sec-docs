## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH-RISK [CRITICAL] OR: Exploit ktlint Vulnerability:**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk__critical__or_exploit_ktlint_vulnerability.md)

This represents the overarching high-risk path of directly exploiting weaknesses within the ktlint library itself. Success here leads to the ability to execute arbitrary code within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [**AND: Identify ktlint Vulnerability:**](./attack_tree_paths/and_identify_ktlint_vulnerability.md)

This is a necessary step to exploit a vulnerability. The attacker needs to find a weakness before they can exploit it.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH-RISK [CRITICAL] Discover Zero-Day Vulnerability:**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk__critical__discover_zero-day_vulnerability.md)

Attackers with advanced skills and resources can analyze ktlint's source code to identify previously unknown vulnerabilities in its parsing, formatting, or rule processing logic. This is a high-effort but potentially high-reward attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH-RISK [CRITICAL] AND: Trigger Vulnerability During ktlint Execution:**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk__critical__and_trigger_vulnerability_during_ktlint_execution.md)

Once a vulnerability is identified, the attacker needs to trigger it during ktlint's execution to achieve their goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH-RISK [CRITICAL] Supply Maliciously Crafted Kotlin Code:**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk__critical__supply_maliciously_crafted_kotlin_code.md)

Attackers can craft specific Kotlin code snippets designed to exploit identified vulnerabilities in ktlint's parsing or formatting engine. This code might trigger buffer overflows, injection flaws, or other unexpected behaviors within ktlint that could lead to code execution within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH-RISK [CRITICAL] Supply Malicious Custom Rule Set:**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk__critical__supply_malicious_custom_rule_set.md)

If the application uses custom ktlint rules, attackers can provide a malicious rule set. This rule set could contain code that, when executed by ktlint, compromises the application by exploiting a vulnerability in ktlint's rule processing.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH-RISK [CRITICAL] OR: Leverage ktlint's Code Modification Capabilities:**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk__critical__or_leverage_ktlint's_code_modification_capabilities.md)

This represents the high-risk path of abusing ktlint's intended functionality (code formatting and linting) to introduce malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH-RISK [CRITICAL] AND: Introduce Malicious Code via Formatting:**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk__critical__and_introduce_malicious_code_via_formatting.md)

Attackers can exploit ktlint's automatic code formatting features to inject malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH-RISK [CRITICAL] Exploit Formatting Logic Bugs:**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk__critical__exploit_formatting_logic_bugs.md)

Attackers can identify bugs or inconsistencies in ktlint's formatting logic. By crafting specific code structures, they might be able to trick ktlint into automatically inserting malicious code during the formatting process. This could involve exploiting edge cases in how ktlint handles specific syntax or formatting rules.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH-RISK [CRITICAL] AND: Introduce Malicious Code via Custom Rules:**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk__critical__and_introduce_malicious_code_via_custom_rules.md)

If the application uses custom ktlint rules, this provides a direct avenue for introducing malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH-RISK [CRITICAL] Directly Inject Malicious Code in Custom Rule:**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk__critical__directly_inject_malicious_code_in_custom_rule.md)

Attackers with access to the custom rule definitions can directly embed malicious code within the rule's logic. This code will be executed whenever ktlint processes code using that rule.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH-RISK [CRITICAL] Indirectly Introduce Vulnerability via Flawed Custom Rule Logic:**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk__critical__indirectly_introduce_vulnerability_via_flawed_custom_rule_logic.md)

Even without directly injecting malicious code, poorly written custom rules can introduce vulnerabilities. For example, a rule that performs string manipulation without proper sanitization could be exploited to inject code during the formatting process.
