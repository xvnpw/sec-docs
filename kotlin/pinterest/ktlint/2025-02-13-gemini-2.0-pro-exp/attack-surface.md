# Attack Surface Analysis for pinterest/ktlint

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Custom Rule Sets](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_custom_rule_sets.md)

*   **1. Vulnerable Custom Rule Sets**

    *   **Description:**  Custom rule sets (JAR files loaded by `ktlint`) contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited. This is a software supply chain risk *directly* impacting `ktlint`'s execution.
    *   **How `ktlint` Contributes:** `ktlint` executes the code within custom rule sets, providing the direct execution pathway for any malicious code within those rules.
    *   **Example:** A custom rule set has a dependency on a vulnerable library. An attacker crafts input that triggers the vulnerability *through* `ktlint`'s execution of that rule.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Potential for arbitrary code execution (the primary reason for High severity).
        *   Denial of service of the build process.
        *   Possible information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Due to the potential for code execution).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Source Code Review:** Thoroughly review the source code of *all* custom rule sets, treating them as high-risk components.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use static analysis and vulnerability scanning tools on custom rule set code *and* their dependencies.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Carefully manage and vet all dependencies of custom rule sets. Use a dependency scanning tool and keep dependencies updated.
        *   **Sandboxing (Recommended):** Run `ktlint` in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of a compromised rule set. This significantly reduces the blast radius of a successful exploit.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure `ktlint` runs with the absolute minimum system privileges necessary.

## Attack Surface: [`ktlint` Core Vulnerabilities (Hypothetical, but High Impact)](./attack_surfaces/_ktlint__core_vulnerabilities__hypothetical__but_high_impact_.md)

*   **2. `ktlint` Core Vulnerabilities (Hypothetical, but High Impact)**

    *   **Description:** A vulnerability exists within the `ktlint` codebase itself (e.g., a buffer overflow, injection flaw). This is a direct vulnerability in the tool.
    *   **How `ktlint` Contributes:** The vulnerability is *within* `ktlint`'s own code, making `ktlint` the direct target.
    *   **Example:** A hypothetical buffer overflow in `ktlint`'s parsing logic could be exploited by a specially crafted Kotlin file provided as input to `ktlint`.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Potentially arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure (depending on the specific vulnerability). The potential for code execution makes this high-risk.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Low probability, but high *potential* impact).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep `ktlint` Updated:** This is the *most crucial* mitigation. Regularly update to the latest version of `ktlint` to receive security patches.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories or mailing lists related to `ktlint` to be immediately notified of any vulnerabilities.
        *   **Sandboxing (For Very High-Security Environments):** In extremely high-security environments, consider running `ktlint` in a sandboxed environment. This is generally overkill for most use cases but provides an extra layer of defense.
