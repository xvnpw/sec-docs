# Threat Model Analysis for pinterest/ktlint

## Threat: [Malicious Custom Rule Execution](./threats/malicious_custom_rule_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Custom Rule Execution

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious ktlint rule set (JAR file) and distributes it through a compromised repository, social engineering, or a compromised dependency. A developer unknowingly downloads and integrates this rule set. When ktlint runs, the malicious rule executes arbitrary code on the developer's machine or within the CI/CD pipeline. The attacker could steal credentials, modify source code, install malware, or pivot to other systems. This is a classic supply chain attack.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete system compromise (developer machine or CI/CD server).
        *   Data exfiltration (source code, credentials, sensitive data).
        *   Code modification (introduction of backdoors, vulnerabilities, or malicious logic).
        *   Lateral movement within the network.

    *   **Affected ktlint Component:** Custom rule loading mechanism (`RuleSetProvider`, class loading, and the ServiceLoader mechanism). The core vulnerability is ktlint's ability to load and execute arbitrary code from external JAR files provided as rule sets.

    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Source Verification:** *Strictly* obtain rule sets only from trusted, official sources (e.g., the official ktlint GitHub repository, extremely well-known and vetted community providers with a strong security track record). Avoid any unknown or unverified sources.
        *   **Code Review:** Mandate thorough, manual code review of the *source code* of *any* custom rule set before integration. Treat it as a high-risk third-party dependency. Do not rely solely on automated scanning.
        *   **Checksum Verification:** Always verify the SHA-256 (or other strong cryptographic hash) checksum of the downloaded rule set JAR against a known good value published by the trusted source.  Automate this verification in build scripts.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Run ktlint within a strictly sandboxed environment (e.g., a Docker container with minimal privileges and network access) to contain the potential impact of malicious code execution. This is *essential* for CI/CD pipelines.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management system (e.g., Gradle, Maven) that supports and enforces checksum verification for external JAR dependencies. Configure it to fail the build if checksums do not match.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run ktlint with the absolute minimum necessary privileges. Never run it as root or with administrator access.
        * **Network Restrictions:** If possible, restrict network access for the environment where ktlint is executed, especially during CI/CD, to limit the attacker's ability to exfiltrate data or communicate with command-and-control servers.

## Threat: [Exploitation of ktlint Vulnerability (Leading to Code Execution)](./threats/exploitation_of_ktlint_vulnerability__leading_to_code_execution_.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of ktlint Vulnerability (Leading to Code Execution)

    *   **Description:** An attacker discovers a zero-day vulnerability in ktlint itself (e.g., in the parsing logic, rule engine, or a specific built-in rule) that allows for arbitrary code execution. They craft a specially designed Kotlin file that, when processed by ktlint, triggers the vulnerability and executes malicious code. This is less likely than the malicious rule scenario but still a significant risk.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Remote code execution on the developer's machine or CI/CD server.
        *   Data exfiltration.
        *   Code modification.
        *   System compromise.

    *   **Affected ktlint Component:** Potentially any part of ktlint, depending on the specific vulnerability. Likely areas include:
        *   `KtLint.kt` (main entry point and processing logic)
        *   `com.pinterest.ktlint.core.ast` (Abstract Syntax Tree parsing)
        *   Specific rule implementations within `com.pinterest.ktlint.ruleset.standard` or `com.pinterest.ktlint.ruleset.experimental`

    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical if a readily exploitable RCE is found)

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Updated:**  Maintain a strict policy of updating to the *latest* version of ktlint immediately upon release.  Automate this process in CI/CD.
        *   **Monitor Advisories:** Actively monitor ktlint's security advisories, release announcements, and any relevant security mailing lists for vulnerability disclosures.
        *   **Sandboxing:** As with malicious rules, running ktlint in a sandboxed environment (e.g., Docker) significantly reduces the impact of a potential code execution vulnerability.
        *   **Fuzzing (Advanced):** For organizations with high security requirements, consider implementing fuzz testing of ktlint to proactively discover vulnerabilities before attackers do. This is a specialized security testing technique.
        * **Vulnerability Scanning (Advanced):** Integrate static analysis tools that can scan ktlint's codebase itself for potential vulnerabilities.
