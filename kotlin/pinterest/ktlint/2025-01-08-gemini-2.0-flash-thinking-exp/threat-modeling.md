# Threat Model Analysis for pinterest/ktlint

## Threat: [Malicious `.editorconfig` Modification](./threats/malicious___editorconfig__modification.md)

**Threat:** Malicious `.editorconfig` Modification
    * **Description:** An attacker gains write access to the repository and modifies the `.editorconfig` file. This could involve disabling security-related checks or enforcing insecure formatting rules that make vulnerabilities harder to spot.
    * **Impact:** Introduction of security vulnerabilities, reduced code quality, potential for subtle bugs that are hard to detect.
    * **Affected ktlint Component:** Configuration Loading (`.editorconfig` parsing).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strict access controls for repository write access, enforce code review for changes to `.editorconfig`, use configuration management tools to track changes.

## Threat: [Malicious ktlint Configuration File Modification](./threats/malicious_ktlint_configuration_file_modification.md)

**Threat:** Malicious ktlint Configuration File Modification
    * **Description:** An attacker gains write access and modifies ktlint's specific configuration files (e.g., `.ktlint`). They could introduce custom rules that inject malicious code during formatting or disable important security checks provided by ktlint or other linters.
    * **Impact:** Direct injection of malicious code into the codebase, disabling of security safeguards, potential for backdoors or data exfiltration.
    * **Affected ktlint Component:** Rule Engine, Custom Rule Loading.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strict access controls, enforce code review for changes to ktlint configuration files, use a version control system for these files, consider using signed configurations if ktlint supports it.

## Threat: [Compromised Third-Party ktlint Ruleset](./threats/compromised_third-party_ktlint_ruleset.md)

**Threat:** Compromised Third-Party ktlint Ruleset
    * **Description:** The project uses a third-party or community-maintained ktlint ruleset. An attacker compromises this ruleset repository and injects malicious rules. When the project updates the ruleset, the malicious rules are integrated into the development workflow.
    * **Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities through malicious formatting or linting actions, potential for supply chain attacks injecting backdoors or malware.
    * **Affected ktlint Component:** Rule Engine, External Rule Loading.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:** Carefully vet and select third-party rulesets, regularly review the rules for unexpected changes, consider forking and maintaining a local copy of trusted rulesets, implement dependency scanning for known vulnerabilities in ruleset dependencies (if applicable).

## Threat: [Vulnerability in ktlint's Parsing Logic](./threats/vulnerability_in_ktlint's_parsing_logic.md)

**Threat:** Vulnerability in ktlint's Parsing Logic
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts specific Kotlin code that exploits a vulnerability in ktlint's parsing or formatting logic. This could cause ktlint to produce incorrect output, or potentially even allow for code execution if ktlint is used in an insecure environment.
    * **Impact:** Introduction of subtle bugs due to incorrect formatting, potential for remote code execution if ktlint is running in a privileged context.
    * **Affected ktlint Component:** Parser, Formatter.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:** Keep ktlint updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes, monitor ktlint's issue tracker for reported vulnerabilities, avoid running ktlint in highly privileged environments.

## Threat: [Vulnerability in ktlint's Dependency](./threats/vulnerability_in_ktlint's_dependency.md)

**Threat:** Vulnerability in ktlint's Dependency
    * **Description:** ktlint relies on other libraries. An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in one of ktlint's dependencies. This could be leveraged if ktlint doesn't properly isolate its dependencies or if the vulnerability allows for execution within ktlint's process.
    * **Impact:** Potential for various impacts depending on the dependency vulnerability, including remote code execution or information disclosure.
    * **Affected ktlint Component:** Dependency Management, potentially various modules depending on the vulnerable dependency.
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the dependency vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:** Keep ktlint updated, use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in ktlint's dependencies, investigate and update dependencies if vulnerabilities are found.
