# Attack Surface Analysis for pinterest/ktlint

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Custom Rule Sets](./attack_surfaces/malicious_custom_rule_sets.md)

**Description:**  The application integrates custom ktlint rule sets from external or untrusted sources. These rule sets can contain malicious code.

**How ktlint Contributes:** ktlint's extensibility allows for the inclusion of custom rules, which are essentially code executed *by ktlint* during the linting process.

**Example:** A developer adds a custom rule set from a public, unverified repository. This rule set contains code that, when executed by ktlint, reads environment variables containing API keys and sends them to an external server.

**Impact:**  Critical. Could lead to data exfiltration, secret leakage, or unauthorized access to resources.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Only use custom rule sets from trusted and verified sources.
*   Conduct thorough code reviews of custom rule sets before integration.
*   Implement a process for vetting and managing custom rule sets.
*   Consider using static analysis tools on custom rule sets themselves.
*   Utilize a controlled environment for running ktlint with custom rules initially.

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection via ktlint Configuration](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_via_ktlint_configuration.md)

**Description:**  ktlint configuration mechanisms (e.g., `.editorconfig` or command-line arguments) might allow for the execution of external commands or scripts.

**How ktlint Contributes:** If ktlint's configuration parsing or handling allows for interpreting certain values as executable commands, it creates an injection point *within ktlint's execution*.

**Example:** An attacker gains write access to the `.editorconfig` file and injects a command that gets executed when ktlint is run, such as deleting files or installing malware.

**Impact:** High. Could lead to arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine or build server.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict write access to ktlint configuration files.
*   Sanitize or validate any input used in ktlint configuration that could potentially be interpreted as commands.
*   Avoid using ktlint configuration features that involve executing external commands unless absolutely necessary and with strong security controls.
*   Regularly review ktlint configuration files for unexpected or suspicious entries.
