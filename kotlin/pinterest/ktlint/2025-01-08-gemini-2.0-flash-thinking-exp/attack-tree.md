## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application via ktlint [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_via_ktlint__critical_node_.md)

* This represents the overall objective of the attacker. Success at this level means the attacker has achieved their goal of compromising the application by exploiting ktlint.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Inject Malicious Code via ktlint [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__inject_malicious_code_via_ktlint__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker aims to inject malicious code directly into the application's codebase through ktlint. This is a high-impact attack as it grants the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code within the application's context.
* **Why High-Risk:**  This path has multiple avenues for exploitation and a severe consequence.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit ktlint's Code Formatting Capabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_ktlint's_code_formatting_capabilities__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker targets ktlint's ability to automatically reformat code. By manipulating or exploiting this functionality, they can introduce malicious changes.
* **Why Critical:** This is a key entry point for injecting malicious code via ktlint.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Craft Malicious Formatting Rules [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__craft_malicious_formatting_rules__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker with influence over the custom ktlint rule set can create seemingly benign formatting rules that, when applied, inject malicious code or alter existing code in a harmful way.
* **Why High-Risk:**  Combines a medium likelihood (requires influence) with a high impact (direct code injection).

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Inject Code through Custom Rule Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/5__inject_code_through_custom_rule_configuration.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  This is the specific action within the "Craft Malicious Formatting Rules" attack vector where the malicious logic is embedded within the custom rule's definition.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploit Bugs in Default Formatting Logic](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_bugs_in_default_formatting_logic.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker identifies and leverages vulnerabilities within ktlint's built-in formatting engine. By providing specific code constructs that trigger these bugs, they can cause ktlint to reformat the code in a way that introduces vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Introduce Vulnerabilities via Reformatting](./attack_tree_paths/7__introduce_vulnerabilities_via_reformatting.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This is the outcome of exploiting bugs in the default formatting logic, where the reformatting process unintentionally creates security flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Exploit ktlint's Code Parsing/Linting Capabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/8__exploit_ktlint's_code_parsinglinting_capabilities__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker targets how ktlint parses and analyzes Kotlin code. By providing specially crafted code, they can exploit weaknesses in ktlint's understanding of the code.
* **Why Critical:** This is another key entry point for introducing vulnerabilities, albeit more subtle ones.

## Attack Tree Path: [9. Exploit Misinterpretations of Code [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/9__exploit_misinterpretations_of_code__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker leverages subtle differences in how ktlint interprets code compared to the actual Kotlin compiler. They craft code that ktlint formats in a way that introduces logic flaws or security vulnerabilities when the code is ultimately compiled and executed.
* **Why High-Risk:** Combines a medium likelihood with a medium/high impact and high detection difficulty.

## Attack Tree Path: [10. Introduce Subtle Logic Flaws via Formatting](./attack_tree_paths/10__introduce_subtle_logic_flaws_via_formatting.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This is the result of exploiting misinterpretations, where the formatting changes lead to unintended and potentially exploitable logic errors in the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [11. Introduce Subtle Bugs Affecting Runtime [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/11__introduce_subtle_bugs_affecting_runtime__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker aims to introduce bugs that are not immediately obvious but can lead to vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior during the application's runtime.
* **Why High-Risk:** These bugs can be difficult to detect and can have significant consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [12. Manipulate Code Formatting to Introduce Logic Errors [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/12__manipulate_code_formatting_to_introduce_logic_errors__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker subtly manipulates ktlint's configuration or exploits formatting bugs to introduce logic errors that are difficult to detect during development.
* **Why High-Risk:** Combines a medium/high effort and skill level with a medium impact and high detection difficulty.

## Attack Tree Path: [13. Change Execution Flow or Data Handling](./attack_tree_paths/13__change_execution_flow_or_data_handling.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This is the specific outcome of manipulating code formatting, where the changes alter the intended sequence of operations or the way data is processed, potentially leading to vulnerabilities.
