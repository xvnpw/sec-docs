# Attack Surface Analysis for square/picasso

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe URL Handling](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_url_handling.md)

* **Description:** The application uses URLs provided by users or external sources to load images without proper validation or sanitization.
    * **How Picasso Contributes:** Picasso directly uses the provided URL to fetch the image. If the URL is malicious, Picasso will attempt to load it, potentially triggering unintended actions.
    * **Example:** An attacker could inject a URL pointing to an internal service (SSRF) or a phishing site disguised as a legitimate image.
    * **Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery, access to internal resources, phishing attacks, exposure of internal network structure.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Validate and sanitize user-provided URLs *before* passing them to Picasso.
        * Use allow-lists for acceptable domains or URL patterns.
        * Implement proper input validation to prevent injection of malicious characters.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure HTTP Image Loading](./attack_surfaces/insecure_http_image_loading.md)

* **Description:** The application loads images over insecure HTTP connections, making the communication susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
    * **How Picasso Contributes:** Picasso, by default, will load images from both HTTP and HTTPS URLs if provided.
    * **Example:** An attacker on the same network could intercept the HTTP request and replace the intended image with a malicious one, or simply observe the requested URLs.
    * **Impact:** Injection of malicious content (e.g., malware, phishing images), information disclosure (observing requested URLs).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Enforce HTTPS:** Configure Picasso or the application's network settings to only load images over HTTPS.
        * **Use `OkHttp` with TLS configuration:** If using a custom `OkHttp` client with Picasso, ensure proper TLS configuration and certificate pinning for added security.

## Attack Surface: [Image Processing Vulnerabilities via Malicious Images](./attack_surfaces/image_processing_vulnerabilities_via_malicious_images.md)

* **Description:** Loading and processing maliciously crafted images can exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying image decoding libraries used by Android.
    * **How Picasso Contributes:** Picasso fetches the image and then relies on the Android platform's image decoding capabilities. If a malicious image triggers a vulnerability in these decoders, it can impact the application.
    * **Example:** An attacker provides an image with specially crafted headers or data that causes a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issue during decoding.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (application crash), potential for Remote Code Execution (depending on the vulnerability).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep Android System Up-to-Date:** Ensure users are running the latest Android version with security patches.
        * **Limit Image Sources:** Restrict image loading to trusted sources where possible.
        * **Consider Server-Side Validation:**  Validate image integrity and basic properties on the server before allowing them to be loaded by the application.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Custom Downloader Implementations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_custom_downloader_implementations.md)

* **Description:** Developers might implement custom `Downloader` classes to handle image fetching, potentially introducing security vulnerabilities in their own code.
    * **How Picasso Contributes:** Picasso provides the flexibility to use custom `Downloader` implementations. If these implementations are not secure, they become an attack vector.
    * **Example:** A custom downloader might not properly handle authentication, ignore SSL/TLS certificate validation, or store credentials insecurely.
    * **Impact:** Authentication bypass, exposure of credentials, insecure communication.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Thoroughly Review Custom Downloader Code:** Conduct security code reviews of any custom `Downloader` implementations.
        * **Follow Secure Coding Practices:** Implement proper authentication, authorization, and secure communication protocols in custom downloaders.
