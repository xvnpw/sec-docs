# Attack Surface Analysis for square/picasso

## Attack Surface: [Untrusted Image URLs](./attack_surfaces/untrusted_image_urls.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses Picasso to load images from URLs that are not properly validated or controlled.
    *   **How Picasso Contributes:** Picasso directly fetches and loads images from the provided URL. If the application doesn't sanitize the URL, Picasso will attempt to load from any provided source.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could manipulate a user profile to include a URL pointing to an internal server resource (SSRF) or a very large image causing a denial-of-service.
    *   **Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), denial-of-service, potential exposure of internal resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all image URLs before passing them to Picasso. Use URL whitelisting to allow only trusted domains. Consider using Content Security Policy (CSP) where applicable.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Image Processing](./attack_surfaces/malicious_image_processing.md)

*   **Description:** Picasso uses underlying image decoding libraries (like libjpeg, libpng, WebP). Vulnerabilities in these libraries can be exploited by serving maliciously crafted images.
    *   **How Picasso Contributes:** Picasso acts as a conduit by fetching and passing the image data to these libraries for decoding and display.
    *   **Example:** A specially crafted PNG image could trigger a buffer overflow in libpng when Picasso attempts to decode it, potentially leading to a crash or even remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, potential remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Keep Picasso and the underlying system libraries updated to patch known vulnerabilities. Consider using image format validation libraries before loading with Picasso. Implement robust error handling to prevent crashes from propagating.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Certificate Pinning](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_certificate_pinning.md)

*   **Description:** Picasso, by default, relies on the system's trust store for SSL certificate validation. Without certificate pinning, the application is vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
    *   **How Picasso Contributes:** Picasso makes network requests to download images. If the connection is intercepted, an attacker could serve malicious images instead of the legitimate ones.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on a shared Wi-Fi network intercepts the connection when the application downloads an image. The attacker presents a fraudulent certificate, and without pinning, Picasso (and the underlying network stack) might accept it, allowing the attacker to serve a malicious image.
    *   **Impact:** Display of incorrect or harmful content, potential execution of malicious code if the replaced image exploits a vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement certificate pinning within the application's network layer. This ensures that the application only trusts specific certificates for the image server.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Downloader Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/custom_downloader_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses a custom `Downloader` implementation with Picasso, vulnerabilities within that custom implementation can introduce new attack vectors.
    *   **How Picasso Contributes:** Picasso allows developers to provide a custom `Downloader` to handle network requests. If this custom implementation is not secure, it can be exploited when Picasso uses it.
    *   **Example:** A custom `Downloader` might not properly handle redirects, leading to SSRF vulnerabilities, or might not validate SSL certificates correctly.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability in the custom `Downloader`, potentially including SSRF, MITM attacks, or other network-related issues.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Thoroughly review and test any custom `Downloader` implementations for security vulnerabilities. Follow secure coding practices when developing custom network components. Consider using well-vetted and secure network libraries instead of implementing everything from scratch.
