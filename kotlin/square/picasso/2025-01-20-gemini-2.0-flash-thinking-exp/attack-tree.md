## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Picasso Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_picasso_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents any successful compromise achieved by exploiting Picasso.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Image Loading/Processing [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_image_loadingprocessing__critical_node_.md)

This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities during the process of loading and processing images using Picasso. It's critical because image loading is a core function of the library.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Load Malicious Image [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__load_malicious_image__critical_node_.md)

This path involves tricking the application into loading a specially crafted image that contains malicious code or triggers a vulnerability. It's critical because it's a direct route to code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Load Image from Maliciously Controlled Server](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__load_image_from_maliciously_controlled_server.md)

The attacker hosts a malicious image on their own server and the application loads it.
    * Serve Image with Exploit (e.g., Buffer Overflow, Malicious Code): The malicious image is crafted to exploit a vulnerability in the image decoding library used by Picasso.
        * Trigger Vulnerability in Image Decoding Library (Underlying Picasso): The act of decoding the malicious image triggers a flaw in libraries like libjpeg, libpng, or WebP.
            * [HIGH-RISK PATH] Achieve Code Execution on Device [CRITICAL NODE]: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's device, granting them significant control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack.md)

The attacker intercepts network traffic and replaces a legitimate image with a malicious one.
    * Intercept and Replace Legitimate Image with Malicious Image: The attacker intercepts the communication between the application and the image server.
        * Serve Image with Exploit (e.g., Buffer Overflow, Malicious Code): The attacker injects a malicious image into the response.
            * Trigger Vulnerability in Image Decoding Library (Underlying Picasso): Decoding the injected malicious image triggers a vulnerability.
                * [HIGH-RISK PATH] Achieve Code Execution on Device [CRITICAL NODE]: Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Image Processing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_image_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

This path focuses on exploiting flaws in how Picasso processes images after they are loaded.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Trigger Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__trigger_resource_exhaustion.md)

The attacker attempts to overload the application by causing it to consume excessive resources.
    * Load Extremely Large Image: Loading an image with an extremely high resolution or file size.
        * Load Many Images Simultaneously: Requesting a large number of images to be loaded at the same time.
            * Cause Out of Memory Error, Crashing Application (DoS):  The excessive resource consumption leads to the application running out of memory and crashing, resulting in a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Error Handling](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_error_handling.md)

This path exploits weaknesses in how the application handles errors related to image loading.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Trigger Exceptions Leading to Denial of Service](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__trigger_exceptions_leading_to_denial_of_service.md)

The attacker intentionally causes errors that the application doesn't handle properly.
    * Provide Invalid Image URLs or Data: Supplying malformed or incorrect data to Picasso's image loading functions.
        * Cause Picasso to Throw Unhandled Exceptions: Picasso throws an error due to the invalid input.
            * Crash Application: If the application doesn't catch and handle the exception, it will crash, leading to a denial of service.
