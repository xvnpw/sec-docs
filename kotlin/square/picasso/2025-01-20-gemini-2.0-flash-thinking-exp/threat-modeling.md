# Threat Model Analysis for square/picasso

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack on HTTP Image Loading](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_http_image_loading.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the image server when Picasso is used to load images over an unencrypted HTTP connection. The attacker can then replace the legitimate image data with malicious content before it reaches the application.

**Impact:** The application displays a manipulated or malicious image, potentially leading to:
*   Displaying misleading information to the user.
*   Social engineering attacks by displaying fake login screens or other deceptive content.
*   Displaying offensive or inappropriate content.

**Affected Picasso Component:** `Downloader` (when configured to use `OkHttpDownloader` with HTTP URLs).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Enforce HTTPS:** Ensure all image URLs loaded through Picasso use the HTTPS protocol. This encrypts the network traffic, preventing attackers from easily intercepting and modifying the data.
*   **Implement Certificate Pinning (Advanced):** For highly sensitive applications, consider implementing certificate pinning to further ensure the application connects only to trusted servers.

## Threat: [Disk Cache Poisoning](./threats/disk_cache_poisoning.md)

**Description:** An attacker with local access to the device's file system (e.g., through malware or physical access) modifies the cached image files stored by Picasso. When the application later loads the image from the cache, it displays the tampered version.

**Impact:** The application displays a manipulated or malicious image, even when the network connection is secure, leading to similar impacts as the MitM attack. This attack can persist even when the device is offline.

**Affected Picasso Component:** Disk cache implementation (`DiskLruCache`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure File System Permissions:** Implement proper file system permissions for the application's cache directory to restrict access from other applications or unauthorized users.
*   **Cache Encryption (Advanced):** Consider encrypting the disk cache to protect the integrity of the cached images. This adds complexity but provides a stronger defense against local tampering.
*   **Regular Integrity Checks (Advanced):** Implement mechanisms to periodically verify the integrity of cached images, although this can be resource-intensive.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Picasso Library](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_picasso_library.md)

**Description:** Like any software library, Picasso might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application's security or functionality.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability. It could range from minor issues to remote code execution or data breaches in the worst case.

**Affected Picasso Component:** Any component of the Picasso library could be affected depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Can range from Critical to High depending on the vulnerability.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Keep Picasso Updated:** Regularly update the Picasso library to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
*   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about any reported security vulnerabilities in Picasso and its dependencies.
