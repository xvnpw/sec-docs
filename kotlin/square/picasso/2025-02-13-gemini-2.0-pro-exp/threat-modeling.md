# Threat Model Analysis for square/picasso

## Threat: [Malicious Image URL (Spoofing)](./threats/malicious_image_url__spoofing_.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Image URL (Spoofing)

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a crafted URL to the application, which is then passed *directly* to Picasso. This URL might point to a malicious image designed to exploit vulnerabilities in image parsing libraries. The attacker aims to execute code or cause a crash via Picasso's image processing.
    *   **Impact:** Potential arbitrary code execution (if a vulnerability in the image decoding process, triggered *through Picasso*, is exploited), application crash.
    *   **Affected Picasso Component:** `Picasso.load(String url)`, `RequestCreator.into(ImageView target)`, and any methods that accept a URL as input.  The core image loading and *decoding* pipeline is affected.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if code execution is possible) or High (if it leads to crashes).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Backend Validation:** *Strictly* validate and sanitize all image URLs on the *backend* before passing them to Picasso.  This is the primary defense.
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Never directly use user-provided input as the image URL without thorough validation *before* reaching Picasso.

## Threat: [Cache Poisoning (Tampering)](./threats/cache_poisoning__tampering_.md)

*   **Threat:** Cache Poisoning (Tampering)

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to Picasso's *cache directory* and replaces a legitimate cached image with a malicious one. Subsequent loads *by Picasso* will display the attacker's modified image.
    *   **Impact:** Display of incorrect or malicious images, potentially leading to user deception. This directly impacts Picasso's caching mechanism.
    *   **Affected Picasso Component:** Picasso's disk cache (`com.squareup.picasso.Cache` interface, typically `com.squareup.picasso.LruCache`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Cache Location:** Use the default Android cache directory, which is private to the application. This is crucial for preventing external access to Picasso's cache.
        *   **Permissions:** Ensure the cache directory has correct file permissions (private to the application). This directly protects Picasso's stored data.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion - Large Image (Denial of Service)](./threats/resource_exhaustion_-_large_image__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion - Large Image (Denial of Service)

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a URL to a very large image. *Picasso* attempts to load and decode this image, consuming excessive memory and potentially causing the application to crash. This is a direct attack on Picasso's resource handling.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash (OutOfMemoryError), application freeze, denial of service. This directly impacts Picasso's operation.
    *   **Affected Picasso Component:** Image decoding process (`BitmapFactory` *internally*, `RequestHandler`, `Downloader` â€“ all parts of Picasso's pipeline).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **`resize()`:** Use `Picasso.load(url).resize(maxWidth, maxHeight).centerCrop()` (or `.centerInside()`) to limit the dimensions *within Picasso*. This is a Picasso-specific mitigation.
        *   **Backend Size Limits:** Enforce image size limits on the backend *before* providing the URL to Picasso.
        *   **`RequestTransformer`:** Use a Picasso `RequestTransformer` to inspect and potentially reject requests *before* Picasso downloads the entire image. This is a Picasso-specific mitigation.

## Threat: [ContentProvider Leak (Spoofing/Information Disclosure)](./threats/contentprovider_leak__spoofinginformation_disclosure_.md)

* **Threat:** ContentProvider Leak (Spoofing/Information Disclosure) - *If Picasso loads directly from an untrusted ContentProvider*
    *   **Description:** If Picasso is used to load images *directly* from a `ContentProvider`, and that `ContentProvider` is not properly secured or is malicious, an attacker might be able to access or inject malicious images. This is only HIGH/CRITICAL and directly involves Picasso if the app uses `Picasso.load(Uri)` with a `Uri` pointing to an untrusted or vulnerable `ContentProvider`.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to images, potential data leakage, or display of malicious images *through Picasso*.
    *   **Affected Picasso Component:** `Picasso.load(Uri uri)` when the `Uri` refers to a *vulnerable or untrusted* `ContentProvider`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **ContentProvider Security:** Ensure that any `ContentProvider` used to serve images *to Picasso* is properly secured with appropriate permissions and access controls.  *Avoid using untrusted ContentProviders with Picasso*.
        *   **Validate ContentProvider Data:** If you *must* use a `ContentProvider` with Picasso, validate the data returned by the `ContentProvider` *before* passing it to Picasso's display mechanisms. This is a crucial extra layer of defense.
