# Attack Surface Analysis for square/picasso

## Attack Surface: [1. Untrusted Image Sources (RCE/SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/1__untrusted_image_sources__rcessrf_.md)

*   **Description:** Loading images from URLs provided by untrusted sources, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
*   **How Picasso Contributes:** Picasso's primary function is to fetch and display images from URLs.  If the URL is maliciously crafted, Picasso becomes the direct mechanism for the attack.
*   **Example:**
    *   An attacker provides a URL to a crafted image designed to exploit a vulnerability in the system's image decoder (low probability, but high impact): `https://evil.com/malicious.jpg`
    *   An attacker uses a URL parameter to trigger SSRF, causing the *server* to make requests to internal resources: `https://example.com/image?url=http://localhost:8080/admin`
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) - *Low probability, but extremely high impact.*
    *   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict URL Validation:** Implement *extremely* rigorous validation of all image URLs.  Use a whitelist of allowed domains/hosts *exclusively* if possible.  Reject any URL that doesn't match the expected format or comes from an untrusted source.  Use URL parsing libraries to decompose the URL and validate each component (scheme, host, path, query parameters).  *Never* trust user-supplied input directly.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize any user-provided data used to construct image URLs, even if it's just a small part of the URL.  Escape or remove any potentially dangerous characters.
    *   **Use HTTPS:** Enforce HTTPS for *all* image URLs to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Image Loading Proxy:** Use a trusted proxy server to fetch and validate images *before* serving them to the application. The proxy can perform additional checks, such as image size limits, content type verification, and even malware scanning.  This is a strong defense-in-depth measure.

## Attack Surface: [2. Large Image Downloads (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/2__large_image_downloads__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a URL to an extremely large image, causing excessive resource consumption and a Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **How Picasso Contributes:** Picasso downloads the image data.  If the image is excessively large (either in file size or dimensions), it can consume significant memory, bandwidth, and processing power on the device.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides a URL to a "pixel bomb" image (e.g., a 1x1 pixel image with metadata claiming it's 10000x10000 pixels) or a very high-resolution image.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (application crash, unresponsiveness, excessive battery drain).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Set `resize()` and `centerCrop()`/`centerInside()`:** *Always* use Picasso's `resize()` method to limit the maximum dimensions of the loaded image.  Combine this with `centerCrop()` or `centerInside()` to handle images with different aspect ratios gracefully.  This is a *critical* mitigation.  Do *not* rely solely on the server to provide appropriately sized images.
    *   **Set Maximum Image Size (Bytes) - Custom `Downloader`:** Implement a custom `Downloader` or `RequestHandler` that checks the `Content-Length` header (if available) *before* downloading the image.  Refuse to download images exceeding a predefined, reasonable size limit.  This adds an extra layer of protection beyond just dimension limits.
    * **Use `.fetch()` for pre-validation:** Before loading image into `ImageView`, use `.fetch()` method to check if image can be loaded. This allows to check for errors before actual image loading.

## Attack Surface: [3. Custom Component Vulnerabilities (Directly Related to Picasso's API)](./attack_surfaces/3__custom_component_vulnerabilities__directly_related_to_picasso's_api_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities introduced by poorly implemented custom `Downloader` or `RequestHandler` components that interact directly with Picasso's image loading process.  This excludes general security flaws in custom components *not* directly related to how Picasso fetches or processes image data.
*   **How Picasso Contributes:** Picasso's extensibility allows developers to create custom components that handle the core image loading and request processing.  Flaws in *these specific components* directly impact Picasso's security.
*   **Example:**
    *   A custom `Downloader` that doesn't use HTTPS or improperly validates SSL certificates, making the image download vulnerable to MITM attacks.
    *   A custom `RequestHandler` that allows arbitrary file access based on user input, allowing an attacker to bypass URL validation and load images from unintended locations.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could include RCE (if the custom component has severe flaws), information disclosure, or DoS.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Code Review:**  Carefully review the code of any custom `Downloader` or `RequestHandler` for security vulnerabilities, *specifically* focusing on how they interact with network requests and file system access (if applicable).
    *   **Security Testing:**  Perform security testing (e.g., penetration testing, fuzzing) on these custom components to identify and address vulnerabilities related to image fetching and processing.
    *   **Follow Secure Coding Practices:**  Adhere to secure coding principles when developing these components.  Avoid common vulnerabilities like insecure network communication, improper handling of redirects, and path traversal.
    *   **Minimize Custom Components:**  If possible, avoid creating custom `Downloader` or `RequestHandler` components unless absolutely necessary.  Use Picasso's built-in functionality whenever feasible.  If customization is required, keep it as minimal and focused as possible.
