## Attack Tree Path: [1. Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE)](./attack_tree_paths/1__arbitrary_code_execution__ace_.md)

*   **1.1 Exploit Downloader Vulnerability**
    *   **Description:**  Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in custom `Downloader` implementations to achieve RCE.
    *   **1.1.1 RCE via Custom Downloader [CN] [HR]**
        *   **Description:** A custom `Downloader` contains flaws (e.g., unvalidated input, command injection, deserialization issues) allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    *   **1.1.2 Bypass URL Validation [CN]**
        *   **Description:** Weak or bypassed URL validation allows attackers to load images from arbitrary locations, potentially leading to SSRF or other attacks.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **1.2 Exploit Transformer Vulnerability**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in custom `Transformation` implementations to achieve RCE.
    *   **1.2.1 RCE via Custom Transformer [CN] [HR]**
        *   **Description:** A custom `Transformation` contains flaws (e.g., unvalidated input, command injection, deserialization issues, or vulnerabilities in native libraries) allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Data Leakage](./attack_tree_paths/2__data_leakage.md)

*   **2.1 Leak Cached Images**
    *   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to cached image files.
    *   **2.1.1 No Authorization on Cached Files [CN]**
        *   **Description:**  The application lacks proper authorization checks for accessing the cache directory, allowing direct access to cached images.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
    * **2.1.2 Path Traversal [CN]**
        * **Description:** A vulnerability in how Picasso handles file paths for cached images could allow an attacker to use ".." sequences to access files outside the intended cache directory.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
