# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for square/picasso

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Image Dimensions with `resize()` and `onlyScaleDown()`](./mitigation_strategies/limit_image_dimensions_with__resize____and__onlyscaledown___.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Determine Maximum Dimensions:**  Based on your UI and performance needs, determine the maximum width and height for images.
    2.  **Use `resize(width, height)`:**  *Always* use Picasso's `resize()` method when loading images.  Provide the maximum dimensions. This forces Picasso to scale down images.
    3.  **Use `onlyScaleDown()`:**  Use `onlyScaleDown()` with `resize()`. This prevents Picasso from *upscaling* smaller images, saving resources.
    4.  **Avoid Sole `fit()` Reliance:**  `fit()` is convenient but doesn't set hard limits. Use `resize()` for explicit control, then optionally `fit()` to fit the target view.
    5.  **Choose `centerCrop()` or `centerInside()`:** Select the appropriate scaling option based on how you want the image displayed.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High):** Prevents loading huge images that consume excessive memory (OutOfMemoryError crashes) or CPU time (slowing the app).
    *   **Performance Degradation (Medium):** Improves responsiveness by preventing the loading and processing of unnecessarily large images.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Significantly reduces memory-based DoS attack risk.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Improves performance and reduces resource use.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [Example: Partially - `resize()` is used in some places, but not consistently. `onlyScaleDown()` is not used.]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [Example: Apply `resize()` and `onlyScaleDown()` to *all* image loading calls. Review and adjust maximum dimensions based on testing.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Caching with `noCache()` and `noStore()`](./mitigation_strategies/disable_caching_with__nocache____and__nostore___.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Assess Caching Needs:** Determine if caching is *essential*. For sensitive images, disable it.
    2.  **Disable Caching:** Use `noCache()` and `noStore()`: `Picasso.get().load(url).noCache().noStore().into(imageView);`
        *   `noCache()`:  Bypasses the memory cache.
        *   `noStore()`: Prevents storing the image in the disk cache.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Leakage (Medium to High):** Prevents sensitive images from being stored in the cache, accessible to other apps or attackers with device access.
    *   **Data Tampering (Low):** Reduces the risk of cached images being modified.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Leakage:** Significantly reduces risk if caching is disabled.
    *   **Data Tampering:** Minor risk reduction.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [Example: Partially - Default caching is used. No explicit `noCache()` or `noStore()` calls.]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [Example: Evaluate caching needs for each image. Use `noCache()` and `noStore()` where appropriate.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use a Custom `RequestHandler`](./mitigation_strategies/use_a_custom__requesthandler_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create a `RequestHandler`:** Extend `com.squareup.picasso.RequestHandler`.
    2.  **Override `canHandleRequest()`:** Implement `canHandleRequest(Request data)`. This is called *before* loading. Perform security checks here:
        *   **URL Validation (within Picasso's context):** Although ideally done before calling Picasso, you can *re-validate* the URL here for defense-in-depth. Return `true` only if valid, `false` otherwise.  This is crucial if you cannot fully control the inputs to Picasso.
        *   **Header Inspection (Optional):** Inspect headers and reject based on values.
        *   **Other Checks (Optional):** Implement any other custom security checks.
    3.  **Override `load()` (Optional):** Override `load(Request request, int networkPolicy)` for actions *before* or *after* loading:
        *   **Modify Headers:** Add custom headers.
        *   **Post-Processing:** Security checks on loaded data (complex, e.g., format checks).
        *   **Custom Error Handling:** Handle errors specifically.
    4.  **Register the `RequestHandler`:** Use `Picasso.Builder`: `.addRequestHandler(new YourCustomRequestHandler())`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Untrusted Image Sources (RCE, XSS, SSRF, Information Disclosure, Phishing) (Critical to Medium):** Centralized, robust mechanism for enforcing security policies on *all* image requests handled by this Picasso instance.  Crucially, this allows you to intercept requests *even if* the calling code doesn't perform proper validation.
    *   **Flexibility for Future Threats:** Easily add new checks without modifying multiple code areas.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Untrusted Source Threats:** Significantly reduces risk; strong defense layer.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [Example: No - No custom `RequestHandler` is used.]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [Example: Create a `RequestHandler` implementing URL validation (as a fallback) and other needed checks.]
