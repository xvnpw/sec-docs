# Threat Model Analysis for square/picasso

## Threat: [Insecure Image Loading from Untrusted Sources](./threats/insecure_image_loading_from_untrusted_sources.md)

* **Description:**
    * An attacker provides a malicious URL that the application uses with `Picasso.load()`.
    * This URL can point to:
        * **Malicious Image:** Crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in image processing libraries, potentially leading to remote code execution.
        * **Phishing Image:** Designed to deceive users into clicking malicious links or revealing sensitive information.
        * **Denial of Service Image:** An extremely large image that consumes excessive resources, causing application slowdown or crashes.
    * Picasso attempts to download and process the image from this attacker-controlled URL.
* **Impact:**
    * **Critical:** Remote code execution on the user's device if an image processing vulnerability is exploited.
    * **High:** Application crash or instability due to image processing errors or resource exhaustion.
    * **High:** User exposure to phishing or social engineering attacks, potentially leading to data theft or account compromise.
* **Picasso Component Affected:**
    * `Picasso.load()` function, `RequestCreator`, Network downloader, Image decoding pipeline.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical to High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strict URL Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust checks to validate and sanitize image URLs before passing them to `Picasso.load()`. Use allowlists of trusted domains or URL patterns.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** If using Picasso in a WebView context, implement a strong CSP to restrict allowed image sources.
    * **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate any user-provided input that influences image URLs to prevent injection of malicious URLs.
    * **Regular Picasso Updates:** Keep Picasso updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Image Downloads](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_image_downloads.md)

* **Description:**
    * If the application loads images over insecure HTTP connections using Picasso, an attacker on the network can intercept the traffic.
    * The attacker can:
        * **Replace Images:** Substitute legitimate images with malicious images containing malware, phishing content, or misleading information.
        * **Inject Malicious Content:**  While less common with image formats, theoretically, an attacker might attempt to inject malicious code into the image data stream.
* **Impact:**
    * **High:** Display of malicious or inappropriate content to users, potentially leading to user device compromise or phishing attacks.
    * **High:** User deception and manipulation through the display of altered or misleading images.
* **Picasso Component Affected:**
    * Network downloader (when used with HTTP URLs).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Enforce HTTPS:** **Always** use HTTPS for image URLs loaded by Picasso. Configure your application and server infrastructure to serve images exclusively over HTTPS.
    * **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security):** Implement HSTS on your image servers to ensure clients always connect over HTTPS.
    * **Certificate Pinning (Advanced):** For highly sensitive applications, consider certificate pinning to further protect against MitM attacks by validating the server's SSL/TLS certificate against a known, trusted certificate.

## Threat: [Image Processing Vulnerabilities (Indirectly through Picasso's Dependencies)](./threats/image_processing_vulnerabilities__indirectly_through_picasso's_dependencies_.md)

* **Description:**
    * Picasso relies on underlying image decoding and processing libraries provided by the Android platform or potentially other libraries.
    * These libraries might contain vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, or other memory corruption issues when processing malformed or specially crafted images.
    * When Picasso loads and processes an attacker-crafted image, it could trigger these vulnerabilities in the underlying libraries.
* **Impact:**
    * **Critical:** Potential for remote code execution on the user's device if a vulnerability in an image processing library is exploited.
    * **High:** Application crash or instability due to image processing errors.
    * **High:** Denial of service if image processing consumes excessive resources or leads to crashes.
* **Picasso Component Affected:**
    * Image decoding pipeline (indirectly affected through underlying libraries used by Picasso).
* **Risk Severity:** Critical to High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Keep Android System Updated:** Ensure the underlying Android system and its image processing libraries are regularly updated with security patches provided by Google.
    * **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories related to image processing libraries used by Android and indirectly by Picasso.
    * **Consider Image Format Restrictions (If Applicable and Practical):** If feasible, limit the supported image formats to reduce the attack surface, although this might not be practical for many applications.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service_through_resource_exhaustion.md)

* **Description:**
    * An attacker can attempt to overload the application by forcing it to load a large number of images or extremely large images using Picasso.
    * This can be achieved by providing numerous image URLs or URLs pointing to very large files.
    * Picasso, in attempting to fulfill these requests, can exhaust device resources such as memory, bandwidth, and CPU.
* **Impact:**
    * **High:** Application slowdown or unresponsiveness, leading to a degraded user experience.
    * **High:** Application crashes due to out-of-memory errors or excessive resource consumption.
    * **High:** Device battery drain due to prolonged resource utilization.
* **Picasso Component Affected:**
    * `Picasso.load()` function, Network downloader, Memory cache, Disk cache, Image resizing and transformation pipeline.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Image Size Limits:** Implement limits on the maximum size (both dimensions and file size) of images that can be loaded by Picasso.
    * **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on image loading requests, especially from untrusted or external sources, to prevent abuse.
    * **Efficient Image Handling:** Utilize Picasso's features for resizing and transformations to ensure only necessary image resolutions are loaded and processed.
    * **Lazy Loading:** Implement lazy loading of images, particularly in lists or grids, to load images only when they are about to become visible, reducing initial resource consumption.
