# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Picasso, is an open-source Android library for image loading and caching.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide an efficient and easy-to-use image loading and caching solution for Android developers.
  - Improve the performance and user experience of Android applications by optimizing image handling.
  - Offer a robust and reliable library that simplifies complex image loading tasks.
  - Maintain an active and supportive open-source community around the library.

- Business Risks:
  - Vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited by malicious actors, potentially affecting applications using Picasso.
  - Performance issues or bugs in the library could negatively impact the user experience of applications.
  - Lack of maintenance or community support could lead to the library becoming outdated or insecure over time.
  - Security breaches related to image handling, such as denial-of-service attacks through malformed images or information disclosure through insecure caching.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Reliance on standard Android platform security features. Implemented by: Android OS and device manufacturers.
  - security control: Use of standard Java/Kotlin security practices in the codebase. Implemented by: Picasso developers.
  - security control: Code reviews and community contributions to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. Implemented by: Picasso maintainers and community.
  - accepted risk: Dependencies on third-party libraries may introduce vulnerabilities. Accepted risk: inherent in using open-source ecosystems.
  - accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to be discovered in the library code. Accepted risk: inherent in software development.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
  - security control: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) tools into the build process to detect potential code-level vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Conduct regular security code reviews, focusing on areas related to image handling, caching, and network communication.
  - security control: Implement input validation for image URLs and data received from network requests to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Consider implementing secure caching mechanisms to protect cached images from unauthorized access, if sensitive data is handled (though unlikely for a general image loading library).

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable as Picasso is a client-side library and does not handle user authentication itself. Applications using Picasso will handle authentication as needed.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable within the library itself. Authorization is handled by the application and backend services providing images. Picasso needs to respect the authorization context provided by the application when fetching images.
  - Input Validation:
    - All image URLs provided to Picasso should be validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., path traversal, server-side request forgery).
    - Data received from network responses (image data, headers) should be validated to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
  - Cryptography:
    - Cryptography is not a primary requirement for the core functionality of Picasso.
    - If secure caching is implemented for sensitive images in the future, appropriate encryption mechanisms should be used.
    - HTTPS should be used for all network requests to ensure confidentiality and integrity of image data in transit. This is a responsibility of the application using Picasso, but Picasso should encourage and facilitate HTTPS usage.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Providing a reliable and performant image loading and caching library for Android developers.
  - Maintaining the reputation and trustworthiness of the Picasso library as an open-source project.
  - Ensuring the security and stability of applications that depend on Picasso.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Source code of the Picasso library: High sensitivity (confidentiality and integrity). Compromise could lead to vulnerabilities in the library and applications using it.
  - Build artifacts (JAR/AAR files): High sensitivity (integrity and availability). Tampered artifacts could introduce malicious code into applications.
  - Security reports and vulnerability information: Medium sensitivity (confidentiality). Disclosure could provide attackers with information to exploit vulnerabilities.
  - Cached images (on disk and in memory): Low to Medium sensitivity. Mostly public images, but could potentially include user-generated content in some application scenarios. Confidentiality and integrity are relevant.
