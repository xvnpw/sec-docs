## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malformed JSON Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malformed_json_handling.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Crafting malicious JSON payloads that exploit how Moshi handles unexpected or malformed data during deserialization.
* **Specific Threats:**
    * **Trigger Type Confusion via Lack of Type Safety in Custom Adapters:**
        * **Attacker Action:** Send JSON data with types that do not match the expected types in a custom Moshi adapter.
        * **Vulnerability:** The custom adapter lacks proper type checking or validation.
        * **Consequence:**  The application logic receives data of an unexpected type, leading to errors, unexpected behavior, or security vulnerabilities. For example, a string might be interpreted as an integer, bypassing security checks or causing crashes.
    * **Inject Malicious Data Exploiting Custom Deserializers:**
        * **Attacker Action:** Send JSON data containing malicious content that is processed by a custom deserializer.
        * **Vulnerability:** The custom deserializer does not sanitize or validate the input data before using it in application logic.
        * **Consequence:**  The malicious data is incorporated into the application's state or operations, potentially leading to code injection, data manipulation, or unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Moshi Library Itself](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_moshi_library_itself.md)

**Attack Vector:** Leveraging known security vulnerabilities within the Moshi library code.
* **Specific Threats:**
    * **Leverage Known Moshi Vulnerabilities by Exploiting Publicly Disclosed CVEs:**
        * **Attacker Action:** Identify a publicly disclosed Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) for the specific version of Moshi used by the application.
        * **Vulnerability:** A flaw exists in the Moshi library code that can be exploited under certain conditions.
        * **Consequence:** Depending on the specific CVE, this could lead to remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, or other forms of compromise. Exploits for known CVEs are often readily available.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Improper Moshi Configuration or Usage](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_improper_moshi_configuration_or_usage.md)

**Attack Vector:** Taking advantage of insecure configurations or incorrect usage patterns of Moshi within the application.
* **Specific Threats:**
    * **Misconfigure Adapters by Using Unsafe or Incorrectly Implemented Custom Adapters:**
        * **Attacker Action:**  Exploit flaws in custom Moshi adapters due to insecure coding practices.
        * **Vulnerability:** Custom adapters might lack proper input validation, output encoding, or error handling. They might also mishandle data types or expose sensitive information.
        * **Consequence:** This can lead to vulnerabilities similar to those in malformed JSON handling, such as type confusion or malicious data injection, but stemming from the adapter's logic itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Moshi](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_moshi.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the libraries that Moshi depends on (transitive dependencies).
* **Specific Threats:**
    * **Leverage Vulnerabilities in Transitive Dependencies by Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Libraries Used by Moshi:**
        * **Attacker Action:** Identify known CVEs in the libraries that Moshi uses internally.
        * **Vulnerability:** A security flaw exists in one of Moshi's dependencies.
        * **Consequence:** Exploiting these vulnerabilities can have similar consequences to exploiting vulnerabilities in Moshi itself, potentially leading to remote code execution, denial of service, or data breaches. The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency.
