**Subject:** In-depth Analysis of Polymorphic Deserialization Attack Surface in Moshi

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the polymorphic deserialization attack surface present in applications utilizing the Moshi library for JSON processing. We will delve into the mechanisms, potential threats, and detailed mitigation strategies to ensure the security of our application.

**Understanding the Core Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Instantiation**

The fundamental risk associated with polymorphic deserialization lies in the ability of an attacker to influence the type of object instantiated during the deserialization process. Moshi's flexibility in handling different concrete types based on a type identifier within the JSON payload, while a powerful feature, introduces this potential vulnerability.

**Moshi's Role in Enabling Polymorphic Deserialization:**

Moshi provides several mechanisms to implement polymorphic deserialization:

* **`@JsonClass(generateAdapter = true, generator = "sealed:<type_label>")` (Sealed Classes/Interfaces):** This approach leverages Kotlin's sealed classes or interfaces. Moshi generates an adapter that reads a specific property (the `type_label`) from the JSON and uses it to determine which concrete subclass or implementation to instantiate.
* **Custom Type Adapters with Type Information:** Developers can create custom `JsonAdapter` implementations that manually read type information from the JSON and use it to select the appropriate class for deserialization.
* **`@JsonClass(polymorphicLabel = "<type_label>")` (Discriminated Unions):**  Similar to sealed classes, this annotation allows specifying a property (`type_label`) that dictates the concrete type.

**How the Attack Works: Exploiting Trust in Type Identifiers**

The vulnerability arises when the application trusts the type identifier provided in the incoming JSON without proper validation and sanitization. Here's a breakdown of the attack flow:

1. **Attacker Analysis:** The attacker analyzes the application's API and identifies endpoints or data processing pipelines that utilize Moshi for deserialization with polymorphic type handling. They identify the expected structure of the JSON and the property used as the type identifier.
2. **Crafting a Malicious Payload:** The attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload. This payload contains a type identifier that corresponds to a class within the application's classpath. This class could be:
    * **A benign class with unintended side effects in its constructor or methods:**  For example, a class that logs information to a sensitive location, triggers an external API call, or performs resource-intensive operations.
    * **A known vulnerable class (gadget) present in the application's dependencies:**  This is a more advanced attack scenario leveraging existing vulnerabilities in libraries used by the application. Libraries like Apache Commons Collections or Spring Framework have historically been targets for deserialization attacks.
    * **A custom class specifically crafted by the attacker and somehow introduced into the application's classpath (less common but possible in certain scenarios).**
3. **Sending the Malicious Payload:** The attacker sends the crafted JSON payload to the vulnerable endpoint or through the vulnerable data processing pipeline.
4. **Moshi Deserialization:** Moshi reads the JSON and, based on the attacker-controlled type identifier, instantiates the attacker-specified class.
5. **Exploitation:** The constructor or subsequent methods of the instantiated class are executed. This can lead to:
    * **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE):** If a vulnerable gadget class is instantiated, the attacker can leverage its properties to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Instantiating resource-intensive classes can overwhelm the server.
    * **Information Disclosure:**  If the instantiated class logs sensitive information or interacts with internal systems in an unintended way.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** In certain scenarios, instantiating a class with higher privileges could lead to privilege escalation.

**Deep Dive into the Example Scenario:**

Let's expand on the provided example:

* **Scenario:** An application uses Moshi to deserialize events. The JSON includes a `eventType` field to determine the specific event class to instantiate.
* **Vulnerable Code (Conceptual):**

```kotlin
interface Event {
    val type: String
}

data class LoginEvent(override val type: String = "login", val user: String) : Event
data class LogoutEvent(override val type: String = "logout", val user: String) : Event
data class MaliciousEvent(override val type: String = "malicious") : Event {
    init {
        // Simulate malicious activity
        Runtime.getRuntime().exec("rm -rf /tmp/*") // DANGEROUS - Example only!
    }
}

val moshi = Moshi.Builder().add(KotlinJsonAdapterFactory()).build()
val adapter: JsonAdapter<Event> = moshi.adapter(Event::class.java)

// Vulnerable deserialization
val json = """{"eventType": "malicious"}"""
val event = adapter.fromJson(json) // Instantiates MaliciousEvent based on "malicious"
```

* **Attack:** An attacker sends a JSON payload like `{"eventType": "malicious"}`.
* **Impact:** Moshi instantiates `MaliciousEvent`, and its constructor executes the dangerous command (in this example, a highly destructive command - for illustrative purposes only).

**Detailed Threat Modeling:**

| Threat Actor | Goal                                       | Attack Vector                                                                   | Assets at Risk                                    | Potential Impact                                                                 |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| External Attacker | Arbitrary Code Execution, DoS, Data Breach | Manipulating the type identifier in JSON payloads sent to vulnerable endpoints. | Server infrastructure, application data, user data | Complete system compromise, service disruption, unauthorized access to sensitive data |
| Internal Malicious User | Privilege Escalation, Data Exfiltration | Exploiting polymorphic deserialization within internal systems or APIs.        | Internal systems, sensitive data                   | Unauthorized access to internal resources, data breaches                          |

**Expanding on Mitigation Strategies:**

The provided mitigation strategies are crucial. Let's elaborate on them:

* **Whitelist Approach for Allowed Polymorphic Types:**
    * **Implementation:** Explicitly define a closed set of allowed concrete types that can be instantiated during deserialization. This can be achieved through:
        * **Sealed Classes/Interfaces:**  The most robust approach. By defining a sealed hierarchy, Moshi inherently limits instantiation to the defined subclasses.
        * **Custom Type Adapters with Explicit Mapping:**  Create a `JsonAdapter` that uses a map or switch statement to map the type identifier to specific allowed classes. Any unknown identifier should result in an error.
        * **Registration with Moshi Builder:** If using custom adapters, ensure you only register adapters for the explicitly allowed types.
    * **Benefits:**  Significantly reduces the attack surface by preventing the instantiation of arbitrary classes.
    * **Example (Sealed Class):**

    ```kotlin
    sealed class SafeEvent {
        data class LoginEvent(val user: String) : SafeEvent()
        data class LogoutEvent(val user: String) : SafeEvent()
    }

    val moshi = Moshi.Builder().add(KotlinJsonAdapterFactory()).build()
    val adapter: JsonAdapter<SafeEvent> = moshi.adapter(SafeEvent::class.java)

    // Attempting to deserialize with an unknown type will fail
    val json = """{"type": "malicious"}""" // Assuming "type" is the label
    // adapter.fromJson(json) // This will throw a JsonDataException
    ```

* **Avoid Default Implementations for Polymorphic Type Resolution:**
    * **Problem:** Relying solely on untrusted input for type resolution without explicit checks opens the door to manipulation.
    * **Solution:**  Avoid relying on default mechanisms that directly map the JSON type identifier to class names without validation. Implement explicit mapping logic.
    * **Best Practices:**  Always validate the type identifier against the whitelist before attempting instantiation.

* **Carefully Review Constructors and Methods of Deserializable Classes:**
    * **Focus:**  Identify and eliminate any potentially dangerous operations within the constructors or methods of classes that can be instantiated through polymorphic deserialization.
    * **Considerations:**
        * **External API Calls:** Avoid making external calls in constructors unless absolutely necessary and carefully consider the implications.
        * **File System Operations:**  Restrict file system access within these classes.
        * **Resource Allocation:**  Be mindful of resource allocation to prevent DoS vulnerabilities.
        * **Logging:**  Ensure sensitive information is not logged inadvertently.
    * **Secure Coding Practices:** Apply the principle of least privilege and avoid performing actions that could be exploited.

**Additional Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Validate Type Identifiers:**  Before attempting deserialization, explicitly validate the received type identifier against the allowed whitelist.
    * **Sanitize Other Input:**  Treat all data received from untrusted sources with suspicion and sanitize other fields in the JSON payload to prevent other types of injection attacks.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * **Run Application with Minimal Permissions:** Ensure the application runs with the least necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful attack.

* **Dependency Management and Security Audits:**
    * **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update Moshi and all other dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
    * **Perform Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities, including deserialization issues.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP) and Other Security Headers:**
    * While not directly related to deserialization, implementing security headers can help mitigate other attack vectors that might be combined with deserialization exploits.

* **Monitoring and Logging:**
    * **Log Deserialization Attempts:** Log successful and failed deserialization attempts, including the type identifier used. This can help detect suspicious activity.
    * **Monitor System Resources:** Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage for anomalies that might indicate a DoS attack via deserialization.

**Developer Guidelines and Best Practices:**

* **Favor Sealed Classes/Interfaces:**  Whenever possible, leverage Kotlin's sealed classes or interfaces for polymorphic deserialization. This provides the strongest type safety and limits the attack surface.
* **Avoid Reflection-Based Solutions:** Be cautious when using reflection or other dynamic mechanisms for type resolution, as they can be more difficult to secure.
* **Treat All External Data as Untrusted:**  Never assume that incoming data is safe. Always validate and sanitize input.
* **Follow Secure Coding Practices:**  Apply secure coding principles when designing and implementing classes that might be deserialized.
* **Regularly Review Deserialization Logic:**  Periodically review the code responsible for polymorphic deserialization to ensure it adheres to security best practices.
* **Educate Developers:**  Ensure the development team is aware of the risks associated with deserialization vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them.

**Conclusion:**

Polymorphic deserialization vulnerabilities represent a significant risk in applications using Moshi. By understanding the underlying mechanisms, potential attack vectors, and implementing robust mitigation strategies, we can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of such attacks. The key is to move away from trusting untrusted input and embrace a whitelist approach for allowed types. Continuous vigilance, regular security reviews, and adherence to secure coding practices are essential to maintaining the security of our application.

This analysis provides a solid foundation for addressing this attack surface. Let's discuss these points further and collaborate on implementing the necessary mitigations within our application.
