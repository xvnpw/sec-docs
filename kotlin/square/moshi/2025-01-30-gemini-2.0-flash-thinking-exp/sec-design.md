# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project provides a modern JSON library for Android and Java. It aims to make it easy to parse JSON into Java classes and generate JSON from Java classes. The primary business goal is to provide a reliable, efficient, and user-friendly library for JSON processing in Java and Android environments, catering to developers building applications that require JSON serialization and deserialization.

The most important business risks associated with this project are:

- Risk of vulnerabilities in the library that could be exploited by malicious actors, leading to data breaches, application crashes, or other security incidents in applications that depend on Moshi.
- Risk of performance issues or bugs that could negatively impact the performance and stability of applications using Moshi.
- Risk of compatibility issues with different Java and Android versions or other libraries, leading to integration challenges for developers.
- Risk of lack of adoption or community support, which could lead to the library becoming outdated or unmaintained.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for this project:

- security control: Code is hosted on GitHub, providing transparency and enabling community review.
- security control: Open source licensing encourages community contributions and scrutiny.
- security control: Build process likely includes standard Java compilation and testing. (Assumption based on typical Java library projects)

Accepted risks for this project:

- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to be present in dependencies used by Moshi.
- accepted risk: Open source nature means vulnerability information is publicly available once disclosed.

Recommended security controls to implement:

- recommended security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the build pipeline to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities.
- recommended security control: Implement automated Dependency Scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Moshi.
- recommended security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process to handle security issues reported by the community or identified through internal testing.
- recommended security control: Conduct regular security code reviews, especially for critical components and new features.
- recommended security control: Consider fuzz testing to identify unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities in JSON parsing logic.

Security requirements for this project:

- Authentication: Not directly applicable as Moshi is a library and does not handle user authentication. Applications using Moshi will be responsible for their own authentication mechanisms.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable as Moshi is a library and does not handle user authorization. Applications using Moshi will be responsible for their own authorization mechanisms.
- Input Validation: Critical. Moshi must robustly validate and sanitize JSON input to prevent injection attacks (e.g., JSON injection) and denial-of-service attacks caused by malformed or excessively large JSON payloads. Input validation should be implemented during JSON parsing to ensure data conforms to expected formats and constraints.
- Cryptography: Not directly applicable to the core functionality of Moshi as a JSON processing library. However, if Moshi is used in contexts where sensitive data is handled, applications using Moshi will be responsible for implementing appropriate encryption and decryption mechanisms before or after JSON processing. Moshi should not introduce any cryptographic vulnerabilities or weaknesses.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:

- Secure and reliable JSON data processing within applications that depend on Moshi.  This includes ensuring data integrity, confidentiality (if applicable based on application context), and availability of applications using Moshi.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:

- Moshi itself does not directly handle or store sensitive data. However, it processes JSON data which can contain sensitive information depending on the application context. The sensitivity of data processed by Moshi is entirely dependent on the applications that use it.  For example, applications might use Moshi to process JSON data containing personal identifiable information (PII), financial data, or health records. In such cases, vulnerabilities in Moshi could indirectly lead to exposure or compromise of this sensitive data.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

- What are the specific use cases and environments where Moshi is primarily used? (e.g., mobile apps, backend services, specific industries). Understanding the typical use cases can help tailor security recommendations.
- What is the current vulnerability disclosure and response process for Moshi?
- Are there any existing security testing practices beyond basic unit tests?
- What are the dependencies of Moshi, and are they regularly monitored for vulnerabilities?
- What are the performance requirements and constraints for Moshi? (Performance considerations can sometimes influence security design choices).

Assumptions:

- Assumption: Moshi is intended to be used in a wide range of Java and Android applications with varying security requirements.
- Assumption: The development team follows general secure coding practices.
- Assumption: The build process includes basic compilation and testing, but security specific checks might need to be enhanced.
- Assumption: Moshi is distributed as a library dependency and not deployed as a standalone service.
- Assumption: Applications using Moshi are responsible for implementing their own application-level security controls (authentication, authorization, etc.).
