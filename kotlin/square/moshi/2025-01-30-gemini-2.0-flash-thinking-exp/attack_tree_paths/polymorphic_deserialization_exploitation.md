### 4. Deep Analysis of "Polymorphic Deserialization Exploitation" Attack Path

**4.1 Understanding Polymorphic Deserialization in Moshi**

Moshi's polymorphic deserialization is a powerful feature that allows you to deserialize JSON into different concrete types based on a type identifier present in the JSON data itself. This is particularly useful when dealing with inheritance hierarchies or interfaces where the actual type of an object is not known at compile time.

**Key Components:**

* **`@JsonClass(polymorphic = true, name = "typePropertyName")`:** This annotation, applied to an abstract class or interface, enables polymorphic deserialization. `name` specifies the JSON property name that will hold the type identifier.
* **`@JsonSubTypes.Type(value = ConcreteClass::class, name = "typeName")`:**  Used within `@JsonClass` to register concrete classes that can be deserialized. `name` maps a JSON type identifier to a specific `ConcreteClass`.
* **Custom Adapters:**  Moshi allows for custom adapters, which can be used to implement more complex polymorphic deserialization logic if needed.

**How it Works (Simplified):**

1. Moshi encounters a JSON object that needs to be deserialized into a polymorphic type (annotated with `@JsonClass(polymorphic = true)`).
2. It looks for the type identifier property (specified by `name` in `@JsonClass`).
3. Based on the value of the type identifier, Moshi uses the `@JsonSubTypes.Type` annotations to determine the concrete class to instantiate and deserialize the rest of the JSON object into.

**4.2 Vulnerability Description: Uncontrolled Type Instantiation**

The core vulnerability in this attack path lies in the potential for **uncontrolled type instantiation**. If an attacker can manipulate the JSON input to control the value of the type identifier property, they can potentially force Moshi to deserialize the JSON into a type that was not intended by the application developer.

**Why is this a vulnerability?**

* **Unexpected Behavior:** Deserializing into an unexpected type can lead to unexpected application behavior, logic errors, and potentially security vulnerabilities.
* **Bypass of Validation:**  If validation or security checks are designed to operate on specific types, forcing deserialization into a different type might bypass these checks.
* **Resource Exhaustion (Less Likely, but Possible):** In some scenarios, deserializing into a very complex or resource-intensive type could potentially lead to denial-of-service (DoS) conditions, although this is less common in typical Moshi usage compared to other deserialization vulnerabilities in languages like Java.
* **Data Corruption/Manipulation:**  If the attacker can control the properties being set during deserialization into an unintended type, they might be able to manipulate application data in unexpected ways.

**4.3 Attack Vectors**

Here are potential attack vectors for exploiting polymorphic deserialization in Moshi:

* **Manipulating the Type Identifier:** The most direct attack vector is to directly modify the value of the type identifier property in the JSON request. For example, if the expected type identifiers are "TypeA" and "TypeB", an attacker might try injecting a different, unexpected type identifier like "TypeC" or even a fully qualified class name (if Moshi's implementation allows it, though less likely in typical setups).

    **Example:**

    Assume the application expects JSON like this for polymorphic deserialization:

    ```json
    {
      "type": "TypeA",
      "data": {
        "property1": "value1"
      }
    }
    ```

    An attacker might try to send:

    ```json
    {
      "type": "MaliciousType",  // Injecting an unexpected type identifier
      "data": {
        "property1": "malicious_value"
      }
    }
    ```

    If the application doesn't properly validate the `type` field and Moshi attempts to deserialize based on "MaliciousType", it could lead to issues.

* **Exploiting Classpath Availability (Less Common in Moshi's typical use case):** In more complex scenarios, if the application's classpath contains classes that are not intended for deserialization but happen to be compatible with the JSON structure, an attacker might try to force deserialization into these classes. This is less likely in typical Android/Kotlin/Java Moshi usage compared to classic Java deserialization vulnerabilities, but it's still a theoretical possibility if the application's classpath is not carefully controlled.

* **Denial of Service through Complex Types (Less Likely):**  While less probable in Moshi compared to other deserialization vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially try to force deserialization into a type that is extremely complex or resource-intensive to instantiate, potentially leading to performance degradation or denial of service.

**4.4 Impact Assessment**

The impact of successful polymorphic deserialization exploitation can vary depending on the application's logic and the specific types involved. Potential impacts include:

* **Data Integrity Violation:**  Deserializing into an incorrect type could lead to data being interpreted or processed incorrectly, potentially corrupting application data.
* **Logic Errors and Application Instability:** Unexpected type instantiation can cause logic errors within the application, leading to crashes, unexpected behavior, or incorrect processing of data.
* **Security Bypass:**  If security checks or authorization mechanisms rely on the expected type of deserialized objects, an attacker might be able to bypass these checks by forcing deserialization into a different type.
* **Information Disclosure (Indirect):** In some scenarios, manipulating the deserialized type could indirectly lead to information disclosure if the application logic processes the data in an unintended way and exposes sensitive information as a result.
* **Denial of Service (Less Likely):** As mentioned, in rare cases, resource exhaustion during deserialization of complex types could contribute to DoS.

**4.5 Mitigation Strategies**

To mitigate the risk of polymorphic deserialization exploitation in Moshi, developers should implement the following strategies:

1. **Strict Type Validation and Whitelisting:**
    * **Explicitly Define Allowed Types:**  Clearly define and whitelist the allowed concrete types that can be deserialized polymorphically using `@JsonSubTypes.Type`. Avoid relying on implicit type discovery or allowing arbitrary types.
    * **Input Validation:**  Before deserialization, validate the type identifier property in the JSON input against the whitelist of allowed types. Reject requests with invalid or unexpected type identifiers.
    * **Consider Enums for Type Identifiers:**  Using enums for type identifiers can provide a more controlled and type-safe way to manage allowed types.

2. **Secure Adapter Design:**
    * **Minimize Side Effects in Deserialization:**  Ensure that the deserialization process for each concrete type is safe and does not have unintended side effects that could be exploited.
    * **Avoid Deserializing Sensitive Data into Unnecessary Types:**  Carefully consider which types are truly needed for polymorphic deserialization and avoid deserializing sensitive data into types that are not strictly required.

3. **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * **Limit Classpath Scope:**  Minimize the number of classes available on the application's classpath that are not explicitly intended for deserialization. This reduces the potential attack surface if an attacker tries to exploit classpath availability.

4. **Regular Security Audits and Testing:**
    * **Code Reviews:** Conduct regular code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities related to polymorphic deserialization and other security aspects.
    * **Penetration Testing:** Include tests specifically targeting polymorphic deserialization in penetration testing efforts to identify potential weaknesses in real-world scenarios.

5. **Stay Updated with Moshi Security Advisories:**
    * Monitor Moshi's release notes and security advisories for any reported vulnerabilities and apply necessary updates and patches promptly.

**4.6 Conclusion**

Polymorphic deserialization in Moshi, while a powerful and useful feature, introduces a potential attack surface if not implemented carefully. The "Polymorphic Deserialization Exploitation" attack path highlights the risk of uncontrolled type instantiation, where attackers can manipulate JSON input to force deserialization into unintended types.

By implementing robust mitigation strategies, particularly strict type validation and whitelisting, developers can significantly reduce the risk of this type of attack and ensure the secure use of Moshi's polymorphic deserialization capabilities.  It's crucial to treat user-controlled input, especially type identifiers in JSON, with caution and apply appropriate security measures to prevent exploitation.

This deep analysis provides a foundation for development teams to understand the risks associated with polymorphic deserialization in Moshi and take proactive steps to secure their applications.
