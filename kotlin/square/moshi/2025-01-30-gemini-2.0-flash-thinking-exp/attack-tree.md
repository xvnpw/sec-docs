## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in how Moshi deserializes JSON data, potentially leading to code execution, data manipulation, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Polymorphic Deserialization Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/polymorphic_deserialization_exploitation.md)

Moshi's ability to deserialize different types based on JSON type information can be abused.

## Attack Tree Path: [Type Confusion Attack](./attack_tree_paths/type_confusion_attack.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Type Information in JSON](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_type_information_in_json.md)

Attack Vector: An attacker crafts a JSON payload containing manipulated type information. This aims to trick Moshi into deserializing data into an unexpected type. If the application logic or the unexpected type has vulnerabilities, this can be exploited. For example, deserializing into a type with unintended side effects during construction or methods.
Risk: High Impact (potential code execution, data corruption), Medium Likelihood, Medium Effort, Medium Skill Level, Hard Detection Difficulty.

## Attack Tree Path: [Injection via Deserialized Data (Indirect Moshi Vulnerability)](./attack_tree_paths/injection_via_deserialized_data__indirect_moshi_vulnerability_.md)

This path highlights that even if Moshi itself is secure, the *data* it deserializes can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the application's logic. Moshi acts as a conduit for malicious data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Logic Vulnerabilities Post-Deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/application_logic_vulnerabilities_post-deserialization.md)

The application might improperly handle or trust the data deserialized by Moshi, leading to injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection using Deserialized String](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection_using_deserialized_string.md)

Attack Vector: An attacker injects malicious SQL code within a JSON string. If the application uses this deserialized string directly in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, the attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands.
Risk: Critical Impact (full database compromise, data breach), Medium Likelihood, Low Effort, Low Skill Level, Medium Detection Difficulty.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

This path focuses on attacks that aim to make the application unavailable by overwhelming its resources through malicious JSON payloads processed by Moshi.

## Attack Tree Path: [Large JSON Payload Attack](./attack_tree_paths/large_json_payload_attack.md)

Sending excessively large or complex JSON payloads to exhaust application resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [CPU Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/cpu_exhaustion.md)

Attack Vector: An attacker sends JSON payloads with deeply nested structures or a very large number of keys. Parsing these complex structures consumes significant CPU resources, potentially leading to application slowdown or crash.
Risk: Medium Impact (application unavailability), High Likelihood, Low Effort, Low Skill Level, Medium Detection Difficulty.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Implementation Flaws/Bugs in Moshi (General Software Vulnerabilities)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_implementation_flawsbugs_in_moshi__general_software_vulnerabilities_.md)

This path acknowledges the possibility of undiscovered vulnerabilities within the Moshi library itself, like any software.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unknown Vulnerabilities (Zero-Day)](./attack_tree_paths/unknown_vulnerabilities__zero-day_.md)

The risk of encountering and being exploited by vulnerabilities not yet publicly known in Moshi.

## Attack Tree Path: [Undiscovered Bugs in Moshi Library](./attack_tree_paths/undiscovered_bugs_in_moshi_library.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Memory Corruption, Logic Errors, etc.](./attack_tree_paths/memory_corruption__logic_errors__etc.md)

Attack Vector:  Exploiting undiscovered bugs within Moshi's code. These could range from memory corruption issues to logic errors that can be triggered by specific, crafted JSON inputs. Exploitation often requires deep understanding of Moshi's internals.
Risk: Critical Impact (potential code execution, system compromise), Low Likelihood (zero-day), High Effort, High Skill Level, Very Hard Detection Difficulty.
