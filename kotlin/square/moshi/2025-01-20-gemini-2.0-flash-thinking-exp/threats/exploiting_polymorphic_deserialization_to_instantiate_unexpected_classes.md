### 4. Deep Analysis of the Threat: Exploiting Polymorphic Deserialization to Instantiate Unexpected Classes

#### 4.1 Understanding the Vulnerability

The core of this vulnerability lies in the trust placed in the incoming JSON payload's type discriminator when using Moshi's polymorphic deserialization. When `@JsonClass(generateAdapter = true, polymorphic = true)` is used, Moshi needs a way to determine which concrete subclass to instantiate when deserializing a JSON object representing an abstract class or interface. This is typically achieved using `@JsonClassDiscriminator` to specify a key in the JSON and `@JsonClassLabel` to map specific values of that key to concrete classes.

The vulnerability arises when an attacker can manipulate the value of the discriminator field in the JSON payload to point to a class that was not intended to be instantiated in that context. If this unexpected class has side effects in its constructor or methods (especially lifecycle methods called during deserialization), it can lead to various security issues.

**How it Works:**

1. **Polymorphic Type Definition:** A base class or interface is annotated with `@JsonClass(generateAdapter = true, polymorphic = true)` and `@JsonClassDiscriminator("type")`.
2. **Subtype Registration:** Concrete subclasses are annotated with `@JsonClassLabel("specific_type_a")`, `@JsonClassLabel("specific_type_b")`, etc., mapping discriminator values to classes.
3. **Moshi Deserialization:** When Moshi encounters a JSON object, it looks at the value of the discriminator field (e.g., "type").
4. **Class Instantiation:** Based on the discriminator value, Moshi instantiates the corresponding registered subclass.
5. **Exploitation:** An attacker crafts a JSON payload where the discriminator value points to a malicious or unintended class. If this class has harmful logic in its constructor or methods, that logic will be executed during deserialization.

#### 4.2 Potential Attack Vectors

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability through various attack vectors, depending on how the application receives and processes JSON data:

* **API Endpoints:** If the application exposes API endpoints that accept JSON payloads, an attacker can send malicious JSON with crafted discriminator values.
* **Message Queues:** If the application consumes messages from a message queue in JSON format, a compromised or malicious producer can inject harmful messages.
* **Configuration Files:** While less direct, if the application reads configuration files in JSON format and uses polymorphic deserialization for certain configurations, a compromised configuration file could trigger the vulnerability.
* **Data Storage:** If the application retrieves data from a database or other storage in JSON format and uses polymorphic deserialization, a compromised data source could inject malicious data.

**Example Malicious Payload:**

Assuming a base class `Animal` with subclasses `Dog` and `Cat`, and a malicious class `Exploit`:

```json
{
  "type": "exploit",
  "data": "some arbitrary data"
}
```

If the `Exploit` class is somehow accessible to Moshi's classloader and has a constructor with harmful side effects, deserializing this payload could trigger those effects.

#### 4.3 Technical Deep Dive into Moshi's Mechanisms

Moshi's polymorphic deserialization relies on the following key components:

* **`@JsonClass(polymorphic = true)`:** This annotation on the base class or interface signals to Moshi that polymorphic deserialization is required. It triggers the generation of a specific adapter that handles subtype resolution.
* **`@JsonClassDiscriminator(String)`:** This annotation specifies the name of the JSON field that will be used as the type discriminator.
* **`@JsonClassLabel(String)`:** This annotation on each concrete subclass maps a specific discriminator value to that class.

**Deserialization Process:**

1. When Moshi encounters a JSON object that needs to be deserialized into a polymorphic type, the generated adapter for the base class is used.
2. This adapter reads the value of the discriminator field specified by `@JsonClassDiscriminator`.
3. It then uses this value to look up the corresponding concrete subclass based on the `@JsonClassLabel` annotations.
4. If a matching label is found, Moshi instantiates that subclass and proceeds with deserializing the remaining fields.
5. **Vulnerability Point:** If an attacker can provide a discriminator value that maps to an unintended class, that class will be instantiated.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Classloader Visibility:** The unexpected class must be accessible to the classloader used by Moshi.
* **Constructor/Method Side Effects:** The instantiated class must have constructors or methods (especially those called during deserialization) that perform actions with security implications.
* **Absence of Explicit Registration:** If the application relies on automatic subtype discovery (which is generally discouraged for security reasons), the risk is higher as more classes might be considered valid subtypes.

#### 4.4 Illustrative Example (Conceptual)

Let's consider a simplified scenario:

```kotlin
// Base class
@JsonClass(generateAdapter = true, polymorphic = true, discriminator = "type")
sealed class Message {
    abstract val content: String
}

// Allowed subtypes
@JsonClass(generateAdapter = true, label = "text")
data class TextMessage(override val content: String) : Message()

@JsonClass(generateAdapter = true, label = "image")
data class ImageMessage(override val content: String, val imageUrl: String) : Message()

// Unexpected, potentially malicious class
data class ExploitCommand(val command: String) {
    init {
        // Simulate a dangerous operation
        println("Executing command: $command")
        // In a real scenario, this could execute system commands
    }
}
```

If an attacker sends the following JSON:

```json
{
  "type": "exploitcommand",
  "command": "rm -rf /"
}
```

And if Moshi, due to classloader visibility or misconfiguration, can find and instantiate `ExploitCommand`, the constructor's `init` block would be executed, potentially leading to severe consequences.

#### 4.5 Impact Assessment (Detailed)

The impact of successfully exploiting this vulnerability can range from minor disruptions to complete system compromise, depending on the actions performed by the unexpectedly instantiated class:

* **Arbitrary Code Execution (High Severity):** If the unexpected class's constructor or methods execute system commands, access sensitive data, or manipulate critical resources, it can lead to full control of the application or even the underlying server.
* **Denial of Service (Medium to High Severity):** Instantiating a class with resource-intensive operations in its constructor could lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service.
* **Unexpected Application Behavior (Medium Severity):** Instantiating a class with unintended side effects could lead to data corruption, incorrect processing, or other unexpected application behavior.
* **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** If the unexpected class accesses and logs or transmits sensitive information during its instantiation, it could lead to information disclosure.

The severity also depends on the context of the application and the privileges of the user running the application.

#### 4.6 Analysis of Mitigation Strategies

Let's analyze the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies:

* **Explicitly register all allowed subtypes using `@JsonClassDiscriminator` and `@JsonClassLabel`. Avoid relying on default or automatic subtype discovery.**
    * **Effectiveness:** This is the **most crucial mitigation**. By explicitly listing allowed subtypes, you create a whitelist, preventing Moshi from instantiating any other classes based on the discriminator value. This significantly reduces the attack surface.
    * **Implementation:** Requires careful planning and maintenance as new subtypes are added.
* **Thoroughly review the constructors and methods of all registered subtypes for potential security vulnerabilities.**
    * **Effectiveness:** This is a good security practice in general. Even with explicit registration, vulnerabilities might exist within the intended subtypes.
    * **Implementation:** Requires code reviews and security testing of all registered subtypes. Pay close attention to constructors, `init` blocks, and any methods called during deserialization.
* **If possible, limit the number of allowed subtypes to only those strictly necessary.**
    * **Effectiveness:** Reducing the number of potential instantiation targets reduces the overall risk.
    * **Implementation:** Requires careful design and consideration of the application's data model.
* **Consider alternative approaches to handling different data structures if the risk of exploiting polymorphism is deemed too high.**
    * **Effectiveness:** In some cases, simpler approaches like using different API endpoints or data structures for different types might be more secure than relying on polymorphic deserialization.
    * **Implementation:** Requires significant architectural changes and might not be feasible in all situations.

#### 4.7 Further Recommendations and Detection Strategies

Beyond the provided mitigation strategies, consider the following:

* **Input Validation:** While Moshi handles deserialization, validating the structure and content of the incoming JSON payload before deserialization can help prevent unexpected data from reaching the deserialization process.
* **Static Analysis Tools:** Utilize static analysis tools that can identify potential deserialization vulnerabilities.
* **Runtime Monitoring:** Monitor application logs and behavior for unexpected class instantiations or unusual activity that might indicate an attempted exploit.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of potential code execution.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the application's codebase and dependencies, including the usage of Moshi.
* **Consider using a dedicated security framework:** Explore security frameworks that offer built-in protection against deserialization vulnerabilities.

#### 4.8 Limitations of Moshi's Built-in Protections

While Moshi provides the mechanisms for secure polymorphic deserialization (through explicit registration), it doesn't inherently prevent the instantiation of arbitrary classes if not configured correctly. The responsibility lies with the developers to use these features securely. Moshi relies on the provided annotations and the classloader's visibility to perform deserialization. It doesn't have built-in sandboxing or runtime checks to prevent malicious code execution within instantiated classes.

#### 4.9 Real-World Scenarios

This vulnerability is relevant in various scenarios where applications use Moshi for handling diverse JSON structures:

* **Microservices Architectures:** When different microservices communicate using JSON payloads with polymorphic types.
* **Mobile Applications:** When mobile apps receive data from backend services in JSON format.
* **Data Processing Pipelines:** When processing data streams or files in JSON format.
* **Configuration Management:** When applications load configurations from JSON files.

In all these scenarios, if polymorphic deserialization is used without careful consideration of security implications, the risk of exploiting this vulnerability exists.

### 5. Conclusion

The "Exploiting Polymorphic Deserialization to Instantiate Unexpected Classes" threat is a significant security concern when using Moshi's polymorphic deserialization features. While Moshi provides the tools for secure usage, developers must be diligent in explicitly registering allowed subtypes and thoroughly reviewing the code of those subtypes. Failure to do so can open the door to various attacks, including arbitrary code execution. By understanding the underlying mechanisms of this vulnerability and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the risk and build more secure applications. Continuous vigilance and adherence to secure coding practices are essential when dealing with deserialization of untrusted data.
