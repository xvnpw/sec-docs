## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Code Injection within the Adapter Logic (Moshi Library)

This document provides a deep analysis of the attack tree path "Code injection within the adapter logic" for an application utilizing the Moshi library (https://github.com/square/moshi). This analysis aims to understand the mechanics of this attack, its potential impact, and recommend mitigation strategies.

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the attack vector of code injection within custom Moshi adapters. This includes:

* **Understanding the technical details:** How can malicious code be injected and executed during deserialization?

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Code injection within the adapter logic

**ATTACK TREE PATH:**

**Code injection within the adapter logic (CRITICAL NODE)**

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious code that gets executed during the deserialization process within a custom adapter.
* **Critical Node:** Code injection within the adapter logic - Direct code execution within the application's context.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

This attack path hinges on the ability of an attacker to manipulate the input data in a way that, when processed by a custom Moshi adapter, leads to the execution of arbitrary code. This typically occurs when the custom adapter performs actions based on the input data without proper validation or sanitization, and these actions involve dynamic instantiation, reflection, or other mechanisms that can be exploited.

**Scenario:**

Imagine a custom Moshi adapter designed to deserialize a JSON object into a specific class. Let's say the JSON contains a field that dictates which specific subclass of a base class should be instantiated.

```json
{
  "type": "com.example.MaliciousClass",
  "data": {
    "some_property": "some_value"
  }
}
```

If the custom adapter directly uses the value of the "type" field to instantiate a class using reflection (e.g., `Class.forName(typeName).newInstance()`), without proper validation, an attacker can provide a fully qualified class name of a malicious class they have managed to introduce into the application's classpath.

**Technical Details:**

1. **Attacker-Controlled Input:** The attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload where a field intended to represent a specific type or action is manipulated to contain the name of a malicious class.

2. **Custom Adapter Processing:** The Moshi library invokes the custom adapter to deserialize the JSON.

3. **Vulnerable Logic:** The custom adapter contains logic that dynamically uses the attacker-controlled input. This could involve:
    * **Dynamic Class Instantiation:** Using `Class.forName()` or similar mechanisms to instantiate classes based on the input.
    * **Reflection:** Using reflection to access methods or fields of classes whose names are derived from the input.
    * **Scripting Engine Execution:** If the adapter integrates with a scripting engine, malicious scripts could be injected.
    * **Unsafe Deserialization of Nested Objects:** If the adapter relies on other deserialization mechanisms for nested objects without proper validation, vulnerabilities in those mechanisms could be exploited.

4. **Code Execution:** When the vulnerable logic is executed with the malicious input, the attacker's code is loaded and executed within the application's context.

**Potential Vulnerabilities in Custom Adapters:**

* **Unvalidated Class Names:** Directly using user-provided strings as class names for instantiation without whitelisting or sanitization.
* **Unsafe Reflection Usage:** Using reflection to invoke methods or access fields based on attacker-controlled input without proper checks.
* **Deserialization of Untrusted Data into Executable Code:**  Deserializing data that can be interpreted as code (e.g., scripts, serialized objects containing malicious logic).
* **Lack of Input Sanitization:** Failing to sanitize or validate input data before using it in critical operations like class loading or reflection.
* **Over-reliance on Input Data for Control Flow:**  Using input data to determine which code paths are executed within the adapter, allowing attackers to trigger malicious branches.

**Impact Assessment:**

A successful code injection attack within a Moshi adapter can have severe consequences:

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server or client running the application, gaining full control over the system.
* **Data Breach:** The attacker can access sensitive data stored or processed by the application.
* **System Compromise:** The attacker can compromise the integrity and availability of the application and its underlying infrastructure.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker can execute code that crashes the application or consumes excessive resources.
* **Privilege Escalation:** If the application runs with elevated privileges, the attacker can gain those privileges.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To prevent code injection within Moshi custom adapters, developers should implement the following strategies:

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Whitelist Allowed Values:**  If the input is expected to be from a limited set of values (e.g., specific class names), strictly validate against this whitelist.
    * **Sanitize Input:** Remove or escape potentially harmful characters or patterns from the input.
* **Avoid Dynamic Class Instantiation Based on User Input:**  If possible, avoid directly using user-provided strings to instantiate classes. Consider using a predefined mapping or factory pattern.
* **Secure Reflection Practices:**
    * **Limit Reflection Usage:** Minimize the use of reflection, especially when dealing with external input.
    * **Validate Target Classes and Methods:** If reflection is necessary, strictly validate the target classes and methods before invoking them.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the impact of a successful attack.
* **Secure Deserialization Practices:**
    * **Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data into Executable Code:** Be extremely cautious when deserializing data from untrusted sources, especially if it can be interpreted as code.
    * **Use Safe Deserialization Libraries:**  Ensure that any nested deserialization processes are also secure.
* **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews of custom adapter implementations to identify potential vulnerabilities.
* **Security Testing:** Implement security testing practices, including:
    * **Static Analysis:** Use tools to automatically identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
    * **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing):**  Provide malformed or unexpected input to the application to identify potential weaknesses.
    * **Penetration Testing:**  Simulate real-world attacks to assess the application's security posture.
* **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update the Moshi library and other dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
* **Consider Alternatives to Custom Adapters:** If the complexity of the custom adapter introduces significant security risks, explore alternative approaches to data transformation or mapping.

### 5. Conclusion

Code injection within Moshi custom adapters represents a critical security risk due to the potential for arbitrary code execution. By understanding the attack vector, potential vulnerabilities, and implementing robust mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the likelihood of this type of attack. A strong focus on input validation, secure deserialization practices, and thorough security testing is crucial for building secure applications that utilize the Moshi library.
