### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Injection via Custom Adapters

**ATTACK TREE PATH:** Injection via Custom Adapters (CRITICAL NODE)

**- Attack Vector: Vulnerabilities in user-defined `TypeAdapter` implementations are exploited.**
**- Critical Node: This is a critical node because it represents a weakness in application-specific code that interacts with Moshi.**

**Detailed Breakdown:**

The core of this attack path lies in the fact that while Moshi provides a robust and secure framework for JSON processing, the responsibility for the logic within custom `TypeAdapter`s rests entirely with the application developer. This introduces a potential attack surface if these custom adapters are not implemented with security in mind.

**Understanding the Attack Vector:**

Custom `TypeAdapter`s are designed to handle serialization and deserialization of specific data types or complex objects that Moshi doesn't handle out-of-the-box. This often involves:

* **Parsing and validating input data:**  Converting JSON primitives (strings, numbers, booleans) into application-specific objects.
* **Formatting output data:** Converting application objects back into JSON.
* **Performing custom logic:**  Applying transformations, calculations, or other operations during the serialization/deserialization process.

Vulnerabilities can arise in any of these stages if the custom adapter doesn't handle input data securely. An attacker can craft malicious JSON payloads designed to exploit these weaknesses.

**Potential Vulnerabilities in Custom Adapters:**

1. **Lack of Input Validation:** This is a primary concern. If the custom adapter doesn't properly validate the structure, type, and content of the incoming JSON data, it can be susceptible to various injection attacks. For example:
    * **SQL Injection (Indirect):** If the custom adapter uses data from the JSON payload to construct database queries without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code. While Moshi itself doesn't directly interact with databases, the custom adapter might.
    * **Command Injection (Indirect):** If the custom adapter uses data from the JSON payload to execute system commands (e.g., through `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`), an attacker could inject malicious commands.
    * **XPath/LDAP Injection (Indirect):** Similar to SQL injection, if the custom adapter uses data to construct queries for other data sources, it could be vulnerable.
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Indirect):** If the deserialized data is later used in a web context without proper encoding, an attacker could inject malicious scripts.
    * **Path Traversal:** If the custom adapter uses data from the JSON to access files, an attacker could manipulate the path to access unauthorized files.

2. **Incorrect Type Handling:**  If the custom adapter assumes the input data will always be of a specific type and doesn't handle unexpected types gracefully, it could lead to errors or unexpected behavior that an attacker could exploit.

3. **Deserialization of Untrusted Data into Vulnerable Objects:** If the custom adapter deserializes JSON into objects that have known vulnerabilities (e.g., due to insecure constructors or setters), an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by crafting a specific JSON payload.

4. **Resource Exhaustion:**  A malicious JSON payload could be crafted to cause the custom adapter to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory), leading to a denial-of-service. This could involve deeply nested objects or extremely large data values.

5. **Information Disclosure:**  Errors or exceptions within the custom adapter, if not handled properly, could leak sensitive information about the application's internal state or data structures in error messages.

**Why This is a Critical Node:**

This node is critical because it represents a weakness in the application's own code, which is often the least scrutinized part of a system from a security perspective compared to well-established libraries like Moshi itself. Exploiting vulnerabilities in custom adapters can have significant consequences:

* **Direct Control over Data Processing:**  A successful injection can allow an attacker to manipulate the data being processed by the application, leading to data corruption, unauthorized access, or manipulation of business logic.
* **Bypassing Core Moshi Protections:** While Moshi handles the basic JSON parsing securely, vulnerabilities in custom adapters can circumvent these protections at the application level.
* **Potential for Severe Impact:** Depending on the functionality of the custom adapter and the data it handles, a successful attack could lead to data breaches, financial loss, reputational damage, or even system compromise.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To mitigate the risks associated with this attack path, the development team should implement the following strategies when creating custom `TypeAdapter`s:

1. **Strict Input Validation:**
    * **Validate Data Types:** Ensure the incoming JSON data matches the expected types.
    * **Validate Data Ranges and Formats:**  Check if values fall within acceptable ranges and adhere to expected formats (e.g., date formats, email formats).
    * **Sanitize Input:**  If the data is used in contexts where injection is possible (e.g., database queries, system commands), sanitize the input to remove or escape potentially malicious characters. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions.
    * **Use Regular Expressions for Pattern Matching:**  Employ regular expressions to validate string inputs against expected patterns.

2. **Type Safety and Generics:** Leverage Java's type system and generics to ensure that the custom adapter is handling the correct types of data.

3. **Secure Deserialization Practices:**
    * **Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data Directly into Sensitive Objects:** Consider using intermediate objects or data transfer objects (DTOs) to sanitize and validate data before mapping it to core application entities.
    * **Be Cautious with Polymorphism:** If the custom adapter handles polymorphic types, ensure that the type information in the JSON is trustworthy and cannot be manipulated to instantiate malicious classes.

4. **Robust Error Handling:**
    * **Handle Exceptions Gracefully:**  Catch exceptions that might occur during deserialization and avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.
    * **Log Errors Securely:**  Log errors in a way that doesn't reveal sensitive data and is accessible only to authorized personnel.

5. **Code Reviews:**  Conduct thorough code reviews of all custom `TypeAdapter` implementations to identify potential vulnerabilities.

6. **Security Testing:**
    * **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests that specifically target the custom adapter's handling of various valid and invalid JSON inputs, including potentially malicious payloads.
    * **Integration Tests:** Test the custom adapter within the context of the application to ensure it interacts securely with other components.
    * **Penetration Testing:** Consider engaging security professionals to perform penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities that might have been missed.

7. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the custom adapter only has access to the resources and data it absolutely needs to perform its function.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a custom `TypeAdapter` for handling user profile data. The JSON includes a `profile_picture_path` field. A vulnerable adapter might directly use this path to load the image without proper validation. An attacker could inject a path like `/etc/passwd` or `../../sensitive_file` to potentially access unauthorized files on the server.

**Conclusion:**

The "Injection via Custom Adapters" attack path highlights the importance of secure coding practices when extending the functionality of libraries like Moshi. While Moshi provides a secure foundation, the security of the application ultimately depends on the careful implementation of custom components. By understanding the potential vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation through this critical attack vector. Regular security reviews and testing of custom adapters are crucial for maintaining a strong security posture.
