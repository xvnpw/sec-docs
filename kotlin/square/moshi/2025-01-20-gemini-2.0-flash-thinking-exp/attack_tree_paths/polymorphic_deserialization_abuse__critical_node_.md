## Deep Analysis of Polymorphic Deserialization Abuse

**Attack Tree Path:** Polymorphic Deserialization Abuse (CRITICAL NODE)

**- Attack Vector: Attackers manipulate the JSON to force Moshi to instantiate arbitrary classes, potentially malicious ones.**

**Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Vector:**

Moshi's powerful polymorphic deserialization feature allows applications to handle JSON data where the actual type of an object might not be explicitly known beforehand. This is achieved through mechanisms like `@JsonClass(generateAdapter = true, generator = "sealed:...")` for sealed classes or `@PolymorphicJsonAdapterFactory` for more general cases. These mechanisms rely on information within the JSON payload (often a "type" field) to determine which concrete class to instantiate during deserialization.

The attack vector exploits this trust in the JSON data. An attacker can craft a malicious JSON payload where the "type" field specifies a class that is:

* **Present on the application's classpath:** This is a fundamental requirement for the attack to succeed.
* **Has undesirable side effects upon instantiation:** This is the core of the exploit. The malicious class might contain logic in its constructor, static initializer, or other lifecycle methods that performs harmful actions.

**Examples of Malicious Classes and Potential Actions:**

* **File System Manipulation:** A class that, upon instantiation, attempts to read, write, or delete files on the server's file system.
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  A class that executes arbitrary system commands. This could be achieved through various techniques, such as using `ProcessBuilder` or similar mechanisms within the class's constructor.
* **Network Communication:** A class that initiates connections to external servers, potentially exfiltrating data or participating in botnet activities.
* **Resource Exhaustion:** A class designed to consume excessive CPU, memory, or other resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
* **Database Manipulation:** A class that interacts with the application's database in unauthorized ways.

**- Critical Node: This is a critical node because it directly targets a powerful feature of Moshi that, if abused, can lead to RCE.**

**Why This Node is Critical:**

The "Polymorphic Deserialization Abuse" node is classified as critical due to the following reasons:

* **Direct Path to RCE:**  A successful exploitation of this vulnerability can directly lead to Remote Code Execution, granting the attacker complete control over the application server. This is the most severe type of security vulnerability.
* **Circumvention of Traditional Security Measures:**  This attack often bypasses traditional security measures like input validation that focus on the *content* of the data rather than the *structure* and the types being instantiated.
* **Complexity of Detection:**  Identifying malicious deserialization attempts can be challenging, as the attack relies on the presence of specific classes on the classpath, which might not be immediately obvious.
* **Wide Impact:**  If the application handles sensitive data, a successful RCE can lead to data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage.
* **Exploitation Simplicity (Potentially):**  Crafting a malicious JSON payload might be relatively straightforward once the attacker identifies suitable classes on the classpath.

**Mechanism of Abuse:**

The abuse hinges on the following steps:

1. **Attacker Identifies Deserialization Point:** The attacker finds an API endpoint or data processing mechanism where the application uses Moshi to deserialize JSON data with polymorphic type handling.
2. **Classpath Analysis (Reconnaissance):** The attacker attempts to identify classes present on the application's classpath that could be exploited upon instantiation. This might involve techniques like:
    * **Error Message Analysis:** Observing error messages that reveal class names.
    * **Dependency Analysis:** Examining the application's dependencies to identify potentially vulnerable libraries.
    * **Brute-forcing Class Names:**  Trying common or known vulnerable class names.
3. **Crafting Malicious JSON:** The attacker constructs a JSON payload that includes the "type" field (or equivalent mechanism used by Moshi) specifying the malicious class. The payload might also include parameters that are passed to the constructor of the malicious class.
4. **Sending the Malicious Payload:** The attacker sends the crafted JSON payload to the vulnerable endpoint or through the vulnerable data processing mechanism.
5. **Moshi Deserialization:** Moshi processes the JSON, reads the "type" information, and attempts to instantiate the specified class.
6. **Malicious Code Execution:** If the specified class is present and has exploitable logic in its constructor or lifecycle methods, that code is executed on the server.

**Technical Details and Moshi Configuration:**

The specific configuration of Moshi's polymorphic deserialization plays a crucial role:

* **`@JsonClass(generateAdapter = true, generator = "sealed:...")`:**  For sealed classes, the "type" field typically corresponds to the subclass name. Attackers would need to identify subclasses with exploitable behavior.
* **`@PolymorphicJsonAdapterFactory`:** This provides more flexibility in mapping type identifiers to concrete classes. The attacker needs to understand the specific mapping configured in the application.
* **Custom Type Adapters:** If the application uses custom type adapters for polymorphic deserialization, the vulnerability might lie within the logic of these adapters.

**Example (Conceptual):**

Let's assume the application uses `@PolymorphicJsonAdapterFactory` and has a mapping where `"command"` maps to a class named `SystemCommandExecutor`. A malicious JSON payload could look like this:

```json
{
  "type": "command",
  "command": "rm -rf /tmp/*"
}
```

If the `SystemCommandExecutor` class is present on the classpath and its constructor executes the provided `command`, this payload would result in the deletion of all files in the `/tmp` directory on the server.

**Likelihood and Severity:**

* **Likelihood:** The likelihood of this attack depends on factors like the visibility of the API endpoints, the complexity of the application's codebase, and the attacker's knowledge of the application's dependencies. If the application exposes APIs that accept arbitrary JSON and uses polymorphic deserialization, the likelihood is moderate to high.
* **Severity:** As mentioned earlier, the severity is **critical** due to the potential for RCE.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To mitigate the risk of Polymorphic Deserialization Abuse, the following strategies should be implemented:

1. **Restrict Allowed Types:**  The most effective mitigation is to explicitly define and restrict the set of allowed classes that Moshi can instantiate during polymorphic deserialization. This can be achieved through:
    * **Whitelisting:**  Using mechanisms within `@PolymorphicJsonAdapterFactory` or custom type adapters to only allow specific, safe classes.
    * **Sealed Classes:**  Leveraging sealed classes with a limited and controlled set of subclasses.
2. **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While not a complete solution, validating and sanitizing the "type" field and other relevant data in the JSON payload can help prevent the instantiation of obviously malicious class names. However, this approach is prone to bypasses if the attacker finds less obvious but still dangerous classes.
3. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges. This can limit the impact of a successful RCE.
4. **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough security audits and code reviews to identify potential deserialization vulnerabilities and ensure that best practices are followed.
5. **Dependency Management:** Keep Moshi and all other dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
6. **Consider Alternative Deserialization Libraries:** If polymorphic deserialization is not strictly necessary, consider using simpler deserialization mechanisms or libraries that offer more robust security features against this type of attack.
7. **Sandboxing and Isolation:**  If possible, run the application in a sandboxed environment or use containerization technologies to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
8. **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:** Implement monitoring and logging mechanisms to detect unusual deserialization patterns or attempts to instantiate unexpected classes.

**Conclusion:**

Polymorphic Deserialization Abuse is a critical vulnerability that can have severe consequences for applications using Moshi. By understanding the attack vector, the underlying mechanisms, and the potential impact, development teams can implement effective mitigation strategies to protect their applications. The key is to move away from trusting the "type" information provided in the JSON payload and instead enforce strict control over the classes that can be instantiated during deserialization. A defense-in-depth approach, combining multiple mitigation techniques, is crucial for minimizing the risk of this dangerous attack.
