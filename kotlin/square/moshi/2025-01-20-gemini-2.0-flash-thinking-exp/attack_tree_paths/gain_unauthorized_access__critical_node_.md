## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Gain Unauthorized Access via Malicious Instantiation

This document provides a deep analysis of a specific attack tree path identified for an application utilizing the Moshi library (https://github.com/square/moshi). The focus is on understanding the mechanics, potential impact, and mitigation strategies for an attack where adversaries force the instantiation of classes with malicious constructors to gain unauthorized access.

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the attack vector where attackers manipulate object instantiation within an application using Moshi to achieve unauthorized access. This includes:

* **Understanding the technical details:** How can an attacker force the instantiation of specific classes? What are the mechanisms within Moshi that could be exploited?
* **Identifying potential vulnerabilities:** Where are the weaknesses in the application's design or usage of Moshi that make this attack possible?
* **Assessing the impact:** What are the potential consequences of a successful attack via this path?
* **Developing mitigation strategies:** What steps can the development team take to prevent or mitigate this type of attack?

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack path: **Gain unauthorized access** through the **Attack Vector: Attackers force the instantiation of classes whose constructors perform actions that compromise the application.**

The scope includes:

* **Moshi library:**  The analysis will consider how Moshi's features, particularly its reflection-based deserialization, could be leveraged in this attack.
* **Application code:**  The analysis will consider how the application's design and usage of Moshi might create vulnerabilities.
* **Constructor execution:** The core focus is on the actions performed within class constructors during instantiation.
* **Unauthorized access:** The ultimate goal of the attacker is to gain access to resources or functionalities they are not authorized to use.

The scope excludes:

* **Other attack vectors:** This analysis does not cover other potential attack paths within the application.
* **Vulnerabilities in the Moshi library itself:**  The focus is on how the application's use of Moshi can be exploited, not inherent flaws in the library.
* **Specific application details:** While we will discuss general principles, we won't delve into the specifics of a particular application's codebase without further context.

### 3. Methodology

The methodology for this deep analysis involves the following steps:

1. **Understanding Moshi's Instantiation Process:**  Investigate how Moshi creates instances of objects during deserialization, paying close attention to the role of constructors and reflection.
2. **Identifying Potential Attack Surfaces:** Analyze scenarios where attacker-controlled data could influence the class being instantiated or the arguments passed to its constructor.
3. **Analyzing Constructor Behavior:**  Examine how actions within constructors could be exploited to perform malicious operations.
4. **Developing Attack Scenarios:**  Create concrete examples of how an attacker could leverage this vulnerability.
5. **Assessing Impact:** Evaluate the potential consequences of a successful attack, focusing on the "Gain unauthorized access" objective.
6. **Proposing Mitigation Strategies:**  Recommend specific coding practices and security measures to prevent this type of attack.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

**ATTACK TREE PATH:** Gain unauthorized access (CRITICAL NODE)

**- Attack Vector: Attackers force the instantiation of classes whose constructors perform actions that compromise the application.**
**- Critical Node: Gain unauthorized access - A significant security breach resulting from the ability to manipulate object instantiation.**

**Detailed Breakdown:**

This attack vector hinges on the ability of an attacker to influence the deserialization process managed by Moshi in a way that leads to the instantiation of specific, attacker-chosen classes. The key to the compromise lies within the constructors of these malicious classes.

**How Moshi Instantiates Objects:**

Moshi, like other JSON binding libraries, uses reflection to create instances of objects during deserialization. When Moshi encounters JSON data that needs to be mapped to a Java/Kotlin object, it typically performs the following steps:

1. **Determines the Target Class:** Based on the JSON structure and the defined type adapters, Moshi identifies the class to be instantiated.
2. **Creates an Instance:** Moshi uses reflection to create a new instance of the target class. This often involves invoking the constructor of the class.
3. **Populates Fields:**  Moshi then uses reflection to set the values of the object's fields based on the corresponding values in the JSON data.

**The Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises when an attacker can control the data being deserialized in a way that forces Moshi to instantiate a class whose constructor performs unintended or malicious actions. This can happen in several ways:

* **Polymorphic Deserialization without Proper Type Handling:** If the application uses polymorphic deserialization (e.g., using `@JsonClass(generateAdapter = true, generator = "sealed:type")` or custom type adapters) without strict validation of the incoming type information, an attacker might be able to inject a malicious type identifier, causing Moshi to instantiate a malicious class.
* **Unsafe Custom Type Adapters:**  If the application uses custom type adapters that perform complex logic or interact with external resources during the deserialization process (and thus during instantiation), vulnerabilities could be introduced.
* **Indirect Instantiation via Constructor Logic:**  Even if the directly instantiated class seems benign, its constructor might trigger the instantiation of other classes with malicious behavior.
* **Side Effects in Constructors:**  Constructors are intended for object initialization. However, if constructors perform actions that have side effects beyond initialization (e.g., writing to files, making network requests, executing commands), an attacker can leverage this to their advantage.

**Example Attack Scenario:**

Imagine an application that processes user-provided JSON data to create objects. Let's say the application uses polymorphic deserialization to handle different types of "Action" objects.

```java
@JsonClass(generateAdapter = true, generator = "sealed:type")
sealed class Action {
    abstract val type: String
}

@JsonClass(generateAdapter = true)
data class LogAction(override val type: String = "log", val message: String) : Action()

@JsonClass(generateAdapter = true)
data class ExecuteCommandAction(override val type: String = "execute", val command: String) : Action() {
    init {
        // Potentially dangerous action in the constructor
        Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command);
    }
}
```

If the application deserializes JSON into an `Action` object without proper validation, an attacker could send the following JSON:

```json
{
  "type": "execute",
  "command": "rm -rf /"
}
```

Moshi, based on the "type" field, would instantiate an `ExecuteCommandAction` object. The constructor of this class would then execute the provided command, leading to a severe security breach.

**Impact of Successful Attack:**

A successful attack via this path can have severe consequences, leading to:

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** As demonstrated in the example, malicious constructors can execute arbitrary code on the server.
* **Data Breach:**  Constructors could be designed to exfiltrate sensitive data.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Malicious constructors could consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service.
* **Privilege Escalation:**  If the application runs with elevated privileges, the attacker could gain those privileges.
* **Unauthorized Access:**  Constructors could be used to create backdoor accounts or modify access control mechanisms.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To mitigate the risk of this attack vector, the development team should implement the following strategies:

* **Principle of Least Privilege in Constructors:**  Avoid performing any actions in constructors that are not strictly necessary for object initialization. Side effects should be handled in dedicated methods called after object creation.
* **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided data before deserialization. This includes validating the "type" field in polymorphic deserialization scenarios. Use allow-lists for acceptable types rather than relying on deny-lists.
* **Secure Polymorphic Deserialization:**  Implement robust mechanisms for handling polymorphic deserialization. Consider using sealed classes with explicit type mapping and validation. Avoid relying solely on attacker-controlled type identifiers.
* **Careful Use of Custom Type Adapters:**  Review custom type adapters for potential vulnerabilities. Ensure they do not perform risky operations during deserialization.
* **Consider Alternatives to Reflection-Heavy Deserialization:**  In highly sensitive applications, consider alternative deserialization approaches that offer more control and less reliance on reflection, if feasible.
* **Security Audits and Code Reviews:**  Regularly conduct security audits and code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities related to object instantiation and deserialization.
* **Principle of Least Authority for Application Processes:** Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful attack.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** For web applications, implement a strong Content Security Policy to mitigate the risk of executing malicious scripts injected through this vulnerability.
* **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep the Moshi library and other dependencies up-to-date to benefit from security patches.

**Conclusion:**

The attack path involving the forced instantiation of malicious classes through Moshi highlights the importance of secure deserialization practices. By understanding how Moshi handles object creation and the potential for malicious constructor behavior, development teams can implement effective mitigation strategies to protect their applications from this critical vulnerability. A proactive approach focusing on input validation, secure coding practices, and regular security assessments is crucial in preventing unauthorized access through this attack vector.
