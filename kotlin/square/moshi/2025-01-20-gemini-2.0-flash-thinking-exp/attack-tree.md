# Attack Tree Analysis for square/moshi

Objective: To compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Moshi library, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) or significant data manipulation/access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Moshi Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_moshi_exploitation__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

- This path encompasses a range of attacks that exploit how Moshi converts JSON data into application objects.
- Critical Node: This is a critical node because successful exploitation can lead to severe consequences like RCE or unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Polymorphic Deserialization Abuse (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/polymorphic_deserialization_abuse__critical_node_.md)

- Attack Vector: Attackers manipulate the JSON to force Moshi to instantiate arbitrary classes, potentially malicious ones.
- Critical Node: This is a critical node because it directly targets a powerful feature of Moshi that, if abused, can lead to RCE.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__rce___critical_node_.md)

- Attack Vector: Attackers exploit sequences of method calls in the application's dependencies to achieve code execution.
- Critical Node: Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) - This is the ultimate goal of many attacks and has a critical impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain unauthorized access (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access__critical_node_.md)

- Attack Vector: Attackers force the instantiation of classes whose constructors perform actions that compromise the application.
- Critical Node: Gain unauthorized access - A significant security breach resulting from the ability to manipulate object instantiation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Injection via Custom Adapters (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/injection_via_custom_adapters__critical_node_.md)

- Attack Vector: Vulnerabilities in user-defined `TypeAdapter` implementations are exploited.
- Critical Node: This is a critical node because it represents a weakness in application-specific code that interacts with Moshi.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code injection within the adapter logic (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection_within_the_adapter_logic__critical_node_.md)

- Attack Vector: Attackers inject malicious code that gets executed during the deserialization process within a custom adapter.
- Critical Node: Code injection within the adapter logic - Direct code execution within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/deserialization_of_untrusted_data__critical_node_.md)

- Attack Vector: The application processes JSON data from untrusted sources without proper validation, making it susceptible to various deserialization attacks.
- Critical Node: This is a critical node because it's the fundamental flaw that allows many other deserialization attacks to succeed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

- This path focuses on vulnerabilities present in the libraries that Moshi relies on.
- Critical Node: This is a critical node because vulnerabilities in dependencies can have widespread impact and are often overlooked.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve RCE or other forms of compromise through vulnerable dependencies (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_rce_or_other_forms_of_compromise_through_vulnerable_dependencies__critical_node_.md)

- Attack Vector: Attackers exploit known security flaws in libraries that Moshi uses indirectly.
- Critical Node: Achieve RCE or other forms of compromise through vulnerable dependencies -  The potential for significant compromise through vulnerable dependencies.
