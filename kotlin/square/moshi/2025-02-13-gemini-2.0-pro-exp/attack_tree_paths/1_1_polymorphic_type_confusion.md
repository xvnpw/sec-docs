# Deep Analysis: Moshi Polymorphic Type Confusion Attack

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Polymorphic Type Confusion" vulnerability within the context of Moshi JSON serialization/deserialization, identify potential exploitation scenarios, assess the associated risks, and propose concrete mitigation strategies for our application.  We aim to provide developers with actionable insights to prevent this vulnerability.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Moshi Library:**  We are analyzing the vulnerability as it pertains to the Moshi library (https://github.com/square/moshi) and its handling of polymorphic types.  We will *not* be examining other JSON libraries or general type confusion vulnerabilities outside the context of Moshi.
*   **Application Context:**  The analysis will consider how our *specific* application uses Moshi, including:
    *   The data models (classes) that utilize polymorphism (e.g., interfaces, abstract classes, sealed classes).
    *   The sources of JSON data processed by Moshi (e.g., user input, external APIs, internal messages).
    *   The security implications of successfully exploiting this vulnerability in our application (e.g., data breaches, privilege escalation, remote code execution).
*   **Attack Path 1.1:**  This document is dedicated solely to the "Polymorphic Type Confusion" attack path identified in the broader attack tree analysis.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Definition:**  Clearly define the "Polymorphic Type Confusion" vulnerability in the context of Moshi.
2.  **Technical Explanation:**  Explain the underlying mechanisms that make this vulnerability possible, including how Moshi handles type adapters and polymorphic deserialization.
3.  **Exploitation Scenario(s):**  Develop realistic scenarios where an attacker could exploit this vulnerability in our application.  This will involve crafting malicious JSON payloads.
4.  **Risk Assessment:**  Evaluate the likelihood and impact of successful exploitation.  Consider factors like attack complexity, required privileges, and potential damage.
5.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  Propose specific, actionable steps to prevent or mitigate the vulnerability.  This will include code examples, configuration changes, and best practices.
6.  **Testing and Verification:**  Describe how to test the effectiveness of the mitigation strategies.  This may involve unit tests, integration tests, or penetration testing.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1 Polymorphic Type Confusion

### 2.1 Vulnerability Definition

Polymorphic Type Confusion in Moshi arises when an attacker can manipulate the JSON input to cause Moshi to deserialize a JSON object into an instance of a class *different* from the one expected by the application.  This is possible because Moshi, like many JSON libraries, uses type hints (often a field like `@type` or a similar discriminator) within the JSON to determine which concrete class to instantiate when dealing with polymorphic types (interfaces or abstract classes).  If an attacker can control this type hint, they can potentially force the creation of an unexpected object.

### 2.2 Technical Explanation

Moshi uses `JsonAdapter` instances to handle serialization and deserialization.  For polymorphic types, Moshi provides mechanisms like `PolymorphicJsonAdapterFactory`.  This factory relies on a designated "type label" (a field in the JSON) to determine the correct concrete class to instantiate.

**Example (Conceptual):**

Let's say we have an interface `Animal` and two implementing classes: `Dog` and `Cat`.  We configure Moshi to use the field `"type"` as the type label:

```java
// Kotlin example (Java is similar)
interface Animal {
    val name: String
}

data class Dog(override val name: String, val breed: String) : Animal
data class Cat(override val name: String, val color: String) : Animal

val moshi = Moshi.Builder()
    .add(PolymorphicJsonAdapterFactory.of(Animal::class.java, "type")
        .withSubtype(Dog::class.java, "dog")
        .withSubtype(Cat::class.java, "cat")
    )
    .build()
```

Normally, Moshi would expect JSON like this:

```json
{ "type": "dog", "name": "Buddy", "breed": "Golden Retriever" }
```

or

```json
{ "type": "cat", "name": "Whiskers", "color": "Gray" }
```

The vulnerability exists if an attacker can *inject* or *modify* the `"type"` field.

### 2.3 Exploitation Scenario(s)

**Scenario 1: Gadget Class Exploitation**

Suppose our application, or a library it uses, contains a class like this (a "gadget class"):

```java
// Dangerous "gadget" class
class SystemCommandExecutor : Animal { // Implements Animal for some reason
    override val name: String = ""
    var command: String = ""

    init {
        if (command.isNotEmpty()) {
            Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command) // DANGEROUS!
        }
    }
}
```

This class executes a system command in its constructor if the `command` property is set.  An attacker could craft a malicious JSON payload:

```json
{ "type": "com.example.SystemCommandExecutor", "command": "rm -rf /" }
```

If the attacker can inject this JSON into a place where our application expects an `Animal`, Moshi might be tricked into instantiating `SystemCommandExecutor` instead of `Dog` or `Cat`, leading to arbitrary command execution.  This is a classic example of a deserialization attack leading to RCE.

**Scenario 2: Unexpected State Manipulation**

Even without a directly dangerous gadget class, an attacker might be able to cause unexpected behavior by instantiating a class that has side effects in its constructor or other methods.  For example, a class that modifies shared state, opens network connections, or performs other actions could be abused.

**Scenario 3: Denial of Service (DoS)**

An attacker might be able to cause a denial-of-service by forcing Moshi to attempt to instantiate a class that:

*   Requires unavailable resources.
*   Has a constructor that throws an exception.
*   Leads to an infinite loop or excessive memory allocation.

### 2.4 Risk Assessment

*   **Likelihood:**  Medium to High.  The likelihood depends on how much control an attacker has over the JSON input processed by Moshi.  If user input is directly deserialized without proper validation, the likelihood is high.  If the JSON comes from a trusted internal source, the likelihood is lower.
*   **Impact:**  High to Critical.  The impact ranges from denial-of-service to arbitrary code execution (RCE), depending on the available "gadget" classes and the application's functionality.  Data breaches and complete system compromise are possible.
*   **Attack Complexity:**  Medium.  The attacker needs to understand the application's data models and find a way to inject malicious JSON.  However, tools and techniques for finding gadget classes are readily available.
*   **Required Privileges:**  Low.  The attacker typically doesn't need any special privileges on the system, only the ability to provide input to the application.

### 2.5 Mitigation Strategies

1.  **Input Validation:**  *Strictly* validate all JSON input *before* passing it to Moshi.  This is the most crucial defense.
    *   **Schema Validation:**  Use JSON Schema (or a similar technology) to define the expected structure and types of the JSON data.  Reject any input that doesn't conform to the schema.  This prevents attackers from injecting arbitrary fields or changing the type label.
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Types:**  If possible, maintain a whitelist of allowed concrete types for each polymorphic field.  Reject any JSON that specifies a type not on the whitelist.  This is more robust than relying solely on the type label.

2.  **Avoid Dangerous Gadget Classes:**  Carefully review your codebase (and dependencies) for classes that could be misused if instantiated unexpectedly.  Avoid side effects in constructors, especially those that interact with the operating system or external resources.

3.  **Use `sealed` classes (Kotlin) or `sealed` interfaces/records (Java 17+)**:  Sealed classes/interfaces restrict the possible subtypes to those defined within the same file (or module).  This makes it much harder for an attacker to introduce unexpected types.

    ```kotlin
    // Kotlin sealed class example
    sealed class Animal {
        abstract val name: String
    }

    data class Dog(override val name: String, val breed: String) : Animal()
    data class Cat(override val name: String, val color: String) : Animal()
    // No other Animal subtypes are allowed outside this file
    ```

4.  **Customize `PolymorphicJsonAdapterFactory`:**  If you must use `PolymorphicJsonAdapterFactory`, consider:
    *   **Using a different type label:**  Don't use a common name like `"type"`.  Choose a more obscure or application-specific name.
    *   **Adding custom validation logic:**  You can override methods in `PolymorphicJsonAdapterFactory` to add extra checks before instantiating a class.

5.  **Limit Deserialization Depth:**  Configure Moshi to limit the depth of nested objects to prevent stack overflow attacks.

6.  **Regular Security Audits and Dependency Updates:**  Keep Moshi and all other dependencies up to date to benefit from security patches.  Regularly audit your codebase for potential vulnerabilities.

### 2.6 Testing and Verification

1.  **Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests that specifically target the polymorphic deserialization logic.
    *   Test with valid JSON.
    *   Test with invalid JSON (missing type label, incorrect type label, unknown type).
    *   Test with malicious JSON payloads designed to trigger the vulnerability (if safe to do so in a controlled environment).

2.  **Integration Tests:**  Test the entire flow of data through your application, including the points where JSON is deserialized.

3.  **Fuzz Testing:** Use a fuzzer to generate a large number of variations of JSON input, including malformed and unexpected data. This can help uncover edge cases and unexpected vulnerabilities.

4. **Penetration Testing:** Consider engaging a security professional to perform penetration testing, specifically targeting the deserialization functionality.

By implementing these mitigation strategies and thoroughly testing your application, you can significantly reduce the risk of Polymorphic Type Confusion vulnerabilities in your Moshi-based application. Remember that security is a continuous process, and ongoing vigilance is essential.
