Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on the use of Moshi for JSON deserialization.

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.1 Craft JSON with Known Gadget Class

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the feasibility, impact, and mitigation strategies for the attack vector described as "Craft JSON with Known Gadget Class" within the context of a Java application utilizing the Moshi library for JSON serialization and deserialization.  We aim to understand how an attacker might exploit this vulnerability, what specific conditions make the application susceptible, and how to effectively prevent or detect such attacks.  A key focus is on how Moshi's features (or lack thereof) influence the vulnerability.

**Scope:**

This analysis is limited to the following:

*   **Moshi Library:**  We will focus specifically on the Moshi library and its features related to (de)serialization.  We will not delve into vulnerabilities in other JSON libraries.
*   **Java Deserialization:** The core vulnerability class is Java deserialization.  We will examine how Moshi handles this process.
*   **Gadget Classes:** We will consider the concept of "gadget classes" and how they are leveraged in deserialization attacks.  We won't exhaustively list all possible gadgets, but rather focus on the *mechanism* of exploitation.
*   **Polymorphism:** We will specifically analyze how Moshi handles polymorphic deserialization, as this is a key area for potential vulnerabilities.  This includes both reflection-based and sealed-class-based polymorphism.
*   **Application Context:** We will assume a generic Java application using Moshi.  Specific application logic will be considered only in terms of how it might influence the vulnerability (e.g., classpath contents, custom adapters).
* **Attack Tree Path 1.1.1:** We are focusing on this specific path, not the entire attack tree.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Technical Background:**  Provide a concise explanation of Java deserialization vulnerabilities and the role of gadget classes.
2.  **Moshi's Deserialization Mechanism:**  Detail how Moshi handles deserialization, particularly concerning type handling and polymorphism.  This will involve reviewing Moshi's documentation and source code.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Analyze how the "Craft JSON with Known Gadget Class" attack could be executed against an application using Moshi.  This will include:
    *   Identifying potential attack surfaces (entry points where attacker-controlled JSON is deserialized).
    *   Explaining how an attacker could craft a malicious JSON payload.
    *   Describing the conditions under which the attack would succeed.
    *   Analyzing the impact of successful exploitation.

5.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the findings and provide actionable recommendations.

### 2. Deep Analysis

#### 2.1 Technical Background: Java Deserialization Vulnerabilities

Java deserialization vulnerabilities arise when an application deserializes untrusted data without proper validation.  The `ObjectInputStream.readObject()` method (and similar mechanisms in libraries like Moshi) can be tricked into instantiating arbitrary classes and calling their methods.

**Gadget Classes:**  A "gadget class" is a class that, during its deserialization process (e.g., in its `readObject()` method, or in methods called during deserialization), performs actions that can be harmful.  These actions might include:

*   Executing system commands (`Runtime.exec()`).
*   Reading or writing files.
*   Making network connections.
*   Modifying system properties.

A classic example is a class that, upon deserialization, attempts to delete a file whose name is provided in the serialized data.  An attacker could provide a malicious file path, leading to unauthorized file deletion.  More complex "gadget chains" can be constructed, where the deserialization of one object triggers the deserialization of another, and so on, ultimately leading to arbitrary code execution.

#### 2.2 Moshi's Deserialization Mechanism

Moshi is a modern JSON library for Java and Kotlin that focuses on type safety and simplicity.  It differs from older libraries like `ObjectInputStream` in several key ways:

*   **No Direct `readObject()` Equivalent:** Moshi doesn't use the traditional `ObjectInputStream.readObject()` mechanism.  Instead, it uses reflection (or code generation with Kotlin) and `JsonAdapter` instances to map JSON data to Java objects.
*   **Type Safety:** Moshi strongly emphasizes type safety.  You typically define `JsonAdapter` instances for specific types, which helps prevent accidental deserialization of unexpected classes.
*   **Polymorphism Handling:** Moshi supports polymorphic deserialization in two main ways:
    *   **Reflection-Based Polymorphism (Vulnerable):**  Using `@JsonClass(generateAdapter = true, generator = "reflection")` (or similar configurations), Moshi can use reflection to determine the concrete type to instantiate based on a type discriminator field in the JSON (e.g., a field named "type").  This is the *primary attack surface* for the vulnerability we're analyzing.
    *   **Sealed Classes (Mitigation):**  Moshi provides excellent support for Kotlin's sealed classes (and Java's sealed classes, introduced in Java 17).  When using sealed classes, Moshi *knows* all possible subtypes at compile time.  This eliminates the need for reflection-based type resolution and significantly reduces the attack surface.  The type discriminator is still used, but it's validated against the known set of sealed subtypes.
* **Custom Adapters:** The ability to create custom JsonAdapters is a double-edged sword. While they provide flexibility, they also introduce a potential risk if not implemented securely. A poorly written custom adapter could inadvertently introduce a deserialization vulnerability.

#### 2.3 Vulnerability Analysis: Crafting the Malicious JSON

**Attack Surfaces:**

The primary attack surface is any point where the application uses Moshi to deserialize JSON data that is, at least partially, under the attacker's control.  This could include:

*   **API Endpoints:**  REST APIs that accept JSON payloads.
*   **Message Queues:**  Applications that consume JSON messages from a queue.
*   **Configuration Files:**  If configuration is loaded from a JSON file that an attacker can modify.
*   **Database Fields:**  If JSON data is stored in a database and later deserialized.
* **Deserializing data from untrusted sources:** Any scenario where the application receives JSON from an external, untrusted source.

**Malicious JSON Payload (Example - Reflection-Based Polymorphism):**

Let's assume the application uses reflection-based polymorphism and has a vulnerable gadget class on its classpath, `com.example.VulnerableGadget`, which executes a command upon deserialization.  The attacker might craft a JSON payload like this:

```json
{
  "type": "com.example.VulnerableGadget",
  "command": "rm -rf /"
}
```

*   **`"type"`:** This field acts as the type discriminator.  Moshi, using reflection, will see this and attempt to instantiate a class with the fully qualified name `com.example.VulnerableGadget`.
*   **`"command"`:** This field (and its value) would be specific to the `VulnerableGadget` class.  It represents data that the gadget class uses during its malicious action.

**Conditions for Successful Attack:**

1.  **Reflection-Based Polymorphism:** The application must be using Moshi's reflection-based polymorphism for the relevant data type.  If sealed classes are used correctly, this attack vector is largely mitigated.
2.  **Gadget Class on Classpath:** The `com.example.VulnerableGadget` (or another suitable gadget) must be present on the application's classpath.  This often involves finding a vulnerable library or dependency.
3.  **Attacker Control of Type Discriminator:** The attacker must be able to control the value of the type discriminator field in the JSON.
4.  **No Input Validation/Sanitization:**  The application must not perform sufficient input validation or sanitization to prevent the malicious JSON from being processed.
5. **Vulnerable Custom Adapter (If Applicable):** If a custom `JsonAdapter` is used, it must be vulnerable to deserialization attacks. This could happen if the adapter uses reflection to instantiate classes based on untrusted input without proper validation.

**Impact:**

The impact of a successful attack is typically **high**, potentially leading to:

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE):** The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, with the privileges of the application.
*   **Data Breach:**  The attacker can read, modify, or delete sensitive data.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The attacker can crash the application or the entire server.
*   **Full System Compromise:**  The attacker can gain complete control of the server.

#### 2.4 Mitigation Strategies

1.  **Prefer Sealed Classes:**  The most effective mitigation is to use Kotlin's sealed classes (or Java's sealed classes, if using Java 17+) for polymorphic deserialization.  This eliminates the reliance on reflection for type resolution and restricts the possible types to a known set.

2.  **Avoid Reflection-Based Polymorphism:** If sealed classes are not an option, *strongly* consider alternatives to reflection-based polymorphism.  If you *must* use it, be extremely cautious.

3.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Types:**  If you must use reflection-based polymorphism, maintain a strict whitelist of allowed types for the type discriminator.  Reject any JSON that attempts to deserialize a type not on the whitelist.
    *   **Schema Validation:**  Use JSON Schema validation to enforce a strict schema for the expected JSON structure.  This can help prevent unexpected fields or types.
    *   **Sanitize Input:**  Even with a whitelist, sanitize the values of other fields in the JSON to prevent injection attacks within the gadget class itself.

4.  **Dependency Management and Vulnerability Scanning:**
    *   **Keep Dependencies Updated:**  Regularly update all dependencies, including Moshi and any libraries that might contain gadget classes.
    *   **Use Vulnerability Scanners:**  Employ static analysis tools (e.g., Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check) to scan your dependencies for known vulnerabilities, including deserialization gadgets.

5.  **Secure Custom Adapters:**
    *   **Avoid Unnecessary Reflection:**  If writing custom `JsonAdapter` implementations, avoid using reflection to instantiate classes based on untrusted input.
    *   **Validate Input:**  Thoroughly validate all input within custom adapters.
    *   **Use `@FromJson` and `@ToJson`:** Prefer using these annotations for custom adapter logic, as they provide a more structured and type-safe approach.

6.  **Runtime Monitoring and Detection:**
    *   **Security Auditing:**  Implement security auditing to log suspicious class instantiations or other unusual activity.
    *   **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):**  Use an IDS to monitor network traffic for patterns indicative of deserialization attacks.
    *   **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP):**  Consider using a RASP solution that can detect and block deserialization attacks at runtime.

7. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they achieve code execution.

8. **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While primarily for web applications, CSP can help mitigate some aspects of deserialization attacks by restricting the resources that can be loaded.

#### 2.5 Conclusion

The "Craft JSON with Known Gadget Class" attack is a serious threat to applications using Moshi with reflection-based polymorphism for deserialization.  The attacker can exploit this to achieve arbitrary code execution by crafting a malicious JSON payload that references a known gadget class on the application's classpath.

The most effective mitigation is to **use sealed classes** for polymorphic deserialization.  This eliminates the need for reflection-based type resolution and significantly reduces the attack surface.  If sealed classes are not feasible, strict input validation, whitelisting of allowed types, dependency management, and runtime monitoring are crucial.  Carefully review and secure any custom `JsonAdapter` implementations. By following these recommendations, developers can significantly reduce the risk of deserialization vulnerabilities in their applications using Moshi.
