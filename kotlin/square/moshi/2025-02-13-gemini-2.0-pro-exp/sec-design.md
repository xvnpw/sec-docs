# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

* Provide a modern, efficient, and customizable JSON library for Java and Kotlin.
* Offer a simpler, more robust alternative to existing JSON libraries like Gson.
* Improve developer productivity by reducing boilerplate code related to JSON serialization and deserialization.
* Enhance performance and reduce memory footprint compared to other JSON libraries.
* Support advanced features like polymorphism, custom adapters, and streaming.
* Maintain strong compatibility with Kotlin's features, including null safety and data classes.
* Ensure the library is easy to use, well-documented, and actively maintained.

Business Risks:

* Incompatibility with existing projects or libraries that rely on different JSON processing mechanisms.
* Performance bottlenecks or excessive memory usage when handling large or complex JSON data.
* Security vulnerabilities arising from improper handling of untrusted JSON input.
* Difficulty in adapting the library to evolving JSON standards or specific application requirements.
* Lack of community adoption or contribution, leading to stagnation or obsolescence.
* Bugs or unexpected behavior that could lead to data corruption or application instability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

* security control: The project uses GitHub, which provides a secure platform for code hosting, version control, and collaboration.
* security control: The project is open-source, allowing for community review and scrutiny of the codebase.
* security control: Moshi focuses on secure defaults, such as strict parsing, to mitigate common JSON vulnerabilities.
* security control: The library is designed to handle various edge cases and malformed JSON input gracefully. (implied, needs verification)
* security control: The project likely has unit and integration tests to ensure the correctness and security of the code. (implied, needs verification)

Accepted Risks:

* accepted risk: The library relies on external dependencies, which could introduce vulnerabilities if not properly managed.
* accepted risk: Users may misuse the library or introduce vulnerabilities in their own code that interacts with Moshi.
* accepted risk: The library may not be fully compliant with all relevant security standards or regulations. (needs verification)

Recommended Security Controls:

* security control: Implement regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning to mitigate supply chain risks.
* security control: Provide clear security documentation and guidelines for users on how to use the library securely.
* security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
* security control: Implement a security policy and vulnerability disclosure program.
* security control: Consider using static analysis tools (SAST) to identify potential security issues during development.
* security control: Consider using dynamic analysis tools (DAST) to test the library's runtime behavior and identify vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:

* Authentication: Not directly applicable to a JSON library.
* Authorization: Not directly applicable to a JSON library.
* Input Validation:
    * The library should strictly validate JSON input against the expected schema.
    * The library should handle malformed or unexpected JSON input gracefully, without crashing or exposing sensitive information.
    * The library should provide mechanisms for users to customize validation rules and error handling.
* Cryptography:
    * Not directly applicable to a JSON library, unless it's used for handling encrypted data. If so, it should use well-established cryptographic libraries and algorithms.
* Data Protection:
    * The library should not store or transmit sensitive data unnecessarily.
    * If the library handles sensitive data, it should be protected in accordance with relevant security standards and regulations.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

* JSON serialization and deserialization for data exchange between applications and services.
* Data binding for mapping JSON data to Java/Kotlin objects.
* Configuration and customization of JSON processing.

Data to Protect:

* **Any data serialized or deserialized using Moshi.** The sensitivity of this data depends entirely on the application using Moshi. Moshi itself doesn't inherently handle sensitive data, but it *processes* data that *could* be sensitive.
* **Configuration data for Moshi (if any).** This is generally not sensitive.

Data Sensitivity:

* **Variable:** The sensitivity of the data processed by Moshi is entirely dependent on the context of the application using it. It could range from non-sensitive public data to highly sensitive PII, financial data, or healthcare information.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

* What specific types of data will be processed by Moshi in the applications where it is used?
* Are there any specific security standards or regulations that the applications using Moshi must comply with (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS)?
* What is the threat model for the applications using Moshi? What are the potential attackers and their motivations?
* Are there any existing security reviews or audits of the Moshi library?
* What is the process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in Moshi?
* Are there any performance requirements or limitations for Moshi?
* What level of logging and monitoring is required for Moshi's operations?

Assumptions:

* BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a reliable and efficient JSON library. Security is a high priority, but performance and ease of use are also important considerations.
* SECURITY POSTURE: The development team follows secure coding practices. The library is regularly updated to address security vulnerabilities. Users are responsible for securely handling the data they process with Moshi.
* DESIGN: Moshi is primarily used as an embedded library within other applications. The build process includes security checks like SAST and SCA. The deployment environment is secure and follows best practices.
