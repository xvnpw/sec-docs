# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for square/moshi

## Mitigation Strategy: [Deserialization Control and Configuration - Use `lenient()` Mode with Extreme Caution](./mitigation_strategies/deserialization_control_and_configuration_-_use__lenient____mode_with_extreme_caution.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1:  Thoroughly review all places in your codebase where Moshi's `lenient()` mode is used. Identify these by searching for `.lenient()` calls on `Moshi.Builder` or `JsonReader.Options`.
    *   Step 2:  For each usage of `lenient()`, carefully analyze why it is necessary. Determine if there are alternative approaches to handle the non-standard JSON input without using Moshi's `lenient()` mode. Consider fixing the source of non-standard JSON generation if possible.
    *   Step 3: If using Moshi's `lenient()` is deemed absolutely necessary, restrict its usage to only the specific `Moshi` instances or `JsonReader` configurations that are processing the known non-standard JSON. Avoid using `lenient()` globally for all Moshi deserialization.
    *   Step 4:  When deserializing data using a Moshi instance configured with `lenient()`, implement rigorous validation and sanitization of the resulting objects *after* Moshi deserialization. Treat the deserialized data as potentially less reliable and validate all critical fields against expected values and formats.
    *   Step 5: Document clearly in the code comments and design documentation why Moshi's `lenient()` mode is used in specific locations and the associated security considerations.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unexpected Behavior due to Non-Standard JSON Parsing** (Severity: Medium): Moshi's `lenient()` mode can parse JSON that deviates from the standard, potentially leading to unexpected data interpretation and application logic errors if the non-standard aspects are not fully understood and handled.
    *   **Bypass of Security Checks** (Severity: Medium):  If security checks rely on strict JSON parsing assumptions, Moshi's `lenient()` mode might allow bypassing these checks by accepting and processing non-standard JSON that would otherwise be rejected by a standard parser.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unexpected Behavior due to Non-Standard JSON Parsing: Medium Reduction -  Mitigation relies heavily on post-deserialization validation and careful usage restriction of Moshi's `lenient()` mode. `lenient()` itself increases the risk, so reduction is achieved by controlled usage and validation.
    *   Bypass of Security Checks: Medium Reduction -  Similar to the above, careful usage of Moshi's `lenient()` and post-deserialization validation are crucial to minimize the risk of bypassing security checks.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Status: To be determined.
    *   Location: Need to audit codebase for Moshi's `lenient()` mode usage.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing in: Codebase audit for Moshi's `lenient()` usage.
    *   Documentation of Moshi's `lenient()` usage and associated risks.
    *   Standardized post-deserialization validation procedures for data parsed using Moshi's `lenient()` mode.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Deserialization Control and Configuration - Explicitly Define Adapters and Serializers](./mitigation_strategies/deserialization_control_and_configuration_-_explicitly_define_adapters_and_serializers.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Review your Moshi setup and identify areas where you are relying on default Moshi behavior for adapter generation and serialization. This includes places where you are directly using `moshi.adapter(Class)` without explicit adapter configuration.
    *   Step 2: For all data classes that are frequently deserialized or serialized using Moshi, especially those handling sensitive data or external input, explicitly define Moshi adapters. This can be done using `@JsonClass(generateAdapter = true)` annotation for Kotlin data classes, creating custom `JsonAdapter.Factory` implementations and registering them with `Moshi.Builder`, or by creating custom `JsonAdapter` implementations and registering them directly.
    *   Step 3: Within your explicit Moshi adapters, customize the deserialization and serialization logic as needed. This includes handling null values using `.nullSafe()`, default values, custom data type conversions using `@FromJson` and `@ToJson` annotations, and validation logic within the adapter itself (though primary validation should still occur before Moshi deserialization).
    *   Step 4: Avoid relying on reflection-based adapter generation by Moshi for critical data classes, as explicit adapters offer more control and can be optimized for security and performance.
    *   Step 5: For complex data types or custom serialization/deserialization requirements, create dedicated custom `JsonAdapter` implementations to ensure precise control over how Moshi handles these types.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unexpected Type Conversions by Moshi** (Severity: Low to Medium): Default Moshi behavior might lead to unexpected type conversions during deserialization, potentially causing application errors or subtle vulnerabilities if data is misinterpreted by Moshi. Explicit adapters provide better control over type handling within Moshi.
    *   **Data Handling Inconsistencies in Moshi Usage** (Severity: Low): Relying on default Moshi behavior across different parts of the application can lead to inconsistencies in how data is handled by Moshi. Explicit adapters promote consistent and predictable data processing by Moshi.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unexpected Type Conversions by Moshi: Medium Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk by providing explicit control over type mapping within Moshi.
    *   Data Handling Inconsistencies in Moshi Usage: Medium Reduction - Improves consistency and predictability of data processing by Moshi.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Status: Partially implemented.
    *   Location: Explicit adapters are used for some key data classes in the core business logic modules using `@JsonClass(generateAdapter = true)`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing in: Explicit adapters are not consistently used for all data classes handled by Moshi, especially in newer modules and less critical parts of the application.
    *   No systematic approach to defining and maintaining explicit Moshi adapters for all relevant data classes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Deserialization Control and Configuration - Review and Secure Custom Adapters](./mitigation_strategies/deserialization_control_and_configuration_-_review_and_secure_custom_adapters.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify all custom `JsonAdapter` implementations in your project that are used with Moshi.
    *   Step 2: Conduct a thorough security review of each custom adapter's code. Pay close attention to how they handle:
        *   Null values and unexpected input data during Moshi deserialization.
        *   Data type conversions and potential type mismatches within Moshi's deserialization process.
        *   Edge cases and boundary conditions in the context of Moshi's data handling.
        *   Potential for vulnerabilities if the adapter processes user-provided data directly within Moshi's deserialization flow.
    *   Step 3: Implement robust error handling within custom Moshi adapters. Ensure that exceptions during deserialization or serialization within the adapter are caught and handled gracefully, preventing unexpected crashes or information leakage from Moshi.
    *   Step 4: Write unit tests specifically for custom Moshi adapters, focusing on testing edge cases, invalid input that Moshi might encounter, and potential error conditions within the adapter's interaction with Moshi.
    *   Step 5: Follow secure coding practices when writing custom Moshi adapters, such as input validation (though ideally done before Moshi deserialization), output encoding relevant to Moshi's serialization, and avoiding hardcoded secrets within adapter logic.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Custom Moshi Deserialization Logic** (Severity: Medium to High): Bugs or vulnerabilities in custom Moshi adapters can directly lead to security issues if they mishandle data during Moshi's deserialization, introduce points of failure in Moshi's process, or cause unexpected application behavior when Moshi uses these adapters.
    *   **Data Corruption or Integrity Issues due to Custom Moshi Adapters** (Severity: Medium): Incorrectly implemented custom Moshi adapters can lead to data corruption during deserialization or serialization by Moshi, affecting data integrity and application functionality when Moshi is used.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Vulnerabilities in Custom Moshi Deserialization Logic: Medium to High Reduction -  Thorough review and testing of custom Moshi adapters significantly reduces the risk of vulnerabilities introduced by custom code interacting with Moshi.
    *   Data Corruption or Integrity Issues due to Custom Moshi Adapters: Medium Reduction - Improves data handling correctness within Moshi's processing and reduces data integrity risks related to custom adapters used by Moshi.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Status: Partially implemented.
    *   Location: Some custom Moshi adapters have unit tests, but a dedicated security review specifically focused on Moshi adapter security has not been performed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing in: Formal security review process for custom Moshi adapters.
    *   Comprehensive unit tests covering security-relevant aspects of custom Moshi adapters (e.g., handling invalid input within Moshi's context).
    *   Secure coding guidelines specifically for developing Moshi custom adapters.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Management and Updates - Keep Moshi Library Updated](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_management_and_updates_-_keep_moshi_library_updated.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Regularly check for new releases of the Moshi library on its official repository (e.g., GitHub, Maven Central) or through dependency management tools.
    *   Step 2: Subscribe to security advisories or release notes for Moshi to be notified of security updates and bug fixes released for the Moshi library itself.
    *   Step 3: Establish a process for promptly updating the Moshi dependency in your project whenever a new version is released, especially if release notes indicate security patches for Moshi.
    *   Step 4: After updating Moshi, run your application's test suite to ensure compatibility with the new Moshi version and that no regressions have been introduced in your application's Moshi usage.
    *   Step 5: Document the Moshi version used in your project and track updates in your dependency management system (e.g., `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `requirements.txt`) to maintain awareness of the Moshi library version in use.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Moshi Vulnerabilities** (Severity: High if vulnerabilities exist): Outdated versions of the Moshi library might contain known security vulnerabilities within Moshi's core code that attackers can exploit. Keeping Moshi updated ensures you benefit from official security patches provided by the Moshi developers.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Moshi Vulnerabilities: High Reduction -  Effectively eliminates the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities patched in newer Moshi versions.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Status: Partially implemented.
    *   Location: Dependency updates are performed periodically, but not always immediately upon new Moshi releases.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing in: Automated dependency update checks and notifications specifically for Moshi library updates.
    *   Formal process for prioritizing and applying security updates specifically for Moshi and other critical dependencies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Management and Updates - Monitor Moshi and its Dependencies for Vulnerabilities](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_management_and_updates_-_monitor_moshi_and_its_dependencies_for_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Integrate a dependency scanning tool into your development pipeline. Tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, or GitHub Dependency Scanning can automatically scan your project's dependencies, including Moshi, for known vulnerabilities.
    *   Step 2: Configure the dependency scanning tool to specifically monitor the Moshi library and its transitive dependencies.
    *   Step 3: Set up alerts or notifications to be triggered when the dependency scanning tool detects vulnerabilities specifically in Moshi or its dependencies.
    *   Step 4: Regularly review the vulnerability reports generated by the dependency scanning tool, focusing on any vulnerabilities reported for Moshi or its direct/transitive dependencies. Prioritize remediation of identified vulnerabilities related to Moshi.
    *   Step 5: Follow the recommended remediation steps provided by the tool, which typically involve updating to a patched version of Moshi or its vulnerable dependency, or applying workarounds if patches are not immediately available for Moshi-related vulnerabilities.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Moshi and Dependency Vulnerabilities** (Severity: High if vulnerabilities exist):  Proactively identifies known vulnerabilities in the Moshi library itself and its dependencies, allowing for timely patching and preventing exploitation of vulnerabilities within the Moshi dependency chain.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Moshi Dependencies** (Severity: Medium to High): Monitoring dependencies helps detect vulnerabilities introduced through compromised dependencies that Moshi relies on in its supply chain.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Moshi and Dependency Vulnerabilities: High Reduction -  Significantly reduces the risk by proactively identifying and enabling patching of vulnerabilities in Moshi and its dependency tree.
    *   Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Moshi Dependencies: Medium to High Reduction - Provides an early warning system for potential supply chain compromises affecting Moshi and its related libraries.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Status: Partially implemented.
    *   Location: GitHub Dependency Scanning is enabled for the project repository, providing basic dependency vulnerability detection including for Moshi.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing in: Integration of a more comprehensive dependency scanning tool like Snyk or OWASP Dependency-Check for more detailed vulnerability analysis specifically for Moshi and its dependencies.
    *   Automated alerts and notifications specifically for dependency vulnerabilities detected in Moshi or its dependency tree are not fully configured.
    *   Formal process for responding to and remediating dependency vulnerabilities identified by scanning tools, with a focus on Moshi-related issues.
