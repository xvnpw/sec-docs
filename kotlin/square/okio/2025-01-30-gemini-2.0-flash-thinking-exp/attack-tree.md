## Attack Tree Path: [Buffer Overflow in Buffer/Segment Management](./attack_tree_paths/buffer_overflow_in_buffersegment_management.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Send crafted input data to the application that is processed by Okio, specifically designed to exceed the allocated buffer size during read or write operations.
    *   Exploit vulnerabilities in Okio's internal segment management logic to cause a buffer to overflow when data is being moved or manipulated.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Application crash due to memory access violation.
    *   Arbitrary code execution by overwriting return addresses or function pointers in memory.
    *   Data corruption by overwriting adjacent memory regions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Double-Free or Use-After-Free in Segment Pool](./attack_tree_paths/double-free_or_use-after-free_in_segment_pool.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Trigger specific sequences of Okio API calls that lead to a segment in the segment pool being freed twice (double-free).
    *   Trigger sequences where a segment is freed and then accessed again later (use-after-free). This often requires deep understanding of Okio's internal memory management.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Application crash due to memory corruption.
    *   Memory corruption leading to unpredictable behavior.
    *   Potential for arbitrary code execution by manipulating freed memory.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion via Unbounded Operations](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion_via_unbounded_operations.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Provide extremely large input files or streams to the application that are processed by Okio without proper size limits or buffering. This can lead to excessive memory consumption.
    *   Trigger Okio operations that create a large number of internal objects (e.g., segments) without releasing them, leading to memory exhaustion.
    *   Initiate a large number of concurrent Okio operations that overwhelm system resources (CPU, file handles).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Application slowdown or unresponsiveness.
    *   Application crash due to out-of-memory errors.
    *   System-wide resource exhaustion affecting other services on the same machine.

## Attack Tree Path: [Infinite Loop/Deadlock in Stream Processing](./attack_tree_paths/infinite_loopdeadlock_in_stream_processing.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Send crafted input data that triggers an infinite loop within Okio's stream processing logic (Sources, Sinks, Buffers). This might exploit error handling paths or specific data patterns.
    *   Exploit concurrency issues in Okio's stream processing to create a deadlock condition where threads are blocked indefinitely, leading to application hang.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Application hang and unresponsiveness.
    *   Denial of service as the application becomes unusable.
    *   Potential application crash if watchdog timers or resource limits are exceeded.

## Attack Tree Path: [Injection Vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, Command Injection, etc.)](./attack_tree_paths/injection_vulnerabilities__sql_injection__command_injection__etc__.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Application reads data from an external source (e.g., file, network) using Okio.
    *   This data, without proper sanitization or validation, is then directly used in:
        *   SQL queries, leading to SQL Injection.
        *   System commands, leading to Command Injection.
        *   Other contexts where code or commands are interpreted (e.g., LDAP queries, XPath queries).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data breach by accessing or modifying sensitive database information (SQL Injection).
    *   System compromise by executing arbitrary commands on the server (Command Injection).
    *   Various other injection-related impacts depending on the context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if Okio used for handling serialized data)](./attack_tree_paths/deserialization_vulnerabilities__if_okio_used_for_handling_serialized_data_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Application uses Okio to read serialized data from an untrusted source.
    *   The application deserializes this data without proper validation or using insecure deserialization libraries.
    *   Crafted serialized data can contain malicious payloads that are executed during deserialization.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) by executing arbitrary code on the server during deserialization.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) by triggering resource-intensive deserialization processes.
    *   Other deserialization-related vulnerabilities like data corruption or information disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compression/Decompression Algorithm Exploits (e.g., Zip Bomb, Gzip Bomb)](./attack_tree_paths/compressiondecompression_algorithm_exploits__e_g___zip_bomb__gzip_bomb_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Provide a specially crafted compressed file (zip bomb, gzip bomb) to the application that uses Okio's decompression capabilities (GzipSource, DeflateSource, ZipFileSystem).
    *   These files are designed to decompress to an extremely large size, consuming excessive resources during decompression.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) due to resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk I/O).
    *   Application slowdown or unresponsiveness.
    *   Potential application crash due to out-of-memory errors or timeouts.
