# Attack Surface Analysis for square/okio

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion via Large Data Streams](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_via_large_data_streams.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides an extremely large data stream to be read by the application using Okio, leading to excessive memory consumption and a denial-of-service condition.
*   **How Okio Contributes:** Okio's `Buffer` can grow dynamically to accommodate incoming data. Without proper size limits enforced by the application, an attacker can exploit this by sending a vast amount of data, potentially exceeding available memory managed by Okio.
*   **Example:** A network application uses `Okio.source(socket)` to read data. An attacker sends an endless stream of data, causing the application's `Buffer` (managed by Okio) to grow indefinitely, eventually leading to an out-of-memory error.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service (application becomes unresponsive or crashes).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Size Limits:** Implement limits on the amount of data read from untrusted sources *before* or *during* reading with Okio. Use methods like wrapping the `Source` with a limiting `Source` or checking the size of the data as it's being processed.
    *   **Timeouts:** Set appropriate timeouts for read operations to prevent indefinite waiting for data, which can contribute to resource exhaustion. Use `Timeout.timeout(long, TimeUnit)`.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor application resource usage (memory, CPU) to detect and respond to potential resource exhaustion attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient or Missing Timeouts](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_or_missing_timeouts.md)

**Description:** The application performs I/O operations using Okio without setting appropriate timeouts, potentially leading to denial of service if the remote end is slow or unresponsive.
*   **How Okio Contributes:** Okio provides a `Timeout` mechanism that needs to be explicitly configured. If this mechanism is not used or configured inadequately when using Okio's `Source` or `Sink` with external resources, the application can become stuck waiting for data indefinitely.
*   **Example:** A network application uses `Okio.source(socket)` to read data from a remote server. If the server becomes unresponsive and no timeout is set on the `Source` (via `Timeout`), the application thread will block indefinitely, potentially exhausting resources.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service (application hangs or becomes unresponsive).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Set Timeouts:** Always configure appropriate timeouts for I/O operations using Okio's `Timeout` mechanism, especially when dealing with external or untrusted sources. Use `Timeout.timeout(long, TimeUnit)` on the `Source` or `Sink`.
    *   **Review Timeout Values:** Ensure timeout values are reasonable and sufficient for legitimate operations but not so long that they allow for easy exploitation.
