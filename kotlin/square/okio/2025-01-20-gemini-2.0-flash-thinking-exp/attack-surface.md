# Attack Surface Analysis for square/okio

## Attack Surface: [Memory Exhaustion via Large Untrusted Data](./attack_surfaces/memory_exhaustion_via_large_untrusted_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides an extremely large data stream to be processed by Okio, leading to excessive memory consumption and potentially a denial of service.

**How Okio Contributes:** Okio's buffering mechanisms can consume significant memory if the application reads large amounts of data into `Buffer` instances without proper size limitations.

**Example:** An application uses `Okio.source(inputStream)` to read data from a network connection without specifying a maximum read size. A malicious server sends gigabytes of data, causing the application to allocate excessive memory and crash.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application crash.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement size limits when reading data using Okio's `Source` implementations.
* Use methods like `Source.read(Buffer sink, long byteCount)` with a defined `byteCount` to control the amount of data read at once.
* Consider using streaming approaches where large data is processed in chunks rather than loading it entirely into memory.

## Attack Surface: [Zip Bomb Vulnerability](./attack_surfaces/zip_bomb_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted compressed file (e.g., a zip bomb) that expands to an enormous size when decompressed, leading to resource exhaustion.

**How Okio Contributes:** Okio provides `GzipSource` and other decompression mechanisms that can be used to decompress potentially malicious compressed data.

**Example:** An application uses `Okio.gzip(Okio.source(file))` to decompress a user-uploaded file. A malicious user uploads a zip bomb, causing the application to consume excessive disk space or memory during decompression.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), disk space exhaustion, memory exhaustion.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement size limits on the decompressed data. Check the size of the data being written to the `Sink` during decompression.
* Set timeouts for decompression operations to prevent indefinite resource consumption.
* Consider using alternative decompression libraries with built-in safeguards against zip bombs, or implement custom checks before and during decompression.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via `FileSystem` Interface](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via__filesystem__interface.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates file paths provided to Okio's `FileSystem` interface to access or modify files outside of the intended directory.

**How Okio Contributes:** Okio's `FileSystem` interface provides methods for interacting with the file system, and if user-provided input is directly used in file paths without sanitization, it can lead to path traversal.

**Example:** An application uses `FileSystem.SYSTEM.source(Path.of(userInput))` to read a file based on user input. A malicious user provides input like `../../../../etc/passwd`, potentially exposing sensitive system files.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized file access, potential system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Never directly use user-provided input in file paths.**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization for file paths.
* Use canonicalization techniques to resolve symbolic links and relative paths.
* Restrict file system access to specific directories using whitelisting or sandboxing.
