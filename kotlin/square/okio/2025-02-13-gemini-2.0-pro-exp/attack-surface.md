# Attack Surface Analysis for square/okio

## Attack Surface: [Untrusted Input Source Exploitation (via Okio's Read Operations)](./attack_surfaces/untrusted_input_source_exploitation__via_okio's_read_operations_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers provide malicious data through input sources (network, files, etc.) that Okio *reads*. The vulnerability lies in how the application *using* Okio handles this potentially malicious input *after* Okio has read it. Okio is the direct conduit for the malicious data.
*   **How Okio Contributes:** Okio's `Source` and `BufferedSource` interfaces are the *direct* mechanisms used to read the attacker-controlled data. Okio's buffering, while efficient, can be leveraged by attackers to send large payloads if the application doesn't implement proper limits.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a specially crafted, extremely long stream of data to an application. The application uses Okio's `BufferedSource.readUtf8()` to read the stream without checking the length *before* or *during* the read operation. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) due to excessive memory allocation.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Remote Code Execution (RCE) (if the input triggers vulnerabilities in subsequent processing), Data Corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical/High (depending on the application's subsequent handling of the input).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation (Pre and Post Okio):** Implement strict input validation *before* passing data to Okio (if possible, e.g., checking content type headers) and *immediately after* reading it using Okio. Validate length, content type, format, and expected values.
    *   **Size Limits (Using Okio):** Enforce maximum input sizes *using Okio's capabilities*. Use methods like `BufferedSource.readByteArray(maxSize)` or `BufferedSource.readByteString(maxSize)` to limit the amount of data read at once.  This is a *direct* Okio-based mitigation.
    *   **Timeouts (Using Okio):** Use Okio's `Timeout` class to set deadlines for read operations.  This prevents indefinite blocking on malicious input, a direct Okio-level defense.  `source.timeout().timeout(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)` is a concrete example.
    *   **Resource Limits (System-Level):** Configure overall resource limits (memory) for the application, but this is *indirect* to Okio.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Okio's Output Operations](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_okio's_output_operations.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate file paths used by Okio for *writing* data, attempting to write to unauthorized locations on the file system. Okio is the direct mechanism for writing to the manipulated path.
*   **How Okio Contributes:** Okio's `Sink` and `BufferedSink` interfaces are the *direct* mechanisms used to write data to files. If the application constructs file paths based on untrusted input, Okio becomes the tool for executing the path traversal.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to specify a filename for saving data.  An attacker provides a filename like `../../etc/passwd`. The application, without sanitization, uses `FileSystem.SYSTEM.sink(File(maliciousPath))` (Okio's API) to create a `Sink` and write to that location.
*   **Impact:** Data Corruption, System Compromise, Privilege Escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High/Critical (depending on the target file and system configuration).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Path Sanitization:** Never construct file paths directly from user input. Sanitize any user-provided components rigorously, removing ".." sequences and other path traversal attempts. This is done *before* using Okio.
    *   **Whitelisting:** Use a whitelist of allowed directories and filenames, rejecting any input that doesn't match. This is done *before* using Okio.
    *   **Secure Base Directory:** Confine file writing operations to a designated, secure base directory with appropriate permissions. This is configured *before* using Okio.
    *   **File System Permissions (System-Level):** Ensure the application runs with least privileges. This is *indirect* to Okio.

## Attack Surface: [Network Redirection/Injection via Okio's Network Operations](./attack_surfaces/network_redirectioninjection_via_okio's_network_operations.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers influence network destinations or inject data into network streams managed by Okio. Okio is the direct mechanism for establishing and using the network connection.
*   **How Okio Contributes:** Okio provides `Source` and `Sink` implementations for network sockets (typically through `Okio.source(socket)` and `Okio.sink(socket)`). If the application uses user-supplied data to determine the destination address or port *before* creating the socket, Okio becomes the tool for the redirection.
*   **Example:** An application uses Okio to connect to a server. The server address is read from a configuration file that an attacker can modify. The attacker changes the address to point to a malicious server. The application then uses `Okio.sink(socket)` to send data to the attacker-controlled server.
*   **Impact:** Data Interception, Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks, Data Injection, System Compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High/Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the data).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Hardcoded Endpoints:** Use hardcoded server addresses and ports whenever possible. This is done *before* using Okio.
    *   **Secure Configuration:** If endpoints must be configurable, store them securely and validate their integrity *before* using Okio.
    *   **Certificate Pinning:** Implement certificate pinning or other strong authentication mechanisms to verify the server's identity *before* sending data via Okio.
    *   **TLS/SSL:** Always use TLS/SSL for network communication. This is typically configured on the `Socket` *before* passing it to Okio.
