# Threat Model Analysis for square/okio

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Unbounded Input Stream](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_unbounded_input_stream.md)

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion via Unbounded Input Stream

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends an extremely large or infinite stream of data to an application endpoint that uses Okio to read the data without any size limits. The attacker could craft a malicious HTTP request, a specially designed file, or manipulate a network connection to achieve this. Okio, without proper safeguards, will continue to buffer the input.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). The application consumes all available memory or other system resources (CPU, file descriptors), becoming unresponsive or crashing.  Other applications on the same system may also be affected.
    *   **Okio Component Affected:** `BufferedSource`, specifically methods like `readByteString()`, `readUtf8()`, `readAll()`, and any method that reads data without an explicit size limit.  Also affects any custom `Source` implementations that don't handle large inputs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical if it's a core service)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation *before* passing data to Okio.  Reject requests that exceed a predefined maximum size.  This is crucial, as Okio itself doesn't enforce limits.
        *   **Size Limits:** Use `BufferedSource.require(long)` to ensure that sufficient data is available *before* attempting to read a large chunk.  Set a reasonable maximum size for `require()`. This acts as a gatekeeper.
        *   **Timeouts:** Use `Timeout` to set deadlines for read operations.  If a read operation takes too long, it will be aborted, preventing the attacker from holding resources indefinitely. This is a core Okio feature for preventing hangs.
        *   **Streaming Processing:** If possible, process the input stream incrementally instead of reading the entire input into memory at once.  Use Okio's `BufferedSource` to read data in smaller chunks and process each chunk individually. This leverages Okio's buffering for efficiency without loading everything.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting at the application or network level (though this is *outside* Okio) to prevent attackers from sending excessive amounts of data.

## Threat: [Decompression Bomb (Zip Bomb)](./threats/decompression_bomb__zip_bomb_.md)

*   **Threat:** Decompression Bomb (Zip Bomb)

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a highly compressed file (e.g., a "zip bomb") to an application that uses Okio and a decompression library (like `GzipSource`) to decompress the data. The compressed file is small, but it expands to a massive size when decompressed. Okio, as the underlying I/O layer, facilitates the rapid processing of the compressed data, exacerbating the attack.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). The application consumes excessive memory and CPU during decompression, leading to unresponsiveness or crashes.
    *   **Okio Component Affected:** `GzipSource` (and potentially other `Source` implementations that wrap decompression libraries). This is a direct threat because Okio provides the `GzipSource`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Specialized Decompression Libraries:** Use a decompression library specifically designed to handle malicious input securely.  These libraries often have built-in limits on the expansion ratio and memory usage. This is *in addition* to using Okio.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate the compressed file's metadata (if available) before decompression to estimate the uncompressed size.  Reject files that are likely to be decompression bombs.
        *   **Size Limits:**  Monitor the amount of data read from the `GzipSource` and set a limit on the total amount of uncompressed data that can be produced. This leverages Okio's ability to track bytes read.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor memory and CPU usage during decompression.  If resource usage exceeds predefined thresholds, terminate the decompression process.

## Threat: [Data Corruption due to Concurrent Buffer Access](./threats/data_corruption_due_to_concurrent_buffer_access.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Corruption due to Concurrent Buffer Access

    *   **Description:** Multiple threads in the application access the same `okio.Buffer` instance concurrently without proper synchronization (locks, mutexes, etc.). One thread might be writing to the buffer while another thread is reading from it, or multiple threads might be writing simultaneously.  This is a direct threat because `okio.Buffer` is *not* thread-safe by design.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unpredictable application behavior, crashes. The data in the buffer becomes inconsistent, leading to incorrect processing and potentially security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Okio Component Affected:** `okio.Buffer`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Sharing:**  The best approach is to avoid sharing `Buffer` instances between threads.  If possible, create a separate `Buffer` for each thread. This is the primary recommendation.
        *   **Synchronization:** If sharing is unavoidable, use appropriate synchronization primitives (e.g., locks, mutexes) to protect access to the `Buffer`.  Ensure that all read and write operations are properly synchronized.
        *   **Thread-Safe Alternatives:** Consider using thread-safe alternatives if available in your programming environment.
        *   **Immutability:** If possible, create immutable copies of the `Buffer`'s contents before passing them to other threads. This avoids the need for synchronization.
