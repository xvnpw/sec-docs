# Attack Surface Analysis for square/workflow-kotlin

## Attack Surface: [Workflow Definition Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/workflow_definition_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the process of deserializing workflow definitions, potentially leading to remote code execution.
*   **How Workflow-Kotlin Contributes:** If workflow definitions are serialized (e.g., for persistence or transfer) using insecure methods, malicious payloads can be embedded and executed upon deserialization. Workflow-Kotlin's reliance on Kotlin's serialization mechanisms can inherit their vulnerabilities if not used carefully.
*   **Example:** An attacker modifies a serialized workflow definition stored in a database, injecting malicious code. When the application loads this workflow, the injected code executes.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Remote code execution, full system compromise, data breach.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid deserializing workflow definitions from untrusted sources.
    *   Use secure serialization libraries and configurations that prevent arbitrary code execution during deserialization.
    *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., signatures, checksums) on serialized workflow definitions to detect tampering.

## Attack Surface: [State Management Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/state_management_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate the state of running workflows to alter their behavior, bypass security checks, or cause denial of service.
*   **How Workflow-Kotlin Contributes:** Workflow-Kotlin manages and persists workflow state. If access to or modification of this state is not properly controlled, attackers could potentially inject malicious state data.
*   **Example:** An attacker directly modifies the persisted state of a workflow to bypass an authorization step, granting them unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** High - Unauthorized access, data manipulation, disruption of application logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the storage and access mechanisms for workflow state.
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization controls for accessing and modifying workflow state.
    *   Validate state transitions and data integrity before applying state changes.
    *   Consider using immutable state management patterns where applicable.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Steps and Side Effects](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_steps_and_side_effects.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws in custom `Step` implementations or `SideEffect` implementations can introduce arbitrary code execution or other vulnerabilities.
*   **How Workflow-Kotlin Contributes:** Workflow-Kotlin allows developers to create custom steps and side effects, which can execute arbitrary code. If these implementations are not carefully reviewed and secured, they can become attack vectors.
*   **Example:** A custom step makes an insecure API call, exposing sensitive data. Or a custom side effect executes arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Impact:** High - Remote code execution, data breach, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and audit all custom step and side effect implementations for security vulnerabilities.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom steps and side effects.
    *   Implement principle of least privilege for custom step execution.
    *   Consider using static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in custom code.
