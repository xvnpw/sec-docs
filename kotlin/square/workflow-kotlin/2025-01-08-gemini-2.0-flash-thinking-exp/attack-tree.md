## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Workflow Logic Flaws [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_workflow_logic_flaws__critical_node_.md)

*   This node represents the core vulnerability of manipulating the intended behavior of the workflow. Success here can lead to a wide range of attacks.

    *   **High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Workflow Definition [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Exploiting Insecure Input Validation on Workflow Definition: An attacker provides a crafted workflow definition that exploits weaknesses in how the application parses or validates workflow definitions. This could involve injecting malicious code or logic directly into the workflow structure.
            *   Supplying a Workflow with Malicious Steps/Logic: An attacker provides a seemingly valid workflow definition that contains steps designed to perform malicious actions once executed. This could include steps that access sensitive files, make unauthorized API calls, or manipulate data in unintended ways.

    *   **High-Risk Path: Exploit Side Effects of Workflow Execution [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Triggering Actions with Malicious Intent: An attacker manipulates the workflow execution flow or data to trigger legitimate workflow actions in a way that achieves a malicious goal. This could involve actions like sending unauthorized notifications, modifying data based on manipulated input, or triggering external processes with harmful parameters.
            *   **High-Risk Path: Abuse Interactions with Backing Services [CRITICAL NODE]**
                *   **Attack Vectors:**
                    *   Inject Malicious Data into Backing Service Calls: An attacker manipulates data within the workflow to inject malicious payloads into calls made to external or internal backing services. This is similar to SQL injection or command injection, but within the context of the workflow's interaction with other systems.
                    *   Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses in Backing Service Interactions: An attacker exploits flaws in how the workflow authenticates or authorizes its requests to backing services. This could involve bypassing authentication checks, impersonating authorized users, or exploiting overly permissive access controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Manipulate Workflow State [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__manipulate_workflow_state__critical_node_.md)

*   This node highlights the risk of attackers gaining unauthorized access to or control over the workflow's internal state, which can lead to bypassing intended logic and data manipulation.

    *   **High-Risk Path: Direct State Modification**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Exploiting Insecure State Persistence/Storage: An attacker directly accesses and modifies the workflow's state data if it is stored insecurely. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the storage mechanism (e.g., lack of encryption, weak access controls on the storage).
            *   Bypassing Access Controls on State Data: An attacker circumvents access controls intended to protect the workflow's state, allowing them to read or modify it without proper authorization. This could be due to flaws in the access control implementation or misconfigurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Rendering/Event Handling Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_renderingevent_handling_mechanisms.md)

*   This area focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the workflow interacts with the user interface or handles external events.

    *   **High-Risk Path: Inject Scripting Code via Rendered Output (e.g., XSS if rendering to web)**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   If the workflow's state or data is rendered in a web context, an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the rendered output. This typically occurs when user-provided data is not properly sanitized or escaped before being displayed. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or further compromise of the user's system.
