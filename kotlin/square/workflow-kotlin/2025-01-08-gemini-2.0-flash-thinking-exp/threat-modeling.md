# Threat Model Analysis for square/workflow-kotlin

## Threat: [Workflow State Corruption](./threats/workflow_state_corruption.md)

**Threat:** Workflow State Corruption
    * **Description:**
        * **Attacker Action:** An attacker could attempt to manipulate the persisted or in-memory state of a running workflow. This might involve directly modifying the data store where the state is held or exploiting vulnerabilities in how the state is serialized/deserialized *by `workflow-kotlin`*.
        * **How:** Exploiting insecure state management practices *within `workflow-kotlin`*, intercepting and altering state data handled *by `workflow-kotlin`*, or injecting malicious data that, when deserialized *by `workflow-kotlin`*, corrupts the state.
    * **Impact:**
        * The workflow could enter an invalid or unintended state, leading to incorrect business logic execution, data inconsistencies, or security breaches. Sensitive data within the workflow state could be exposed or modified.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * Workflow State Management (within the `Workflow` class and its associated state holders, specifically how `workflow-kotlin` manages state).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use secure serialization and deserialization mechanisms provided or recommended by `workflow-kotlin`.
        * Encrypt sensitive data within the workflow state at rest and in transit *within the `workflow-kotlin` context*.
        * Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums, digital signatures) on the workflow state *managed by `workflow-kotlin`*.
        * Carefully manage access controls to the state data store used *by `workflow-kotlin`*.
        * Consider using immutable data structures for state within your workflows.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of External Interactions within Workflows](./threats/insecure_handling_of_external_interactions_within_workflows.md)

**Threat:** Insecure Handling of External Interactions within Workflows
    * **Description:**
        * **Attacker Action:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in how a workflow, *orchestrated by `workflow-kotlin`*, interacts with external systems (e.g., APIs, databases). This could involve injecting malicious data into requests, intercepting responses, or exploiting insecure authentication mechanisms *within the workflow's external calls*.
        * **How:** Manipulating data sent to external APIs *from within a `workflow-kotlin` workflow*, exploiting missing input validation before external calls *made by the workflow*, or compromising stored credentials used for external authentication *managed by the workflow*.
    * **Impact:**
        * Data breaches in external systems, unauthorized actions performed on external systems, or denial of service of external services.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * Workflow steps that initiate external calls (using `Worker` or direct API calls within workflows defined using `workflow-kotlin` primitives).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization before making external calls *from within workflows*.
        * Use secure communication protocols (HTTPS) for all external interactions *initiated by workflows*.
        * Securely manage API keys and other credentials used for external authentication *within the context of workflow execution* (e.g., using a secrets management system).
        * Implement proper error handling for external calls to avoid leaking sensitive information *through workflow execution*.

## Threat: [Logic Bugs Leading to Authorization Bypass within Workflows](./threats/logic_bugs_leading_to_authorization_bypass_within_workflows.md)

**Threat:** Logic Bugs Leading to Authorization Bypass within Workflows
    * **Description:**
        * **Attacker Action:** An attacker could exploit flaws in the workflow's logic, *defined using `workflow-kotlin` constructs*, to bypass intended authorization checks and gain access to resources or perform actions they are not authorized for.
        * **How:** Finding conditional branches or state transitions *within the `workflow-kotlin` workflow definition* that can be manipulated to skip authorization steps.
    * **Impact:**
        * Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * Workflow definition and logic itself (`Workflow` class, state transitions, conditional logic defined using `workflow-kotlin` APIs).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully design and review authorization logic within workflows *implemented using `workflow-kotlin`*.
        * Implement explicit authorization checks at critical points in the workflow *logic*.
        * Use formal verification techniques or thorough testing to identify potential logic flaws in your workflow definitions.
        * Follow the principle of least privilege when designing workflow steps and access controls.
