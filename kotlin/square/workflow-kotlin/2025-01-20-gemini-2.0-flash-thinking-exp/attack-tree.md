## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Workflow Definitions](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_workflow_definitions.md)

**High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Workflow Definitions:**
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies a location where workflow definitions are stored (e.g., a database, file system). If they can gain write access to this location, they can modify existing workflow definitions or inject entirely new ones containing malicious logic. This malicious logic could perform actions like executing arbitrary code on the server, accessing or modifying sensitive data, or disrupting application functionality.
*   **Critical Node: Gain Write Access to the External Source:** This is the crucial step that enables the injection of malicious workflows. Without write access, the attacker cannot directly manipulate the workflow definitions. Exploiting vulnerabilities in the storage system's access controls or authentication mechanisms is the primary way to achieve this.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Workflow Definitions](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_workflow_definitions.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Workflow Definitions:**
*   **Attack Vector:** If workflow definitions are serialized (converted into a byte stream for storage or transmission), and a vulnerable deserialization library is used without proper safeguards, an attacker can craft a malicious serialized payload. When this payload is deserialized by the application, it can lead to arbitrary code execution. This is because the deserialization process can instantiate objects and execute code defined within the serialized data.
*   **Critical Node: Identify Vulnerable Deserialization Library or Configuration:** Identifying the specific deserialization library being used and any known vulnerabilities associated with it is a key step for the attacker. Misconfigurations or the use of outdated, vulnerable libraries are common targets.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Logic into Steps (If Dynamically Loaded/Executed)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_logic_into_steps__if_dynamically_loadedexecuted_.md)

**Potential High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Logic into Steps (If Dynamically Loaded/Executed):**
*   **Attack Vector:** If the workflow engine allows for dynamically loading or executing code as part of a workflow step (e.g., through plugins or scripting), an attacker might try to inject malicious code into this process. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in how the code is loaded, validated, or executed. Successful injection allows the attacker to run arbitrary code within the context of the workflow engine.
*   **Critical Node: Identify Vulnerabilities in the Loading or Execution Process of Dynamic Steps:**  The attacker needs to find weaknesses in how the application handles the dynamic loading and execution of step logic. This could involve path traversal vulnerabilities, insufficient input validation, or insecure plugin mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Content via Workflow Rendered UI](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_content_via_workflow_rendered_ui.md)

**Potential High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Content via Workflow Rendered UI:**
*   **Attack Vector:** If the application renders user interface elements based on data derived from the workflow state, and this data is not properly sanitized or encoded, an attacker can inject malicious content (like JavaScript or HTML). This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where the attacker's script executes in the victim's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Vulnerabilities in Libraries Used by Workflow-Kotlin](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_vulnerabilities_in_libraries_used_by_workflow-kotlin.md)

**Potential High-Risk Path: Leverage Vulnerabilities in Libraries Used by Workflow-Kotlin:**
*   **Attack Vector:**  `workflow-kotlin`, like most software, relies on external libraries. If these libraries have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit them in the context of the application. This often involves finding a way to trigger the vulnerable code path within the dependency through the application's functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Workflow State Data](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_workflow_state_data.md)

**Potential High-Risk Path: Access Sensitive Workflow State Data:**
*   **Attack Vector:**  Workflow state often contains sensitive information. If the storage or transmission mechanisms for this state are not adequately secured (e.g., weak access controls, lack of encryption), an attacker might be able to gain unauthorized access to this data, leading to confidentiality breaches.
