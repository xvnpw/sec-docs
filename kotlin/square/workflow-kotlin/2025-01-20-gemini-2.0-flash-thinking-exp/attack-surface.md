# Attack Surface Analysis for square/workflow-kotlin

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Workflow Injection/Modification](./attack_surfaces/malicious_workflow_injectionmodification.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects or modifies workflow definitions to execute arbitrary code or perform unauthorized actions within the application's context.
    *   **How Workflow-Kotlin Contributes:** If the application allows external sources (e.g., user input, external files, network sources) to define or modify workflows, the `workflow-kotlin` engine will interpret and execute these potentially malicious definitions.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a workflow definition that includes a step executing a shell command to access sensitive files on the server. The application loads and executes this workflow.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data breach, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls on workflow definition sources.
        *   Sanitize and validate any external input used in workflow definitions.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed environment for workflow execution.
        *   Employ code review processes for workflow definitions.
        *   Digitally sign workflow definitions to ensure integrity.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Workflow State](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_workflow_state.md)

*   **Description:** If workflow state is serialized and persisted (e.g., for resuming workflows after interruptions), vulnerabilities in the deserialization process can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
    *   **How Workflow-Kotlin Contributes:** `workflow-kotlin` might use serialization mechanisms to persist the state of running workflows. If these mechanisms are vulnerable, attackers can craft malicious serialized data.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts and modifies the serialized state of a paused workflow, injecting a malicious object. When the workflow is resumed, the malicious object is deserialized, leading to code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid serializing sensitive data in workflow state if possible.
        *   Use secure serialization libraries and keep them updated.
        *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., HMAC) on serialized data to detect tampering.
        *   Encrypt serialized data at rest and in transit.

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated Input to Workflow Steps/Workers](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_input_to_workflow_stepsworkers.md)

*   **Description:** Data from external sources is passed directly as input to workflow steps or workers without proper validation and sanitization, leading to vulnerabilities within those components.
    *   **How Workflow-Kotlin Contributes:** Workflows often interact with external systems through workers. If the data passed from the workflow to the worker is not validated, it can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A workflow takes user input for a file path and passes it to a worker that reads the file. An attacker provides a path like `/etc/passwd`, leading to unauthorized file access.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, command injection, SQL injection (if workers interact with databases).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all data entering workflow steps and workers.
        *   Use parameterized queries or ORM frameworks to prevent SQL injection in database interactions within workers.
        *   Avoid constructing shell commands directly from user input within workers. If necessary, use secure command execution methods.
        *   Implement proper authorization checks within workers to ensure they only access resources they are permitted to.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Worker Implementations](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_worker_implementations.md)

*   **Description:** Workers, responsible for interacting with external systems, contain security vulnerabilities due to insecure coding practices.
    *   **How Workflow-Kotlin Contributes:** `workflow-kotlin` relies on workers to perform actions outside the workflow engine. Vulnerabilities in these workers directly expose the application.
    *   **Example:** A worker making an HTTP request to an external API doesn't properly validate the URL, allowing an attacker to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
    *   **Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), command injection, access to internal resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing workers.
        *   Regularly review and audit worker code for vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege for worker permissions.
        *   Use secure libraries and APIs for interacting with external systems.
