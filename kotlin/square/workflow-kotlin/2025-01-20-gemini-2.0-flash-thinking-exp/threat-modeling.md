# Threat Model Analysis for square/workflow-kotlin

## Threat: [Workflow Definition Tampering](./threats/workflow_definition_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to modify the source code or configuration files that define workflows. This could involve altering the sequence of steps, introducing malicious steps, or changing the logic of existing steps *within the `workflow-kotlin` defined structure*.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of unintended or malicious logic *within the workflow*, bypassing security checks implemented in the workflow, data manipulation performed by the workflow, denial of service by introducing infinite loops or resource-intensive operations *within the workflow execution*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Workflow Definition Files (e.g., `.kt` files containing `Workflow` implementations).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strict access controls on workflow definition files and repositories. Utilize code signing or integrity checks for workflow definitions. Secure the build and deployment pipeline to prevent unauthorized modifications. Employ version control and audit logs for changes to workflow definitions.

## Threat: [Workflow State Manipulation](./threats/workflow_state_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to modify the internal state of a running workflow instance. This could involve changing variables, skipping steps, or altering the data being processed by the workflow *as managed by `workflow-kotlin`*.
    *   **Impact:** Altering the intended flow of the workflow, leading to incorrect outcomes dictated by the workflow logic, data corruption within the workflow's scope, or the execution of privileged operations *as defined within the workflow* under false pretenses.
    *   **Affected Component:** Workflow State Management Mechanism (how the `State` of a `Workflow` is stored and managed *by `workflow-kotlin`*, including any persistence mechanisms it facilitates).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Encrypt sensitive workflow state when persisted or transmitted. Implement integrity checks to detect unauthorized modifications to the state. Carefully design state management to minimize the impact of potential tampering. Avoid storing highly sensitive information directly in the workflow state if possible.

## Threat: [Malicious Step Implementation](./threats/malicious_step_implementation.md)

*   **Description:** A developer or attacker introduces a `Step` implementation that contains malicious code. This code could perform unauthorized actions *within the context of the workflow*, such as accessing sensitive data managed by the workflow, interacting with external systems in an unintended way *initiated by the step*, or causing a denial of service *by consuming resources during step execution*.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code within the application's context *triggered by the workflow step*, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Step` interface and its implementations within a `Workflow`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement rigorous code review processes for all `Step` implementations. Restrict the use of external or untrusted `Step` libraries. Employ static analysis security testing (SAST) tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in `Step` code. Enforce the principle of least privilege for `Step` implementations.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Workflow Execution](./threats/denial_of_service_through_workflow_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker triggers the execution of workflows in a way that consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory) *managed by the `workflow-kotlin` execution engine*, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users. This could involve triggering workflows with a large number of steps or workflows with computationally expensive steps *defined within the `workflow-kotlin` structure*.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation, and potential financial losses due to service disruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** Workflow Execution Engine (the part of the application responsible for running workflows *using `workflow-kotlin`*).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement rate limiting on workflow initiation. Monitor resource consumption of running workflows. Design workflows to be efficient and avoid unnecessary resource usage. Implement circuit breakers for interactions with external systems to prevent cascading failures.

## Threat: [Injection Vulnerabilities in Renderings](./threats/injection_vulnerabilities_in_renderings.md)

*   **Description:** If workflow renderings directly incorporate user-provided data without proper sanitization or escaping, they could be susceptible to injection attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) if rendering targets web UIs. This vulnerability arises from how the *`workflow-kotlin` rendering mechanism* handles data.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of malicious scripts in the user's browser (XSS), potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
    *   **Affected Component:** Workflow Rendering Mechanism (how the `Workflow`'s state is transformed into UI updates *by `workflow-kotlin`*).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if targeting web UIs).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Always sanitize or escape user-provided data before incorporating it into renderings. Utilize UI frameworks that provide built-in protection against injection vulnerabilities. Follow secure coding practices for UI development.
