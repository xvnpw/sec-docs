# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, 'workflow-kotlin', is a Kotlin library designed to simplify the development of applications that require complex state management and orchestration. It aims to provide a robust and developer-friendly framework for building and managing workflows within Kotlin applications.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Simplify development of stateful applications.
  - Improve code maintainability and readability for complex workflows.
  - Enhance developer productivity by providing a reusable workflow framework.
  - Enable building resilient and scalable applications through workflow management.
  - Foster adoption of Kotlin for building complex backend systems.

- Business Risks:
  - Adoption Risk: Developers may not adopt the library if it is perceived as too complex, poorly documented, or lacking in features.
  - Maintenance Burden:  Maintaining the library and ensuring its compatibility with evolving Kotlin and related technologies requires ongoing effort.
  - Security Vulnerabilities:  Vulnerabilities in the library could be inherited by all applications that use it, posing a widespread risk.
  - Performance Issues: Inefficient workflow implementations within the library could lead to performance bottlenecks in applications.
  - Community Support Risk: Reliance on open-source community for support and contributions can be unpredictable.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Code Reviews - Implemented through GitHub pull requests and contributions review process. (Location: GitHub repository contribution guidelines and pull request process)
  - security control: Unit Tests -  Extensive unit tests are present in the repository to ensure code correctness and prevent regressions. (Location: 'workflow-kotlin' repository test directories)
  - security control: Open Source License (Apache 2.0) - Allows for community scrutiny and contributions, potentially leading to faster identification and resolution of security issues. (Location: LICENSE file in the repository)

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Third-party Dependencies - The library relies on external Kotlin and Java libraries, which may contain vulnerabilities. Risk is mitigated by dependency management and updates.
  - accepted risk: Community Contributions - Security of contributions from the community relies on the code review process. Potential risk of malicious or vulnerable code being introduced.
  - accepted risk: Lack of Dedicated Security Team - As an open-source project, there might not be a dedicated security team continuously monitoring for vulnerabilities. Reliance on community and maintainers.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Automated Dependency Scanning - Implement automated scanning of dependencies for known vulnerabilities as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential security flaws in the code.
  - security control: Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits of the codebase by external security experts.
  - security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Policy - Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy to allow security researchers to report issues responsibly.
  - security control: Security Documentation - Provide clear security guidelines for developers using the library, including best practices for secure workflow implementation.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a library. Authentication is the responsibility of the applications using the library.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a library. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications using the library. However, the library should provide mechanisms to implement authorization within workflows if needed by the application.
  - Input Validation: The library's API should perform robust input validation to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities when applications interact with it. This is crucial for public functions and workflow definitions.
  - Cryptography: If the library handles sensitive data or requires secure communication within workflows, it should provide secure cryptographic functionalities or guidance on using external cryptography libraries securely.  Ensure proper key management practices if cryptography is used.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - The critical business processes are those implemented by applications that utilize the 'workflow-kotlin' library. The library itself is an enabling component, and its failure or compromise could impact any application depending on it. The criticality depends on the specific applications and their business functions.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - The 'workflow-kotlin' library itself does not directly handle business data. However, applications built with it will process and manage data. The sensitivity of data depends entirely on the applications using the library. It could range from publicly available information to highly sensitive personal or financial data, depending on the application's purpose. The library should be designed to facilitate secure data handling by applications, but the responsibility for data security ultimately lies with the application developers.
