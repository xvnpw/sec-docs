# Attack Surface Analysis for square/workflow-kotlin

## Attack Surface: [State Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/state_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Workflow state is serialized for persistence and deserialized when workflows are resumed. Vulnerabilities in the deserialization process can lead to code execution or denial of service.
*   **Workflow-Kotlin Contribution:** `workflow-kotlin` manages workflow state serialization and deserialization internally. While Kotlin serialization is generally safer, misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in custom serialization logic (if used within `workflow-kotlin` context or extensions) can introduce risks. The library's state management directly relies on deserialization.
*   **Example:** A custom serialization mechanism is incorrectly configured within a `workflow-kotlin` application, making it vulnerable to deserialization attacks. An attacker crafts a malicious serialized state payload that, when deserialized by `workflow-kotlin`, executes arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Secure Serialization Libraries:** Rely on well-vetted and secure serialization libraries (like Kotlin Serialization as intended by `workflow-kotlin`). Avoid custom, potentially vulnerable serialization implementations within the workflow context.
    *   **Input Validation on Deserialized Data:**  Validate the integrity and expected structure of deserialized workflow state before using it in workflow logic. While `workflow-kotlin` handles this internally to some extent, ensure custom state handling or extensions also incorporate validation.
    *   **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep `workflow-kotlin` and its serialization library dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Consider Signed Serialization:** Implement mechanisms to sign serialized state to ensure integrity and prevent tampering, especially if custom state handling is involved.

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection via Worker Inputs/Outputs](./attack_surfaces/data_injection_via_worker_inputsoutputs.md)

*   **Description:** Workers interact with workflows by exchanging data. If worker inputs or outputs are not properly validated and sanitized, malicious data can be injected, leading to various attacks.
*   **Workflow-Kotlin Contribution:** `workflow-kotlin` workflows heavily rely on Workers for external interactions. The data flow *orchestrated by the workflow framework* between workflows and workers is a critical point where vulnerabilities can be introduced if not handled securely.  `workflow-kotlin`'s design necessitates this worker interaction, making it a key contributor to this attack surface in workflow-based applications.
*   **Example:** A worker receives user-provided input as part of its `doWork` function and passes it back to the workflow without sanitization. The workflow then uses this unsanitized data to construct a database query, leading to SQL injection. The workflow framework facilitates this data flow and potential vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, Command Injection, business logic bypass, data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data received by workers (inputs) and data passed back to workflows (outputs). Apply context-appropriate encoding and escaping *at the worker level and within workflow logic that processes worker results*.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Workers:** Grant workers only the necessary permissions to access external resources. Avoid running workers with overly broad privileges. This limits the impact if a worker is compromised or misused through data injection.
    *   **Secure Communication Channels:** If workers communicate over a network, use secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL) to protect data in transit. This is relevant if `workflow-kotlin` is used in a distributed worker setup.
    *   **Output Encoding:** Encode worker outputs appropriately before using them in contexts where they could be interpreted as code (e.g., in web pages, database queries, system commands) *within the workflow logic*.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Workflow State Persistence](./attack_surfaces/insecure_workflow_state_persistence.md)

*   **Description:** Workflow state, potentially containing sensitive data, is stored in a persistent storage. If this storage is not properly secured, it becomes an attack surface.
*   **Workflow-Kotlin Contribution:** `workflow-kotlin` inherently relies on state persistence to manage long-running workflows. The library's core functionality *mandates* state persistence, making the security of this storage a direct and critical concern for applications built with it.
*   **Example:** Workflow state is stored in a database with default credentials or without proper access controls. An attacker gains access to the database and reads sensitive user data stored within workflow states managed by `workflow-kotlin`.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, confidentiality violation, potential data manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Storage Configuration:** Implement strong access controls, authentication, and authorization for the state persistence layer (database, file system, etc.).
    *   **Encryption at Rest:** Encrypt workflow state data when it is stored persistently.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically audit the security configuration of the state persistence layer.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to services and users accessing the state persistence layer. Ensure `workflow-kotlin` runtime environment also adheres to least privilege.
