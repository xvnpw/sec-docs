# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for square/workflow-kotlin

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for State (Workflow-Kotlin Focused)](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_state__workflow-kotlin_focused_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize `State` Scope:** Create separate `data class`es for the `State` of *each* `Workflow` and sub-`Workflow`. Avoid a single, large state object. Each `State` class should *only* contain data absolutely necessary for that specific workflow.
    2.  **Visibility Modifiers within `Workflow`:** Use Kotlin's visibility modifiers (`private`, `internal`, `protected`) within your `Workflow` and `State` classes. Restrict access to state properties. Only expose what is absolutely necessary. Avoid `public` for state properties unless strictly required for rendering (and even then, prefer a separate `RenderingT`).
    3.  **Careful `RenderingT` Design:** Review all `RenderingT` types. If a `RenderingT` directly includes sensitive state, create a separate DTO (Data Transfer Object). This DTO should contain *only* the data needed for display, transforming the internal `State` into a safe-to-expose representation.
    4.  **Controlled Event Propagation:** Define custom, strongly-typed event classes (e.g., `data class UserLoggedIn(val userId: String)`). Avoid generic event types. In the `Workflow`'s `onAction`, only emit events that are necessary. Be explicit about which workflows subscribe to which events using the `Workflow` APIs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintentional State Exposure / Leaks (Severity: High):** Reduces exposure through renderings, events, or direct access to the `Workflow`'s state.
    *   **Workflow Composition Vulnerabilities (Severity: Medium):** Limits state accessible to child `Workflow`s, reducing unintended interactions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unintentional State Exposure / Leaks:** Significant reduction.
    *   **Workflow Composition Vulnerabilities:** Moderate reduction.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Visibility modifiers used in `WorkflowA` and `WorkflowB` state.
    *   Separate DTOs for rendering in `WorkflowC`.
    *   Strongly-typed events for user authentication.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `WorkflowD` uses a large state object. Needs refactoring.
    *   `WorkflowE` exposes sensitive state in `RenderingT`. Needs a DTO.
    *   Generic events used between `WorkflowF` and `WorkflowG`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Isolate Side Effects with `Worker`s](./mitigation_strategies/isolate_side_effects_with__worker_s.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Side Effects:** List all external interactions (databases, APIs, etc.).
    2.  **Create `Worker`s:** For *each* distinct side effect, create a separate `Worker` implementation. The `Worker` should encapsulate *only* that specific side effect.
    3.  **`Worker` Input Validation:** Treat the input to the `Worker` as untrusted. Implement rigorous input validation within the `Worker`'s `run` method to ensure the input conforms to expected types, ranges, and formats. Use Kotlin's type system.
    4. **Rate Limiting/Circuit Breakers (Using Workers):** While the *implementation* of rate limiting and circuit breakers might be external, the *decision* to apply them and the *integration* point is within the `Workflow` that uses the `Worker`.  You would use the `Worker` API to handle the results of these patterns (e.g., checking for a `Worker` result indicating a rate limit was hit).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Side Effect Mismanagement / Injection (Severity: High):** Isolates side effects, making them easier to audit and control.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Workflow Overload (Severity: Medium):** Rate limiting and circuit breakers, integrated *through* the `Worker` API, help.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Side Effect Mismanagement / Injection:** Significant reduction.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Moderate reduction.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Database interactions in `DatabaseWorker`.
    *   API calls to ServiceX in `ServiceXWorker`.
    *   Input validation in `ServiceXWorker`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `FileAccessWorker` lacks input validation.
    *   Rate limiting/circuit breakers not integrated for `ServiceXWorker` or `ServiceYWorker`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Well-Defined Workflow Contracts (Using `Workflow` APIs)](./mitigation_strategies/well-defined_workflow_contracts__using__workflow__apis_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Inputs/Outputs/Events:** For each `Workflow`, especially child workflows, clearly define:
        *   **Inputs:** Strongly-typed `data class`es for data received from the parent.
        *   **Outputs:** Strongly-typed `data class`es for data returned to the parent.
        *   **Events:** Strongly-typed event classes the child `Workflow` might emit.
    2.  **Limit Parent Access:** Avoid giving child `Workflow`s direct access to the parent `Workflow`'s state. Pass data explicitly through inputs and outputs.
    3.  **Review `compose` Method:** In the parent `Workflow`'s `compose` method, carefully review:
        *   How child `Workflow`s are instantiated and configured.
        *   How inputs are passed to child `Workflow`s.
        *   How outputs from child `Workflow`s are handled.
        *   How events from child `Workflow`s are handled.  Use the `Workflow`'s event handling mechanisms to manage subscriptions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Workflow Composition Vulnerabilities (Severity: Medium):** Reduces unintended interactions between parent and child `Workflow`s.
    *   **Unintentional State Exposure / Leaks (Severity: Medium):** Limits access to parent's state.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Workflow Composition Vulnerabilities:** Moderate reduction.
    *   **Unintentional State Exposure / Leaks:** Moderate reduction.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `WorkflowH` and `WorkflowI` have defined input/output classes.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `WorkflowK` lacks definitions, interacts with parent's state. Needs refactoring.
    *   `WorkflowL`'s `compose` method needs review.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Workflow Timeouts (Using `withTimeout` in `Workflow`)](./mitigation_strategies/workflow_timeouts__using__withtimeout__in__workflow__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Long-Running Workflows:** Analyze workflows for potential long-running operations.
    2.  **Implement Timeouts:** Use Kotlin coroutines' `withTimeout` or `withTimeoutOrNull` functions *within* the `Workflow`'s `compose` or `onAction` methods, especially when launching child workflows or `Worker`s. This ensures that the timeout is managed within the `workflow-kotlin` context.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Workflow Overload (Severity: Medium):** Prevents workflows from running indefinitely.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Significant reduction.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Timeouts for long-running workflows using `withTimeout`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Needs more comprehensive application across all potentially long-running workflows and workers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Idempotency within Workflows](./mitigation_strategies/idempotency_within_workflows.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Analyze Workflow Actions:** Examine each `Workflow`'s `onAction` method and any `Worker` interactions. Identify operations that modify external state (databases, APIs, etc.).
    2. **Design for Idempotency:**
        * **Conditional Updates:** Before performing an update, check if the update has already been applied. For example, if inserting a record into a database, check if a record with the same unique identifier already exists.
        * **Unique Request IDs:** If interacting with external APIs, include a unique request ID in each request. The API can then use this ID to detect and prevent duplicate processing.
        * **Use `Worker` Results:** Leverage the `Worker` API to check for successful completion of previous operations before retrying.
    3. **Test for Idempotency:** Write specific tests that repeatedly execute the same `Workflow` actions with the same inputs to verify that the outcome is consistent.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Replay Attacks / State Corruption (Severity: Medium):** Reduces the impact of replaying a workflow or restoring a previous state.

* **Impact:**
    * **Replay Attacks / State Corruption:** Moderately reduces the risk and impact.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * Partial idempotency implemented in `WorkflowM` for database updates.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * Needs a comprehensive review and implementation across all workflows that modify external state, particularly `WorkflowN` and interactions with `ServiceZWorker`.
