            *   Description: The attacker provides input that, when rendered, results in malicious output (e.g., XSS, UI manipulation). This exploits how the *application* uses the rendering, not a flaw in `workflow-kotlin` *per se*, but the library provides the mechanism.
            *   Likelihood: Medium to High
            *   Impact: Medium to High (Depends on the context of the rendering)
