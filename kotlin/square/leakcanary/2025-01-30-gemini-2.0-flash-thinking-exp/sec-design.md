# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Primary goal is to improve the quality and stability of Android applications by helping developers identify and fix memory leaks.
  - Secondary goal is to reduce development time and costs associated with debugging memory leaks.
  - Tertiary goal is to enhance user experience by preventing application crashes and performance issues caused by memory leaks.
- Business Risks:
  - Risk of undetected memory leaks in production applications leading to crashes, poor performance, and negative user reviews.
  - Risk of increased development time and costs if memory leaks are difficult to diagnose and fix without proper tooling.
  - Risk of reputational damage if applications are perceived as unstable or unreliable due to memory leaks.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: LeakCanary is designed to be used in debug builds only, minimizing its presence in production environments. Described in README and documentation.
  - security control: Source code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny. Public GitHub repository.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential exposure of debug information if debug builds with LeakCanary are accidentally distributed. Risk is mitigated by design to be used only in debug builds.
  - accepted risk: Dependency on third-party libraries and components, which may introduce vulnerabilities. Risk is mitigated by standard dependency management and updates.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning of dependencies to identify and address known vulnerabilities. Recommended for build process.
  - security control: Regularly review and update dependencies to incorporate security patches. Recommended for maintenance process.
  - security control: Provide clear guidelines and documentation to developers on the secure usage of LeakCanary, emphasizing its debug-only nature. Recommended for documentation.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable, LeakCanary is a library and does not require authentication.
  - Authorization: Not applicable, LeakCanary is a library and does not require authorization.
  - Input Validation: Not directly applicable to LeakCanary itself as it primarily analyzes application memory. However, the applications using LeakCanary should still adhere to input validation best practices.
  - Cryptography: Not directly applicable to LeakCanary as it does not handle sensitive data in transit or at rest. However, applications using LeakCanary might handle sensitive data and should use cryptography appropriately.

- Build Process Description:
  - Developer makes code changes and commits them to a Version Control System (e.g., GitHub).
  - A Build System (e.g., GitHub Actions, local Gradle build) is triggered by code changes or manually.
  - Dependency Management tool resolves and downloads project dependencies.
  - Compilation and Packaging tools compile the code and package it into build artifacts (e.g., JAR or AAR files for Android libraries).
  - Security Checks are performed, including dependency scanning for known vulnerabilities and code linters for potential security issues.
  - If security issues are found, the build process may be halted, and developers need to address the issues and iterate.
  - If no security issues are found, Build Artifacts are produced.
  - Build Artifacts are published to a Dependency Repository (e.g., Maven Central, Google Maven) for distribution.

- Build Security Controls:
  - security control: Version Control System (GitHub) for code integrity and change tracking. Implemented by GitHub.
  - security control: Build System (GitHub Actions/Local Gradle) for automated and repeatable builds. Implemented by GitHub Actions or local Gradle setup.
  - security control: Dependency Management (Gradle) for managing and resolving dependencies. Implemented by Gradle.
  - security control: Security Checks (Dependency Scanning) to identify vulnerable dependencies. Can be integrated into GitHub Actions or Gradle build.
  - security control: Security Checks (Code Linters) to identify potential code quality and security issues. Can be integrated into GitHub Actions or Gradle build.
  - security control: Code Review process before merging code changes to ensure code quality and security. Implemented by development team process.
  - security control: Secure publishing process to Dependency Repository, including signing artifacts. Implemented by publishing process and repository requirements.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes Protected:
  - Ensuring Android application stability and performance.
  - Reducing debugging time and costs for memory leaks.
  - Maintaining positive user experience and application reputation.
- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Heap Dumps: Contain snapshots of application memory, which may include sensitive data depending on the application (e.g., user data, API keys in memory). Sensitivity is high if application handles sensitive user data.
  - Leak Reports: Summaries of detected memory leaks, derived from heap dumps. Sensitivity is medium, as they may indirectly reveal application internals.
  - Source Code: Publicly available, but integrity and confidentiality are important for maintaining trust in the library. Sensitivity is medium to high.
  - Build Artifacts (JAR/AAR): Publicly distributed, integrity is critical to prevent supply chain attacks. Sensitivity is high.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements for projects using LeakCanary (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)?
  - Are there any specific types of sensitive data that applications using LeakCanary are expected to handle?
  - What is the typical risk appetite of organizations using LeakCanary (startup vs. Fortune 500)?
- Assumptions:
  - LeakCanary is primarily used by mobile application developers during the development and testing phases.
  - LeakCanary is intended for debug builds and should not be included in production builds.
  - Organizations using LeakCanary are concerned about application quality, stability, and user experience.
  - Security focus is on preventing accidental exposure of debug information and ensuring the integrity of the LeakCanary library itself.
  - Risk appetite can vary, but generally, all organizations benefit from improved application quality and reduced debugging efforts.
