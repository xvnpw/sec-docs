# Threat Model Analysis for square/leakcanary

## Threat: [Heap Dump Information Disclosure](./threats/heap_dump_information_disclosure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to heap dump files generated by LeakCanary. This could be achieved through physical device access, malware, or compromising developer environments.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data within heap dumps, including user credentials, PII, business secrets, and database connection strings. This can lead to account compromise, privacy violations, reputational damage, and financial loss.
*   **LeakCanary Component Affected:** HeapDumper, File Storage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly use LeakCanary in debug builds only.
    *   Store heap dumps in the application's internal storage.
    *   Enforce restrictive file permissions on heap dump files.
    *   Regularly delete old heap dumps.
    *   Secure developer environments.
    *   Minimize sensitive data in memory during debug builds.

## Threat: [Accidental LeakCanary Inclusion in Release Build](./threats/accidental_leakcanary_inclusion_in_release_build.md)

*   **Description:** Developers mistakenly include LeakCanary in the release build. This can occur due to incorrect build configuration, errors in build scripts, or insufficient release testing.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information disclosure in production through heap dumps on user devices.
    *   Performance degradation and battery drain for users due to LeakCanary's resource consumption.
    *   Increased attack surface in production due to unintended code inclusion.
*   **LeakCanary Component Affected:** Entire LeakCanary library.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize robust Gradle build configurations with `debugImplementation` for LeakCanary.
    *   Implement automated build and release pipelines.
    *   Thoroughly test release builds to verify LeakCanary exclusion.
    *   Conduct code reviews to check for accidental inclusion.
    *   Employ static analysis tools to detect LeakCanary in release builds.

## Threat: [Performance Denial of Service (Indirect)](./threats/performance_denial_of_service__indirect_.md)

*   **Description:** If LeakCanary is accidentally included in a release build, its continuous operation can consume significant device resources, leading to application slowdowns, unresponsiveness, and battery drain.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service for users, poor user experience, negative app reviews, and potential user churn due to performance issues.
*   **LeakCanary Component Affected:** ObjectWatcher, HeapDumper, AnalysisProcessor.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly use LeakCanary in debug builds only.
    *   Monitor user feedback and crash reports in release builds for performance issues that might indicate accidental LeakCanary inclusion.
