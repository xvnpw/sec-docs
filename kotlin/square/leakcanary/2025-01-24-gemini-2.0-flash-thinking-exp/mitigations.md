# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for square/leakcanary

## Mitigation Strategy: [Debug-Only `debugImplementation` Dependency for LeakCanary](./mitigation_strategies/debug-only__debugimplementation__dependency_for_leakcanary.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Open your module-level `build.gradle` file (e.g., `app/build.gradle`) in your Android project.**
    2.  **Locate the `dependencies` block.**
    3.  **Declare LeakCanary dependencies using the `debugImplementation` configuration.** This ensures LeakCanary is only included in debug builds and excluded from release builds. Example:
        ```gradle
        dependencies {
            debugImplementation("com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android:2.12") // Or latest version
            // ... other dependencies ...
        }
        ```
    4.  **Sync your Gradle project** to apply the changes.
    5.  **Verify by building a release APK/AAB and inspecting it.** Use APK Analyzer or similar tools to confirm that LeakCanary classes (packages starting with `leakcanary`) are *not* present in the release build.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure through LeakCanary Heap Dumps (High Severity):** Prevents LeakCanary from generating heap dumps containing potentially sensitive application data in production environments, eliminating the risk of exposure.
    *   **Performance Impact from LeakCanary in Production (Medium Severity):**  Avoids performance overhead caused by LeakCanary's heap analysis and dumping processes running in production, ensuring smooth application performance for users.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure through LeakCanary Heap Dumps:** **High** risk reduction. Effectively eliminates the threat if correctly configured.
    *   **Performance Impact from LeakCanary in Production:** **High** risk reduction. Completely prevents performance degradation from LeakCanary in release builds.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Location:** Gradle build files (`app/build.gradle`).
    *   **Status:** Should be implemented in projects using LeakCanary as a standard practice for managing debug dependencies.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Location:** Projects where developers might have incorrectly used `implementation` or `api` for LeakCanary dependencies, or in older projects not updated to use `debugImplementation` effectively.
    *   **Action Required:** Review all module-level `build.gradle` files and strictly enforce the use of `debugImplementation` for all LeakCanary dependencies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Automated LeakCanary Class Verification in Release Builds (CI/CD)](./mitigation_strategies/automated_leakcanary_class_verification_in_release_builds__cicd_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create a script within your CI/CD pipeline that runs after building the release APK/AAB.**
    2.  **This script should analyze the release build artifact (APK/AAB) to detect the presence of LeakCanary classes.**  Use tools like `apkanalyzer` or scripting languages to inspect the contents.
    3.  **Specifically search for packages or class names associated with LeakCanary.**  For example, check for the presence of packages starting with `leakcanary`.
    4.  **If LeakCanary classes are found in the release build, the script should fail the CI/CD pipeline.** This prevents the release from proceeding and signals an error.
    5.  **Configure your CI/CD pipeline to make this verification step mandatory for all release builds.**

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure through LeakCanary Heap Dumps (High Severity):** Acts as a critical safety net to catch any accidental inclusion of LeakCanary in release builds, reinforcing the prevention of heap dump exposure.
    *   **Performance Impact from LeakCanary in Production (Medium Severity):** Provides a robust secondary check to ensure LeakCanary's performance overhead is not introduced into production applications.
    *   **Accidental Release of LeakCanary in Production Builds (Medium Severity):** Directly mitigates the risk of unintentionally releasing builds containing LeakCanary by automating detection and build failure.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure through LeakCanary Heap Dumps:** **Medium** risk reduction (in addition to `debugImplementation`). Provides a strong automated check.
    *   **Performance Impact from LeakCanary in Production:** **Medium** risk reduction (in addition to `debugImplementation`).  Acts as a backup to prevent performance issues.
    *   **Accidental Release of LeakCanary in Production Builds:** **High** risk reduction. Significantly reduces the chance of accidental release by automated verification.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Location:** CI/CD pipeline configuration.
    *   **Status:** Potentially missing. Many projects might rely solely on `debugImplementation` without automated CI/CD verification for LeakCanary presence.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Location:** CI/CD pipeline for release builds.
    *   **Action Required:** Implement a build verification script specifically designed to detect LeakCanary classes in release builds and integrate it into the CI/CD pipeline as a mandatory step.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Review Focus on LeakCanary Dependency Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/code_review_focus_on_leakcanary_dependency_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Incorporate specific checks for LeakCanary dependency configurations into the code review process.**
    2.  **Train code reviewers to specifically look for correct usage of `debugImplementation` for LeakCanary dependencies during code reviews.**
    3.  **Reviewers should verify:**
        *   LeakCanary dependencies are exclusively under `debugImplementation`.
        *   No accidental inclusion of LeakCanary dependencies in `implementation`, `api`, or other configurations that would include them in release builds.
        *   No unintended changes to build configurations that might affect LeakCanary's debug-only status.
    4.  **Create a code review checklist item specifically for verifying LeakCanary dependency configuration.**

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure through LeakCanary Heap Dumps (Low Severity):** Reduces the risk of human error in build configuration related to LeakCanary, contributing to preventing accidental inclusion.
    *   **Performance Impact from LeakCanary in Production (Low Severity):** Minimizes the chance of incorrect LeakCanary build configurations leading to performance issues in production.
    *   **Accidental Release of LeakCanary in Production Builds (Low Severity):** Decreases the likelihood of accidental release by introducing a manual review step specifically focused on LeakCanary's build configuration.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure through LeakCanary Heap Dumps:** **Low** risk reduction. Relies on human review, but adds a targeted check for LeakCanary.
    *   **Performance Impact from LeakCanary in Production:** **Low** risk reduction. Similar to information disclosure, it's a preventative measure against configuration errors related to LeakCanary.
    *   **Accidental Release of LeakCanary in Production Builds:** **Medium** risk reduction. Code reviews are effective in catching human errors, especially when reviewers are specifically guided to check for LeakCanary configurations.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Location:** Code review process.
    *   **Status:** Partially implemented. Code reviews are likely in place, but specific focus on LeakCanary dependency configuration might be missing or inconsistent.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Location:** Code review process and reviewer training.
    *   **Action Required:** Formalize LeakCanary dependency configuration review as a specific part of the code review process. Train reviewers to specifically check for correct `debugImplementation` usage for LeakCanary. Add a checklist item for LeakCanary dependency verification.
