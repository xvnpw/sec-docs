# Threat Model Analysis for square/leakcanary

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Leak Reports](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_leak_reports.md)

- Description: An attacker gains unauthorized access to local storage or intercepts network traffic where LeakCanary's leak reports are stored or transmitted. These reports, generated by LeakCanary, contain snapshots of the application's memory, potentially including sensitive data held by leaked objects (e.g., API keys, user credentials, personal information). The attacker could analyze these reports to extract this sensitive information.
- Impact: Confidentiality breach, potential identity theft, unauthorized access to user accounts or resources, violation of privacy regulations.
- Affected Component: LeakCanary's heap analysis functionality and report generation. Specifically, the files where leak traces are stored locally and any mechanism used to transmit these reports (if configured by the developer using LeakCanary's APIs).
- Risk Severity: High
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - Ensure LeakCanary is strictly limited to debug/development builds and is completely removed or disabled in release/production builds through proper build configurations.
  - If leak reports are transmitted remotely (using custom integrations with LeakCanary), use secure protocols (HTTPS) and ensure the receiving server has robust security measures.
  - Educate developers to avoid storing sensitive data directly in objects that might be tracked and reported by LeakCanary. Implement secure data handling practices.
  - Consider encrypting leak reports if there's a legitimate need to store or transmit them, even in development environments. Implement this encryption within the application's integration with LeakCanary.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in LeakCanary Library](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_leakcanary_library.md)

- Description: The LeakCanary library itself might contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities if they exist within LeakCanary's code, leading to unexpected behavior, information disclosure directly through LeakCanary's mechanisms, or potentially even code execution within the application's context if a severe flaw is present in LeakCanary.
- Impact: Depends on the nature of the vulnerability within LeakCanary. Could range from information disclosure via manipulated leak reports to more severe issues like remote code execution if a critical flaw exists in how LeakCanary processes data or interacts with the application.
- Affected Component: Any module or function within the LeakCanary library's codebase that contains the security vulnerability.
- Risk Severity: Critical (if a remote code execution or significant data breach vulnerability exists within LeakCanary) or High (for other exploitable flaws).
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - Keep the LeakCanary library updated to the latest stable version. This ensures that known security vulnerabilities are patched.
  - Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues specifically related to LeakCanary.
  - If a critical vulnerability is identified in LeakCanary and an immediate update is not available, consider temporarily removing or disabling LeakCanary if the risk outweighs the benefits of its use in the development environment. Evaluate alternative memory leak detection strategies.
  - Be cautious about using unverified or modified versions of the LeakCanary library. Stick to the official releases.
