# Attack Surface Analysis for square/leakcanary

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Heap Dumps](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_heap_dumps.md)

* **Description:** Heap dumps, created by LeakCanary to analyze memory leaks, capture the application's memory state at a specific point in time. This memory can contain sensitive data.
* **How LeakCanary Contributes:** LeakCanary's core function is to trigger and store these heap dumps when leaks are detected.
* **Example:** A heap dump taken while a user is logged in might contain their session token, password in memory (if not properly cleared), or other personal information. If this dump is accessible, the data is exposed.
* **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, identity theft, unauthorized access to user accounts or sensitive information.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Ensure LeakCanary is ONLY enabled in debug builds.** This is the most critical mitigation. Use build variants and dependency management to prevent its inclusion in release versions.
    * **If custom leak reporters are used to transmit heap dumps, ensure secure transmission (e.g., HTTPS).**

## Attack Surface: [Risk of Accidental Inclusion in Release Builds](./attack_surfaces/risk_of_accidental_inclusion_in_release_builds.md)

* **Description:** If LeakCanary is unintentionally included in a release build, the risk of sensitive data exposure through heap dumps becomes active in the production environment.
* **How LeakCanary Contributes:** Improper build configuration or dependency management can lead to LeakCanary being packaged in release APKs, enabling its heap dump functionality in production.
* **Example:** A developer forgets to exclude the LeakCanary dependency for the release build variant, and the production app starts generating heap dumps on user devices, potentially exposing sensitive data.
* **Impact:** Significant security and privacy risks, potential for data breaches.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strictly manage dependencies and build variants.** Utilize tools like Gradle build types and flavors to ensure LeakCanary is only included in debug builds.
    * **Implement automated checks in the CI/CD pipeline to verify that LeakCanary is not present in release builds.**
    * **Perform thorough testing of release builds before deployment.**

## Attack Surface: [Exposure through Insecure Custom Leak Reporters](./attack_surfaces/exposure_through_insecure_custom_leak_reporters.md)

* **Description:** LeakCanary allows developers to implement custom leak reporters to handle leak information in specific ways (e.g., sending reports to a server).
* **How LeakCanary Contributes:** By providing this extensibility, LeakCanary indirectly introduces the risk of insecure implementations of these custom reporters handling potentially sensitive data from heap dumps or leak traces.
* **Example:** A custom leak reporter might send heap dumps or leak traces over an unencrypted HTTP connection, exposing sensitive information during transmission.
* **Impact:** Data breaches, information leakage, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Implement custom leak reporters with security in mind.** Use secure protocols (HTTPS), proper authentication, and authorization.
    * **Avoid logging sensitive information in custom reporters unless absolutely necessary and with appropriate security measures.
    * **Thoroughly review and test custom leak reporter implementations for potential vulnerabilities.**
