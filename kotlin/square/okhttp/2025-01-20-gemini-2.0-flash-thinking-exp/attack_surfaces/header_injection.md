### 4. Deep Analysis of Header Injection Attack Surface

#### 4.1 Understanding the Attack Surface

The Header Injection attack surface arises when an application allows user-controlled data to be directly incorporated into HTTP request headers without proper sanitization or validation. OkHttp, as a powerful HTTP client, provides developers with the flexibility to customize request headers. While this flexibility is essential for many legitimate use cases, it also introduces the risk of header injection if not handled carefully.

#### 4.2 How OkHttp Facilitates Header Injection

OkHttp provides several methods that can be misused to inject malicious headers:

*   **`Request.Builder.header(String name, String value)`:** This method allows setting a single header with a given name and value. If the `value` is derived from unsanitized user input, an attacker can inject arbitrary headers by including newline characters (`\n` or `\r\n`).
*   **`Request.Builder.addHeader(String name, String value)`:** Similar to `header()`, but adds a new header without replacing existing ones with the same name. This also suffers from the same vulnerability if the `value` is not sanitized.
*   **`Request.Builder.headers(Headers headers)`:** This method allows setting multiple headers at once using a `Headers` object. If the `Headers` object is constructed using user-provided data without proper validation, it can lead to header injection.
*   **`Interceptor` Implementation:** While not directly an OkHttp method for setting headers based on user input, custom interceptors can be written to modify requests, including headers. If the logic within an interceptor uses unsanitized user input to set headers, it becomes a potential injection point.

**Code Example Illustrating Vulnerability:**

```java
OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();
String userInput = getUserInput(); // Assume this gets user input

Request request = new Request.Builder()
    .url("https://example.com/api")
    .header("User-Agent", "MyApp/" + userInput) // Vulnerable line
    .build();

Response response = client.newCall(request).execute();
```

In the above example, if `userInput` contains `\nSet-Cookie: malicious=true`, the resulting HTTP request will include the injected `Set-Cookie` header.

#### 4.3 Detailed Examination of the Example Scenario

The provided example highlights a common scenario: allowing users to customize the "User-Agent" header. While seemingly innocuous, this can be a vector for header injection.

**Attack Breakdown:**

1. The attacker provides input intended for the "User-Agent" header.
2. This input includes newline characters (`\n` or `\r\n`) followed by a malicious header, such as `Set-Cookie: malicious=true`.
3. The application, using OkHttp, directly incorporates this unsanitized input into the "User-Agent" header using methods like `header()` or `addHeader()`.
4. OkHttp constructs the HTTP request with the injected header.
5. The server receives the request and processes the injected header. In this case, it sets a malicious cookie on the client's browser in the response.

#### 4.4 Impact of Header Injection

Successful header injection attacks can have significant consequences:

*   **Session Fixation:** Attackers can inject headers like `Cookie` to force a user to use a specific session ID controlled by the attacker.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Response Headers:** Attackers can inject headers like `Content-Type` or custom headers that, when reflected in the server's response, can be interpreted as HTML or JavaScript by the browser, leading to XSS. For example, injecting `Content-Type: text/html` followed by malicious HTML in a subsequent header value.
*   **Cache Poisoning:** By injecting headers like `Cache-Control` or `Pragma`, attackers can manipulate caching mechanisms on intermediary proxies or the client's browser, leading to serving outdated or malicious content to other users.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers might inject headers to elicit specific responses from the server, potentially revealing sensitive information. For example, injecting specific `Accept-*` headers might reveal supported content types or server capabilities.
*   **Bypassing Security Controls:** Injected headers can sometimes bypass security checks or filters implemented on the server-side.
*   **Request Smuggling (Less likely with standard OkHttp usage but possible with custom interceptors):** In complex scenarios involving intermediaries, carefully crafted injected headers could potentially lead to request smuggling vulnerabilities.

#### 4.5 Risk Severity Analysis

As indicated in the initial description, the risk severity of Header Injection is **High**. This is due to:

*   **Ease of Exploitation:** Injecting headers is relatively straightforward if user input is not properly sanitized.
*   **Wide Range of Impacts:** The potential consequences of successful header injection can be severe, ranging from session manipulation to XSS and cache poisoning.
*   **Potential for Widespread Impact:** If the vulnerability exists in a widely used application, it can affect a large number of users.

#### 4.6 Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

To effectively mitigate the Header Injection attack surface when using OkHttp, developers should implement the following strategies:

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** This is the most crucial mitigation.
    *   **Whitelisting:** Define a strict set of allowed characters and only permit those characters in header values derived from user input.
    *   **Blacklisting:** Identify and remove or escape potentially harmful characters, especially newline characters (`\n`, `\r`) and colon (`:`).
    *   **Encoding:**  Consider encoding user input before using it in headers. However, be cautious as incorrect encoding can lead to other issues.
    *   **Regular Expressions:** Use regular expressions to validate the format and content of user-provided header values.
    *   **Contextual Sanitization:** Sanitize based on the specific header being set. For example, the allowed characters for a custom header might differ from those allowed in a standard header.

*   **Avoid Dynamic Header Setting When Possible:**  Minimize the scenarios where users can directly control header values.
    *   **Predefined Options:** Offer a limited set of predefined options for headers instead of allowing arbitrary input.
    *   **Indirect Control:** If user input is necessary, process it on the server-side and then set the headers before making the request using OkHttp.

*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not a direct mitigation for header injection itself, a properly configured CSP can significantly reduce the impact of XSS vulnerabilities that might arise from injected response headers.

*   **Secure Coding Practices:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only grant the necessary permissions for setting headers.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular code reviews and security testing to identify potential header injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Developer Training:** Educate developers about the risks of header injection and secure coding practices.

*   **Security Libraries and Frameworks:** Consider using security libraries or frameworks that provide built-in mechanisms for sanitizing and validating user input.

*   **Output Encoding (for Response Headers):** If your application is generating response headers based on data that might have originated from user input (though less directly related to OkHttp), ensure proper output encoding to prevent interpretation as HTML or JavaScript.

#### 4.7 Developer Best Practices When Using OkHttp for Headers

*   **Treat all user input as untrusted:**  Never directly incorporate user input into header values without thorough validation and sanitization.
*   **Be mindful of newline characters:**  Specifically check for and remove or escape newline characters (`\n`, `\r`) as they are the primary mechanism for injecting new headers.
*   **Understand the context of each header:**  Different headers have different purposes and may have specific formatting requirements. Validate input accordingly.
*   **Prefer predefined options over arbitrary input:**  When possible, limit user choices to a predefined set of valid header values.
*   **Review OkHttp documentation carefully:**  Understand the nuances of the `header()`, `addHeader()`, and `headers()` methods and their potential security implications.
*   **Test thoroughly:**  Implement unit and integration tests that specifically check for header injection vulnerabilities with various malicious inputs.

### 5. Conclusion

Header Injection is a significant security risk in applications using OkHttp if developers do not handle user input carefully when setting HTTP headers. By understanding how OkHttp's features can be exploited, the potential impact of such attacks, and implementing robust mitigation strategies like input validation and avoiding dynamic header setting, development teams can significantly reduce their attack surface and build more secure applications. Continuous vigilance, developer education, and regular security assessments are crucial for preventing and addressing header injection vulnerabilities.
