## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit OkHttp Library Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_okhttp_library_vulnerabilities.md)

This node represents the potential for attackers to exploit inherent flaws within the OkHttp library itself. Successful exploitation can lead to significant compromise, including remote code execution or complete application takeover. It's critical because it bypasses application-level defenses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Network Communication via OkHttp](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_network_communication_via_okhttp.md)

This node encompasses attacks that intercept or modify network traffic handled by OkHttp. It's critical because successful manipulation can lead to data breaches, unauthorized actions, or the introduction of malicious content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate OkHttp Requests/Responses](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_okhttp_requestsresponses.md)

This node focuses on the ability to alter the content of requests sent by the application or responses received. It's critical as it directly impacts the data exchanged and can be used to bypass security checks or inject malicious payloads.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure TLS Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_tls_configuration.md)

This node highlights vulnerabilities arising from improper TLS/SSL setup. It's critical because it undermines the confidentiality and integrity of communication, making MITM attacks feasible.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known CVEs in OkHttp](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_cves_in_okhttp.md)

Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in specific OkHttp versions. This path is high-risk due to the availability of exploit information and tools, making it relatively easy for attackers to execute if the application uses an outdated version.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack.md)

Attackers intercept communication between the application and a server. This path is high-risk because it allows for the manipulation of data in transit, potentially leading to various forms of compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Headers](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_headers.md)

Attackers insert harmful headers into HTTP requests sent by OkHttp. This path is high-risk as it can exploit vulnerabilities in server-side header processing, leading to actions like cache poisoning or session hijacking.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tamper with Request Body](./attack_tree_paths/tamper_with_request_body.md)

Attackers modify the data sent in the request body via OkHttp. This path is high-risk because it can directly alter the data processed by the server, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Downgrade HTTPS to HTTP](./attack_tree_paths/downgrade_https_to_http.md)

Attackers force the application to communicate over unencrypted HTTP instead of HTTPS. This path is high-risk as it exposes sensitive data transmitted between the application and the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure TLS Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_tls_configuration.md)

Attackers take advantage of weak or improperly configured TLS settings. This path is high-risk as it weakens the encryption and authentication mechanisms, making communication vulnerable to interception and manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Certificate Validation](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_certificate_validation.md)

Attackers circumvent the process of verifying the server's SSL/TLS certificate. This path is high-risk because it allows for trivial MITM attacks, as the application will trust potentially malicious servers.
