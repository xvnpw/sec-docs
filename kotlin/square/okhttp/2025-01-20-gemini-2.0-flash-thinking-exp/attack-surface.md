# Attack Surface Analysis for square/okhttp

## Attack Surface: [Malicious URLs (Server-Side Request Forgery - SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_urls__server-side_request_forgery_-_ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate the application to make unintended HTTP requests to internal or external resources.
*   **How OkHttp Contributes:** OkHttp is the mechanism used by the application to make these HTTP requests. If the URL passed to OkHttp is constructed using unsanitized user input or external data, it can be controlled by an attacker.
*   **Example:** An application takes a URL from user input to fetch an image. An attacker provides `http://internal.server/admin/delete_all_data`. The application, using OkHttp, makes this request.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, data breaches, denial of service, execution of arbitrary code on internal systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided URLs or URL components before using them with OkHttp.
    *   **Allow Lists:**  Maintain a strict allow list of acceptable domains or URL patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious HTTP headers into requests made by the application.
*   **How OkHttp Contributes:** OkHttp provides methods to add custom headers to requests. If the values for these headers are derived from unsanitized user input, attackers can inject arbitrary headers.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to set a custom "User-Agent" header. An attacker injects `User-Agent: vulnerable\nSet-Cookie: malicious=true`. This could lead to setting malicious cookies on the client.
*   **Impact:** Session fixation, cross-site scripting (XSS) via response headers, cache poisoning, information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user-provided data used for setting HTTP header values.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Header Setting:** If possible, avoid allowing users to directly control header values. Use predefined options instead.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tlsssl_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** The application is configured to use weak or outdated TLS protocols or ciphers, making communication vulnerable to interception and decryption.
*   **How OkHttp Contributes:** OkHttp allows customization of the `SSLSocketFactory` and `HostnameVerifier`. Incorrect configuration here can weaken TLS security.
*   **Example:** An application configures OkHttp to allow SSLv3 or weak ciphers like RC4. An attacker can then perform a man-in-the-middle attack and decrypt the communication.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, eavesdropping, manipulation of transmitted data.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Strong TLS Configuration:** Configure OkHttp to use only strong and up-to-date TLS protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher) and secure cipher suites.
    *   **Disable Weak Ciphers:** Explicitly disable known weak ciphers.
    *   **Use Platform Defaults:**  Consider using the platform's default secure TLS settings if appropriate.

## Attack Surface: [Disabled or Improper Certificate Validation](./attack_surfaces/disabled_or_improper_certificate_validation.md)

*   **Description:** The application does not properly validate the server's SSL/TLS certificate, allowing connections to potentially malicious servers.
*   **How OkHttp Contributes:** OkHttp uses `HostnameVerifier` and `SSLSocketFactory` for certificate validation. If a custom, insecure implementation is used (e.g., trusting all certificates), or if the default validation is bypassed, this vulnerability arises.
*   **Example:** An application uses a custom `HostnameVerifier` that always returns `true`, effectively disabling hostname verification. This allows an attacker with a valid certificate for any domain to intercept traffic.
*   **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, data breaches, impersonation of legitimate servers.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Default Certificate Validation:** Rely on OkHttp's default, secure certificate validation.
    *   **Implement Proper Custom Validation (if necessary):** If custom validation is required, ensure it is implemented correctly and securely.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Cookie Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_cookie_handling.md)

*   **Description:** The application mishandles cookies, potentially exposing session information or allowing manipulation.
*   **How OkHttp Contributes:** OkHttp provides mechanisms for managing cookies through `CookieJar`. Vulnerabilities can arise from custom `CookieJar` implementations or improper usage of the default one.
*   **Example:** A custom `CookieJar` stores cookies in plain text on the device's storage, making them accessible to other applications.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, unauthorized access, information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Secure Cookie Storage:** If implementing a custom `CookieJar`, ensure secure storage mechanisms are used.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Interceptors](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_interceptors.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws exist within custom interceptors added to OkHttp's request/response pipeline.
*   **How OkHttp Contributes:** OkHttp's interceptor mechanism allows developers to modify requests and responses. Bugs or insecure practices within these interceptors introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** An interceptor logs sensitive data (like authorization tokens) to a file, making it accessible to attackers. Another interceptor might incorrectly modify request headers, leading to unexpected server behavior.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, data manipulation, bypassing security controls, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding principles when developing interceptors.
    *   **Thorough Testing:**  Rigorous testing of interceptors, including security testing, is crucial.
