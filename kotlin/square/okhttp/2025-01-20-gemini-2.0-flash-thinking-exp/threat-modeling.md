# Threat Model Analysis for square/okhttp

## Threat: [Insufficient Certificate Validation](./threats/insufficient_certificate_validation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could intercept network traffic between the application and a server by performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. They would present a fraudulent SSL/TLS certificate to the application. If certificate validation is disabled or improperly configured *within OkHttp*, the library will accept the fake certificate, allowing the attacker to eavesdrop on or modify the communication.
    *   **Impact:** Confidential data transmitted between the application and the server could be exposed to the attacker. This might include sensitive user credentials, personal information, or proprietary business data. The attacker could also modify data in transit, leading to data corruption or manipulation of application behavior.
    *   **Affected OkHttp Component:** `CertificatePinner`, `HostnameVerifier`, `SSLSocketFactory` configuration within `OkHttpClient`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure proper default certificate validation is enabled and not overridden with insecure configurations when building `OkHttpClient`.
        *   Utilize `CertificatePinner` to explicitly pin trusted certificates or certificate chains for critical connections using `OkHttpClient.Builder`.
        *   Carefully review and understand any custom `HostnameVerifier` or `SSLSocketFactory` implementations provided to `OkHttpClient.Builder`.

## Threat: [TLS Downgrade Attacks](./threats/tls_downgrade_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate the TLS handshake process to force the client and server to negotiate a weaker, less secure TLS protocol version or cipher suite that is vulnerable to known exploits. This can occur if *OkHttp is not configured to enforce strong TLS settings*.
    *   **Impact:**  Communication security is weakened, making it easier for attackers to decrypt the traffic and potentially steal or modify data. Vulnerabilities like POODLE or BEAST could be exploited.
    *   **Affected OkHttp Component:** TLS negotiation within OkHttp's connection establishment. Configuration of `ConnectionSpec` within `OkHttpClient.Builder`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure `OkHttpClient` using `ConnectionSpec.Builder` to enforce a minimum TLS protocol version (e.g., TLSv1.2 or higher).
        *   Ensure the server also enforces strong TLS protocol versions and cipher suites.
        *   Regularly update OkHttp to benefit from the latest security patches and protocol support.

## Threat: [Malicious Interceptors](./threats/malicious_interceptors.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows dynamic loading or configuration of OkHttp interceptors from untrusted sources, an attacker could inject malicious interceptors *into the OkHttpClient*. These interceptors could intercept, modify, or drop requests and responses, potentially exfiltrating data, manipulating application logic, or causing denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of application data and functionality. The attacker could steal sensitive information, modify transactions, or disrupt the application's operation.
    *   **Affected OkHttp Component:** `Interceptor` interface and the `OkHttpClient.Builder` for adding interceptors.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly control the sources from which interceptors are loaded and added to the `OkHttpClient`.
        *   Avoid dynamic loading of interceptors from external or untrusted sources.
        *   Thoroughly review and audit all custom interceptor implementations added to the `OkHttpClient`.
        *   Implement strong input validation and sanitization within interceptors.

## Threat: [Information Leakage through Interceptors](./threats/information_leakage_through_interceptors.md)

*   **Description:**  Improperly implemented interceptors *within the OkHttpClient* might inadvertently log or expose sensitive information present in request headers, bodies, or responses. This could occur through excessive logging or by including sensitive data in error messages within the interceptor's logic.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data such as API keys, authentication tokens, personal information, or business secrets. This information could be exploited for further attacks or identity theft.
    *   **Affected OkHttp Component:** `Interceptor` interface and logging mechanisms used within interceptors added to the `OkHttpClient`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review and control logging within interceptors added to the `OkHttpClient`.
        *   Avoid logging sensitive data within interceptors. If logging is necessary, redact or mask sensitive information.
        *   Ensure error handling in interceptors does not expose sensitive details.

## Threat: [Cache Poisoning](./threats/cache_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:** If the server's caching directives are not properly respected or if there are vulnerabilities in *OkHttp's caching implementation*, an attacker might be able to inject malicious content into the cache managed by OkHttp. Subsequent requests for the same resource would then serve the attacker's malicious content from OkHttp's cache.
    *   **Impact:**  Serving malicious content to application users, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, redirection to phishing sites, or other client-side vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected OkHttp Component:** `Cache` class and handling of HTTP caching headers within OkHttp.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the server sends appropriate and strict `Cache-Control` headers.
        *   Understand and respect server-provided caching directives when configuring OkHttp's cache.
        *   Consider disabling caching for sensitive resources within the `OkHttpClient` configuration.
        *   Regularly update OkHttp to benefit from any caching-related security fixes.

## Threat: [WebSocket Hijacking](./threats/websocket_hijacking.md)

*   **Description:** If the initial handshake for a WebSocket connection established using *OkHttp's WebSocket API* is not properly secured (e.g., lacking proper origin checks on the server-side), an attacker might be able to hijack the connection.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could send and receive messages on behalf of the legitimate client, potentially performing actions the user did not authorize or accessing sensitive information.
    *   **Affected OkHttp Component:** `WebSocketListener` and the underlying WebSocket connection establishment within OkHttp.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the server properly validates the `Origin` header during the WebSocket handshake. This is primarily a server-side concern, but the client application using OkHttp should be aware of this risk.
        *   Implement additional authentication or authorization mechanisms for WebSocket connections.
        *   Use secure protocols (WSS) for WebSocket connections initiated by OkHttp.

## Threat: [HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 Specific Attacks](./threats/http2_and_http3_specific_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities specific to the HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 protocols implemented by *OkHttp* could be exploited. This includes issues like stream multiplexing vulnerabilities, header compression attacks (like HPACK bombing), or rapid reset attacks leading to denial of service.
    *   **Impact:**  Denial of service, information disclosure, or other protocol-specific vulnerabilities could be exploited.
    *   **Affected OkHttp Component:**  HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 protocol implementations within OkHttp.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be High or Critical depending on the specific vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep OkHttp updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 vulnerabilities.
        *   Ensure the server also has up-to-date implementations of HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.
        *   Monitor security advisories related to HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 and OkHttp.
