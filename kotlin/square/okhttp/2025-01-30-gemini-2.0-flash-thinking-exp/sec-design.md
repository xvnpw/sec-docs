  - Lack of compatibility with new platforms or protocols could limit the adoption and usefulness of OkHttp.
  - Security misconfigurations or misuse of OkHttp by developers could introduce vulnerabilities into applications.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: TLS/SSL support for encrypted communication, implemented within the library to handle HTTPS connections. Described in OkHttp documentation and source code.
  - security control: Input validation on response headers and bodies to prevent common vulnerabilities. Implemented within the library's response processing logic. Described in source code.
  - security control: Connection pooling and reuse to improve performance and reduce resource consumption, which can indirectly enhance security by reducing attack surface related to connection setup. Implemented within the library's connection management logic. Described in source code.
  - security control: Support for modern HTTP features and security best practices, such as HTTP/2 and certificate pinning. Implemented as features within the library. Described in documentation and source code.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on application developers to correctly configure and use OkHttp securely within their applications.
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in underlying platform libraries (e.g., Java/Android networking stack) that OkHttp depends on.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) integrated into the OkHttp development pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
  - security control: Regular dependency updates for OkHttp's build and test dependencies to mitigate risks from known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
  - security control: Security code reviews conducted by experienced security engineers to identify and address potential security flaws in the design and implementation.
  - security control: Public vulnerability disclosure policy and process to handle reported security issues in a timely and transparent manner.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Support for standard HTTP authentication schemes (e.g., Basic, Digest, Bearer Token).
    - Requirement: Secure handling of authentication credentials, avoiding storage in plaintext within the library itself.
    - Requirement: Ability for applications to integrate custom authentication mechanisms.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: While OkHttp is primarily a client library and does not enforce authorization, it must correctly handle and propagate authorization tokens or headers provided by applications.
    - Requirement: Support for handling server-side authorization responses and errors.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Robust validation of HTTP response headers and bodies to prevent injection attacks (e.g., header injection, body injection).
    - Requirement: Protection against malformed or unexpected HTTP responses that could lead to parsing errors or denial-of-service.
    - Requirement: Input validation should be applied to all data received from external sources (web servers).
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Strong TLS/SSL implementation using secure cipher suites and protocols.
    - Requirement: Support for certificate validation and revocation mechanisms (e.g., CRL, OCSP).
    - Requirement: Protection of cryptographic keys and sensitive data used for TLS/SSL.
    - Requirement: Support for certificate pinning to enhance security against man-in-the-middle attacks.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Network communication for applications using OkHttp. This is critical for any application that relies on network data exchange, including fetching data from APIs, downloading resources, and interacting with web services. Disruption or compromise of this process can lead to application malfunction, data breaches, or denial of service.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - The data handled by OkHttp depends entirely on the applications using it. OkHttp itself is a transport mechanism and can handle any type of data transmitted over HTTP. The sensitivity of this data can range from public information to highly confidential personal or financial data, depending on the application's purpose. Therefore, the security of OkHttp is crucial for protecting a wide range of potentially sensitive data.
