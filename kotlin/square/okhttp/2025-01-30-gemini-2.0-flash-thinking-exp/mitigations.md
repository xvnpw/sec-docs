# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for square/okhttp

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update OkHttp](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_okhttp.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Current OkHttp Version:** Check your project's dependency management file (e.g., `build.gradle`) to determine the currently used OkHttp version.
    2.  **Check for Latest Stable Version:** Visit the official OkHttp repository (https://github.com/square/okhttp/releases) or Maven Central/Gradle Plugin Portal to find the latest stable release version.
    3.  **Update Dependency Version:** Modify your dependency management file to use the latest stable OkHttp version.
    4.  **Test Application:** Thoroughly test your application after updating OkHttp, focusing on network requests made using OkHttp.
    5.  **Establish Update Cadence:**  Create a process for regularly checking for and applying OkHttp updates.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated OkHttp versions can contain known security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
        *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):**  Staying updated reduces the window of exposure to newly discovered zero-day vulnerabilities in OkHttp.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction - Directly patches known OkHttp vulnerabilities.
        *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces exposure time to new OkHttp vulnerabilities.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. OkHttp updates are generally performed during major release cycles. Version is managed in `build.gradle` file.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Lack of a defined process for *regular* (e.g., monthly) checks specifically for OkHttp updates.
        *   No automated alerts for new OkHttp releases or security advisories.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce TLS 1.2 or Higher in OkHttp](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_tls_1_2_or_higher_in_okhttp.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create a `ConnectionSpec`:** Instantiate a `ConnectionSpec` object.
    2.  **Configure TLS Versions:** Use `ConnectionSpec.Builder` to specify `TlsVersion.TLS_1_2` and `TlsVersion.TLS_1_3` (if desired) in the `tlsVersions()` method.
    3.  **Configure Cipher Suites (Optional but Recommended):** Use `ConnectionSpec.Builder` to specify secure cipher suites in the `cipherSuites()` method.
    4.  **Apply `ConnectionSpec` to `OkHttpClient`:** When building your `OkHttpClient`, use the `connectionSpecs()` method to apply the created `ConnectionSpec` list.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Downgrade Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from forcing OkHttp connections to use older, weaker TLS versions like TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1.
        *   **Cipher Suite Weaknesses (Medium Severity):** Explicitly configuring cipher suites in OkHttp further reduces the risk of using weak or compromised ciphers.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Downgrade Attacks:** High Risk Reduction - Directly prevents downgrade attacks for OkHttp connections.
        *   **Cipher Suite Weaknesses:** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces risk related to cipher suite vulnerabilities in OkHttp.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Not currently implemented. Application relies on OkHttp's default `ConnectionSpec`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `ConnectionSpec` configuration is not explicitly set in the `OkHttpClient` initialization within the project.
        *   No explicit configuration of cipher suites within OkHttp client setup.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Hostname Verification in OkHttp](./mitigation_strategies/enable_hostname_verification_in_okhttp.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Ensure Default `OkHttpClient` Behavior:** Hostname verification is enabled by default in OkHttp.
    2.  **Avoid Disabling Hostname Verification:** Do not use `.hostnameVerifier(HostnameVerifier.ALLOW_ALL)` or similar methods in your `OkHttpClient` configuration unless absolutely necessary for controlled testing.
    3.  **Review Custom SSL Configurations:** If using custom `SSLSocketFactory` or `TrustManager` with OkHttp, verify they maintain hostname verification.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity):** Hostname verification in OkHttp prevents MITM attacks by ensuring the application connects to the intended server and not a malicious impersonator.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** High Risk Reduction - Crucial for preventing MITM attacks when using OkHttp.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Implemented by default as standard `OkHttpClient` instantiation is used.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No explicit code reviews to confirm hostname verification is *always* enabled in OkHttp client configurations, especially if custom SSL handling is ever introduced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Certificate Pinning in OkHttp (for critical connections)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_certificate_pinning_in_okhttp__for_critical_connections_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Pinning Strategy:** Decide between certificate or public key pinning for OkHttp.
    2.  **Obtain Server Certificate/Public Key:** Retrieve the server's certificate or public key for the target host(s) used with OkHttp.
    3.  **Create a `CertificatePinner`:** Instantiate a `CertificatePinner.Builder`.
    4.  **Add Pins to `CertificatePinner`:** Use `CertificatePinner.Builder.add()` to add pins for the target hostname(s), specifying the SHA-256 hash of the certificate or public key.
    5.  **Apply `CertificatePinner` to `OkHttpClient`:** When building your `OkHttpClient`, use the `certificatePinner()` method to apply the created `CertificatePinner`.
    6.  **Pin Backup Strategy & Rotation Plan:** Develop a backup pinning strategy and a plan for rotating pins when server certificates are updated to avoid service disruption when using OkHttp.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks due to Compromised Certificate Authorities (High Severity):** OkHttp certificate pinning mitigates MITM attacks even if a CA is compromised.
        *   **Rogue CAs (High Severity):** Protects OkHttp connections against attacks involving rogue or malicious Certificate Authorities.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks due to Compromised CAs:** High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces risk from CA compromise for OkHttp connections.
        *   **Rogue CAs:** High Risk Reduction - Eliminates trust in potentially rogue CAs for OkHttp connections.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Not currently implemented. Certificate pinning is not used in OkHttp configurations.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Certificate pinning is not configured for any `OkHttpClient` instances within the project.
        *   No plan for implementing and managing certificate pinning for critical backend services accessed via OkHttp.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Redirect Handling in OkHttp](./mitigation_strategies/control_redirect_handling_in_okhttp.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Default Redirect Behavior:** Understand OkHttp's default behavior for handling HTTP redirects (both regular and SSL redirects).
    2.  **Customize Redirect Following (If Needed):** If stricter control is required, use `OkHttpClient.Builder` methods like `followRedirects(boolean)` and `followSslRedirects(boolean)` to disable or customize redirect following.
    3.  **Implement Custom Redirect Logic (Advanced):** For fine-grained control, implement a custom `Interceptor` that intercepts redirect responses and applies specific logic to determine whether to follow the redirect based on destination URL or other criteria.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Open Redirect Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Uncontrolled redirect handling in OkHttp could potentially be exploited for open redirect vulnerabilities if the application blindly follows redirects to untrusted destinations.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Open Redirect Vulnerabilities:** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk of open redirect vulnerabilities arising from OkHttp's redirect handling.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Default OkHttp redirect handling is used. No custom redirect control is implemented.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No explicit review or customization of OkHttp's redirect handling behavior has been performed.
        *   No custom interceptor for redirect control is implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Logging Practices for OkHttp Interceptors](./mitigation_strategies/secure_logging_practices_for_okhttp_interceptors.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review OkHttp Logging Interceptors:** Examine your OkHttp configuration for any `HttpLoggingInterceptor` instances.
    2.  **Minimize Logging Level in Production:** Set the logging level of `HttpLoggingInterceptor` to `NONE`, `BASIC`, or `HEADERS` in production. Avoid `BODY` or `BODY_STAR` levels in production to prevent excessive logging of potentially sensitive data.
    3.  **Redact Sensitive Data in Logging Interceptors (If Needed):** If `BODY` logging is necessary for debugging, create custom interceptors to redact or sanitize sensitive data from request/response bodies *before* they are logged by OkHttp.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information in Logs (High Severity):** Logging sensitive data by OkHttp interceptors can lead to security breaches if logs are compromised.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information in Logs:** High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of sensitive data exposure through OkHttp logs.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `HttpLoggingInterceptor` is used in development with `BODY` level.
        *   In production, logging level is set to `HEADERS`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No explicit redaction of sensitive data in OkHttp logging, even when `BODY` logging is used in development.
        *   No automated checks to ensure minimal logging levels are enforced in production OkHttp configurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Connection Pool Limits in OkHttp](./mitigation_strategies/configure_connection_pool_limits_in_okhttp.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Default Connection Pool:** Understand OkHttp's default connection pool settings.
    2.  **Configure `ConnectionPool`:**  Create a `ConnectionPool` instance and configure its `maxIdleConnections()` and `keepAliveDuration()` parameters based on your application's needs and server capabilities.
    3.  **Apply `ConnectionPool` to `OkHttpClient`:** Use the `connectionPool()` method when building your `OkHttpClient` to apply the configured `ConnectionPool`.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Resource Exhaustion/DoS (Medium Severity):**  Unbounded connection pooling in OkHttp could potentially contribute to resource exhaustion or DoS if an attacker can trigger excessive connection creation.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Resource Exhaustion/DoS:** Medium Risk Reduction - Helps prevent resource exhaustion related to excessive OkHttp connection pooling.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Default OkHttp connection pool settings are used. No custom configuration is in place.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No explicit configuration of `ConnectionPool` limits in OkHttp client setup.
        *   No performance testing or analysis to determine optimal connection pool settings for the application's usage patterns.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Set Timeouts Appropriately in OkHttp](./mitigation_strategies/set_timeouts_appropriately_in_okhttp.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Connect Timeout:** Set an appropriate `connectTimeout()` on your `OkHttpClient.Builder` to limit the time OkHttp will wait to establish a connection to a server.
    2.  **Configure Read Timeout:** Set an appropriate `readTimeout()` to limit the time OkHttp will wait for data to be received from the server after a connection is established.
    3.  **Configure Write Timeout:** Set an appropriate `writeTimeout()` to limit the time OkHttp will wait to send data to the server.
    4.  **Review Timeout Values:** Regularly review and adjust timeout values based on network conditions and expected server response times.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) due to Slowloris-like Attacks (Medium Severity):** Timeouts in OkHttp can help mitigate slowloris-like attacks where attackers attempt to keep connections open indefinitely, exhausting server resources.
        *   **Application Hangs/Unresponsiveness (Medium Severity):** Timeouts prevent the application from hanging indefinitely due to slow or unresponsive servers when using OkHttp.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) due to Slowloris-like Attacks:** Medium Risk Reduction - Helps mitigate slowloris-like attacks by limiting connection duration.
        *   **Application Hangs/Unresponsiveness:** Medium Risk Reduction - Improves application robustness and prevents hangs due to network issues when using OkHttp.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Default timeouts are used in `OkHttpClient` configuration.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Timeouts are not explicitly configured or tuned for specific use cases or network environments.
        *   No process for regularly reviewing and adjusting OkHttp timeout values.
