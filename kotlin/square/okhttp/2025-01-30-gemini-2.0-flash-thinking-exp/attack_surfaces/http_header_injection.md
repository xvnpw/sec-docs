### 4. Deep Analysis of HTTP Header Injection Attack Surface

#### 4.1 Vulnerability Breakdown: How HTTP Header Injection Occurs in OkHttp Applications

HTTP Header Injection vulnerabilities in OkHttp applications arise when:

*   **Untrusted Data Source:** The application receives user-controlled input from an untrusted source (e.g., user input fields, query parameters, external APIs, configuration files).
*   **Direct Header Construction:** This untrusted input is directly used to construct HTTP headers without proper validation or sanitization.
*   **OkHttp API Usage:** The application then uses OkHttp's `Headers.Builder` or `Request.Builder` to add these crafted headers to an HTTP request.
*   **OkHttp's Faithful Transmission:** OkHttp, acting as a compliant HTTP client, faithfully transmits the headers as constructed by the application, including any malicious injections.
*   **Server-Side Interpretation:** The server-side application or infrastructure processes these injected headers, potentially leading to unintended behavior, security breaches, or further attacks.

**Key Point:** OkHttp itself is not inherently vulnerable to header injection. The vulnerability lies in the *application code* that uses OkHttp and fails to properly handle user-controlled input when constructing headers. OkHttp acts as a neutral intermediary, transmitting what it is instructed to transmit.

#### 4.2 Attack Vectors and Examples

Attackers can leverage HTTP Header Injection to achieve various malicious objectives. Here are some common attack vectors in the context of OkHttp applications:

*   **Bypassing Security Controls (IP Whitelisting/Blacklisting):**
    *   **Injected Header:** `X-Forwarded-For: <attacker_ip>`
    *   **Mechanism:** By injecting `X-Forwarded-For`, an attacker can spoof their IP address as seen by the server. If the server relies on IP-based access controls (e.g., whitelisting specific IPs), the attacker can bypass these controls by injecting a whitelisted IP address.
    *   **Example Scenario:** An application restricts access to certain resources based on IP address. An attacker from a blacklisted IP range injects `X-Forwarded-For` with a whitelisted IP, gaining unauthorized access.

*   **Session Hijacking/Fixation:**
    *   **Injected Header:** `Set-Cookie: SESSIONID=<attacker_session_id>`
    *   **Mechanism:** Injecting `Set-Cookie` allows an attacker to attempt session fixation or potentially overwrite existing cookies. While servers typically control `Set-Cookie`, vulnerabilities in server-side header parsing or misconfigurations could allow this injection to be effective.
    *   **Example Scenario:** An attacker wants to hijack a user's session. They inject `Set-Cookie` with a known session ID, hoping the server will accept it and potentially associate it with the victim's session.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Less Direct, Server-Side Dependent):**
    *   **Injected Header:** `X-Custom-Header: <script>alert('XSS')</script>`
    *   **Mechanism:** If the server-side application reflects or processes custom headers in a way that is vulnerable to XSS (e.g., logging headers without proper encoding and displaying them in a web interface), header injection can become a vector for XSS. This is less direct and relies on server-side misconfiguration.
    *   **Example Scenario:** A server-side logging system displays HTTP headers in a web interface without proper HTML encoding. An attacker injects a header with JavaScript code, which is then executed in the browser when the logs are viewed.

*   **Request Smuggling (More Complex, Server-Side Dependent):**
    *   **Injected Headers:**  Manipulating `Content-Length` or `Transfer-Encoding` headers, potentially in combination with newline injection (`\n`).
    *   **Mechanism:**  If the server-side infrastructure (e.g., proxies, load balancers) and the backend server interpret HTTP requests differently, header injection, especially newline injection leading to header splitting, can be exploited for request smuggling. This is a more advanced attack and requires specific server-side vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example Scenario:** An attacker injects newline characters and manipulates `Content-Length` to create two requests within a single HTTP connection. The frontend proxy might see one request, while the backend server sees two, leading to request smuggling and potential security bypasses.

*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   **Injected Headers:**  Headers that might trigger verbose error messages or reveal internal server information.
    *   **Mechanism:**  Injecting specific headers might cause the server to respond with more detailed error messages or expose internal configurations in response headers or logs.
    *   **Example Scenario:** Injecting headers related to debugging or tracing might inadvertently trigger verbose error responses that reveal server-side technology stack or internal paths.

#### 4.3 Technical Deep Dive: OkHttp API and Header Handling

OkHttp provides the `Headers.Builder` and `Request.Builder` classes for constructing HTTP headers.

*   **`Headers.Builder`:**  Used to create a collection of headers. Methods like `add(String line)`, `add(String name, String value)`, `set(String name, String value)` are used to add or modify headers.
    *   **`add(String line)`:**  This method is particularly risky if used with user-controlled input as it takes a raw header line string. If not carefully validated, it can be easily exploited for newline injection and header splitting.
    *   **`add(String name, String value)` and `set(String name, String value)`:** These methods are generally safer as they separate header names and values. However, even with these, if the `value` is derived from unsanitized user input, injection is still possible.

*   **`Request.Builder`:** Used to build an HTTP request. The `headers(Headers headers)` method is used to set the headers for the request, typically using a `Headers` object built with `Headers.Builder`.

**Vulnerability Point:**  Neither `Headers.Builder` nor `Request.Builder` performs automatic sanitization or validation of header names or values. They are designed to be flexible and allow developers to construct headers as needed. The responsibility for secure header construction lies entirely with the application developer.

#### 4.4 Code Examples: Vulnerable and Secure Practices

**Vulnerable Code Example (Java):**

```java
import okhttp3.Headers;
import okhttp3.OkHttpClient;
import okhttp3.Request;
import okhttp3.Response;

import java.io.IOException;

public class VulnerableHeaderInjection {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        String userProvidedHeaderValue = args[0]; // User input from command line

        OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();
        Headers headers = new Headers.Builder()
                .add("X-Custom-User-Header", userProvidedHeaderValue) // Directly using user input
                .build();

        Request request = new Request.Builder()
                .url("https://example.com/api")
                .headers(headers)
                .build();

        try (Response response = client.newCall(request).execute()) {
            System.out.println("Response code: " + response.code());
            System.out.println("Response body: " + response.body().string());
        }
    }
}
```

**Running the vulnerable code with malicious input:**

```bash
java VulnerableHeaderInjection "evil\nX-Injected-Header: Malicious"
```

In this vulnerable example, if `userProvidedHeaderValue` contains newline characters and additional headers, it could lead to header splitting or injection.

**Secure Code Example (Java):**

```java
import okhttp3.Headers;
import okhttp3.OkHttpClient;
import okhttp3.Request;
import okhttp3.Response;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class SecureHeaderConstruction {

    private static final Pattern ALLOWED_HEADER_VALUE_PATTERN = Pattern.compile("^[a-zA-Z0-9\\-_.,;:= ]*$"); // Whitelist pattern

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        String userProvidedHeaderValue = args[0]; // User input from command line

        if (!isValidHeaderValue(userProvidedHeaderValue)) {
            System.err.println("Invalid header value provided.");
            return;
        }

        OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();
        Headers headers = new Headers.Builder()
                .add("X-Custom-User-Header", userProvidedHeaderValue) // Using validated input
                .build();

        Request request = new Request.Builder()
                .url("https://example.com/api")
                .headers(headers)
                .build();

        try (Response response = client.newCall(request).execute()) {
            System.out.println("Response code: " + response.code());
            System.out.println("Response body: " + response.body().string());
        }
    }

    private static boolean isValidHeaderValue(String value) {
        if (value == null || value.isEmpty()) {
            return true; // Allow empty values if needed, adjust as per requirements
        }
        return ALLOWED_HEADER_VALUE_PATTERN.matcher(value).matches();
    }
}
```

**Secure practices demonstrated in the example:**

*   **Input Validation:** The `isValidHeaderValue` method implements a whitelist-based validation using a regular expression (`ALLOWED_HEADER_VALUE_PATTERN`). This pattern defines the allowed characters for header values.
*   **Sanitization (Implicit):** By validating against a whitelist, we are implicitly sanitizing the input by rejecting any characters outside the allowed set.
*   **Error Handling:** The code handles invalid input by printing an error message and exiting, preventing the vulnerable header construction.

**Further Security Enhancements:**

*   **Contextual Validation:**  The validation logic should be tailored to the specific header and its intended purpose. For example, if the header is expected to be a number, validate it as a number.
*   **Encoding (If Necessary):** In some cases, URL encoding or other forms of encoding might be necessary depending on the header and server-side requirements. However, for general header values, strict validation is often more effective than complex encoding.
*   **Minimize User-Controlled Headers:**  The best approach is to avoid allowing users to directly control HTTP headers whenever possible. If custom headers are needed, use predefined options or structured data that the application safely translates into headers.

#### 4.5 Advanced Attack Scenarios (Beyond Basic Injection)

While basic header injection focuses on injecting single malicious headers, more advanced scenarios can involve:

*   **Newline Injection and Header Splitting:** Injecting newline characters (`\r\n` or `\n`) within header values can lead to header splitting. This can allow attackers to inject multiple headers or even craft entirely new HTTP requests within the same connection, potentially leading to request smuggling or other server-side vulnerabilities.
*   **Combining Header Injection with Other Vulnerabilities:** Header injection can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to amplify their impact. For example, combining header injection with a server-side XSS vulnerability can create a more potent attack vector.
*   **Exploiting Server-Side Header Parsing Quirks:** Different servers and server-side frameworks might have subtle differences in how they parse HTTP headers. Attackers can exploit these quirks by crafting headers that are interpreted differently by different components in the request processing chain, potentially leading to bypasses or unexpected behavior.

#### 4.6 Detection and Prevention Techniques (Expanded)

Beyond the basic mitigation strategies, here are more detailed detection and prevention techniques:

**Detection:**

*   **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** WAFs can be configured to detect and block requests containing suspicious header patterns or known header injection attack signatures.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Network-based IDS/IPS can monitor network traffic for patterns indicative of header injection attacks.
*   **Security Auditing and Logging:**  Comprehensive logging of HTTP requests and responses, including headers, can help in detecting and investigating potential header injection attempts. Analyze logs for unusual header values or patterns.
*   **Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Scanning:**  Regular penetration testing and vulnerability scanning should include tests for HTTP Header Injection vulnerabilities. Use tools and manual techniques to identify vulnerable code paths.
*   **Code Reviews:**  Thorough code reviews, especially focusing on code sections that construct HTTP headers using user input, are crucial for identifying potential vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.

**Prevention (Expanded):**

*   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (Detailed):**
    *   **Whitelist Approach:** Define strict whitelists of allowed characters, patterns, and values for each header. Use regular expressions or custom validation logic to enforce these whitelists.
    *   **Contextual Validation:** Validate header values based on their intended purpose and expected format. For example, if a header is expected to be an integer, validate it as an integer.
    *   **Reject Invalid Input:**  Reject requests with invalid header values and provide informative error messages to the user (while avoiding revealing sensitive information in error messages).
    *   **Escape Output (If Necessary):** If header values are ever displayed or logged, ensure they are properly encoded to prevent any potential interpretation as code (e.g., HTML encoding for display in web pages).

*   **Avoid User-Controlled Headers (Best Practice):**
    *   **Predefined Header Options:**  Instead of allowing users to provide arbitrary header values, offer a limited set of predefined header options or structured data that the application can safely translate into headers.
    *   **Abstraction Layers:**  Create abstraction layers that handle header construction internally, shielding the application code from directly manipulating raw header values based on user input.

*   **Secure OkHttp API Usage:**
    *   **Prefer `add(String name, String value)` and `set(String name, String value)`:** Use these methods instead of `add(String line)` whenever possible, as they provide better control and reduce the risk of newline injection.
    *   **Immutable Headers:**  Use `Headers.Builder` to construct headers and then build an immutable `Headers` object. This helps ensure that headers are not modified after creation.

*   **Security Libraries and Frameworks:**  Utilize security libraries and frameworks that provide built-in input validation and sanitization capabilities.

*   **Regular Security Training:**  Educate developers about common web security vulnerabilities, including HTTP Header Injection, and secure coding practices.

#### 4.7 Testing Strategies

To effectively test for HTTP Header Injection vulnerabilities in OkHttp applications, consider the following strategies:

*   **Manual Testing with Proxy Tools (Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP):**
    *   **Intercept Requests:** Use a proxy tool to intercept HTTP requests sent by the application.
    *   **Modify Headers:** Manually modify header values in the intercepted requests to inject malicious payloads (e.g., newline characters, `X-Forwarded-For`, `Set-Cookie`, XSS payloads).
    *   **Analyze Server Response:** Observe the server's response to identify if the injected headers are being processed as intended by the attacker. Look for changes in application behavior, bypassed security controls, or error messages.

*   **Automated Vulnerability Scanning:**
    *   **Specialized Scanners:** Use web vulnerability scanners that are capable of detecting HTTP Header Injection vulnerabilities. Configure the scanner to target the application and its API endpoints.
    *   **Custom Scripts:** Develop custom scripts or tools to automate the process of injecting various header payloads and analyzing server responses.

*   **Code Review and Static Analysis:**
    *   **Static Analysis Tools:** Use static analysis tools to scan the application's source code for potential header injection vulnerabilities. Configure the tools to identify code patterns where user input is used to construct HTTP headers without proper validation.
    *   **Manual Code Review:** Conduct manual code reviews, focusing on code sections that handle user input and construct HTTP requests using OkHttp.

*   **Fuzzing:**
    *   **Header Fuzzing:** Use fuzzing techniques to send a wide range of invalid and malicious header values to the application to identify unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

#### 4.8 Tools and Resources

*   **Burp Suite:** A popular web security testing proxy tool that is excellent for manual testing of header injection vulnerabilities.
*   **OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy):** A free and open-source web security scanner that can be used for automated vulnerability scanning, including header injection.
*   **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) Tools:** Tools like SonarQube, Checkmarx, Fortify can be used for static code analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   **OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project):**  A valuable resource for information on web security vulnerabilities, including HTTP Header Injection. Refer to OWASP documentation and guides for best practices and mitigation strategies.
*   **PortSwigger Web Security Academy:** Offers excellent online training and labs on web security vulnerabilities, including header injection.

#### 4.9 Impact Reassessment

The initial risk severity assessment of **High** for HTTP Header Injection is **justified and remains accurate**.  While OkHttp itself is not the source of the vulnerability, the potential impact of successful header injection attacks in applications using OkHttp can be significant.

**Reasons for High Severity:**

*   **Bypass of Security Controls:** Header injection can directly lead to the bypass of critical security controls like IP whitelisting, authentication mechanisms, and access control rules.
*   **Session Hijacking and User Impersonation:**  Session manipulation through header injection can allow attackers to hijack user sessions and impersonate legitimate users.
*   **Potential for Server-Side Exploits:** In advanced scenarios, header injection can be a stepping stone to more severe server-side vulnerabilities like request smuggling or XSS (in specific server configurations).
*   **Wide Applicability:** HTTP Header Injection is a common vulnerability in web applications, and applications using OkHttp are susceptible if proper precautions are not taken.
*   **Ease of Exploitation:**  Basic header injection attacks can be relatively easy to execute, especially if input validation is weak or non-existent.

#### 4.10 Conclusion and Recommendations

HTTP Header Injection is a serious attack surface in applications using OkHttp. While OkHttp provides the tools to construct HTTP requests, it is the responsibility of the development team to ensure that user-controlled input is handled securely and does not lead to header injection vulnerabilities.

**Key Recommendations for Development Teams:**

1.  **Prioritize Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user-controlled input that is used to construct HTTP headers. Use whitelist-based validation and reject invalid input.
2.  **Minimize User-Controlled Headers:**  Avoid allowing users to directly control HTTP headers whenever possible. Use predefined options or structured data instead.
3.  **Use OkHttp API Securely:**  Prefer `add(String name, String value)` and `set(String name, String value)` over `add(String line)`.
4.  **Conduct Regular Security Testing:**  Incorporate HTTP Header Injection testing into your regular security testing processes, including manual testing, automated scanning, and code reviews.
5.  **Educate Developers:**  Provide security training to developers to raise awareness about HTTP Header Injection and secure coding practices.
6.  **Implement WAFs and IDS/IPS:**  Deploy Web Application Firewalls and Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems to detect and block header injection attacks at the network level.
7.  **Adopt a Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC):** Integrate security considerations into all phases of the software development lifecycle, from design to deployment and maintenance.

By diligently implementing these recommendations, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of HTTP Header Injection vulnerabilities in their OkHttp-based applications and enhance the overall security posture of their systems.
