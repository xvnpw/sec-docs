## Attack Tree Path: [Improper Certificate Validation](./attack_tree_paths/improper_certificate_validation.md)

*   **Description:** This is a critical vulnerability stemming from misconfigurations in how OkHttp handles TLS/SSL certificates. It allows attackers to intercept and potentially modify encrypted communication between the application and the server.
*   **Sub-Paths:**
    *   **{<<No Hostname Verification>>}**
        *   **Description:** The application is configured to skip hostname verification during the TLS handshake. This means the application will accept a certificate from *any* server, even if the certificate's Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternative Name (SAN) doesn't match the intended host.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. They present a valid certificate for a different domain (e.g., `attacker.com`) to the application when it tries to connect to `example.com`. Because hostname verification is disabled, the application accepts the invalid certificate, and the attacker can decrypt and modify the traffic.
        *   **Mitigation:**  **Never disable hostname verification in production.** Use the default `HostnameVerifier` or a secure custom implementation. Enforce strict hostname validation. Consider certificate pinning.

    *   **{<<Ignore Certificate Errors>>}**
        *   **Description:** The application's `TrustManager` is configured to accept *all* certificates, even those that are invalid (e.g., expired, self-signed, issued by an untrusted CA).
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Attack Scenario:** Similar to the "No Hostname Verification" scenario, an attacker performs a MITM attack. They present an invalid certificate (e.g., a self-signed certificate) to the application. Because the application ignores certificate errors, it accepts the invalid certificate, allowing the attacker to intercept the communication.
        *   **Mitigation:** **Never ignore certificate errors in production.** Use the system's default trust manager or a secure custom implementation that properly validates certificates. Implement robust certificate validation logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** OkHttp, like any software, relies on other libraries (dependencies). These dependencies can have their own vulnerabilities, which can be exploited to compromise the application using OkHttp.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Variable (Depends on the specific vulnerability, can range from Low to Very High)
*   **Effort:** Variable (Depends on the vulnerability)
*   **Skill Level:** Variable (Depends on the vulnerability)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (Vulnerability scanners can easily identify known issues)
*   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker identifies a known vulnerability in a library that OkHttp depends on (e.g., a vulnerable version of Gson used for JSON parsing). The attacker crafts a malicious input (e.g., a specially crafted JSON payload) that exploits this vulnerability. When OkHttp processes this input (e.g., when parsing a JSON response), the vulnerability is triggered, potentially leading to code execution, data leakage, or denial of service.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Use a dependency vulnerability scanner (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, Dependabot).
    *   Keep all dependencies up-to-date.
    *   Use a software bill of materials (SBOM) to track dependencies.
    *   Implement robust input validation and output encoding to mitigate the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
