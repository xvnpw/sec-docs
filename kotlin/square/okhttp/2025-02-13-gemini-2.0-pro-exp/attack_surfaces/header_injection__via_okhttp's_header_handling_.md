Okay, let's perform a deep analysis of the "Header Injection (via OkHttp's Header Handling)" attack surface.

## Deep Analysis: Header Injection in OkHttp

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with header injection vulnerabilities when using OkHttp, identify specific code patterns that are susceptible, and provide concrete, actionable recommendations for developers to prevent this vulnerability.  We aim to go beyond the general description and provide practical guidance.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on header injection vulnerabilities arising from the misuse of OkHttp's `Headers.Builder` class and related methods for constructing HTTP request headers.  It covers:

*   How OkHttp handles header names and values.
*   Common developer mistakes that lead to injection vulnerabilities.
*   Specific attack vectors enabled by header injection.
*   Robust mitigation techniques, including code examples and best practices.
*   Testing strategies to detect and prevent header injection.

We will *not* cover:

*   Header injection vulnerabilities in other HTTP client libraries.
*   Vulnerabilities unrelated to OkHttp's header handling (e.g., SQL injection, XSS in the response body).
*   Server-side vulnerabilities that might be *exploited* by header injection, but are not directly caused by OkHttp usage (e.g., a vulnerable web server that misinterprets injected headers).

**Methodology:**

1.  **OkHttp API Review:** Examine the relevant parts of the OkHttp API documentation (`Headers`, `Headers.Builder`, `Request.Builder`) to understand the intended usage and potential pitfalls.
2.  **Code Pattern Analysis:** Identify common, insecure coding patterns that developers might use when constructing headers with user-supplied data.
3.  **Attack Vector Exploration:** Detail specific attack scenarios, such as request smuggling, response splitting, and cache poisoning, demonstrating how they can be achieved through header injection in OkHttp.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:** Provide concrete, practical mitigation strategies, including code examples and best practices, to prevent header injection.  This will include both preventative measures and defensive coding techniques.
5.  **Testing Strategy Recommendation:** Outline testing approaches, including unit tests and potentially fuzzing, to identify and prevent header injection vulnerabilities.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

#### 2.1 OkHttp API Review

The key classes involved are:

*   **`Headers`:** Represents an immutable collection of HTTP headers.
*   **`Headers.Builder`:**  Used to construct `Headers` objects.  Relevant methods include:
    *   `add(String name, String value)`: Adds a header with the specified name and value.  Crucially, this method *does* perform some basic validation, throwing an `IllegalArgumentException` if the name or value contains illegal characters *according to OkHttp's internal checks*. However, these checks are not a complete defense against all forms of header injection.
    *   `addUnsafeNonAscii(String name, String value)`: Adds a header, allowing non-ASCII characters in the value. This method bypasses some of the built-in checks and is inherently more dangerous if used with unsanitized input.  **Avoid this method unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.**
    *   `set(String name, String value)`: Replaces any existing headers with the given name with a single header with the specified value.  Subject to the same validation as `add()`.
*   **`Request.Builder`:** Used to construct `Request` objects.  The `headers(Headers headers)` method sets the headers for the request.

The documentation explicitly states that header names and values should conform to RFC 7230 (and related RFCs).  However, it's the *developer's responsibility* to ensure this conformance. OkHttp provides some basic checks, but it's not a comprehensive security solution.

#### 2.2 Code Pattern Analysis (Insecure Examples)

The most common vulnerability pattern is directly incorporating user input into header values without proper sanitization or validation.

**Example 1: Unsanitized User Input**

```java
// Vulnerable Code!
String username = request.getParameter("username"); // User-provided input
Headers headers = new Headers.Builder()
    .add("X-User", username) // Directly using unsanitized input
    .build();

Request request = new Request.Builder()
    .url("https://example.com/api")
    .headers(headers)
    .build();

// ... send the request ...
```

If the `username` parameter contains newline characters (`\r` or `\n`) followed by malicious header content, this code is vulnerable.  For example, an attacker could provide:

`username=test%0D%0AEvil-Header: evil-value`

This would result in the following headers being sent:

```
X-User: test
Evil-Header: evil-value
```

**Example 2:  Incorrect String Concatenation**

```java
// Vulnerable Code!
String userId = request.getParameter("userId");
String headerValue = "User ID: " + userId; // Concatenating user input

Headers headers = new Headers.Builder()
    .add("X-User-Info", headerValue)
    .build();
// ...
```

This is vulnerable for the same reasons as Example 1.  String concatenation with user input is a major red flag.

**Example 3: Using `addUnsafeNonAscii` with Unsanitized Input**

```java
// Vulnerable Code! - Extremely Dangerous
String comment = request.getParameter("comment"); // User-provided, potentially non-ASCII
Headers headers = new Headers.Builder()
    .addUnsafeNonAscii("X-Comment", comment) // Bypassing checks, using unsanitized input
    .build();
// ...
```

This is highly vulnerable because it explicitly bypasses OkHttp's built-in checks for invalid characters.

#### 2.3 Attack Vector Exploration

*   **Request Smuggling:** By injecting `Content-Length` or `Transfer-Encoding` headers, an attacker can cause the server to misinterpret the request boundaries, potentially leading to the attacker's malicious request being processed as part of a subsequent legitimate request.  This is particularly dangerous in environments with front-end proxies and back-end servers.

    *   **Example:** Injecting a `Content-Length` header that is smaller than the actual request body.  The server might process only part of the request, leaving the remaining part (containing the attacker's malicious payload) to be prepended to the next request.

*   **Response Splitting:** By injecting newline characters and additional headers into a *response* header (if the server reflects user-supplied data into response headers), an attacker can craft a completely separate HTTP response.  This can be used to inject malicious content, redirect the user to a phishing site, or perform XSS attacks.  While this is primarily a server-side vulnerability, understanding it helps illustrate the dangers of header injection.

*   **Cache Poisoning:** By injecting headers like `Cache-Control`, an attacker can manipulate the caching behavior of proxies and browsers.  This can lead to malicious content being served to other users from the cache.

    *   **Example:** Injecting a `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600` header into a response that should not be cached.

*   **Session Fixation:** By injecting a `Set-Cookie` header, an attacker can set the victim's session ID to a known value, allowing the attacker to hijack the victim's session.

#### 2.4 Mitigation Strategies

The core principle is: **Never trust user input.  Always validate and sanitize.**

1.  **Strict Input Validation:**
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Characters:** Define a strict whitelist of allowed characters for each header value based on its expected format.  Reject any input that contains characters outside the whitelist.  For example, a user ID might only allow alphanumeric characters and underscores.
    *   **Regular Expressions:** Use regular expressions to enforce specific patterns for header values.  This is particularly useful for headers with well-defined formats (e.g., email addresses, dates).
    *   **Length Limits:** Impose reasonable length limits on header values to prevent excessively long inputs that might be used for denial-of-service attacks or to exploit buffer overflows.

2.  **Header Sanitization:**
    *   **Remove Newline Characters:**  Always remove or replace newline characters (`\r` and `\n`) from user-supplied data before using it in headers.  This is the most critical step to prevent header injection.
    *   **Encode Special Characters:**  Consider URL-encoding or using other appropriate encoding schemes for header values that might contain special characters. However, be careful not to double-encode.
    *   **Dedicated Sanitization Library:** Use a well-tested library specifically designed for header sanitization. This can provide a more robust and comprehensive solution than rolling your own.

3.  **Defensive Coding Practices:**
    *   **Avoid String Concatenation:**  Never directly concatenate user input with other strings to construct header values.  Use the `Headers.Builder` methods appropriately.
    *   **Avoid `addUnsafeNonAscii`:**  Unless absolutely necessary, avoid using the `addUnsafeNonAscii` method. If you must use it, ensure the input is meticulously validated and sanitized.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Only include headers that are absolutely necessary for the request.  Don't add unnecessary headers, especially those based on user input.

**Example (Mitigated Code):**

```java
// Mitigated Code
String username = request.getParameter("username");

// 1. Validate: Allow only alphanumeric characters and underscores, max length 32
if (username == null || !username.matches("^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{1,32}$")) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid username");
}

// 2. Sanitize (not strictly needed here because of the validation, but good practice)
username = username.replace("\r", "").replace("\n", "");

Headers headers = new Headers.Builder()
    .add("X-User", username) // Now safe to use
    .build();

Request request = new Request.Builder()
    .url("https://example.com/api")
    .headers(headers)
    .build();

// ... send the request ...
```

#### 2.5 Testing Strategies

*   **Unit Tests:**
    *   Create unit tests that specifically target the header-building logic.
    *   Test with valid and invalid inputs, including:
        *   Empty strings
        *   Strings with only whitespace
        *   Strings with newline characters (`\r`, `\n`, `\r\n`)
        *   Strings with special characters
        *   Strings exceeding length limits
        *   Strings with non-ASCII characters (if applicable)
    *   Assert that the resulting `Headers` object contains the expected values and does *not* contain any injected headers.

*   **Fuzzing:**
    *   Use a fuzzing tool to generate a large number of random or semi-random inputs for header values.
    *   Monitor the application for exceptions, errors, or unexpected behavior.
    *   Fuzzing can help uncover edge cases and vulnerabilities that might be missed by manual testing.

*   **Static Analysis:**
    *   Use static analysis tools to scan the codebase for potential header injection vulnerabilities.
    *   These tools can identify patterns of insecure code, such as direct concatenation of user input with header values.

*   **Dynamic Analysis (Security Testing):**
     * Use dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools to test the running application for header injection vulnerabilities. These tools can send specially crafted requests to the application and analyze the responses for signs of injection.

### 3. Conclusion

Header injection in OkHttp is a serious vulnerability that can lead to a variety of attacks. By understanding the underlying mechanisms, common insecure coding patterns, and effective mitigation strategies, developers can significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability.  The key takeaways are:

*   **Never trust user input.**
*   **Strictly validate and sanitize all data before using it in HTTP headers.**
