# Threat Model Analysis for square/okhttp

## Threat: [Insecure TLS Configuration](./threats/insecure_tls_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker could intercept communication if the application is configured to accept weak or outdated TLS versions (e.g., TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1) or weak cipher suites. The attacker performs a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack by exploiting the vulnerabilities in the weak encryption protocols.

**Impact:** Confidential data transmitted between the application and the server (including sensitive user information, API keys, etc.) could be exposed to the attacker.

**Affected Component:** `okhttp3.ConnectionSpec` (configuration of allowed TLS versions and cipher suites).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Explicitly configure `ConnectionSpec` to only allow secure TLS versions (TLS 1.2 or higher).
* Specify a list of strong, recommended cipher suites.
* Regularly update the application's dependencies to benefit from security updates in the underlying TLS implementation.

## Threat: [Disabled or Weak Hostname Verification](./threats/disabled_or_weak_hostname_verification.md)

**Description:** An attacker could perform a MITM attack if the application disables hostname verification or uses a custom `HostnameVerifier` that doesn't properly validate the server's certificate hostname against the requested hostname. The attacker presents a valid certificate for a different domain, and the application incorrectly trusts it.

**Impact:** The application could be tricked into communicating with a malicious server, potentially sending sensitive data to the attacker or receiving malicious responses.

**Affected Component:** `okhttp3.OkHttpClient.Builder.hostnameVerifier()` or custom `HostnameVerifier` implementations.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure proper hostname verification is enabled and rely on the default `HostnameVerifier`.
* If a custom `HostnameVerifier` is absolutely necessary, ensure it performs rigorous validation according to best practices. Thoroughly review and test any custom implementation.

## Threat: [Trusting User-Provided Certificate Authorities (CAs)](./threats/trusting_user-provided_certificate_authorities__cas_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could perform a MITM attack if the application is configured to trust Certificate Authorities (CAs) provided by the user or loaded from an untrusted source. The attacker installs a malicious CA on the user's device, allowing them to generate valid-looking certificates for any domain.

**Impact:** The application could be tricked into trusting connections to attacker-controlled servers, leading to data interception or manipulation.

**Affected Component:** `okhttp3.OkHttpClient.Builder.sslSocketFactory()` in conjunction with custom `TrustManagerFactory` or `X509TrustManager` implementations.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid trusting user-provided CAs. Rely on the system's default trust store or a carefully managed and vetted set of trusted CAs.
* If custom trust management is required, ensure the implementation is robust and secure.

## Threat: [Ignoring Certificate Errors](./threats/ignoring_certificate_errors.md)

**Description:** An attacker could perform a MITM attack if the application is configured to ignore certificate validation errors (e.g., using a permissive `TrustManager` that always returns true). The application will establish a connection even if the server's certificate is invalid, expired, or self-signed.

**Impact:** The application becomes vulnerable to MITM attacks, as it will trust any server regardless of its certificate validity.

**Affected Component:** `okhttp3.OkHttpClient.Builder.sslSocketFactory()` in conjunction with a permissive `X509TrustManager` implementation.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Never ignore certificate validation errors in production. Use the default `TrustManager` or a custom one that performs thorough validation.

## Threat: [Malicious Request Interceptor](./threats/malicious_request_interceptor.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains control over the application's code could inject a malicious request interceptor. This interceptor can modify outgoing requests, adding malicious headers, altering request bodies, or redirecting requests to attacker-controlled servers.

**Impact:** Sensitive data could be sent to unintended recipients, the application's functionality could be altered, or users could be redirected to phishing sites.

**Affected Component:** `okhttp3.OkHttpClient.Builder.addInterceptor()` or `okhttp3.OkHttpClient.Builder.addNetworkInterceptor()`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust security practices to prevent code injection vulnerabilities in the application.
* Carefully audit all request interceptors and their functionality.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when designing and implementing interceptors.

## Threat: [Malicious Response Interceptor](./threats/malicious_response_interceptor.md)

**Description:** Similar to malicious request interceptors, an attacker could inject a malicious response interceptor. This interceptor can modify incoming responses, altering data, injecting malicious content into the application's UI, or leaking sensitive information from the response.

**Impact:** The application could display incorrect or malicious information to the user, leading to confusion, data corruption, or further attacks. Sensitive data from the server could be exposed.

**Affected Component:** `okhttp3.OkHttpClient.Builder.addInterceptor()` or `okhttp3.OkHttpClient.Builder.addNetworkInterceptor()`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust security practices to prevent code injection vulnerabilities in the application.
* Carefully audit all response interceptors and their functionality.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when designing and implementing interceptors.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle via Malicious Proxy](./threats/man-in-the-middle_via_malicious_proxy.md)

**Description:** If the application is configured to use a proxy server, and that proxy server is compromised or malicious, an attacker controlling the proxy can intercept and modify all network traffic between the application and the intended server.

**Impact:** Sensitive data can be intercepted, requests can be manipulated, and malicious responses can be injected.

**Affected Component:** `okhttp3.OkHttpClient.Builder.proxy()` or `okhttp3.OkHttpClient.Builder.proxySelector()`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure proxy settings are obtained from trusted sources and are configured securely.
* If possible, avoid using proxies or use authenticated proxies.
* Even with a proxy, enforce HTTPS to encrypt communication between the application and the target server.

## Threat: [Insecure Cookie Handling](./threats/insecure_cookie_handling.md)

**Description:** If the application or the server doesn't properly configure cookie attributes (e.g., `HttpOnly`, `Secure`), attackers could exploit these weaknesses. Lack of `HttpOnly` allows JavaScript access to cookies, potentially leading to XSS-based session hijacking. Lack of `Secure` allows cookies to be transmitted over insecure HTTP connections.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Affected Component:** `okhttp3.CookieJar`, `okhttp3.Cookie`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure the server sets appropriate cookie attributes (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`).
* If the application needs to manage cookies directly using `CookieJar`, implement secure handling practices and avoid storing sensitive information in cookies unnecessarily.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in OkHttp](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_okhttp.md)

**Description:** Older versions of OkHttp might contain known security vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit.

**Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, attackers could potentially perform remote code execution, denial of service, or bypass security measures.

**Affected Component:** The entire OkHttp library.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update the OkHttp dependency to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
* Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for known issues in the used OkHttp version.
