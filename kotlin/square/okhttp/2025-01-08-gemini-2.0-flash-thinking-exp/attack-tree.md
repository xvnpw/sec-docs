## Attack Tree Path: [Downgrade TLS/SSL Protocol](./attack_tree_paths/downgrade_tlsssl_protocol.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker intercepts the initial TLS handshake between the application and the server. They manipulate the handshake process to force the use of older, vulnerable TLS or SSL versions (e.g., SSLv3, TLS 1.0). These older protocols have known security weaknesses that can be exploited to decrypt the communication.
    * **Underlying Vulnerability:**  The application or server allows negotiation of insecure TLS/SSL versions.
    * **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the confidentiality and integrity of the communication, allowing the attacker to eavesdrop on sensitive data and potentially modify requests and responses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Certificate Pinning Bypass -> Exploit Weak Pinning Implementation](./attack_tree_paths/certificate_pinning_bypass_-_exploit_weak_pinning_implementation.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application implements certificate pinning to ensure it only trusts connections to servers with specific, known certificates. However, the implementation is flawed. This could involve pinning to a common intermediate CA certificate instead of the leaf certificate, not handling certificate rotation properly, or having logic that can be bypassed through specific manipulations. The attacker leverages this weakness to present a rogue certificate signed by a compromised or trusted CA, bypassing the intended pinning security.
    * **Underlying Vulnerability:**  Flawed logic or insecure practices in the application's certificate pinning implementation.
    * **Impact:**  Allows a Man-in-the-Middle attack, negating the protection offered by certificate pinning.

## Attack Tree Path: [DNS Spoofing/Hijacking](./attack_tree_paths/dns_spoofinghijacking.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates the DNS resolution process to redirect the application's requests to a malicious server instead of the legitimate one. This can be achieved through various techniques like poisoning the DNS cache of the local resolver or by compromising the authoritative DNS server.
    * **Underlying Vulnerability:**  Lack of DNSSEC implementation or reliance on insecure DNS resolvers.
    * **Impact:**  The application connects to the attacker's server, allowing the attacker to steal credentials, serve malicious content, or intercept sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_deserialization.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application uses OkHttp to receive data in a serialized format (e.g., Java serialization, JSON with specific libraries). The attacker crafts a malicious serialized object that, when deserialized by the application, executes arbitrary code on the application's system.
    * **Underlying Vulnerability:**  The application deserializes untrusted data without proper validation or uses inherently insecure serialization formats.
    * **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to gain complete control over the application and potentially the underlying system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Stealing or Modifying Cookies](./attack_tree_paths/stealing_or_modifying_cookies.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the application or network to gain access to the user's session cookies. This could involve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, Man-in-the-Middle attacks (if HTTPS is not used or compromised), or other vulnerabilities that expose cookie data. Once the cookies are stolen, the attacker can impersonate the user. Alternatively, the attacker might modify cookies to escalate privileges or bypass authentication checks.
    * **Underlying Vulnerability:**  XSS vulnerabilities, lack of secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite), insecure network communication.
    * **Impact:**  Session hijacking, allowing the attacker to perform actions as the legitimate user, potentially accessing sensitive data or performing unauthorized operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Disabling Certificate Validation](./attack_tree_paths/disabling_certificate_validation.md)

**Attack Vector:** Developers mistakenly disable certificate validation in the OkHttp configuration (e.g., by using a TrustManager that trusts all certificates or a HostnameVerifier that always returns true). This removes a critical security check.
    * **Underlying Vulnerability:**  Developer error or misconfiguration.
    * **Impact:**  Completely bypasses TLS/SSL security, allowing trivial Man-in-the-Middle attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Using Custom, Vulnerable Trust Managers](./attack_tree_paths/using_custom__vulnerable_trust_managers.md)

**Attack Vector:** Developers implement custom `TrustManager` logic in OkHttp but introduce security flaws in the implementation. For example, the custom TrustManager might not correctly validate certificate chains or might have logic that can be bypassed.
    * **Underlying Vulnerability:**  Flaws in the custom `TrustManager` implementation due to lack of expertise or oversight.
    * **Impact:**  Potential for bypassing TLS/SSL security, allowing Man-in-the-Middle attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Hostname Verifier Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_hostname_verifier_configuration.md)

**Attack Vector:** Developers implement a custom `HostnameVerifier` in OkHttp that does not properly validate the hostname against the certificate's subject alternative names (SANs) or common name (CN). This allows an attacker to present a valid certificate for a different hostname, which the application will incorrectly trust.
    * **Underlying Vulnerability:**  Flaws in the custom `HostnameVerifier` implementation.
    * **Impact:**  Allows Man-in-the-Middle attacks by accepting certificates for incorrect hostnames.

## Attack Tree Path: [Reliance on Insecure Protocols (HTTP)](./attack_tree_paths/reliance_on_insecure_protocols__http_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application is configured to use plain HTTP instead of HTTPS for communication with a server. This means the communication is unencrypted.
    * **Underlying Vulnerability:**  Misconfiguration or lack of enforcement of HTTPS.
    * **Impact:**  All communication is transmitted in plaintext, allowing attackers to easily eavesdrop on sensitive data (including credentials) and potentially modify requests and responses.
