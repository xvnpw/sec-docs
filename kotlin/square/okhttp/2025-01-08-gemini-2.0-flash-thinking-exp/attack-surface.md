# Attack Surface Analysis for square/okhttp

## Attack Surface: [Malformed or Crafted URLs](./attack_surfaces/malformed_or_crafted_urls.md)

**Description:** An attacker can manipulate the URL used in an OkHttp request by injecting special characters or sequences.

**How OkHttp Contributes:** OkHttp uses the provided URL to construct and send HTTP requests. If the application doesn't sanitize or validate URLs before passing them to OkHttp, it becomes vulnerable.

**Example:** An application takes a user-provided string and appends it to a base URL. An attacker enters `..;/sensitive/data` which, when appended, could lead to accessing unintended resources if the server doesn't properly handle the `..;` sequence. OkHttp would then send a request with this crafted URL.

**Impact:** Access to unauthorized resources, server-side vulnerabilities exploitation (if the server mishandles the crafted URL), information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developer:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any data used to construct URLs *before* passing them to OkHttp. Use URL encoding for dynamic parts of the URL. Utilize URL builder classes provided by frameworks to avoid manual string concatenation.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/http_header_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious values into HTTP headers sent by OkHttp.

**How OkHttp Contributes:** OkHttp allows developers to set custom headers. If the values for these headers come from untrusted sources without proper sanitization, attackers can inject arbitrary header values that OkHttp will then include in the request.

**Example:** An application allows users to set a custom "User-Agent" header. An attacker injects `User-Agent: vulnerable\r\nMalicious-Header: attack`. OkHttp will include these headers in the outgoing request, potentially leading to HTTP Response Splitting if the server is vulnerable.

**Impact:** HTTP Response Splitting/Smuggling, bypassing security controls on the server, XSS if combined with response splitting.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developer:** Sanitize and validate all input used for setting HTTP header values *before* passing them to OkHttp. Avoid directly using user-provided input for critical headers. Use predefined constants or enums for header values where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TLS Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tls_configuration.md)

**Description:** The application uses a weak or outdated TLS configuration when establishing secure connections with OkHttp.

**How OkHttp Contributes:** OkHttp relies on the underlying Java/Android TLS implementation but allows for configuration of the `ConnectionSpec`. If the application doesn't configure OkHttp to enforce strong TLS protocols and cipher suites through its `ConnectionSpec`, it can be vulnerable.

**Example:** The application doesn't explicitly configure OkHttp to disable SSLv3 or weak ciphers. An attacker can perform a downgrade attack, forcing the OkHttp connection to use a less secure protocol susceptible to known vulnerabilities like POODLE.

**Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping on sensitive communication.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developer:** Configure OkHttp's `ConnectionSpec` to enforce strong TLS protocols (TLSv1.2 or higher) and secure cipher suites. Explicitly disable known vulnerable protocols and ciphers within the `ConnectionSpec`. Regularly update the application's dependencies and the underlying Java/Android environment.

## Attack Surface: [Improper Certificate Pinning](./attack_surfaces/improper_certificate_pinning.md)

**Description:** Incorrect implementation or lack of certificate pinning when using OkHttp to connect to critical servers.

**How OkHttp Contributes:** OkHttp provides the `CertificatePinner` class to implement certificate pinning for enhanced security. Incorrect usage or absence of pinning within OkHttp makes the application vulnerable.

**Example:** The application pins to an intermediate certificate authority instead of the leaf certificate using OkHttp's `CertificatePinner`. If that intermediate CA is compromised, the pinning provides no protection. Alternatively, not implementing pinning at all in OkHttp leaves the application vulnerable to MitM attacks.

**Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, allowing attackers to intercept and potentially modify communication with trusted servers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developer:** Implement certificate pinning correctly using OkHttp's `CertificatePinner`, pinning to the leaf certificate or a specific set of trusted certificates. Have a plan for certificate rotation and updating pins within the application's configuration. Consider using a backup pin. Thoroughly test the pinning implementation with OkHttp.
