## Deep Dive Analysis: HTTP Header Injection Attack Surface in OkHttp Applications

As a cybersecurity expert working with the development team, let's conduct a deep analysis of the HTTP Header Injection attack surface within applications utilizing the OkHttp library.

**Understanding the Core Vulnerability:**

The fundamental issue lies in the inherent trust that HTTP servers place in the headers they receive. Headers dictate crucial aspects of the communication, such as content type, caching behavior, authentication, and even the target resource. HTTP Header Injection exploits this trust by injecting malicious data into these headers, causing the server or intermediary systems to misinterpret or act upon this injected data.

**OkHttp's Role and the Attack Vector:**

OkHttp, as a powerful and widely used HTTP client, provides developers with fine-grained control over the HTTP requests they construct. This control, while beneficial for flexibility and customization, becomes a potential attack vector when dealing with untrusted input.

Specifically, the following OkHttp APIs are the primary contributors to this attack surface:

* **`Request.Builder.header(String name, String value)`:** This method directly sets a header with the provided name and value. If the `value` originates from an untrusted source without sanitization, it's a direct injection point.
* **`Request.Builder.addHeader(String name, String value)`:** Similar to `header()`, but adds a new header instead of replacing an existing one. This can be exploited in the same way.
* **`Interceptor` implementations:** Developers can create custom interceptors to modify requests before they are sent. If an interceptor manipulates headers based on unsanitized input, it introduces the same vulnerability.
* **Potentially less obvious scenarios:**
    * **Configuration files:** If header values are read from configuration files that are modifiable by attackers (e.g., through a separate vulnerability), this can lead to injection.
    * **Database entries:**  If header values are retrieved from a database that has been compromised, the injected values will be used by OkHttp.

**Deconstructing the Attack:**

Let's break down the attacker's methodology and the mechanics of the injection:

1. **Identifying Injection Points:** Attackers will look for any place in the application where user input or data from an external, potentially compromised source is used to set HTTP header values via OkHttp's APIs. This includes form fields, URL parameters, API responses, or even data read from files.

2. **Crafting the Malicious Payload:** The core of the attack lies in injecting specific control characters into the header value. The most critical are:
    * **`\r\n` (Carriage Return and Line Feed):** This is the fundamental delimiter between HTTP headers and the message body. Injecting this sequence allows the attacker to introduce new headers or even start a new HTTP response.
    * **Colon (`:`):** Used to separate the header name from its value. Attackers might manipulate this to create entirely new headers.

3. **Exploiting the Injection:** Once the malicious payload is injected into the header value, OkHttp faithfully includes it in the outgoing HTTP request. The receiving server or intermediary then processes this malformed request.

**Expanding on the Impact:**

The provided description highlights HTTP Response Splitting/Smuggling and XSS. Let's delve deeper into these and other potential impacts:

* **HTTP Response Splitting:** This is the most direct consequence of injecting `\r\n`. By injecting this sequence, the attacker can effectively terminate the current HTTP response and start a new one. This can lead to:
    * **Cache Poisoning:** Injecting a malicious response that gets cached by proxies or the client's browser, affecting subsequent requests from other users.
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By injecting a malicious `<script>` tag within the injected response, the attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, leading to credential theft, session hijacking, and other malicious activities.
    * **Defacement:** Injecting HTML content to alter the appearance of the web page.

* **HTTP Request Smuggling:** This is a more complex attack that exploits inconsistencies in how different HTTP servers and proxies parse HTTP requests. By carefully crafting injected headers, an attacker can send multiple requests within a single TCP connection, potentially bypassing security controls or routing requests to unintended backends.

* **Bypassing Security Controls:** As mentioned, security mechanisms like Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) often rely on inspecting HTTP headers. By injecting malicious headers, attackers might be able to bypass these controls. For example:
    * Injecting `X-Forwarded-For` to manipulate IP-based access control.
    * Injecting authentication headers to impersonate legitimate users (though this is less likely with proper authentication mechanisms).

* **Information Disclosure:** In some scenarios, injected headers might reveal sensitive information about the server or application.

* **Denial of Service (DoS):** While less common, crafting overly large or malformed headers could potentially lead to resource exhaustion on the server.

**Real-World Scenarios and Examples:**

Consider these scenarios where HTTP Header Injection via OkHttp could occur:

* **Custom User-Agent:** An application allows users to specify a custom User-Agent string for identification purposes. If this input isn't sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious headers.
* **Language Preference:** An application uses a header like `Accept-Language` based on user selection. Injection here could lead to response splitting and XSS.
* **API Integrations:** When integrating with third-party APIs, header values might be dynamically constructed based on data received from the external service. If that service is compromised, it could lead to header injection in outgoing requests from the application.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** If header values are logged without proper sanitization, injected malicious headers could compromise logging systems or even lead to command injection vulnerabilities in the logging infrastructure.

**Deep Dive into Mitigation Strategies:**

The provided mitigation strategies are a good starting point. Let's expand on them:

* **Robust Input Sanitization and Validation:** This is the **most critical** defense.
    * **Blacklisting is insufficient:** Relying on blacklisting specific characters like `\r` and `\n` can be easily bypassed with encoding or other techniques.
    * **Whitelisting is preferred:** Define an allowed set of characters or patterns for header values and reject any input that doesn't conform.
    * **Context-aware sanitization:** The sanitization logic should be tailored to the specific header being set. For example, the allowed characters for a `User-Agent` header might be different from an `Accept-Language` header.
    * **Encoding:** Consider encoding special characters (e.g., URL encoding) if they are necessary within the header value. However, be cautious as improper encoding can sometimes lead to bypasses.

* **Strictly Avoid User-Provided Input for Critical Headers:** Headers like `Host`, `Content-Length`, `Transfer-Encoding`, and authentication headers should **never** be directly derived from user input. These are fundamental to the HTTP protocol and their manipulation can have severe consequences.

* **Leverage Predefined Constants and Enums:** For common headers with a limited set of valid values (e.g., `Content-Type`), using predefined constants or enums significantly reduces the risk of injection.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not a direct mitigation for header injection, a strong CSP can significantly reduce the impact of XSS attacks that might result from response splitting. CSP allows developers to control the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the effectiveness of injected `<script>` tags.

* **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**  Proactive identification of potential injection points is crucial. Code reviews should specifically focus on how header values are constructed and where user input is involved. Static analysis tools can also help identify potential vulnerabilities.

* **Security Libraries and Frameworks:** Explore using security-focused libraries or frameworks that might provide built-in mechanisms for header sanitization or validation.

* **Server-Side Hardening:** While the focus is on the client-side (OkHttp), server-side hardening is also essential. Servers should be configured to be resilient against malformed requests and to properly handle unexpected header values.

* **Consider using OkHttp's `Headers.Builder`:** While not a direct mitigation, using `Headers.Builder` can encourage a more structured approach to header construction and might make it easier to identify potential injection points during code review.

**Conclusion:**

HTTP Header Injection is a serious vulnerability with potentially significant impact. When using OkHttp, developers must be acutely aware of the risks associated with setting header values based on untrusted input. A defense-in-depth approach, combining robust input sanitization, strict control over critical headers, proactive security measures, and server-side hardening, is essential to mitigate this attack surface effectively. By understanding the mechanics of the attack and the specific ways OkHttp can be exploited, development teams can build more secure applications. Our collaboration is crucial to ensure that security considerations are integrated throughout the development lifecycle.
