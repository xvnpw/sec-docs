Here are the high and critical threats directly involving Korge:

*   **Threat:** Platform-Specific Graphics Driver Vulnerability Exploitation
    *   **Description:** An attacker could craft specific game content or trigger rendering operations that exploit known vulnerabilities in the underlying graphics drivers (e.g., OpenGL, DirectX, Metal) used *by Korge*. This could involve sending specific rendering commands or data *through Korge's rendering API* that cause the driver to crash or execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential for arbitrary code execution on the user's machine if the driver vulnerability allows it.
    *   **Affected Korge Component:** `korim` module, specifically the platform-specific graphics backend implementations (e.g., `korim-desktop-jvm`, `korim-webgl`). Functions related to texture loading, shader compilation, and rendering commands are affected.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Users should keep their graphics drivers updated to the latest versions provided by their hardware vendors.
        *   Developers should be aware of common graphics driver vulnerabilities and try to avoid patterns in their Korge usage that might trigger them.
        *   Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms for rendering failures within the Korge application.

*   **Threat:** Maliciously Crafted Asset Causing Resource Exhaustion
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted asset (image, audio, model, etc.) that, when loaded and processed *by Korge's asset loading mechanisms*, consumes excessive system resources (CPU, memory, GPU). This could be achieved through extremely large file sizes, highly complex geometry, or recursive data structures within the asset file that Korge's parsing logic struggles with.
    *   **Impact:** Application slowdown, unresponsiveness, crash due to out-of-memory errors or CPU overload, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Korge Component:** Asset loading functions within various modules like `korio` (for general I/O), `korim` (for images), `korau` (for audio), and potentially custom asset loading logic *built on top of Korge's asset management*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement resource limits for asset loading *within the Korge application* (e.g., maximum texture size, polygon count).
        *   Validate asset integrity and format *before passing them to Korge's loading functions*.
        *   Use asynchronous asset loading *as provided by Korge* to prevent blocking the main thread.
        *   Implement proper error handling for asset loading failures *within the application's Korge usage*.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Platform-Specific Native Code Integration
    *   **Description:** When targeting native platforms (using Kotlin/Native), developers might integrate with platform-specific native code. Vulnerabilities in *Korge's interoperability layer* between Kotlin and native code, or insecure practices when calling native code from Korge, could be exploited.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution, memory corruption, application crash, or other platform-specific vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Korge Component:**  The Kotlin/Native runtime environment *as used by Korge* and any custom native code integrations *directly interacting with Korge components*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow secure coding practices for native code development.
        *   Thoroughly review and test native code integrations *within the Korge application*.
        *   Be aware of common vulnerabilities in the target platform's native APIs and how Korge interacts with them.
