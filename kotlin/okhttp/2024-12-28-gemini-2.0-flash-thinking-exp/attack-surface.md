Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving OkHttp, with high and critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious URLs leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
    *   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate the application to make requests to unintended locations, potentially internal resources or external systems, by controlling the URL used with OkHttp.
    *   **How OkHttp Contributes:** OkHttp is the mechanism through which the application makes the HTTP request to the attacker-controlled URL. It faithfully executes the request provided by the application.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, data breaches, denial of service against internal systems, potential for further exploitation of internal services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Attack Surface:** HTTP Header Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious HTTP headers into requests made by OkHttp if the application allows user-controlled input to populate header values without proper sanitization.
    *   **How OkHttp Contributes:** OkHttp provides methods to set custom headers. If the application uses user input directly in these methods, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Impact:**  Bypassing security checks on the target server, cache poisoning, cross-site scripting (XSS) if combined with other vulnerabilities, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration
    *   **Description:** The application configures OkHttp to use weak or outdated TLS/SSL protocols or cipher suites, making the communication vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and eavesdropping.
    *   **How OkHttp Contributes:** OkHttp allows customization of the `ConnectionSpec` used for TLS/SSL negotiation. Incorrect configuration weakens the security of the connection.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data interception, potential for data manipulation during transit.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Attack Surface:** Unvalidated Redirects
    *   **Description:** OkHttp automatically follows redirects. If the application doesn't validate the target of a redirect, an attacker could potentially trick the application into making requests to malicious sites.
    *   **How OkHttp Contributes:** OkHttp's default behavior is to follow redirects. The application needs to implement logic to control and validate these redirects.
    *   **Impact:** Open redirection attacks, where users are redirected to malicious sites, potentially leading to phishing or malware distribution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
