*   **Threat:** Malicious Processor Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker could introduce a compromised or intentionally malicious KSP processor into the project's dependencies. This could be done by convincing a developer to add a malicious dependency, compromising a legitimate processor's repository, or through typosquatting. The malicious processor would then execute arbitrary code during the compilation process *via the KSP Processor Interface*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Critical:** Injection of arbitrary code into the application's bytecode, potentially leading to remote code execution on user devices.
        *   **High:** Exfiltration of sensitive data from the build environment (e.g., environment variables, secrets, source code).
        *   **High:** Modification of build artifacts to introduce backdoors or vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected KSP Component:** `Processor Interface`, `Gradle Plugin`
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet and review all KSP processors before adding them as dependencies.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in processor dependencies.
        *   Implement a process for verifying the integrity and authenticity of processors (e.g., using checksums or signatures).
        *   Restrict the permissions and capabilities of the build environment.
        *   Use dependency management tools with vulnerability scanning capabilities.

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Compromise of Legitimate Processor
    *   **Description:** An attacker could compromise the repository or distribution mechanism of a legitimate and widely used KSP processor. This would allow them to inject malicious code into updates of the processor, affecting all projects that depend on it. The malicious code would then be executed *through the KSP Processor Interface*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Critical:** Widespread injection of malicious code into applications using the compromised processor.
        *   **High:** Mass exfiltration of sensitive data from numerous build environments.
        *   **High:** Introduction of widespread vulnerabilities across many applications.
    *   **Affected KSP Component:** `Processor Interface`, `Gradle Plugin`
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Prefer processors from well-established and reputable sources with strong security practices.
        *   Monitor for security advisories and updates related to used processors.
        *   Consider using dependency pinning or locking to ensure consistent processor versions and prevent automatic updates of potentially compromised versions.
        *   Implement a process for verifying the integrity of downloaded processors.

*   **Threat:** Configuration Vulnerabilities Leading to Excessive Processor Access
    *   **Description:** Incorrect or overly permissive configuration of KSP *within the Gradle Plugin* could grant processors more access than necessary. This could allow a compromised or malicious processor to access sensitive parts of the project or build environment *through the KSP Processor Interface*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **High:** Exposure of sensitive source code or build artifacts to a malicious processor.
    *   **Affected KSP Component:** `Gradle Plugin`, `Processor Interface`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring KSP processor access.
        *   Carefully review and understand the configuration options for each processor within the KSP Gradle plugin configuration.
        *   Restrict the directories and files that processors can access through KSP configuration.
        *   Regularly review KSP configuration for potential security weaknesses.

*   **Threat:** Generation of Vulnerable Code
    *   **Description:** A poorly written or intentionally malicious KSP processor could generate code that contains security vulnerabilities *through its implementation of the KSP Processor Interface*. This could introduce weaknesses into the application without the developers explicitly writing the vulnerable code.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **High:** Introduction of common web application vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection) if the generated code handles user input.
        *   **High:** Introduction of logic errors that can be exploited by attackers.
    *   **Affected KSP Component:** `Processor Interface`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly test and review the generated code for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Choose processors from reputable sources known for producing secure code.
        *   Implement static analysis tools to scan the generated code.
        *   Understand the code generation logic of the processors being used.
        *   Consider using processors that have undergone security audits.

*   **Threat:** Build Process Manipulation via Malicious Processor Actions
    *   **Description:** A malicious KSP processor could manipulate the build process in unexpected ways *through its interaction with the Gradle Plugin and the Processor Interface*, potentially bypassing security checks or introducing vulnerabilities outside of the generated code itself.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **High:** Modification of build outputs (e.g., injecting malicious libraries or resources).
    *   **Affected KSP Component:** `Processor Interface`, `Gradle Plugin`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Monitor build logs for suspicious activity or unexpected processor behavior.
        *   Implement integrity checks for build artifacts.
        *   Restrict the actions that KSP processors can perform during the build process through KSP configuration or build environment restrictions.
        *   Isolate the build environment to limit the impact of malicious actions.
