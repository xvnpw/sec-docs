* **Attack Surface:** Malicious or Vulnerable Symbol Processors
    * **Description:**  A symbol processor, either intentionally malicious or containing vulnerabilities, executes arbitrary code during the build process.
    * **How KSP Contributes:** KSP's core function is to execute these processors. If a processor is compromised, KSP provides the execution environment.
    * **Example:** A developer includes a seemingly helpful annotation processor from an untrusted source. This processor, in reality, injects code to exfiltrate environment variables containing API keys during the build.
    * **Impact:**  Critical - Can lead to complete compromise of the build environment, code injection into the application, and exposure of sensitive information.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *  Thoroughly vet and audit all symbol processors used in the project.
        *  Only use processors from trusted and reputable sources.
        *  Implement a process for reviewing and approving new processor dependencies.
        *  Consider using static analysis tools on processor code if source is available.
        *  Employ dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in processor dependencies.

* **Attack Surface:** Supply Chain Attacks via Processor Dependencies
    * **Description:**  A dependency of a symbol processor is compromised, indirectly affecting the security of the application build.
    * **How KSP Contributes:** KSP relies on the execution of symbol processors, which in turn can have their own dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these transitive dependencies can be exploited during the KSP execution.
    * **Example:** A popular logging library used by a seemingly benign annotation processor has a known remote code execution vulnerability. When KSP executes this processor, the vulnerable library is loaded, potentially allowing an attacker to exploit it.
    * **Impact:** High - Can lead to build system compromise, code injection, and data breaches, although the attack vector is indirect.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *  Utilize dependency management tools with vulnerability scanning capabilities.
        *  Regularly update processor dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *  Employ Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track dependencies.
        *  Consider using dependency pinning or locking to ensure consistent and known dependency versions.

* **Attack Surface:** Exploitation of KSP Framework Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:**  Vulnerabilities within the KSP framework itself are exploited to manipulate the symbol processing process or gain unauthorized access.
    * **How KSP Contributes:** KSP is the execution environment and the core library handling symbol processing. Bugs or security flaws within KSP directly expose the build process.
    * **Example:** A bug in KSP's annotation parsing logic allows a specially crafted annotation to trigger a buffer overflow, leading to arbitrary code execution during the build.
    * **Impact:** Critical - Could allow attackers to gain full control over the build process, inject malicious code, or cause significant disruption.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *  Keep KSP updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
        *  Monitor KSP release notes and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities.
        *  Report any suspected vulnerabilities in KSP to the maintainers.

* **Attack Surface:** Input Manipulation via Annotations and Source Code
    * **Description:**  Carefully crafted annotations or source code are used to exploit vulnerabilities in KSP or symbol processors, leading to unexpected code generation or resource exhaustion.
    * **How KSP Contributes:** KSP processes annotations and source code as input for symbol processors. If this input is malicious, it can trigger vulnerabilities during processing.
    * **Example:** A specially crafted annotation, when processed by a vulnerable symbol processor, causes it to generate an extremely large amount of code, leading to a denial-of-service during compilation.
    * **Impact:** High - Can lead to build failures, resource exhaustion, or the generation of vulnerable code.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *  Sanitize and validate inputs processed by custom symbol processors.
        *  Implement limits on the complexity and size of annotations processed.
        *  Thoroughly test symbol processors with various input scenarios, including potentially malicious ones.
