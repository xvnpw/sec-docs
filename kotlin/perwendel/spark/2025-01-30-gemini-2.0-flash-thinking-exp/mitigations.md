## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Session Configuration (Spark Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_session_configuration__spark_specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Spark Session Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure HTTP-Only Flag in Spark:** Utilize Spark's session handling configuration (if you are using Spark's built-in session management, or a library integrated with Spark) to ensure the `HttpOnly` flag is set for session cookies. This is typically done programmatically when setting up your Spark application.
    2.  **Configure Secure Flag in Spark:** Similarly, configure Spark to set the `Secure` flag for session cookies. This ensures cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS, and is also usually configured programmatically during Spark application setup.
    3.  **Set Session Timeout in Spark:** Define an appropriate session timeout value within your Spark application's session management configuration. This is often done by setting properties or using session management APIs provided by Spark or integrated libraries.
    4.  **Implement Session Regeneration (if applicable to your session management):** If your session management approach allows, implement session ID regeneration after successful authentication within your Spark application logic. This might involve using session management libraries or custom code within your Spark routes.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Session Hijacking (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of attackers stealing session cookies and impersonating users.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) based Session Theft (Medium Severity):**  `HttpOnly` flag mitigates session theft via XSS.
    *   **Session Fixation (Medium Severity):** Session regeneration prevents session fixation attacks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Medium Reduction - Reduces risk by making session cookies harder to steal and limiting session lifetime.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) based Session Theft:** High Reduction - Effectively prevents JavaScript access to session cookies.
    *   **Session Fixation:** High Reduction - Effectively prevents session fixation attacks.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Session management is used, but explicit configuration of `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags within Spark's context is not confirmed. Session timeout might be default, and session regeneration is likely not implemented within Spark logic.
    *   **Location:** Potentially in Spark application startup code where session handling is initialized.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Explicitly configure `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags when setting up session management within your Spark application code.
    *   Review and adjust session timeout value within Spark's session configuration based on security requirements.
    *   Implement session ID regeneration within your Spark application's authentication flow if your session management approach supports it.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Error Handling (Spark Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_error_handling__spark_specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Spark Error Handling
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Custom Error Handling in Spark:** Utilize Spark's exception handling mechanisms (e.g., `exception()` filters in Spark routes) to define custom error handling logic.
    2.  **Display Generic Error Responses via Spark:** Within your custom Spark error handlers, ensure you return generic error responses (e.g., HTTP 500 Internal Server Error with a simple message) to users in production. Avoid directly outputting detailed error messages or stack traces in responses served by Spark.
    3.  **Log Detailed Errors Server-Side (Outside Spark Response):**  Within your Spark error handlers, implement logging to capture detailed error information (stack traces, request details) to server-side logs. Ensure this logging is done separately from the response sent back to the user.
    4.  **Sanitize Error Messages in Spark Handlers:** If you must display any error messages to users via Spark responses (e.g., for specific validation errors), carefully sanitize these messages to remove any sensitive internal details before they are sent in the Spark response.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Prevents leakage of sensitive information through verbose error messages served by Spark.
    *   **Application Debugging Information Leakage (Low Severity):** Reduces exposure of internal application details that could aid attackers through Spark's error responses.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Medium Reduction - Reduces risk by preventing direct exposure of sensitive information in error messages served by Spark.
    *   **Application Debugging Information Leakage:** Low Reduction - Minimizes the information available to attackers through Spark's error responses.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Default Spark error handling might be in use, potentially displaying stack traces in responses under certain conditions. Custom error handling within Spark routes is likely not fully implemented for security purposes.
    *   **Location:** Spark route definitions and potentially default Spark error handling configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement custom error handling using Spark's `exception()` filters in your route definitions.
    *   Configure these Spark error handlers to return generic error responses to users.
    *   Implement detailed server-side logging within Spark error handlers, separate from user responses.
    *   Review and sanitize any error messages that are intentionally displayed to users via Spark responses.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Route Design (Spark Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_route_design__spark_specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Spark Route Design
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid Sensitive Data in Spark Route Paths:** When defining routes in your Spark application (using `get()`, `post()`, etc.), avoid embedding sensitive data directly within the URL path or query parameters that are part of the route definition itself.
    2.  **Use Parameterized Routes Carefully in Spark:** When using parameterized routes in Spark (e.g., `get("/users/:id", ...)`), ensure that the parameters are used securely within your route handlers and are not directly exposed in ways that could lead to information disclosure or unauthorized access.
    3.  **Implement Route-Specific Authorization in Spark:** Within your Spark route handlers, implement authorization checks to control access to specific routes based on user roles or permissions. Utilize Spark's request context to access user authentication information and enforce authorization logic within each route handler.
    4.  **Validate Route Parameters in Spark Handlers:** In your Spark route handlers, validate any parameters extracted from the URL path or query parameters to ensure they conform to expected formats and ranges. This validation should be performed within the route handler logic itself.
    5.  **Consider Rate Limiting for Sensitive Spark Routes:** For sensitive routes defined in your Spark application (e.g., login routes), consider implementing rate limiting middleware or logic within your Spark application to prevent brute-force attacks. This might involve using external libraries or custom code integrated into your Spark routes.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via URL (Low Severity):** Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data in URLs defined in Spark routes.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Medium Severity):** Route-based authorization within Spark handlers prevents unauthorized access to specific functionalities exposed through Spark routes.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Rate limiting on sensitive Spark routes mitigates brute-force attacks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via URL:** Low Reduction - Minimizes the risk of accidental information disclosure in URLs defined in Spark.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** High Reduction - Effectively prevents unauthorized access to specific routes when authorization is properly implemented within Spark handlers.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Medium Reduction - Reduces the effectiveness of brute-force attacks on sensitive Spark routes by limiting request rates.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Route design is likely functional, but security considerations in route design within Spark might not be fully addressed. Route-based authorization might be partially implemented in some Spark handlers, but not consistently. Rate limiting on Spark routes is likely not implemented.
    *   **Location:** Route definitions within your Spark application code (using `get()`, `post()`, etc.). Authorization checks might be scattered across Spark route handlers.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Review all Spark route definitions to ensure no sensitive data is inadvertently exposed in URL paths or query parameters used in route definitions.
    *   Implement consistent route-based authorization within all relevant Spark route handlers.
    *   Implement rate limiting for sensitive routes defined in Spark, such as login endpoints.
    *   Document route design principles and authorization policies specifically related to your Spark application's routes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Spark Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_spark_configuration.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Spark Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Disable Unnecessary Spark Features:** Review the Spark framework's configuration options and disable any features or functionalities that are not essential for your application's operation. This reduces the potential attack surface of the Spark framework itself.
    2.  **Restrict Access to Spark Admin UI (Configuration):** If you are using Spark's Admin UI, configure Spark to restrict access to it. Ideally, disable the Admin UI in production environments if it's not actively needed for monitoring. If it is necessary, configure authentication and authorization for access to the Admin UI within Spark's configuration.
    3.  **Configure Secure Communication Channels in Spark (if applicable):** If your Spark application communicates with other services or components, configure Spark to use secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL) where applicable. This might involve configuring Spark's network settings or communication libraries used within your Spark application.
    4.  **Review Default Spark Configurations:** Review the default configuration settings of the Spark framework itself. Identify any settings that might have security implications and adjust them to more secure values. Pay particular attention to network-related settings, logging configurations, and any settings related to external access or data handling within Spark.
    5.  **Regularly Review Spark Configuration:** Establish a process for periodically reviewing your Spark framework's configuration settings to ensure they remain secure and aligned with current security best practices and your application's security requirements.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Admin UI (Medium Severity):** Prevents unauthorized access to Spark Admin UI, which could expose sensitive information or allow malicious actions against the Spark application.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Admin UI (Medium Severity):** Restricting access to Admin UI reduces the risk of information disclosure through Spark's administrative interface.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Medium Severity):** Secure communication channels configured in Spark prevent interception of sensitive data in transit between Spark and other components.
    *   **Exploitation of Unnecessary Features (Low Severity):** Disabling unnecessary Spark features reduces the attack surface of the Spark framework itself.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Admin UI:** Medium Reduction - Reduces risk by restricting access, but complete removal of the UI is more effective if not needed.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Admin UI:** Medium Reduction - Reduces risk by limiting access to the UI.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Medium Reduction - Reduces risk by encrypting communication channels configured within Spark.
    *   **Exploitation of Unnecessary Features:** Low Reduction - Minimally reduces the attack surface of the Spark framework.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Default Spark configuration is likely in use. Admin UI might be enabled with default access settings. Secure communication channels within Spark are probably not explicitly configured.
    *   **Location:** Spark configuration files (if external configuration is used) or embedded configuration within the Spark application's code.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Conduct a review of Spark's features and disable any that are not strictly necessary for your application.
    *   Restrict access to the Spark Admin UI, ideally disabling it in production or configuring authentication and authorization.
    *   Configure secure communication channels (TLS/SSL) for any communication involving Spark with other services or components.
    *   Document the secure Spark configuration settings and the rationale behind them.
