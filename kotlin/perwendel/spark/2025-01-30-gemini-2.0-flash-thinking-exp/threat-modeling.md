# Threat Model Analysis for perwendel/spark

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability (Jetty)](./threats/dependency_vulnerability__jetty_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in the Jetty web server dependency used by Spark. This could involve sending crafted requests to trigger the vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure. For example, an attacker might exploit a path traversal vulnerability in Jetty to access sensitive files or execute arbitrary code on the server through the Spark application.
*   **Impact:**  Compromise of the server, including potential data breach, complete system takeover, or service disruption.
*   **Affected Spark Component:** Jetty Dependency (indirectly Spark application)
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Spark to the latest version to benefit from updated and patched Jetty versions.
    *   Implement dependency scanning and vulnerability monitoring for Jetty and other dependencies used by your Spark application.
    *   Apply security patches for Jetty promptly when available, potentially by updating Spark or manually updating the Jetty dependency if possible and safe.
    *   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious requests that might target known Jetty vulnerabilities, providing an additional layer of defense.

## Threat: [Basic Session Management Vulnerabilities](./threats/basic_session_management_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits weaknesses inherent in Spark's basic session management design.  Since Spark provides minimal session handling out-of-the-box, developers might unknowingly introduce vulnerabilities if they rely solely on these defaults without implementing proper security measures. This could lead to session hijacking by intercepting session cookies (especially over HTTP), session fixation attacks, or session replay attacks. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to impersonate a legitimate user and gain unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, data breaches, impersonation of users, and potential manipulation of user data or application functionality.
*   **Affected Spark Component:** Session Management (Spark built-in, design choice of minimal session features)
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce HTTPS** for all application communication to encrypt session cookies and prevent session hijacking via network sniffing. This is crucial as Spark's default session handling doesn't enforce HTTPS.
    *   Configure session cookies with `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags programmatically within your Spark application to mitigate client-side script access and ensure cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS.
    *   Implement robust session timeout mechanisms and ensure proper session invalidation upon user logout to limit the lifespan of sessions and reduce the window of opportunity for attacks.
    *   Consider using more robust and feature-rich session management libraries or frameworks if Spark's built-in session handling is insufficient for your application's security requirements. This might involve integrating external session stores or libraries.
    *   Implement anti-CSRF tokens to protect against session-based Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks, as Spark doesn't provide built-in CSRF protection.

## Threat: [Lack of Built-in Security Features - Input Validation Bypass leading to Injection Vulnerabilities](./threats/lack_of_built-in_security_features_-_input_validation_bypass_leading_to_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits Spark's design philosophy of being lightweight and lacking many built-in security features.  Specifically, the absence of automatic input validation and output encoding in Spark means developers must manually implement these crucial security controls.  If developers fail to do so, attackers can inject malicious data through user inputs. This can lead to critical vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by injecting malicious scripts into responses, or SQL Injection if user input is directly used in database queries without sanitization.
*   **Impact:** XSS can lead to account hijacking, data theft, and website defacement. SQL Injection can lead to database compromise, data breaches, and complete application takeover, potentially exposing sensitive data or allowing for arbitrary code execution on the database server.
*   **Affected Spark Component:** Request Handling, Route Handlers (Developer implemented logic within Spark routes, Spark framework design itself)
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the type of injection vulnerability and its potential impact)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement **robust input validation** on **all** user inputs within your Spark route handlers. This should include whitelisting, blacklisting, regular expressions, and data type validation, depending on the expected input.
    *   **Always use parameterized queries or ORM frameworks** to interact with databases. This is essential to prevent SQL Injection vulnerabilities when handling user input in database queries.
    *   Employ **output encoding (escaping)** for **all** user-generated content before displaying it in web pages or responses. This prevents XSS vulnerabilities by neutralizing malicious scripts injected by attackers. Choose the appropriate encoding method based on the output context (e.g., HTML encoding, JavaScript encoding).
    *   Utilize established security libraries and frameworks for input validation and output encoding to ensure proper and consistent implementation across your Spark application.
    *   Conduct **regular security code reviews and penetration testing** specifically focused on input handling and output generation within your Spark application to proactively identify and fix potential injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Educate developers on secure coding practices and the importance of manual input validation and output encoding when using lightweight frameworks like Spark.
