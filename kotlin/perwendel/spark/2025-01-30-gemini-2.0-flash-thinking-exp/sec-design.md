# BUSINESS POSTURE

Spark is a micro web framework for Java and Kotlin designed to simplify web application development. The primary business priority for adopting Spark is to accelerate the development and deployment of web applications and APIs. This is particularly valuable for projects requiring rapid prototyping, microservices architecture, or lightweight web interfaces. The goal is to enable developers to quickly build and deploy web applications with minimal boilerplate code and configuration.

Key business risks associated with using Spark include:

- Risk of vulnerabilities in applications built with Spark due to developer error or framework limitations.
- Risk of performance bottlenecks if Spark is not used efficiently or if applications are not properly optimized.
- Risk of maintainability issues if applications become overly complex or if the framework evolves in incompatible ways.
- Risk of security vulnerabilities in Spark framework itself, requiring timely updates and patches.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for projects using Spark will largely depend on the development practices and deployment environment of the organization using it.  Assuming a typical modern software development lifecycle:

- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) might be used on application code built with Spark. Implementation location: CI/CD pipeline, developer workstations.
- security control: Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) might be used on deployed applications built with Spark. Implementation location: Staging and Production environments.
- security control: Dependency scanning might be used to identify vulnerable dependencies in application code. Implementation location: CI/CD pipeline, developer workstations.
- security control: Code reviews are likely performed for application code. Implementation location: Development process.
- security control: Access control lists (ACLs) and firewalls are likely in place in the deployment environment. Implementation location: Infrastructure layer (cloud provider, network devices).

Accepted risks:

- accepted risk:  Risk of zero-day vulnerabilities in Spark framework or its dependencies before patches are available.
- accepted risk:  Risk of misconfiguration of Spark applications leading to security vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk:  Risk of vulnerabilities introduced by third-party libraries used in Spark applications.
- accepted risk:  Risk of insufficient security awareness among developers leading to insecure coding practices.

Recommended security controls to implement:

- security control: Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) specifically for Spark framework and its dependencies to proactively identify and manage vulnerabilities.
- security control: Introduce security champions within development teams to promote secure coding practices and framework-specific security guidance.
- security control: Develop and enforce secure coding guidelines specific to Spark framework, addressing common pitfalls and best practices.
- security control: Implement regular security training for developers focusing on web application security and Spark framework specifics.

Security requirements for projects using Spark:

- Authentication:
  - Requirement: Applications should implement robust authentication mechanisms to verify user identity.
  - Requirement: Support for industry standard authentication protocols like OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, or SAML should be considered based on application needs.
  - Requirement: Secure storage of credentials and session management is essential.

- Authorization:
  - Requirement: Applications must implement fine-grained authorization to control user access to resources and functionalities.
  - Requirement: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) should be considered for managing permissions.
  - Requirement: Authorization decisions should be consistently enforced throughout the application.

- Input Validation:
  - Requirement: All user inputs must be validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting).
  - Requirement: Input validation should be performed on both client-side and server-side.
  - Requirement: Use of parameterized queries or ORM frameworks to mitigate SQL injection risks.
  - Requirement: Output encoding should be applied to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

- Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Sensitive data at rest and in transit must be encrypted.
  - Requirement: Use of HTTPS for all communication to protect data in transit.
  - Requirement: Proper key management practices must be implemented for cryptographic keys.
  - Requirement: Consider using encryption for sensitive data stored in databases or configuration files.

Build Process Description:

1. Developer commits code changes to the "Code Repository (GitHub)".
2. "CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)" is triggered upon code commit.
3. "Build Process (Maven/Gradle)" compiles the code, runs unit tests, and packages the application (e.g., creates a JAR file).
4. "Security Scanners (SAST, SCA)" are integrated into the pipeline to perform static analysis of the code and scan dependencies for vulnerabilities.
5. If security checks pass, the pipeline builds a Docker container image and pushes it to the "Container Image Registry".
6. The "Deployment Environment" pulls the latest container image from the registry for deployment.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes protected by the Spark application depend on the specific application built.  Examples include:

- E-commerce transactions processing.
- User authentication and authorization.
- Data processing and analytics.
- Content delivery.
- API gateway functionalities.

Data being protected and its sensitivity also depends on the application. Examples of data types and sensitivity levels:

- User credentials (highly sensitive).
- Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sensitive).
- Financial transaction data (highly sensitive).
- Application configuration data (sensitive).
- Business data (sensitivity depends on the nature of the data).
- Logs and audit trails (sensitive).

The sensitivity of data dictates the required security controls. Applications handling highly sensitive data will require stronger authentication, authorization, encryption, and monitoring compared to applications handling less sensitive data.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Assumptions:

- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is rapid web application development and deployment. Security is a significant but not overriding concern.
- SECURITY POSTURE:  The organization has basic security controls in place (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, code reviews). There is a need to enhance security posture with more proactive and framework-specific controls.
- DESIGN: The Spark application is designed as a typical three-tier web application with web server, application logic, and data storage. Deployment is assumed to be containerized on a cloud platform. Build process is automated using CI/CD and includes basic security checks.
