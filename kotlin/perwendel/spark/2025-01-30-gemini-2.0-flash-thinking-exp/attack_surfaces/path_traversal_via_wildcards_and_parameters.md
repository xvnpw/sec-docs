### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Path Traversal via Wildcards and Parameters

#### 4.1. Technical Deep Dive

Spark, a micro web framework for Java and Kotlin, simplifies web application development by providing an expressive routing mechanism.  Routes are defined using HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and URL paths.  Spark's routing features, specifically wildcards (`*`) and named parameters (`:param`), are designed for flexibility in handling dynamic URLs. However, this flexibility can become a security liability when these captured parameters are directly used in file system operations without proper validation and sanitization.

**How Spark Routing Works (Relevant to Path Traversal):**

*   **Parameter Capture:** When a route is defined with `:param` (e.g., `/files/:filename`), Spark captures the part of the URL path that matches `:filename` and makes it available to the route handler.
*   **Wildcard Matching:** Wildcards (`*`) match any sequence of characters in a URL path segment. While less commonly directly used for file names, they can be part of more complex routing patterns that might indirectly lead to path traversal if not handled carefully.
*   **Handler Execution:** The captured parameter is passed to the route handler as a String. Developers then often use this string to construct file paths, for example, to read and serve files.

**The Vulnerability - Insufficient Input Validation:**

The core vulnerability lies in the *lack of sufficient input validation* of the parameters captured by Spark's routing.  If a developer directly uses the `:filename` parameter (or any parameter derived from URL input) to construct a file path without proper checks, an attacker can manipulate this parameter to include path traversal sequences like `../` to navigate outside the intended directory.

**Example Breakdown:**

Consider the vulnerable Spark route:

```java
get("/files/:filename", (req, res) -> {
    String filename = req.params(":filename");
    File file = new File("uploads/" + filename); // Vulnerable path construction
    if (file.exists() && file.isFile()) {
        // Serve the file
        res.type(Files.probeContentType(file.toPath()));
        return Files.readAllBytes(file.toPath());
    } else {
        res.status(404);
        return "File not found";
    }
});
```

In this example:

1.  **Parameter Capture:** Spark captures the value of `:filename` from the URL.
2.  **Vulnerable Path Construction:** The code directly concatenates the captured `filename` with the base directory "uploads/".  **This is the critical flaw.**
3.  **File Access:** The `File` object is created, and the code attempts to read and serve the file.

**Attack Vector:**

An attacker can craft a malicious URL like:

`/files/../../../../etc/passwd`

When this request is processed:

1.  **Spark Routing:** Spark routes this request to the `/files/:filename` handler, capturing `../../../../etc/passwd` as the `:filename` parameter.
2.  **Vulnerable Path Construction:** The code constructs the file path as `"uploads/../../../../etc/passwd"`.
3.  **Path Traversal:** Due to the `../` sequences, the resulting path resolves to `/etc/passwd` on the server's file system, *bypassing the intended "uploads/" directory*.
4.  **Unauthorized Access:** If the application process has read permissions to `/etc/passwd`, the attacker can successfully retrieve the contents of this sensitive system file.

#### 4.2. Attack Scenarios and Impact

**Attack Scenarios:**

*   **Accessing Configuration Files:** Attackers can target configuration files (e.g., `.env`, `.properties`, XML configuration files) that might contain sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or internal application settings.
*   **Source Code Disclosure:**  By traversing to application source code files, attackers can gain insights into the application's logic, identify further vulnerabilities, and potentially reverse engineer proprietary algorithms.
*   **Data Breach:** Accessing files containing user data, application data, or business-critical information can lead to significant data breaches and privacy violations.
*   **System File Access:** In more severe cases, attackers might be able to access system files like `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow` (if permissions allow, which is less common but possible in misconfigured environments), or other system configuration files, potentially leading to system compromise.
*   **Arbitrary File Read (in some cases):** Depending on the application's file system permissions and the context, successful path traversal can potentially allow reading any file accessible to the application process.

**Impact Analysis (Expanded):**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, configuration files, and source code directly violates confidentiality.
*   **Integrity Compromise (Indirect):** While path traversal primarily focuses on reading files, the information gained can be used to plan further attacks that could compromise data integrity. For example, understanding application logic can help craft injection attacks.
*   **Availability Impact (Indirect):** In some scenarios, attackers might be able to access log files or application state files, potentially leading to denial-of-service attacks by manipulating or deleting these files (though less common for path traversal itself, more of a secondary exploit).
*   **Reputational Damage:** Data breaches and security incidents resulting from path traversal vulnerabilities can severely damage an organization's reputation and customer trust.
*   **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:**  Data breaches can lead to legal and regulatory penalties, especially in industries subject to data protection regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS.

#### 4.3. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

**1. Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**

*   **Whitelist Approach:** Define a strict whitelist of allowed characters for file names. Reject any input containing characters outside this whitelist. For example, allow only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores if appropriate for your use case.
*   **Regular Expressions:** Use regular expressions to enforce allowed patterns for file names.
*   **Input Length Limits:**  Restrict the maximum length of file name parameters to prevent excessively long paths that might be used in traversal attempts.
*   **Blacklist Approach (Less Recommended, but can be supplementary):** Blacklist path traversal sequences like `../`, `..\\`, `./`, `.\\`, and encoded variations (`%2e%2e%2f`, etc.). However, blacklists are often bypassable and less robust than whitelists.
*   **Example (Java - Whitelist Validation):**

    ```java
    get("/files/:filename", (req, res) -> {
        String filename = req.params(":filename");

        // Whitelist validation: Allow only alphanumeric, hyphen, underscore, and dot
        if (!filename.matches("^[a-zA-Z0-9\\-_.]+$")) {
            res.status(400); // Bad Request
            return "Invalid filename format";
        }

        File file = new File("uploads/" + filename);
        // ... (rest of the file serving logic)
    });
    ```

**2. Secure Path Resolution:**

*   **Canonicalization:** Use `File.getCanonicalPath()` in Java to resolve symbolic links and remove redundant path separators (`/./`, `//`) and `../` sequences.  Compare the canonical path of the user-provided input with the canonical path of the intended base directory. Ensure the resolved path is still within the allowed directory.
*   **`Paths.get().normalize().toAbsolutePath()` (Java NIO.2):**  Similar to `getCanonicalPath()`, but part of the more modern NIO.2 API.  `normalize()` removes redundant elements, and `toAbsolutePath()` resolves to an absolute path.
*   **Path Prefix Checking:** After canonicalization, check if the resolved path *starts with* the canonical path of the intended base directory. This ensures that the user-provided path remains within the allowed boundaries.
*   **Example (Java - Secure Path Resolution with Canonicalization):**

    ```java
    get("/files/:filename", (req, res) -> {
        String filename = req.params(":filename");
        String baseDir = "uploads";
        File baseDirFile = new File(baseDir).getCanonicalFile(); // Canonical base directory

        File requestedFile = new File(baseDirFile, filename).getCanonicalFile(); // Canonical requested file

        if (!requestedFile.getAbsolutePath().startsWith(baseDirFile.getAbsolutePath())) {
            res.status(400); // Bad Request - Path traversal attempt
            return "Invalid filename";
        }

        if (requestedFile.exists() && requestedFile.isFile()) {
            // Serve the file
            res.type(Files.probeContentType(requestedFile.toPath()));
            return Files.readAllBytes(requestedFile.toPath());
        } else {
            res.status(404);
            return "File not found";
        }
    });
    ```

**3. Principle of Least Privilege:**

*   **Restrict Application Process Permissions:** Run the Spark application process with the minimum necessary file system permissions.  Ideally, the application should only have read access to the directories it needs to serve files from and write access only to directories where it needs to write data (e.g., temporary upload directories).
*   **Operating System Level Permissions:** Configure file system permissions at the operating system level to restrict access to sensitive files and directories for the user account running the Spark application.
*   **Containerization (Docker, etc.):** When using containers, carefully define volume mounts and user permissions within the container to limit the application's access to the host file system.

**4. Avoid Direct File Path Construction from User Input:**

*   **Indirect File Access:** Instead of directly using user-provided file names, use validated identifiers or keys to look up file paths internally.
*   **Database Mapping:** Store file paths in a database and associate them with unique, validated identifiers.  Use the identifier from the URL parameter to retrieve the corresponding file path from the database.
*   **Configuration-Based File Paths:** Define allowed file paths in a configuration file or data structure.  Use user input to select from these pre-defined paths rather than constructing paths dynamically.
*   **Example (Conceptual - Database Mapping):**

    1.  **Database Table:** `files (file_id INT PRIMARY KEY, file_path VARCHAR(255), public_name VARCHAR(255))`
    2.  **Route:** `/files/:fileId`
    3.  **Handler Logic:**
        *   Validate `fileId` (e.g., ensure it's an integer).
        *   Query the database to retrieve `file_path` based on `fileId`.
        *   If found, serve the file at `file_path`.

#### 4.4. Testing and Detection

*   **Manual Testing:**
    *   Craft URLs with path traversal sequences (`../`, `..\\`, encoded variations) in the file name parameter.
    *   Attempt to access known sensitive files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, application configuration files).
    *   Observe the application's response. A successful path traversal will likely result in the content of the targeted file being returned or an error message indicating access to a file outside the intended directory.
*   **Automated Security Scanning:**
    *   Use web application security scanners (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) configured to detect path traversal vulnerabilities. These scanners can automatically fuzz URL parameters with path traversal payloads.
    *   Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools can analyze the Spark application's source code to identify potential path traversal vulnerabilities in file path construction logic.
*   **Code Reviews:**
    *   Conduct thorough code reviews, specifically focusing on route handlers that handle file system operations and use URL parameters to construct file paths.
    *   Look for instances where user input is directly used in `File` constructors or file access methods without proper validation and sanitization.
