## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Spark Weaknesses [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_spark_weaknesses__critical_.md)

This is the overarching goal of the attacker. It represents the successful exploitation of vulnerabilities within the Spark application to achieve malicious objectives like gaining unauthorized access or executing arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Spark Routing Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_spark_routing_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

This critical node represents the attacker's attempt to leverage weaknesses in how the Spark application defines and handles routes. Successful exploitation can lead to bypassing security controls or accessing unintended resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send Crafted Request to Bypass Authentication/Authorization (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/send_crafted_request_to_bypass_authenticationauthorization__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies a misconfigured wildcard route (e.g., `/api/*` intended for internal use). They then craft a specific URL that matches this broad wildcard but targets a sensitive endpoint that should have stricter access controls. Due to the misconfiguration, the request bypasses the intended authentication or authorization checks, granting the attacker unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Spark Request Handling Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_spark_request_handling_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

This critical node focuses on weaknesses in how the Spark application processes incoming requests, particularly the data contained within parameters and the request body. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to code injection or other malicious outcomes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Vulnerable Parameter Handling [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/identify_vulnerable_parameter_handling__critical_.md)

This critical node represents the attacker's effort to find weaknesses in how the application handles data passed through URL parameters. This often involves looking for a lack of input validation or sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_input_sanitizationvalidation__critical_.md)

This critical node highlights the fundamental security flaw where the application does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input. This makes the application vulnerable to various injection attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Query Parameters (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_query_parameters__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker discovers that the application directly uses data from a query parameter in a way that allows for code execution. For example, if a parameter value is used in a system call without proper sanitization, the attacker can inject malicious commands into the parameter value. When the application executes the system call, the injected commands are also executed, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (e.g., via command injection if parameters are used in system calls) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__e_g___via_command_injection_if_parameters_are_used_in_system_calls____db13d6ec.md)

This critical node represents the highly severe outcome where the attacker successfully executes arbitrary code on the server hosting the Spark application. This grants them complete control over the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Request Body (if processed without sanitization) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_request_body__if_processed_without_sanitization___high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker identifies that the application processes the request body (e.g., JSON or XML data) without proper sanitization. If the application deserializes this data, and there are vulnerabilities in the deserialization process or the classes being deserialized, the attacker can craft a malicious payload in the request body. Upon deserialization, this payload can trigger the execution of arbitrary code on the server, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (e.g., via deserialization vulnerabilities if body is deserialized) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__e_g___via_deserialization_vulnerabilities_if_body_is_deserialized___c_68a50cd0.md)

This critical node, similar to the previous RCE node, represents the severe outcome of gaining arbitrary code execution on the server, but specifically through exploiting deserialization vulnerabilities in the processing of the request body.
