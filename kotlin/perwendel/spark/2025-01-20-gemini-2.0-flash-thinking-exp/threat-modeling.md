# Threat Model Analysis for perwendel/spark

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Route Parameters](./threats/path_traversal_via_route_parameters.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate route parameters to include path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..%2F`) to access files or resources outside the intended directory. This is possible if the application directly uses these parameters to construct file paths without proper sanitization within a Spark route handler. For instance, a route like `/download/:filename` could be exploited with a filename like `../../../../etc/passwd`.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, access to sensitive files or configurations, potential for arbitrary code execution if accessed files are executable.

**Affected Component:** Spark's Request Handling (specifically how route parameters are extracted and made available to route handlers).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all route parameters within the route handler before using them to access files or resources.
*   Use whitelisting of allowed characters and file extensions for route parameters representing filenames.
*   Avoid directly using route parameters to construct file paths. Instead, map parameters to internal identifiers or use a secure file access mechanism.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Session Configuration (If Using Spark's Built-in Sessions)](./threats/insecure_default_session_configuration__if_using_spark's_built-in_sessions_.md)

**Description:** If the application relies on Spark's built-in session management (if it exists and is used) and it has insecure default settings (e.g., weak session ID generation, lack of `HttpOnly` or `Secure` flags on session cookies), it can be vulnerable to session hijacking. An attacker could potentially steal or forge session IDs to impersonate legitimate users.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, ability to perform actions on behalf of legitimate users, potential data breaches.

**Affected Component:** Spark's Session Management (if a built-in mechanism is present and used).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure Spark's session management (if applicable) with strong, cryptographically secure session ID generation.
*   Ensure that session cookies are set with the `HttpOnly` flag to prevent client-side JavaScript access, mitigating XSS-based session hijacking.
*   Ensure that session cookies are set with the `Secure` flag to ensure they are only transmitted over HTTPS.
*   If Spark's built-in session management is limited, consider using a well-vetted third-party session management library.
