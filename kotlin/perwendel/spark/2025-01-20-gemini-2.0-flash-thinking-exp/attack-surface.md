# Attack Surface Analysis for perwendel/spark

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Wildcard/Regex Routes](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_wildcardregex_routes.md)

**Description:** Attackers can manipulate URL paths to access resources outside the intended scope by exploiting overly permissive wildcard (`*`) or regular expression route definitions.

**How Spark Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Spark's core routing mechanism, which allows developers to define dynamic routes using wildcards and regular expressions, is the direct source of this vulnerability if not implemented securely.

**Example:** A route defined as `/files/*` in Spark might allow an attacker to access `/files/../../etc/passwd` if the application doesn't properly sanitize the wildcard parameter extracted by Spark's routing.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, configuration data, or internal application resources.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all route parameters extracted by Spark from wildcard or regex matches.
* Avoid overly broad wildcard usage in Spark route definitions. Use more specific route patterns where possible.
* Consider using regular expressions for more precise matching and validation within Spark route definitions, ensuring they are anchored to prevent traversal.
* Implement proper authorization checks *after* Spark's route matching to verify if the user has access to the resolved resource.

## Attack Surface: [Parameter Pollution](./attack_surfaces/parameter_pollution.md)

**Description:** Attackers can inject or overwrite request parameters, potentially altering application logic or accessing unintended data.

**How Spark Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Spark's API provides direct access to request parameters through methods like `request.queryParams()` and `request.params()`. This direct access, without enforced validation, makes the application susceptible to parameter pollution.

**Example:** An attacker might inject a malicious value for a user ID parameter via a Spark request, potentially allowing access to another user's data if the application relies solely on the value retrieved by Spark without verification.

**Impact:** Data breaches, privilege escalation, unexpected application behavior.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all request parameters accessed through Spark's API.
* Define expected parameter types and enforce them within the Spark route handlers.
* Avoid directly using raw request parameters retrieved by Spark in sensitive operations without validation.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Input Validation on WebSocket Messages (if used)](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_input_validation_on_websocket_messages__if_used_.md)

**Description:** If the application uses WebSockets, a lack of validation on incoming messages can allow attackers to inject malicious data.

**How Spark Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Spark's WebSocket support provides the infrastructure for real-time communication. However, the framework itself doesn't enforce validation on the content of WebSocket messages, leaving this responsibility to the developer.

**Example:** An attacker might send a malicious JSON payload via a Spark-managed WebSocket connection that, if not validated within the Spark route handler, could cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly.

**Impact:** Application crashes, unexpected behavior, potential for remote code execution (depending on how the data is processed).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all data received via Spark's WebSocket handling.
* Define a clear message format and enforce it within the Spark WebSocket handlers.
* Implement proper authentication and authorization for WebSocket connections managed by Spark.

## Attack Surface: [Serving Sensitive Static Files (if used)](./attack_surfaces/serving_sensitive_static_files__if_used_.md)

**Description:** Accidentally including sensitive files in the directory served by Spark's static file handling can lead to information disclosure.

**How Spark Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Spark's `staticFileLocation()` configuration directly designates a directory from which static files are served. The framework itself doesn't inherently restrict access within this directory.

**Example:** Configuration files, database credentials, or internal documentation might be inadvertently placed in the directory configured via `staticFileLocation()` and become publicly accessible through Spark.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, potential compromise of the application or related systems.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully manage the content of the directory configured as the `staticFileLocation()` in Spark.
* Avoid placing sensitive files in the static file directory served by Spark.
* If necessary, implement custom routing and authentication mechanisms within Spark to control access to specific static files.
