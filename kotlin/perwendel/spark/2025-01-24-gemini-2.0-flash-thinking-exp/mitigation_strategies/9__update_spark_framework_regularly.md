#### 4.3. Current Implementation and Missing Implementations

*   **Currently Implemented: Manual Updates (Infrequent):**
    *   **Analysis:** While manual updates are better than no updates, infrequent updates leave the application vulnerable for extended periods between releases. This approach is reactive rather than proactive and increases the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Limitations:**  Prone to human error and oversight.  Updates may be delayed due to other priorities or lack of awareness of new releases.

*   **Missing Implementation: Regular Spark Update Schedule:**
    *   **Importance:** Establishing a regular schedule (e.g., monthly, quarterly) for checking and applying updates is crucial for proactive vulnerability management. This transforms the update process from reactive to preventative.
    *   **Benefits:** Ensures timely patching of vulnerabilities, reduces the window of exposure, and promotes a culture of security awareness within the development team.
    *   **Implementation Recommendation:** Integrate Spark update checks and planning into the regular development or maintenance cycle.

*   **Missing Implementation: Automated Spark Update Checks (Optional):**
    *   **Potential Benefits:** Automation can streamline the monitoring process, reduce manual effort, and ensure no releases are missed.
