# Threat Model Analysis for perwendel/spark

## Threat: [Route Manipulation](./threats/route_manipulation.md)

*   **Threat:** Route Manipulation
*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the codebase or configuration files and modifies existing route definitions or injects new malicious routes *within Spark's routing mechanism*. They might add routes that expose sensitive data, execute arbitrary code, or redirect users to phishing sites. This is *direct* manipulation of Spark's routing.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, arbitrary code execution, application compromise, user redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Spark Component Affected:** Route definitions (e.g., `get()`, `post()`, `put()`, etc.), `Spark.routes()`, configuration files *specifically* related to Spark's routing.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict access controls to the codebase and configuration files.
    *   Use a secure development lifecycle (SDLC) with code reviews and least privilege principles.
    *   Store route configurations securely (e.g., environment variables, secure configuration management system).  *Ensure these are not readable by the application itself after startup.*
    *   Regularly audit route definitions for unauthorized changes.

## Threat: [Filter Bypass/Injection (Spark-Specific Logic)](./threats/filter_bypassinjection__spark-specific_logic_.md)

*   **Threat:** Filter Bypass/Injection (Spark-Specific Logic)
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Spark's `before` or `after` filters to inject malicious code or bypass security checks *specifically implemented within these Spark filters*. This focuses on the *Spark-specific* logic within the filters, not general filter vulnerabilities. The vulnerability lies in how Spark *uses* the filters, and how the developer implements them *within Spark*.
*   **Impact:** Bypass of *Spark-level* security controls (authentication, authorization), arbitrary code execution *within the Spark context*, application compromise.
*   **Spark Component Affected:** `before()` and `after()` filters *as used by Spark*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Treat filter code with the same level of security scrutiny as route handler code.  Focus on the *Spark-specific* logic.
    *   Avoid using untrusted input within filters *in ways that affect Spark's behavior*.
    *   Thoroughly review filter code for potential vulnerabilities, especially related to how they interact with Spark's request/response cycle.
    *   Implement centralized authorization checks *before* filters, if possible, *within Spark's control*.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass via Spark Routing](./threats/authorization_bypass_via_spark_routing.md)

*   **Threat:** Authorization Bypass via Spark Routing
*   **Description:** An attacker crafts requests that manipulate route parameters or exploit flaws in authorization logic implemented *within Spark route handlers or Spark filters* to gain unauthorized access. This is about bypassing authorization *as implemented within Spark's control*.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data or functionality, privilege escalation *within the application context defined by Spark*.
*   **Spark Component Affected:** Route handlers, `before` filters (if authorization is implemented there) - *specifically the Spark-controlled parts*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement centralized authorization checks *before* route handler logic *within Spark's control* (e.g., using `before` filters or a dedicated middleware *integrated with Spark*).
    *   Enforce the principle of least privilege *within the Spark application*.
    *   Thoroughly test authorization logic for bypass vulnerabilities, focusing on how it interacts with Spark's routing.
    *   Use a well-vetted authorization library *if it integrates well with Spark's lifecycle*.

## Threat: [Malicious `Response` Modification (Direct Spark Control)](./threats/malicious__response__modification__direct_spark_control_.md)

*     **Threat:** Malicious `Response` Modification (Direct Spark Control)
    *     **Description:**  An attacker exploits vulnerabilities within a Spark route handler to directly manipulate the `Response` object *provided by Spark*. They might inject malicious content into the response body, set malicious headers, or alter the response status code, all *through Spark's API*. This focuses on direct manipulation of the Spark `Response` object.
    *     **Impact:**  Cross-site scripting (XSS) (enabling, not the core threat), HTTP response splitting, information disclosure, client-side attacks â€“ all stemming from direct manipulation of Spark's response.
    *     **Spark Component Affected:**  `Response` object and its methods (e.g., `body()`, `header()`, `status()`) *as provided by Spark*.
    *     **Risk Severity:** High
    *     **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully control how the `Response` object is modified within route handlers *using Spark's API*.
        *   Avoid setting headers or body content based on unvalidated user input *that is then passed to Spark's `Response` methods*.
        *   Use a templating engine (if applicable) with automatic output encoding to prevent XSS, ensuring it interacts correctly with Spark's response handling.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of response manipulation, ensuring it's configured correctly within the Spark context.
