# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Parameter Tampering/Pollution in Spark Framework Applications

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Parameter Tampering/Pollution" attack path within applications built using the Spark framework (https://github.com/perwendel/spark).  We aim to:

*   Identify specific vulnerabilities related to parameter handling in Spark applications.
*   Assess the likelihood and impact of these vulnerabilities.
*   Propose concrete mitigation strategies and best practices for developers.
*   Provide examples of vulnerable code and corresponding secure code.
*   Recommend testing and detection methods.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following attack tree path:

*   **High-Risk Path 2: Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities -> Parameter Tampering/Pollution**
    *   **1.2 Parameter Tampering/Pollution**
    *   **1.2.1 Inject Unvalidated Input**

We will consider vulnerabilities arising from how Spark applications handle user-supplied data through:

*   **Query Parameters:**  Parameters appended to the URL (e.g., `?id=123`).
*   **Form Data:** Data submitted via HTML forms (POST requests).
*   **Request Headers:** Although less common for parameter tampering, we'll briefly touch on header manipulation.
*   **Path Parameters:** Parameters embedded within the URL path (e.g., `/users/:id`).

We will *not* cover:

*   Vulnerabilities unrelated to parameter handling (e.g., session management, authentication flaws).
*   Vulnerabilities within the Spark framework itself (assuming a reasonably up-to-date and correctly configured version).  Our focus is on *application-level* vulnerabilities.
*   Attacks that do not involve manipulating request parameters.

### 1.3 Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will analyze hypothetical and real-world examples of Spark application code to identify potential parameter tampering vulnerabilities.
2.  **Threat Modeling:** We will use the attack tree path as a starting point to model potential attack scenarios.
3.  **Vulnerability Research:** We will research known vulnerabilities and attack patterns related to parameter tampering in web applications generally, and specifically in Java-based web frameworks.
4.  **Best Practices Review:** We will identify and document best practices for secure parameter handling in Spark applications.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:** We will propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies for each identified vulnerability.
6.  **Testing Recommendations:** We will outline testing methods to detect and prevent parameter tampering vulnerabilities.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

### 2.1 Parameter Tampering/Pollution (Node 1.2)

**Description:** This node represents the core of the attack.  The attacker modifies parameters sent to the Spark application to achieve a malicious goal.  Spark, being a lightweight framework, provides mechanisms to *access* parameters but does *not* inherently validate or sanitize them.  This responsibility falls entirely on the application developer.

**Vulnerability Examples in Spark:**

*   **Example 1: Unvalidated Query Parameter (SQL Injection):**

    ```java
    // Vulnerable Code
    get("/users/:id", (req, res) -> {
        String userId = req.params(":id"); // Directly using the parameter
        String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + userId;
        // Execute the query (using a hypothetical database connection)
        // ...
        return "User data...";
    });
    ```

    An attacker could send a request like `/users/1;DROP TABLE users--` to inject SQL code.

*   **Example 2: Unvalidated Form Data (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS):**

    ```java
    // Vulnerable Code
    post("/comments", (req, res) -> {
        String comment = req.queryParams("comment"); // Directly using the parameter
        // ... (Store the comment in a database or directly display it)
        return "Comment added: " + comment; // Unescaped output
    });
    ```

    An attacker could submit a form with a `comment` parameter containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.  If this is displayed without escaping, the attacker's script will execute in the context of the victim's browser.

*   **Example 3:  Parameter Pollution (Overriding Values):**

    ```java
    // Vulnerable Code
    get("/search", (req, res) -> {
        String searchTerm = req.queryParams("q");
        // ... (Use searchTerm to perform a search)
        return "Search results for: " + searchTerm;
    });
    ```
    If the application uses `req.queryParams("q")` multiple times, or if the underlying logic doesn't handle multiple parameters with the same name correctly, an attacker might be able to send `?q=legit&q=malicious` and potentially influence which value is used.  While Spark's `queryParams()` method typically returns the *first* value, relying on this behavior is risky.  The application should explicitly handle multiple values if they are possible.

*   **Example 4: Path Parameter Tampering**
    ```java
    // Vulnerable Code
    get("/files/:filename", (req, res) -> {
        String filename = req.params(":filename");
        // Directly use filename to access a file
        File file = new File("/path/to/files/" + filename);
        // ... (Read and return the file content)
        return "File content...";
    });
    ```
    An attacker could use path traversal techniques like `/files/../../etc/passwd` to access files outside the intended directory.

**Likelihood:** High.  Parameter tampering is a fundamental web application attack, and Spark applications are susceptible if developers don't implement proper input validation and output encoding.

**Impact:** High.  Successful parameter tampering can lead to a wide range of severe consequences, including:

*   **Data Breaches:**  SQL injection can expose sensitive data.
*   **Account Takeover:**  XSS can steal session cookies.
*   **System Compromise:**  Path traversal can allow attackers to read or write arbitrary files.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Malicious input can cause application crashes or resource exhaustion.
*   **Defacement:**  Attackers can modify the application's appearance or content.

**Effort:** Low.  Tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and even simple browser developer tools make it easy to modify request parameters.

**Skill Level:** Intermediate.  While basic parameter tampering is straightforward, exploiting more complex vulnerabilities (e.g., blind SQL injection) requires more advanced skills.

**Detection Difficulty:** Medium.  Automated scanners can detect some forms of parameter tampering (e.g., basic XSS), but more subtle vulnerabilities may require manual testing and code review.

### 2.2 Inject Unvalidated Input (Node 1.2.1)

**Description:** This node represents the *success* of the attacker in injecting malicious data through unvalidated parameters.  It's the critical step that enables many other attacks.  Spark provides no built-in protection against this; it's entirely the application's responsibility to validate and sanitize all user-supplied input.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Input Validation:**  Checking that user input conforms to expected rules (e.g., data type, length, format, allowed characters).  This should be done *before* the input is used in any sensitive operation.
*   **Output Encoding (Escaping):**  Transforming potentially dangerous characters into their safe equivalents before displaying them in a web page (e.g., converting `<` to `&lt;` to prevent XSS).
*   **Whitelist vs. Blacklist:**  A whitelist approach (allowing only known-good input) is generally preferred over a blacklist approach (blocking known-bad input), as blacklists are often incomplete.
*   **Defense in Depth:**  Employing multiple layers of security (e.g., input validation, output encoding, parameterized queries) to mitigate the risk even if one layer fails.

**Mitigation Strategies (for both 1.2 and 1.2.1):**

1.  **Input Validation (Server-Side):**
    *   **Use a Validation Library:**  Libraries like Hibernate Validator (for Java) or Apache Commons Validator provide convenient ways to define and enforce validation rules.
    *   **Validate Data Types:**  Ensure that parameters are of the expected type (e.g., integer, string, date).
    *   **Validate Length and Format:**  Restrict the length of input and enforce specific formats (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers).
    *   **Validate Allowed Characters:**  Use whitelists to specify the characters that are allowed in each parameter.
    *   **Validate Against Business Rules:**  Implement validation logic based on the application's specific requirements (e.g., ensuring that a user ID exists).
    *   **Reject Invalid Input:**  If input fails validation, reject the request and return an appropriate error message (avoiding sensitive information disclosure).

2.  **Output Encoding (Context-Specific):**
    *   **HTML Encoding:**  Use a library like OWASP Java Encoder to escape HTML entities (e.g., `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`) when displaying user-supplied data in HTML.
    *   **JavaScript Encoding:**  Escape characters that have special meaning in JavaScript (e.g., quotes, backslashes) when embedding user-supplied data in JavaScript code.
    *   **URL Encoding:**  Encode characters that have special meaning in URLs (e.g., spaces, slashes) when constructing URLs with user-supplied data.
    *   **SQL Parameterization:**  Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) to prevent SQL injection.  *Never* concatenate user input directly into SQL queries.

3.  **Secure Parameter Handling in Spark:**

    *   **Use `req.queryParams()` and `req.params()` Correctly:**  Understand the difference between query parameters and path parameters.
    *   **Avoid `req.body()` for Untrusted Data:**  If you need to parse the request body manually, be extremely careful about handling untrusted data.  Use a robust parsing library and validate the parsed data thoroughly.
    *   **Consider a Framework for Input Validation:**  While Spark is lightweight, you can integrate a validation framework (like Hibernate Validator) to simplify input validation.

4.  **Testing and Detection:**

    *   **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools (e.g., FindBugs, SonarQube) to identify potential vulnerabilities in your code.
    *   **Dynamic Analysis:**  Use web application security scanners (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) to test for parameter tampering vulnerabilities.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Engage security professionals to perform penetration testing to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:**  Use fuzzing tools to send a large number of invalid or unexpected inputs to your application to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Validation Testing:** Create specific test cases to verify that your input validation logic is working correctly.
    *   **Output Encoding Testing:** Verify that output encoding is being applied correctly in all relevant contexts.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of your code and infrastructure.

**Example of Secure Code (Addressing Example 1 - SQL Injection):**

```java
import java.sql.*;

get("/users/:id", (req, res) -> {
    String userIdStr = req.params(":id");
    int userId;

    // Input Validation: Check if userId is a valid integer
    try {
        userId = Integer.parseInt(userIdStr);
    } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
        res.status(400); // Bad Request
        return "Invalid user ID format.";
    }

    // Use Parameterized Query (Prepared Statement)
    try (Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb", "user", "password");
         PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?")) {

        stmt.setInt(1, userId); // Set the parameter safely
        ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();

        // ... (Process the result set)
        return "User data...";

    } catch (SQLException e) {
        res.status(500); // Internal Server Error
        return "Database error.";
    }
});
```

**Example of Secure Code (Addressing Example 2 - XSS):**

```java
import org.owasp.encoder.Encode;

post("/comments", (req, res) -> {
    String comment = req.queryParams("comment");

    // Input Validation (Example - Check length)
    if (comment == null || comment.length() > 255) {
        res.status(400);
        return "Comment is too long.";
    }

    // Output Encoding (HTML Encoding)
    String safeComment = Encode.forHtml(comment);

    // ... (Store the safeComment in a database or display it)
    return "Comment added: " + safeComment;
});
```

**Example of Secure Code (Addressing Example 4 - Path Traversal):**

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

get("/files/:filename", (req, res) -> {
    String filename = req.params(":filename");

    // Input Validation and Sanitization
    if (filename == null || filename.contains("..") || filename.contains("/") || filename.contains("\\")) {
        res.status(400);
        return "Invalid filename.";
    }

    // Use a safe base directory and resolve the path
    Path baseDir = Paths.get("/path/to/safe/files/");
    Path filePath = baseDir.resolve(filename).normalize();

    // Check if the resolved path is still within the base directory
    if (!filePath.startsWith(baseDir)) {
        res.status(403); // Forbidden
        return "Access denied.";
    }

    File file = filePath.toFile();
    // ... (Read and return the file content)
    return "File content...";
});
```

## 3. Conclusion

Parameter tampering/pollution is a serious threat to Spark applications.  Because Spark itself does not provide built-in protection against these vulnerabilities, developers *must* take responsibility for implementing robust input validation, output encoding, and secure parameter handling practices.  By following the mitigation strategies outlined in this analysis, developers can significantly reduce the risk of these attacks and build more secure applications.  Regular testing and security audits are crucial to ensure that these defenses remain effective.
