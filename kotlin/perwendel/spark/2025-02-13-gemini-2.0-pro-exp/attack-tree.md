## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities -> Path Traversal](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploit_request_handling_vulnerabilities_-_path_traversal.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in how Spark handles incoming HTTP requests, specifically targeting the file system access.
*   **1.1 Path Traversal:** The attacker attempts to access files or directories outside the intended web root by manipulating the URL path.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **1.1.1 Read Arbitrary Files:** The attacker successfully reads files outside the web root, potentially gaining access to sensitive information like configuration files, source code, or system files.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Example:** `/files/../../etc/passwd`
*   **1.1.2 Bypass Filters/Checks:** The attacker uses techniques like URL encoding or double encoding to bypass any security filters or checks that are in place to prevent path traversal.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Example:** `%2e%2e%2f` instead of `../`
* **1.1.3 Access Restricted Directories:** The attacker uses techniques to access directories that should be restricted.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Example:** `/admin/`

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities -> Parameter Tampering/Pollution](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploit_request_handling_vulnerabilities_-_parameter_tamperingpollution.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This path focuses on manipulating request parameters to inject malicious input or alter application behavior. This is a *critical* path due to its high likelihood and impact.
*   **[***1.2 Parameter Tampering/Pollution***] (Critical Node):** The attacker modifies request parameters (query parameters, form data) to inject malicious input or influence the application's logic.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **[***1.2.1 Inject Unvalidated Input***] (Critical Node):** The attacker successfully injects malicious data into the application through unvalidated parameters. This is a *precursor* to many other attacks (SQLi, XSS, etc.). Spark itself doesn't prevent this; it's the application's responsibility.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Example:** Submitting a form with `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` in a text field that is later displayed without sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Abuse Configuration Weaknesses -> Default Settings](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_abuse_configuration_weaknesses_-_default_settings.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This path focuses on exploiting insecure default configurations in Spark or its dependencies.
*   **[***2.2 Default Settings***] (Critical Node):** The attacker leverages default settings that are insecure, such as unchanged default credentials or predictable session IDs.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **[***2.2.1 Unchanged Credentials***] (Critical Node):** The attacker gains access to the application using default credentials that were not changed during setup. This is the *most critical* vulnerability.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy
    *   **Example:** Using "admin/admin" as the username and password for a Spark management interface.
