### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Spark

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the `perwendel/spark` framework:

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal via Unsanitized Route Parameters
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate route parameters (e.g., in a `GET` request) to include `../` sequences or other path traversal characters. This allows them to access files and directories outside the intended web root, potentially accessing sensitive configuration files, source code, or other critical data. This directly involves how Spark handles route parameters.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach (access to sensitive files), potential for further exploitation if configuration files are compromised.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Spark.get()`, `Spark.post()`, and other route handling functions where parameters are used to access file system resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all route parameters before using them to access files or resources.
        *   Avoid directly using user-supplied input to construct file paths.
        *   Use canonicalization techniques to resolve symbolic links and relative paths.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for the application's file system access.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Files via Static File Serving
    *   **Description:** If Spark's static file serving functionality is used incorrectly or without proper restrictions, attackers might be able to access sensitive files that should not be publicly accessible (e.g., configuration files, backup files, source code). This directly involves Spark's static file serving features.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, potential for further exploitation if sensitive files are exposed.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Spark.staticFiles.externalLocation()`, `Spark.staticFileLocation()`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure the directories from which static files are served, ensuring that only necessary public assets are included.
        *   Avoid serving sensitive files or directories using the static file serving mechanism.
        *   Implement access controls or authentication for accessing sensitive static assets if absolutely necessary.

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal via Static File Requests
    *   **Description:** Similar to route parameter path traversal, an attacker could manipulate the requested path for static files (e.g., `/static/../../sensitive.conf`) to access files outside the designated static file directory. This directly involves how Spark handles requests for static files.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach (access to sensitive files).
    *   **Affected Component:** `Spark.staticFiles.externalLocation()`, `Spark.staticFileLocation()`, and the underlying file serving mechanism within Spark.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that the static file serving mechanism properly sanitizes and validates requested file paths to prevent traversal outside the allowed directory.
        *   Avoid using user-supplied input directly in static file paths.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in the Embedded Jetty Version
    *   **Description:** Spark uses an embedded Jetty server. If the version of Jetty included in Spark has known security vulnerabilities, the application will inherit those vulnerabilities. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the server or the application. This is a direct consequence of Spark's choice to embed Jetty.
    *   **Impact:** Server compromise, remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, depending on the specific Jetty vulnerability.
    *   **Affected Component:** The embedded Jetty server within the Spark framework.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update the Spark framework to benefit from updated Jetty versions that include security patches.
        *   Monitor Spark release notes for information on included Jetty versions and any known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using a standalone, updated Jetty instance if more control over the server version is required (though this deviates from the typical Spark usage).
