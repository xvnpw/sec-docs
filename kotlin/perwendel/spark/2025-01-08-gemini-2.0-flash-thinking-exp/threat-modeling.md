# Threat Model Analysis for perwendel/spark

## Threat: [Insecure Route Handling](./threats/insecure_route_handling.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Route Handling
    *   **Description:** An attacker might craft malicious URLs targeting wildcard routes or poorly defined route patterns to access unintended application logic or data that should be protected by more specific routes. This could involve accessing administrative functions or sensitive user information.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, execution of unintended application logic, potential for privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected Spark Component:** `RouteMatcher` component within Spark's request handling pipeline.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Define routes with the highest possible specificity. Avoid overly broad wildcard routes.
        *   Implement authentication and authorization checks within route handlers.
        *   Regularly review and audit route definitions.

## Threat: [Static File Traversal](./threats/static_file_traversal.md)

*   **Threat:** Static File Traversal
    *   **Description:** If static file serving is enabled and not properly configured, an attacker might craft requests with manipulated paths (e.g., using `../`) to access files outside the intended static file directory, potentially exposing sensitive configuration files, source code, or other critical data.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential for application compromise.
    *   **Affected Spark Component:** `StaticHandler` component.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure the static file directory and ensure it only contains publicly accessible assets.
        *   Avoid serving sensitive files through the static file handler.
        *   Consider using a dedicated Content Delivery Network (CDN).
        *   Disable static file serving if not required.

## Threat: [Session Fixation (If Using Spark's Session Management or Extensions)](./threats/session_fixation__if_using_spark's_session_management_or_extensions_.md)

*   **Threat:** Session Fixation (If Using Spark's Session Management or Extensions)
    *   **Description:** If the application relies on Spark's built-in session management (or extensions providing it) and doesn't properly regenerate session IDs upon successful login, an attacker could potentially fix a user's session ID. This allows the attacker to obtain a valid session ID and then trick a legitimate user into using that ID, granting the attacker access to the user's account.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and functionalities.
    *   **Affected Spark Component:** Potentially the `Session` management features or any external library integrated for session handling within the Spark application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that session IDs are regenerated upon successful user login.
        *   Use secure session cookies with the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags set.
        *   Implement other session management best practices.
