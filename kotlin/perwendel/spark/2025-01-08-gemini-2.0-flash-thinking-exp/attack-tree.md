# Attack Tree Analysis for perwendel/spark

Objective: Gain unauthorized control or access to the application or its underlying resources by exploiting vulnerabilities within the Spark framework (focusing on high-risk scenarios).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Response Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_response_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Lack of proper output encoding when incorporating user-provided data into HTTP responses.
* **Critical Node: Inject Malicious Content in Responses (XSS)**
    * **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts (e.g., JavaScript) or HTML into the application's responses. When a user's browser renders this response, the malicious script executes.
    * **Impact:**
        * Account takeover by stealing session cookies or credentials.
        * Defacement of the application.
        * Redirection of users to malicious websites.
        * Theft of sensitive information displayed on the page.
        * Execution of arbitrary actions on behalf of the user.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium (Common vulnerability if developers are not careful with output encoding).
    * **Effort:** Low.
    * **Skill Level:** Low.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires analysis of response content).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Static File Serving Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_static_file_serving_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Improper configuration or lack of input validation when serving static files.
* **Critical Node: Path Traversal**
    * **Description:** An attacker manipulates the file path in a request to access files located outside the intended static file directory.
    * **Impact:**
        * Access to sensitive configuration files (e.g., database credentials).
        * Exposure of source code.
        * Retrieval of user data or other confidential information stored on the server.
        * Potential for further exploitation if accessed files contain sensitive information.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium (If static file serving is not carefully configured).
    * **Effort:** Low.
    * **Skill Level:** Low.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring file access patterns).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Session Management Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_session_management_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Weaknesses in how the application manages user sessions.
* **Critical Node: Session Fixation**
    * **Description:** An attacker forces a user to use a specific session ID known to the attacker, allowing the attacker to hijack the user's session.
    * **Impact:** Full account takeover, allowing the attacker to perform any actions the legitimate user can.
    * **Likelihood:** Low (if HTTPS is used) / Medium (without HTTPS).
    * **Effort:** Low.
    * **Skill Level:** Low.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Low (if session IDs are monitored).
* **Critical Node: Predictable Session IDs**
    * **Description:** If the application generates session IDs using a predictable algorithm, an attacker can guess valid session IDs.
    * **Impact:** Full account takeover.
    * **Likelihood:** Low (if proper random generation is used).
    * **Effort:** Medium.
    * **Skill Level:** Medium.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Low (requires analysis of session ID generation patterns).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Utilizing known security flaws in libraries used by the Spark framework.
* **Critical Node: Utilize Known Vulnerabilities in Spark's Dependencies**
    * **Description:** Attackers exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in libraries that Spark relies on (e.g., Jetty).
    * **Impact:**
        * Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
        * Full compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server.
        * Data breaches and exfiltration.
        * Denial of Service.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the age and maintenance of dependencies).
    * **Effort:** Low (if exploits are readily available) / High (if custom exploitation is needed).
    * **Skill Level:** Medium (to find and adapt exploits) / High (for zero-day exploitation).
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Security scanners can detect known vulnerabilities).
