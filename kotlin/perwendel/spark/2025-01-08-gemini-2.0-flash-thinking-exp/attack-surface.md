# Attack Surface Analysis for perwendel/spark

## Attack Surface: [Parameter Injection](./attack_surfaces/parameter_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code or unexpected input into route parameters, which can be processed by the application in unintended ways.
    *   **How Spark Contributes:** Spark's routing mechanism uses placeholders (e.g., `/users/:id`) that directly map to parameters accessible in the route handler. If these parameters are not sanitized, they can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A route `/search/:query` where the `query` parameter is directly used in a database query without sanitization. An attacker could send `/search/' OR '1'='1` to potentially extract all data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, code execution (if parameters are used in system commands).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all route parameters before using them in any operations (database queries, system calls, etc.).
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Avoid directly using raw parameter values in sensitive operations.

## Attack Surface: [Unintended Route Matching](./attack_surfaces/unintended_route_matching.md)

*   **Description:**  Poorly defined or overly broad routes can allow attackers to access unintended functionalities or resources by crafting specific URLs.
    *   **How Spark Contributes:** Spark's flexible routing allows for complex patterns. If not carefully designed, overlapping or too general routes can lead to unexpected matches.
    *   **Example:** Defining a route `/admin/*` which could unintentionally match `/admin/users` (intended) and `/admin/publicly_accessible_resource` (unintended and potentially sensitive).
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, privilege escalation, bypassing access controls.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Define specific and precise routes. Avoid overly broad wildcards unless absolutely necessary and with strict access control.
        *   Organize routes logically and use more specific paths before more general ones.
        *   Implement proper authentication and authorization checks within route handlers to ensure only authorized users can access specific functionalities.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Static Files](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_static_files.md)

*   **Description:** If static file serving is enabled, attackers might manipulate URLs to access files outside the intended directory structure.
    *   **How Spark Contributes:** Spark allows serving static files from specified directories. Misconfiguration or lack of proper sanitization of requested file paths can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** An application serving static files from a `/public` directory. An attacker could request `/public/../../../../etc/passwd` to attempt to access the system's password file.
    *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive files, potential data breaches, and in some cases, even code execution if accessed files are interpreted.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure the directory from which static files are served.
        *   Avoid serving sensitive files through the static file server.
        *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of requested file paths to prevent ".." sequences or other path traversal attempts.
        *   Consider disabling directory listing for static file directories.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Input Validation on WebSocket Messages (if used)](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_input_validation_on_websocket_messages__if_used_.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to HTTP requests, data received through WebSocket connections needs to be validated to prevent injection attacks or unexpected behavior.
    *   **How Spark Contributes:** If the application uses Spark's WebSocket support, developers are responsible for handling and validating incoming messages. Lack of validation introduces risk.
    *   **Example:** A chat application using WebSockets where user messages are directly displayed without sanitization. An attacker could send a message containing malicious JavaScript that would be executed in other users' browsers (Cross-Site Scripting).
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), injection vulnerabilities, denial-of-service, and other issues depending on how the data is processed.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data received through WebSocket connections.
        *   Encode output properly before displaying it in the user interface to prevent XSS.
        *   Apply rate limiting and other security measures to prevent abuse of the WebSocket connection.
