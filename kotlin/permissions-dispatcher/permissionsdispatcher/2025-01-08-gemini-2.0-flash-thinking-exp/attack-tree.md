## Attack Tree Path: [Race Conditions in Permission Granting (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/race_conditions_in_permission_granting__high-risk_path_.md)

**Description:** This category encompasses potential flaws within the PermissionsDispatcher library itself. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow attackers to bypass permission checks or gain unauthorized access.

**Critical Node Justification:** Any vulnerability within a core library like PermissionsDispatcher has the potential for widespread and significant impact.

    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker attempts to trigger a permission request and, before the application receives the grant or denial callback, quickly performs the action that requires the permission.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium - Requires specific timing and application logic, but race conditions are a known issue in asynchronous programming.
    * **Impact:** Medium - Successful exploitation can bypass permission checks, allowing access to protected resources without explicit user consent.

## Attack Tree Path: [Logic Errors in Callback Handling (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/logic_errors_in_callback_handling__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  An attacker manipulates the application's state or input in a way that causes PermissionsDispatcher to execute the incorrect permission callback (e.g., always triggering the "permission granted" branch).
        * **Likelihood:** Low - Highly dependent on specific, exploitable bugs within the PermissionsDispatcher library.
        * **Impact:** High - Successful exploitation allows execution of permission-protected code without proper authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Injection Attacks (Less Likely, but consider edge cases) (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/injection_attacks__less_likely__but_consider_edge_cases___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If PermissionsDispatcher, or custom implementations using it, processes external input related to permission requests, an attacker might inject malicious code or commands.
        * **Likelihood:** Very Low - Standard usage of PermissionsDispatcher does not typically involve processing external input in a vulnerable manner.
        * **Impact:** High - Successful injection could lead to arbitrary code execution or manipulation of the permission flow.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (Indirect) (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_dependencies__indirect___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  PermissionsDispatcher relies on other Android libraries. A vulnerability in one of these dependencies could indirectly affect PermissionsDispatcher's functionality and create exploitable scenarios.
        * **Likelihood:** Low - Requires a vulnerability in a specific dependency that impacts PermissionsDispatcher's core functionality.
        * **Impact:** Variable - Can range from minor disruptions to complete compromise depending on the dependency and the nature of the vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Permission Dialog Spoofing (General Android Vulnerability, but relevant in context) (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/permission_dialog_spoofing__general_android_vulnerability__but_relevant_in_context___critical_node___5ed43911.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker overlays a fake permission dialog that visually mimics the legitimate Android system dialog, tricking the user into granting permissions to a malicious application or for unintended purposes.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium - Requires the malicious application to have overlay permissions and be running concurrently with the target application.
    * **Impact:** High - Successful spoofing can lead users to grant sensitive permissions they would otherwise deny.

## Attack Tree Path: [Incorrect Annotation Usage (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/incorrect_annotation_usage__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Developers misuse the annotations provided by PermissionsDispatcher (e.g., applying them to the wrong methods, incorrect logic within annotated methods), leading to permission checks not being performed correctly or unexpected application behavior.
        * **Likelihood:** Medium - A common developer error, especially for those new to the library.
        * **Impact:** Medium to High - Can result in permission checks being bypassed or not enforced as intended, potentially leading to unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Improper Handling of Permission Callbacks (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/improper_handling_of_permission_callbacks__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Errors in the logic within the methods annotated with `@OnPermissionGranted`, `@OnPermissionDenied`, or `@OnNeverAskAgain` can lead to the application behaving incorrectly based on the permission status.
        * **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on the complexity of the callback logic and the thoroughness of testing.
        * **Impact:** Medium to High - Can lead to the application granting access when it shouldn't or failing to restrict access when necessary.

## Attack Tree Path: [Relying Solely on PermissionsDispatcher for Security (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/relying_solely_on_permissionsdispatcher_for_security__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Developers mistakenly believe that PermissionsDispatcher provides complete security and fail to implement additional checks before accessing sensitive resources.
        * **Likelihood:** Medium - Developers might overestimate the library's security capabilities.
        * **Impact:** Medium to High - If PermissionsDispatcher is bypassed (through other vulnerabilities or developer errors), no other security layers are in place to prevent unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Directly Accessing Protected Resources without Using Annotated Methods (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/directly_accessing_protected_resources_without_using_annotated_methods__critical_node__high-risk_pat_75fc2e5d.md)

**Attack Vector:** Developers make errors in their code and directly access resources that require permissions without going through the methods annotated by PermissionsDispatcher.
        * **Likelihood:** Medium - A common developer error, especially in larger codebases or when integrating new features.
        * **Impact:** High - Completely bypasses the intended permission checks, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Reflection/Native Code Exploitation (Advanced) (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/reflectionnative_code_exploitation__advanced___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Sophisticated attackers might use reflection or native code (JNI) to bypass PermissionsDispatcher's checks and directly interact with the underlying Android permission APIs.
        * **Likelihood:** Low - Requires significant technical expertise and effort.
        * **Impact:** High - Allows complete circumvention of the library's permission management, granting unrestricted access.
