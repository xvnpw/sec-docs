# Attack Surface Analysis for permissions-dispatcher/permissionsdispatcher

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Generated Code Logic](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_generated_code_logic.md)

**Description:** Errors or oversights in the code automatically generated by the PermissionsDispatcher annotation processor can lead to unexpected behavior or security flaws.

**How PermissionsDispatcher Contributes:** The library's core functionality relies on generating code to handle permission requests. Flaws in the generation logic directly introduce vulnerabilities into the application's codebase.

**Example:** The generated code might have a logic error that allows a permission-dependent action to execute even if the permission is denied under specific circumstances.

**Impact:**  Bypassing permission checks, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Thoroughly review the generated code to understand its behavior and identify potential flaws. Keep the PermissionsDispatcher library updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches. Consider using static analysis tools on the generated code.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of Callbacks](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_callbacks.md)

**Description:** If the application's methods annotated with `@PermissionGranted`, `@PermissionDenied`, `@OnShowRationale`, and `@OnNeverAskAgain` are not implemented securely, they can be exploited.

**How PermissionsDispatcher Contributes:** The library provides these callbacks as entry points into the application's logic based on permission outcomes. If the application logic within these callbacks is flawed, it creates a vulnerability.

**Example:**  The `@PermissionGranted` method might directly access a resource based on the assumption that the permission is granted without further checks, potentially leading to an error or unexpected behavior if the permission grant is later revoked or manipulated.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to resources, application crashes, or unexpected behavior leading to potential security breaches.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement robust error handling and validation within the callback methods. Avoid making assumptions about the permission state without explicit checks. Follow the principle of least privilege when accessing resources.
