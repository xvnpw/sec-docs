## Attack Tree Path: [1. Bypass Permission Checks [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__bypass_permission_checks__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker aims to circumvent the intended permission restrictions enforced by PermissionsDispatcher.  This is a critical branch because successful bypass grants unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Incorrect Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_incorrect_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploits errors made by developers when configuring PermissionsDispatcher.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Missing Checks [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_missing_checks__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The developer forgets to annotate a sensitive method with `@NeedsPermission` (or other relevant annotations), leaving it completely unprotected.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** Very Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Weak Checks](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_weak_checks.md)

*   **Description:** The developer uses a permission string that is too broad, granting more access than necessary.  Or, they use a custom permission that is easily guessable or obtainable.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** Medium to High
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3 Wrong Permission](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_wrong_permission.md)

*   **Description:** The developer uses the incorrect permission string, unintentionally granting access due to a typo or misunderstanding.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low
            *   **Impact:** Medium to High
            *   **Effort:** Very Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Reflection/Annotation Abuse](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_reflectionannotation_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** Exploits how PermissionsDispatcher uses reflection and annotations.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Bypass Checks via Reflection [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_bypass_checks_via_reflection__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker uses Java reflection to directly invoke methods annotated with `@NeedsPermission`, bypassing the generated permission-checking code.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Timing Attacks (TOCTOU)](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_timing_attacks__toctou_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploits race conditions between the permission check and the actual use of the protected resource. Although present in the full tree, it is not considered high-risk due to low likelihood.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3 Logic Errors in Custom Permission Checks](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_logic_errors_in_custom_permission_checks.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploits vulnerabilities introduced by developers when implementing custom permission handling logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.1 Missing Checks (in custom logic) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_1_missing_checks__in_custom_logic___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The custom permission handling logic omits necessary checks, allowing unauthorized access.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
