# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for permissions-dispatcher/permissionsdispatcher

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rigorous Permission Request Justification and Review (PermissionsDispatcher-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/rigorous_permission_request_justification_and_review__permissionsdispatcher-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Documentation:** For each permission requested using `@NeedsPermission`, developers *must* create a justification document.
    2.  **Justification Content:** The document *must* include:
        *   **Necessity:** Why the permission is *essential* for the feature.
        *   **Data Access:** What specific data is accessed.
        *   **Data Usage:** How the accessed data is used.
        *   **Data Protection:** How the accessed data is protected.
        *   **Denial Handling:** What happens if the permission is denied.
    3.  **Code Review Process:**
        *   **Mandatory Check:** Reviewers *must* verify the justification document for *every* `@NeedsPermission`.
        *   **Alignment Verification:** Reviewers *must* ensure code uses the permission as described.
        *   **Challenge Requests:** Reviewers should challenge any seemingly excessive requests.
        *   **Annotation Check:** Verify correct usage of *all* PermissionsDispatcher annotations: `@NeedsPermission`, `@OnShowRationale`, `@OnPermissionDenied`, and `@OnNeverAskAgain`.  This is crucial for ensuring the library is used as intended.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Over-Granting of Permissions (Principle of Least Privilege Violation):** *Severity: High*. Directly addresses this by forcing justification of *every* `@NeedsPermission`.
    *   **Data Exposure:** *Severity: High*.  By linking data access/usage to `@NeedsPermission`, it prevents misuse.
    *   **Incorrect Annotation Usage:** *Severity: Medium*. The annotation check ensures PermissionsDispatcher is used correctly, preventing logic errors.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Over-Granting of Permissions:** Significantly reduces risk by requiring justification for each `@NeedsPermission`.
    *   **Data Exposure:** Reduces risk by ensuring transparency tied directly to PermissionsDispatcher usage.
    *   **Incorrect Annotation Usage:** Prevents errors arising from misusing PermissionsDispatcher's core functionality.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially. Justification documents are required for new features, but a retrospective review is needed. Code reviews include a permission check, but the annotation check needs to be more rigorous.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive review of all existing `@NeedsPermission` annotations.
    *   Formal training on creating justifications and using PermissionsDispatcher annotations correctly.
    *   Update code review checklist to explicitly include verification of *all* relevant annotations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Graceful Degradation and Comprehensive Denial Handling (PermissionsDispatcher-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/graceful_degradation_and_comprehensive_denial_handling__permissionsdispatcher-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`@OnPermissionDenied` Implementation:**
        *   **User-Friendly Messages:** `@OnPermissionDenied` methods *must* provide clear explanations.
        *   **Alternative Functionality:** Offer alternatives if possible, without the denied permission.
        *   **No Crashes or Freezes:** The app *must never* crash due to a denial.
        *   **No Sensitive Data Leakage:** Error messages must not leak information.
        *   **No Bypassing:** Code *must not* try to circumvent the denial handled by PermissionsDispatcher.
    2.  **`@OnNeverAskAgain` Implementation:**
        *   **Settings Guidance:** `@OnNeverAskAgain` methods *must* guide users to re-enable permissions in settings.
        *   **Avoid Nagging:** Do *not* repeatedly prompt after "Never Ask Again."
    3.  **Testing (PermissionsDispatcher-Focused):**
        *   **Denial Simulation:** Create UI/integration tests simulating *all* denial scenarios handled by PermissionsDispatcher (both "Deny" and "Never Ask Again").
        *   **All Flows Tested:** Test *all* code paths affected by PermissionsDispatcher's denial handling.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Poor User Experience:** *Severity: Medium*.  Directly addresses user experience when PermissionsDispatcher denies a request.
    *   **Application Instability:** *Severity: High*. Prevents crashes caused by unhandled denials *within* PermissionsDispatcher's generated code.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** *Severity: Medium*. Prevents leaks through error messages in `@OnPermissionDenied`.
    *   **Incorrect `OnNeverAskAgain` Handling:** *Severity: Medium*. Ensures correct behavior when the user permanently denies a permission.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Poor User Experience:** Improves experience by providing clear explanations within PermissionsDispatcher's flow.
    *   **Application Instability:** Eliminates crashes related to PermissionsDispatcher's denial handling.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Reduces leaks within `@OnPermissionDenied` methods.
    *   **Incorrect `OnNeverAskAgain` Handling:** Ensures correct and respectful handling of permanent denials.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially. `@OnPermissionDenied` methods exist, but consistency needs improvement. `@OnNeverAskAgain` handling is inconsistent.  Basic denial testing exists, but not comprehensive for all PermissionsDispatcher scenarios.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Review and refactor all `@OnPermissionDenied` and `@OnNeverAskAgain` methods.
    *   Comprehensive automated tests covering *all* PermissionsDispatcher denial scenarios.
    *   Implement alternative functionality where feasible.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Clear and Concise Rationales (PermissionsDispatcher-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/clear_and_concise_rationales__permissionsdispatcher-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`@OnShowRationale` Content:**
        *   **Plain Language:** Rationales (in `@OnShowRationale`) *must* be clear and non-technical.
        *   **Honest and Accurate:** Accurately explain *why* the permission is needed.
        *   **Specific to the Feature:** Tailor the rationale to the feature using the permission.
        *   **User-Centric:** Focus on user benefits.
        *   **No Manipulation:** Avoid coercive language.
    2.  **Review Process:**
        *   **Rationale Text Review:** Code reviews *must* check the rationale text in `@OnShowRationale`.
        *   **User Perspective:** Evaluate from a non-technical user's viewpoint.
    3.  **Testing (PermissionsDispatcher-Focused):**
        *   **UI Testing:** Verify the rationale (from `@OnShowRationale`) is displayed correctly and is interactive.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **User Mistrust:** *Severity: Medium*. Builds trust through transparent explanations within PermissionsDispatcher's rationale flow.
    *   **Low Permission Grant Rate:** *Severity: Medium*. Improves grant rates by making the request understandable.
    *   **Incorrect Rationale Handling:** *Severity: Medium*. Ensures the `@OnShowRationale` method functions as intended.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **User Mistrust:** Reduces mistrust by providing clear explanations via `@OnShowRationale`.
    *   **Low Permission Grant Rate:** Improves grant rates by making the request clearer.
    *   **Incorrect Rationale Handling:** Prevents issues with the rationale presentation managed by PermissionsDispatcher.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially. `@OnShowRationale` methods are used, but rationale quality varies.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Review and refactor all `@OnShowRationale` methods.
    *   Establish guidelines for writing effective rationales.
    *   Expand UI testing of rationale presentation (specifically testing PermissionsDispatcher's output).
