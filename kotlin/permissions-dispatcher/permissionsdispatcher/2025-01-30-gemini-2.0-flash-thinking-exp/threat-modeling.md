# Threat Model Analysis for permissions-dispatcher/permissionsdispatcher

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known security vulnerability within the PermissionsDispatcher library itself. This could involve crafting specific inputs or conditions that trigger the vulnerability, potentially leading to unauthorized code execution or denial of service.
*   **Impact:**  Application crash, denial of service, unauthorized access to application data or device resources, potential remote code execution depending on the vulnerability nature.
*   **Affected Component:** PermissionsDispatcher Library (Core library code)
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Regularly update PermissionsDispatcher to the latest stable version.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for PermissionsDispatcher.
        *   Implement dependency scanning in the development pipeline to detect known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Keep applications updated to the latest versions provided by developers, as updates often include security patches.

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Supply Chain Attack](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_supply_chain_attack.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the PermissionsDispatcher supply chain (e.g., repository, build system, distribution channel) and injects malicious code into the library. Developers unknowingly include this compromised library in their applications.
*   **Impact:**  Complete application compromise, data theft, malware distribution, unauthorized access to device resources, user account takeover, and other malicious activities.
*   **Affected Component:** PermissionsDispatcher Library (Distribution and potentially core library code if injected there)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Use reputable package managers and repositories (like Maven Central).
        *   Verify library integrity using checksums or signatures if available.
        *   Monitor PermissionsDispatcher repository for unusual activity.
        *   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to track and manage dependencies.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Difficult to mitigate directly. Rely on app developers and security practices of the library maintainers. Install apps only from trusted sources.

## Threat: [Code Generation Logic Flaw leading to Permission Bypass](./threats/code_generation_logic_flaw_leading_to_permission_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** A bug in the PermissionsDispatcher annotation processor causes it to generate incorrect or incomplete code for permission handling. This flawed code might fail to properly check or request permissions, allowing actions requiring permissions to be executed without authorization.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected device resources (camera, microphone, location, storage, etc.), potential data leaks, privacy violations, and unexpected application behavior.
*   **Affected Component:** PermissionsDispatcher Annotation Processor (Code generation logic)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Thoroughly test permission handling logic in the application, especially generated code paths.
        *   Review generated code to ensure correctness and alignment with intended permission flow.
        *   Report any suspected code generation issues to PermissionsDispatcher maintainers.
        *   Use integration tests to verify permission flows in different scenarios and Android versions.
