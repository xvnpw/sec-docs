## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE - Root Goal] Compromise Application Using PermissionsDispatcher](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node_-_root_goal__compromise_application_using_permissionsdispatcher.md)

This is the ultimate objective of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access or control within the application, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or other malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE - Primary Attack Vector] [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Developer Misuse of PermissionsDispatcher](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node_-_primary_attack_vector___high-risk_path__exploit_developer_misuse_of_permissionsdisp_42075f5c.md)

This is the most probable and impactful attack vector. Developers, even with good intentions, can make mistakes in implementing security measures. Misusing PermissionsDispatcher, despite its simplification of permission handling, can introduce significant vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Incorrect Permission Handling Logic](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__incorrect_permission_handling_logic.md)

This path focuses on flaws in the application's logic related to permission handling, specifically within the context of PermissionsDispatcher's annotations and callbacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Bypass Permission Checks due to flawed @OnPermissionDenied or @OnNeverAskAgain implementation](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__bypass_permission_checks_due_to_flawed_@onpermissiondenied_or_@onneveraskagain_impl_065a62c7.md)

Attack Vector: Developers might not correctly implement the `@OnPermissionDenied` and `@OnNeverAskAgain` methods. If these methods don't properly handle the scenario where a user denies permissions, or if the application logic doesn't enforce restrictions when permissions are denied, attackers can bypass intended permission-based access controls.

[CRITICAL NODE - Mitigation for High-Risk Path] Actionable Insight: Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms when permissions are denied. Thoroughly test permission denial scenarios.

Mitigation: Developers must ensure that `@OnPermissionDenied` and `@OnNeverAskAgain` methods effectively prevent access to protected functionalities when permissions are not granted.  Rigorous testing, especially for permission denial scenarios, is crucial.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Inconsistent permission state management leading to bypasses](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__inconsistent_permission_state_management_leading_to_bypasses.md)

Attack Vector: Applications might incorrectly cache or manage permission states. If the application relies on outdated permission information and doesn't re-verify permissions before accessing protected resources, an attacker could potentially manipulate the permission state (e.g., by revoking and re-granting permissions in a specific sequence) to bypass checks.

[CRITICAL NODE - Mitigation for High-Risk Path] Actionable Insight: Ensure permission checks are performed immediately before accessing protected resources, not relying on cached or outdated permission states. Use `PermissionUtils.hasSelfPermissions` for up-to-date checks.

Mitigation:  Developers should always perform permission checks immediately before accessing sensitive resources or functionalities.  Using `PermissionUtils.hasSelfPermissions` ensures the check reflects the current permission state, preventing bypasses due to outdated information.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE - Architectural Weakness] [HIGH-RISK PATH] Over-reliance on PermissionsDispatcher without proper fallback](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node_-_architectural_weakness___high-risk_path__over-reliance_on_permissionsdispatcher_wit_dc3fae13.md)

This highlights a fundamental architectural flaw where the application's security relies too heavily on client-side permission checks managed by PermissionsDispatcher, without adequate fallbacks or server-side enforcement.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Critical functionality solely dependent on PermissionsDispatcher without alternative paths](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__critical_functionality_solely_dependent_on_permissionsdispatcher_without_alternativ_25493857.md)

Attack Vector: If critical application functionality is exclusively gated by PermissionsDispatcher checks without any alternative access control mechanisms, any bypass of PermissionsDispatcher (even hypothetical) or failure in permission granting could lead to insecure breakdown of the functionality.

[CRITICAL NODE - Mitigation for High-Risk Path] Actionable Insight: Design applications to gracefully degrade or offer alternative functionalities if permissions are not granted or if PermissionsDispatcher encounters issues. Avoid single points of failure.

Mitigation: Applications should be designed to handle scenarios where permissions are not granted or where PermissionsDispatcher might fail.  Graceful degradation or alternative functionality paths should be implemented to prevent critical functionality from becoming insecurely accessible or completely breaking down.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE - Major Security Gap] [HIGH-RISK PATH] Lack of server-side or backend permission enforcement](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node_-_major_security_gap___high-risk_path__lack_of_server-side_or_backend_permission_enfo_8ee8727d.md)

Attack Vector: PermissionsDispatcher operates on the client-side. If the backend systems and APIs lack corresponding authorization and access control checks, attackers can bypass client-side permission checks entirely by directly interacting with the backend APIs. Client-side checks become merely a UX feature, not a true security barrier.

[CRITICAL NODE - Mitigation for High-Risk Path] Actionable Insight: Implement server-side authorization and access control mechanisms to complement client-side permission handling. Client-side checks are for UX and convenience, not primary security.

Mitigation: Server-side authorization is paramount. Backend systems must independently verify user permissions and enforce access control policies. Client-side checks using PermissionsDispatcher should be considered primarily for user experience and convenience, not as the primary security mechanism.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Social Engineering Attacks Leveraging PermissionsDispatcher UI/UX](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__social_engineering_attacks_leveraging_permissionsdispatcher_uiux.md)

This path considers social engineering attacks that exploit the user interface and user experience aspects of permission requests, potentially facilitated by how PermissionsDispatcher presents these requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploiting user fatigue with permission requests](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploiting_user_fatigue_with_permission_requests.md)

Attack Vector: Applications that excessively request permissions, especially upfront or repeatedly, can lead to "permission fatigue." Users become desensitized to permission dialogs and may start granting permissions carelessly without fully understanding the implications, increasing the likelihood of granting unnecessary or potentially harmful permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Bombarding users with frequent permission requests, leading to careless permission grants](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__bombarding_users_with_frequent_permission_requests__leading_to_careless_permission__888424a9.md)

Attack Vector (Specific):  Continuously or frequently prompting users for permissions, even for features not immediately in use, can exacerbate user fatigue.

## Attack Tree Path: [[AND] Application over-requests permissions, desensitizing users to permission dialogs](./attack_tree_paths/_and__application_over-requests_permissions__desensitizing_users_to_permission_dialogs.md)

Condition: The application requests more permissions than strictly necessary or requests them too often.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE - Mitigation for High-Risk Path] Actionable Insight: Follow the principle of least privilege. Only request necessary permissions and justify each request clearly. Request permissions contextually when needed, not upfront.](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node_-_mitigation_for_high-risk_path__actionable_insight_follow_the_principle_of_least_pri_7a37faa3.md)

Mitigation: Adhering to the principle of least privilege is crucial. Only request permissions that are absolutely necessary for the application's core functionality. Justify each permission request clearly in the rationale messages. Request permissions contextually, just before the feature requiring the permission is used, rather than upfront at application launch. This minimizes user fatigue and promotes informed consent.
