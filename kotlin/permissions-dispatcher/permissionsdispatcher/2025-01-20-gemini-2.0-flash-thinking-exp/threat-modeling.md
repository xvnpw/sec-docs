# Threat Model Analysis for permissions-dispatcher/permissionsdispatcher

## Threat: [Incorrect Annotation Usage Leading to Permission Bypass](./threats/incorrect_annotation_usage_leading_to_permission_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit scenarios where developers have incorrectly applied or omitted PermissionsDispatcher annotations (e.g., `@NeedsPermission`, `@OnShowRationale`, `@OnPermissionDenied`, `@OnNeverAskAgain`). This could lead to code intended to be protected by a permission being executed without the necessary grant. For example, a function annotated with `@NeedsPermission(CAMERA)` might be called directly without going through the generated permission request flow if the developer makes a mistake.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to device resources (camera, location, contacts, microphone, storage, etc.) or functionality. This could lead to privacy breaches, data theft, or malicious actions performed without user consent.

**Affected Component:** Annotations (`@NeedsPermission`, `@OnShowRationale`, `@OnPermissionDenied`, `@OnNeverAskAgain`) and the generated code that relies on these annotations.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement thorough code reviews, specifically focusing on the correct placement and usage of PermissionsDispatcher annotations.
* Utilize static analysis tools to automatically detect potential misconfigurations in annotation usage.
* Conduct comprehensive testing of all permission-dependent features, including edge cases and error scenarios.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in PermissionsDispatcher Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_permissionsdispatcher_library_itself.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit undiscovered security vulnerabilities within the PermissionsDispatcher library code. This could potentially allow them to bypass permission checks or cause other unexpected behavior.

**Impact:** Depending on the nature of the vulnerability, this could lead to unauthorized access to resources, denial of service, or other security issues.

**Affected Component:** The PermissionsDispatcher library code itself.

**Risk Severity:** Depends on the specific vulnerability (can range from low to critical, assuming a critical vulnerability for this listing).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Stay updated with the latest versions of the PermissionsDispatcher library to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
* Monitor the library's issue tracker and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities.
* Consider using static analysis tools on the library's code if feasible.
