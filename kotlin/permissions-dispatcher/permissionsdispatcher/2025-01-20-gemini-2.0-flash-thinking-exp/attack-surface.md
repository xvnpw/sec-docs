# Attack Surface Analysis for permissions-dispatcher/permissionsdispatcher

## Attack Surface: [Logic flaws in the generated code for permission checks](./attack_surfaces/logic_flaws_in_the_generated_code_for_permission_checks.md)

* **Description:** Logic flaws in the generated code for permission checks, potentially allowing actions requiring permissions to be executed without proper authorization.
    * **How PermissionsDispatcher Contributes:** The library's annotation processor generates code to handle permission requests and callbacks. Errors in this generated logic can lead to incorrect permission evaluations.
    * **Example:** A developer intends that a camera function only executes if camera permission is granted. Due to a flaw in the generated code, the function executes even if the permission is denied.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources (e.g., camera, microphone, location), potentially leading to privacy breaches or malicious actions.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Thoroughly review the generated code to ensure correct permission checking logic. Implement robust unit and integration tests specifically targeting permission-dependent functionalities. Consider using static analysis tools to identify potential flaws in generated code patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Race conditions in the handling of asynchronous permission requests and their callbacks](./attack_surfaces/race_conditions_in_the_handling_of_asynchronous_permission_requests_and_their_callbacks.md)

* **Description:** Race conditions in the handling of asynchronous permission requests and their callbacks, potentially leading to inconsistent application state or bypassed security checks.
    * **How PermissionsDispatcher Contributes:** The library manages asynchronous permission requests and uses callbacks to notify the application of the result. If not handled carefully, the timing of these asynchronous operations can create race conditions.
    * **Example:** A user grants a permission, but before the callback is processed, another part of the application attempts to access the protected resource, potentially failing or behaving unexpectedly. In a more severe scenario, an attacker might manipulate the application state between the permission grant and the callback processing to bypass intended restrictions.
    * **Impact:** Unexpected application behavior, potential denial of service, or in some cases, bypassing security checks leading to unauthorized access.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement proper synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks, mutexes) when accessing shared resources that depend on permission status. Carefully manage the application state related to pending permission requests. Avoid making assumptions about the order of callback execution.
