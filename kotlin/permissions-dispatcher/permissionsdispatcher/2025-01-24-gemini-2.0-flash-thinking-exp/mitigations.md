## Mitigation Strategy: [Thoroughly Review Generated Code](./mitigation_strategies/thoroughly_review_generated_code.md)

*   **Description:**
        1.  **Locate Generated Code:** After building your project, find the generated code for `permissionsdispatcher`. This is typically located in the `build` directory under `generated/source/kapt` (for Kotlin with kapt) or `generated/source/apt` (for Java with apt).
        2.  **Inspect Generated Classes:** Open and carefully read the generated classes (usually named like `[YourActivity/Fragment/Class]PermissionsDispatcher.java` or `.kt`).
        3.  **Verify Permission Checks Logic:** Examine the generated methods for `@NeedsPermission`, `@OnShowRationale`, `@OnPermissionDenied`, and `@OnNeverAskAgain`. Ensure the generated logic correctly implements the permission flow as intended by `permissionsdispatcher` annotations.
        4.  **Check Callback Logic Implementation:** Verify that the calls to your original methods annotated with `@NeedsPermission` and the callback methods are correctly generated by `permissionsdispatcher` and handle all permission states appropriately.
        5.  **Look for Unintended Logic in Generated PermissionsDispatcher Code:**  Specifically look for any unexpected or potentially vulnerable logic *introduced by the `permissionsdispatcher` code generation process itself*.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Logic Errors in PermissionsDispatcher Generated Code (Medium Severity):**  Incorrect code generation by `permissionsdispatcher` could lead to flaws in permission checks or callback execution, potentially bypassing security measures or causing unexpected behavior due to the library's code generation.
        *   **Unintended Side Effects from PermissionsDispatcher Generation (Medium Severity):** Generated code by `permissionsdispatcher` might introduce unintended side effects if not carefully reviewed, potentially leading to vulnerabilities or application instability originating from the library's code generation.
