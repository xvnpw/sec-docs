### High and Critical RxKotlin Threats

Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve RxKotlin components:

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure via Observable Streams
    *   **Description:** An attacker might gain access to sensitive information that is inadvertently included in observable streams. This occurs because the data flows through the RxKotlin stream, making it potentially visible in logs, monitoring tools, or if the stream's output is exposed to unauthorized components. The attacker exploits the inherent flow of data within the reactive stream.
    *   **Impact:**  Confidentiality breach, potential legal and regulatory repercussions, reputational damage, and financial loss due to the exposure of sensitive data like personal information, API keys, or financial details.
    *   **Affected RxKotlin Component:** `Observable`, `Flowable`, various operators used within the stream (`map`, `filter`, etc.), and potentially `Subjects` or `Processors` if they are the source of the sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review the data flowing through observable streams and avoid including sensitive information unless absolutely necessary.
        *   Implement data masking or anonymization techniques *within* the stream processing pipeline for sensitive data.
        *   Ensure secure logging practices and avoid logging the output or intermediate values of streams containing sensitive data.
        *   Restrict access to monitoring tools and logs that might capture stream data.

*   **Threat:** Unintended Data Sharing via Subjects/Processors
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit improperly secured or scoped `Subjects` or `Processors` to gain access to data they shouldn't have. The attacker subscribes to a `Subject` or `Processor` that is unintentionally exposed, receiving data emitted through it. This directly leverages the publish/subscribe nature of these RxKotlin components.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential for data manipulation if the Subject allows emission from unauthorized sources, and compromise of application logic.
    *   **Affected RxKotlin Component:** `Subject` (e.g., `PublishSubject`, `BehaviorSubject`, `ReplaySubject`), `Processor` (e.g., `PublishProcessor`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully control the scope and visibility of `Subjects` and `Processors`. Use appropriate access modifiers (e.g., `private`, `internal`).
        *   Avoid exposing `Subjects` or `Processors` directly to external or untrusted components.
        *   Consider using immutable data structures within streams to reduce the risk of unintended modification if a Subject is compromised.
        *   Implement authorization checks before allowing subscriptions to sensitive data streams managed by Subjects/Processors.

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion due to Unbounded Streams
    *   **Description:** An attacker could trigger or exploit observable streams that emit data indefinitely without proper termination or backpressure management. This leads to memory leaks as subscribers hold onto resources or internal buffers within RxKotlin grow indefinitely, eventually causing the application to crash or become unresponsive. The attacker exploits the lack of control over the stream's lifecycle or data rate within the RxKotlin framework.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application crashes, performance degradation, and potential system instability.
    *   **Affected RxKotlin Component:** `Observable`, `Flowable`, operators that generate or transform data (`interval`, custom emitters), and subscribers that don't unsubscribe properly. The internal buffering mechanisms of RxKotlin are also affected.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure all long-lived observable streams have clear termination conditions or mechanisms (e.g., using operators like `takeUntil`, `takeWhile`, or manual disposal of subscriptions).
        *   Implement proper backpressure strategies using `Flowable` and appropriate backpressure operators (`onBackpressureBuffer`, `onBackpressureDrop`, `onBackpressureLatest`) to manage the rate of data flow.
        *   Use timeouts for operations within streams to prevent indefinite blocking and resource holding.
        *   Monitor resource usage (memory, CPU) of applications using RxKotlin to detect potential leaks related to unbounded streams.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Observable Amplification
    *   **Description:** An attacker could send a small malicious input that triggers a complex chain of operations within an observable stream, leading to a significant increase in resource consumption (CPU, memory, network). This amplification effect, orchestrated through RxKotlin's operators and stream composition, can overwhelm the application and cause a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation, and potential infrastructure overload.
    *   **Affected RxKotlin Component:** `Observable`, `Flowable`, operators that perform computationally intensive tasks or trigger multiple downstream operations (`flatMap`, `concatMap`, etc.). The composition of the observable chain itself is a key factor.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully analyze the complexity of observable chains and identify potential amplification points where a single input can trigger many downstream operations.
        *   Implement rate limiting or throttling on input streams *before* they enter complex RxKotlin pipelines to prevent excessive processing.
        *   Set resource limits (e.g., thread pool sizes for schedulers used by the stream, buffer sizes for backpressure) for RxKotlin operations.
        *   Use appropriate schedulers to isolate potentially resource-intensive operations and prevent them from blocking other parts of the application.

*   **Threat:** Code Execution via Operator Misuse with Side Effects
    *   **Description:** An attacker might exploit the misuse of RxKotlin operators that allow side effects (e.g., `doOnNext`, `doOnError`, `doFinally`) if the logic within these operators is influenced by untrusted input. By manipulating the data flowing through the stream, the attacker can control the side effects executed by these operators, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system, data breaches, and malicious activities.
    *   **Affected RxKotlin Component:** Operators like `doOnNext`, `doOnError`, `doFinally`, and any custom operators that perform side effects based on data within the stream.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid performing critical or potentially dangerous operations within side-effecting operators based on external or untrusted input.
        *   Sanitize and validate all external input *before* it is processed by observable streams, especially if it influences side-effecting operators.
        *   Prefer pure functional transformations within streams and isolate side effects to specific, controlled parts of the application where input is trusted.
        *   Regularly review the codebase for potential misuse of side-effecting operators and ensure they are not vulnerable to input manipulation.
