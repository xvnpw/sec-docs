Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Data into Reactive Streams

* Goal: Introduce harmful data into the application's data flow, leading to unintended consequences.
* How RxKotlin is involved: RxKotlin manages the flow of data through Observables, Flowables, and Subjects/Relays.
* Critical Node: Exploit Lack of Input Validation in Observable Sources
    * Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Data via User Input Observable
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: High (XSS, Command Injection, Data Corruption)
        * Effort: Low
        * Skill Level: Beginner
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium (Requires monitoring input and output)
    * Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Data via External API Observable
        * Likelihood: Medium (Depends on API security)
        * Impact: High (Data Corruption, System Compromise if API is compromised)
        * Effort: Medium (Requires understanding API and potential vulnerabilities)
        * Skill Level: Intermediate
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium (Requires monitoring API traffic and data)

High-Risk Path: Exploit Security Vulnerabilities in RxKotlin Dependencies (Transitive)

* Goal: Leverage known vulnerabilities in the libraries that RxKotlin depends on.
* How RxKotlin is involved: RxKotlin relies on RxJava as its core dependency, and might have other transitive dependencies.
* Attack Vector: Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in RxJava (Core Dependency)
    * Likelihood: Low (If dependencies are regularly updated)
    * Impact: High (Depends on the specific vulnerability)
    * Effort: Low to High (Depends on the availability of exploits)
    * Skill Level: Beginner to Advanced (Depending on the exploit)
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium to High (May be detected by vulnerability scanners)
* Attack Vector: Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Other Transitive Dependencies
    * Likelihood: Low (If dependencies are regularly updated)
    * Impact: High (Depends on the specific vulnerability)
    * Effort: Low to High (Depends on the availability of exploits)
    * Skill Level: Beginner to Advanced (Depending on the exploit)
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium to High (May be detected by vulnerability scanners)

Critical Nodes:

* Exploit Lack of Input Validation in Observable Sources
    * Description: Failure to sanitize and validate data entering the reactive streams from various sources.
    * Why Critical: Acts as a primary entry point for injecting malicious data, leading to a wide range of high-impact attacks.

* Trigger Infinite Emission Loops
    * Description:  Crafting input or conditions that cause an Observable to emit data indefinitely.
    * Why Critical: Directly leads to complete Denial of Service by exhausting resources.

* Cause Deadlocks by Manipulating Schedulers
    * Description: Strategically scheduling tasks on different schedulers to create deadlock situations.
    * Why Critical: Results in a complete application freeze, severely impacting availability.

* Create Circular Dependencies in Observable Chains
    * Description: Carelessly combining Observables leading to circular dependencies where each Observable is waiting for the other.
    * Why Critical: Results in a complete application freeze.

* Block Threads Indefinitely via Scheduler Manipulation
    * Description: Manipulating the scheduling of tasks to block threads indefinitely.
    * Why Critical: Leads to a complete application freeze.

* Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in RxJava (Core Dependency)
    * Description: Exploiting publicly known security flaws in the underlying RxJava library.
    * Why Critical: RxJava is a fundamental dependency, and vulnerabilities here can have widespread and severe consequences.
