# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for touchlab/kermit

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Strict Log Level Management](./mitigation_strategies/implement_strict_log_level_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Kermit Log Levels for Environments:** Establish clear guidelines for using Kermit's log levels (`Verbose`, `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn`, `Error`, `Assert`) in different environments (Development, Staging, Production).  Prioritize higher levels (e.g., `Warn`, `Error`) for production to minimize verbosity.
    2.  **Environment-Specific Kermit Configuration:**  Leverage build configurations, environment variables, or configuration files to dynamically set the *minimum* log level for Kermit based on the deployment environment.  This ensures verbose logging is enabled only where intended (e.g., development).
    3.  **Code Reviews for Kermit Log Level Usage:**  Incorporate checks for appropriate Kermit log level usage into code reviews. Ensure developers are consciously choosing the correct level and not defaulting to overly verbose levels in production-bound code.
    4.  **Runtime Kermit Level Adjustment (Controlled):**  Optionally, implement a mechanism to adjust Kermit's log level at runtime for debugging in non-production environments. This should be secured and disabled or restricted in production deployments.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):**  Accidental exposure of sensitive application details due to overly verbose Kermit logging in production.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Significantly reduces the risk by controlling the verbosity of Kermit logs in production, limiting the potential for sensitive data leaks.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Environment-specific configuration using build variants exists, but explicit Kermit log level management per environment is not strictly defined or enforced.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal documentation of environment-specific Kermit log level guidelines.
    *   Automated checks or linting rules to enforce Kermit log level usage during development.
    *   Secure runtime Kermit log level adjustment mechanism for non-production.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize and Redact Sensitive Data Before Logging with Kermit](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_and_redact_sensitive_data_before_logging_with_kermit.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data for Kermit Logging:**  Pinpoint all data types considered sensitive that might be passed to Kermit for logging (e.g., PII, API keys, internal paths).
    2.  **Develop Kermit Sanitization Functions/Interceptors:** Create reusable utility functions or interceptors specifically designed to sanitize sensitive data *before* it's passed to Kermit's logging functions. Techniques include redaction, hashing, or truncation.
    3.  **Apply Sanitization to Kermit Logging Statements:**  Consistently use these sanitization functions in code *before* calling Kermit's logging methods whenever sensitive data might be included in the log message.
    4.  **Code Review Focus on Kermit Logging Sanitization:**  During code reviews, specifically examine Kermit logging statements to verify that sensitive data is being properly sanitized *before* being logged via Kermit.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):**  Directly logging sensitive data through Kermit, leading to exposure in log outputs.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Significantly reduces the risk of sensitive data leaks in Kermit logs by proactively sanitizing data before it reaches the logging system.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No - No systematic sanitization of data before using Kermit for logging is currently implemented. Reliance is on developer awareness.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Identification of sensitive data types relevant to Kermit logging.
    *   Development of Kermit-specific sanitization utility functions or interceptors.
    *   Integration of sanitization into Kermit logging calls throughout the application.
    *   Code review checklist item for Kermit logging sanitization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration of Kermit Sinks](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_of_kermit_sinks.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Kermit Sink Security Review:** For each Kermit sink configured (e.g., file sink, network sink, crash reporting sink), conduct a security review of its specific configuration within the Kermit setup.
    2.  **Secure Protocols for Kermit Network Sinks:** If using network sinks with Kermit to send logs remotely, ensure secure protocols (HTTPS, TLS) are configured for Kermit's network communication to protect log data in transit.
    3.  **Authentication for Kermit Network Sinks:**  If Kermit is configured to use network sinks requiring authentication, ensure strong authentication mechanisms are properly configured within Kermit's sink setup.
    4.  **Kermit File Sink Permissions:** When using file sinks with Kermit, verify that the directory and file permissions configured for Kermit's file output are appropriately restrictive.
    5.  **Third-Party Kermit Sink Security:** If integrating Kermit with third-party logging services via custom sinks or integrations, thoroughly review the security implications of the Kermit integration and the third-party service's security posture.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):**  Insecure transmission of Kermit logs over networks or misconfigured sink permissions leading to exposure.
    *   **Log Tampering (Low Severity):**  Potential for attackers to intercept and modify Kermit logs in transit if insecure protocols are used by Kermit's network sinks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Moderately reduces the risk by securing Kermit's communication channels and output destinations.
    *   Log Tampering: Slightly reduces the risk of log manipulation during transmission from Kermit.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - File sinks are used with basic permissions. Network sinks via Kermit are not currently used. Security review of Kermit sink configurations is not formally conducted.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal security review of all configured Kermit sinks.
    *   Implementation of secure protocols and authentication for Kermit network sinks (if used).
    *   Regular review of security configurations for third-party services integrated with Kermit.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review and Audit Custom Kermit Sinks](./mitigation_strategies/review_and_audit_custom_kermit_sinks.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Secure Coding for Custom Kermit Sinks:** If custom Kermit sinks are developed, strictly adhere to secure coding practices during their development.
    2.  **Security Code Review of Custom Kermit Sinks:** Conduct in-depth security code reviews specifically for all custom Kermit sink implementations. Focus on vulnerabilities within the custom sink's code that could impact log security or application security.
    3.  **Security Testing of Custom Kermit Sinks:** Perform security testing (static analysis, dynamic analysis, unit tests focusing on security aspects) on custom Kermit sinks to proactively identify and fix vulnerabilities within the sink's logic.
    4.  **Regular Audits of Custom Kermit Sinks:** Periodically audit the code and configurations of custom Kermit sinks to ensure they remain secure and aligned with security best practices over time.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium to High Severity):**  Vulnerabilities in custom Kermit sinks leading to unintended exposure of log data or other sensitive information.
    *   **Code Injection (Medium Severity):**  Potential for code injection vulnerabilities within custom Kermit sinks if input handling is flawed.
    *   **Denial of Service (Low to Medium Severity):**  Resource exhaustion or other vulnerabilities in custom Kermit sinks causing denial of service.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Moderately to Significantly reduces risk depending on the severity of vulnerabilities in custom sinks.
    *   Code Injection: Moderately reduces risk by identifying and fixing injection flaws in custom sinks.
    *   Denial of Service: Slightly to Moderately reduces risk by addressing resource and error handling in custom sinks.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Applicable - No custom Kermit sinks are currently implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   N/A - This becomes relevant if custom Kermit sinks are developed. If planned, secure development practices, code reviews, and security testing for custom sinks will be missing until implemented.
