# Threat Model Analysis for touchlab/kermit

## Threat: [Accidental Logging of Highly Sensitive Data](./threats/accidental_logging_of_highly_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Threat:** Accidental Logging of Highly Sensitive Data
*   **Description:** Developers may unintentionally log highly sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, cryptographic secrets, or critical PII (e.g., full credit card details, national IDs) using Kermit's logging functions (e.g., `d`, `i`, `w`, `e`, `v`). An attacker who gains access to these logs could directly compromise critical systems or user accounts due to the exposed secrets. This access could be achieved through insecure log storage, transmission, or unauthorized access to log management systems.
*   **Impact:** **Critical** information disclosure leading to immediate and severe security breaches. Potential for full system compromise, account takeover, significant financial loss, and severe regulatory penalties.
*   **Kermit Component Affected:** Kermit Logging Functions (`d`, `i`, `w`, `e`, `v`), Log Sinks (indirectly, as they store the logs).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement mandatory and rigorous code reviews specifically focused on identifying and eliminating logging of highly sensitive data.
    *   Establish a strict "no logging of secrets" policy and provide comprehensive developer training on secure logging practices and the definition of highly sensitive data.
    *   Utilize static analysis tools to automatically detect potential logging of sensitive keywords or patterns.
    *   Implement dynamic configuration of logging levels, ensuring highly verbose levels (like `Debug` or `Verbose`) are strictly disabled in production environments.
    *   Mandate the use of data masking or redaction for any logs that might potentially contain sensitive data, even if not intended.
    *   Implement robust security measures for log storage and transmission (encryption, access controls) as a secondary defense, but primarily focus on preventing sensitive data from being logged in the first place.
    *   Regularly and proactively audit logs in non-production environments to identify and rectify any instances of accidental sensitive data logging before deployment to production.

## Threat: [Kermit Library Vulnerabilities Leading to Code Execution or Data Breach](./threats/kermit_library_vulnerabilities_leading_to_code_execution_or_data_breach.md)

*   **Threat:** Kermit Library Vulnerabilities Leading to Code Execution or Data Breach
*   **Description:**  Critical security vulnerabilities might be discovered in the Kermit library itself. If exploited, these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the application using Kermit, potentially leading to full system compromise. Alternatively, vulnerabilities could enable direct access to application data or bypass security controls. Exploitation could occur if the application is exposed to malicious input that triggers the vulnerability in Kermit, or if an attacker can somehow manipulate the logging process to inject malicious code.
*   **Impact:** **Critical** system compromise, remote code execution, unauthorized access to sensitive data, data breaches, denial of service, complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
*   **Kermit Component Affected:** Kermit Library Code (core modules, specific functions, potentially all components depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the specific vulnerability and its exploitability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediately** update Kermit library to the latest version upon release of security patches or advisories. Implement a process for rapid patching of dependencies.
    *   Proactively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases specifically for Kermit and its dependencies (Kotlin, multiplatform libraries). Subscribe to security mailing lists and feeds.
    *   Incorporate static analysis security testing (SAST) and software composition analysis (SCA) tools into the development pipeline to automatically detect known vulnerabilities in Kermit and other dependencies.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization throughout the application, even in logging contexts, to minimize the risk of triggering potential vulnerabilities through malicious input.
    *   In case of a discovered vulnerability with no immediate patch, consider temporary mitigations such as disabling or limiting the use of the affected Kermit features if feasible, or implementing application-level workarounds to prevent exploitation until a patch is available.
    *   Maintain a security incident response plan that includes procedures for handling vulnerabilities in third-party libraries like Kermit, including rapid assessment, patching, and communication.
