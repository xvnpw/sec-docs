### 6. Current Implementation Status and Missing Implementation

*   **Currently Implemented: Not Applicable - No custom Kermit sinks are currently implemented.**

This indicates that the strategy is currently **proactive** and **preparatory**.  It is crucial to recognize that while no custom sinks exist *now*, the strategy is essential *if* custom sinks are planned or developed in the future.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
