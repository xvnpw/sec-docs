# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - The primary business priority addressed by the Kermit library is to enhance the observability and debuggability of Kotlin Multiplatform applications.
  - The main goal is to provide a consistent and efficient logging solution across different platforms (Android, iOS, JVM, etc.) for Kotlin developers.
  - This contributes to faster development cycles, easier debugging, and improved application stability and maintainability.
  - By simplifying logging, Kermit aims to reduce development costs and improve the overall quality of Kotlin Multiplatform applications.

- Business Risks:
  - Unintentional logging of sensitive data: If developers are not careful, they might log personally identifiable information (PII), API keys, or other confidential data, leading to potential privacy violations or security breaches.
  - Performance overhead: Excessive or inefficient logging can negatively impact application performance, especially in production environments.
  - Dependency risk: Relying on a third-party library introduces a dependency risk. Although Kermit is open-source, vulnerabilities in the library or its dependencies could affect applications using it.
  - Misconfiguration: Incorrectly configured logging levels or destinations can lead to either insufficient logging for debugging or excessive logging that fills up storage or impacts performance.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code review process on GitHub for contributions to the Kermit library. (Implemented on GitHub)
  - security control: Open-source nature of the library allows for community scrutiny and vulnerability reporting. (Described by project nature)
  - accepted risk: Dependency on third-party libraries and potential vulnerabilities within them. (Implicitly accepted by using open-source libraries)
  - accepted risk: Risk of developers misusing the library and logging sensitive information. (Implicitly accepted as developer responsibility)

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated static analysis security testing (SAST) in the Kermit library's CI/CD pipeline to identify potential code vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Provide clear documentation and best practices for developers on how to use Kermit securely, emphasizing the importance of avoiding logging sensitive data and configuring logging levels appropriately.
  - security control: Encourage and facilitate security vulnerability reporting through a clear process, such as a SECURITY.md file in the repository.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable for a logging library itself. Authentication is relevant for systems that consume or process logs generated by applications using Kermit (e.g., log aggregation systems).
  - Authorization: Not applicable for a logging library itself. Authorization is relevant for controlling access to logs generated by applications using Kermit.
  - Input Validation: While Kermit primarily handles string messages, input validation is relevant to prevent log injection vulnerabilities if log messages are processed by downstream systems in a way that could be exploited (e.g., if logs are directly interpreted as commands). Kermit should ensure that log messages are handled safely and do not introduce injection risks in typical logging scenarios.
  - Cryptography: Cryptography is not a core requirement for Kermit itself. However, if logs generated by Kermit need to be transmitted or stored securely, encryption should be considered at the application level or within the logging infrastructure.

## DEPLOYMENT

- Deployment Architecture Options:

  - Backend Application Deployment (JVM): Kermit is included as a dependency in backend applications deployed to servers (cloud VMs, containers, on-premise servers). Logs are typically written to files, standard output, or sent to centralized logging systems.
  - Desktop Application Deployment (JVM): Similar to backend applications, Kermit can be used in desktop applications deployed to user computers. Logs can be stored locally or sent to remote systems.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - For the Kermit library itself, there are no direct critical business processes. Its value is in enabling logging for applications.
  - For applications using Kermit, critical business processes depend on the application's purpose. Logging is crucial for:
    - Incident response and troubleshooting: Quickly identifying and resolving issues in production.
    - Performance monitoring and optimization: Understanding application performance and identifying bottlenecks.
    - Security auditing and compliance: Recording security-related events and meeting regulatory requirements.
    - Debugging and development: Facilitating efficient development and bug fixing.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - The primary data to protect is the log data generated by applications using Kermit.
  - Sensitivity of log data depends entirely on what is logged by the application. Logs can contain:
    - Non-sensitive operational data: Application events, performance metrics, debug information. Low sensitivity.
    - Potentially sensitive data: User IDs, IP addresses, timestamps. Medium sensitivity.
    - Highly sensitive data: Personally identifiable information (PII), API keys, passwords, financial data. High sensitivity.
  - It is crucial to avoid logging highly sensitive data and to implement appropriate security controls for logs based on their sensitivity.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the intended use cases for Kermit in terms of application types and industries? Understanding the typical applications using Kermit would help tailor security recommendations.
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) that applications using Kermit might need to adhere to? This would influence the security requirements for logging.
  - What is the process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in the Kermit library? A clear vulnerability management process is essential for open-source projects.

- Assumptions:
  - Kermit is primarily used by Kotlin developers to enhance the observability and debuggability of their applications.
  - Developers using Kermit are responsible for configuring logging levels and destinations appropriately and for avoiding logging sensitive data.
  - Security of the applications using Kermit is the responsibility of the application developers and operators, not directly the Kermit library itself.
  - The Kermit project aims to follow secure development practices for the library itself, but the primary focus is on providing a functional and efficient logging solution.
