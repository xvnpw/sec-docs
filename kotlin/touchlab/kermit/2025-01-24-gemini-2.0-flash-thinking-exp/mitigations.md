# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for touchlab/kermit

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Log Level Control using Kermit](./mitigation_strategies/implement_log_level_control_using_kermit.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Developers should utilize Kermit's built-in log level functionality. This involves setting the desired `Level` (Verbose, Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Assert, None) when initializing Kermit. For example, using `Kermit(logger = object : Logger { override fun log(severity: Severity, message: String, tag: String?, throwable: Throwable?) { ... } }, defaultTag = "MyApp", defaultSeverity = Level.Info)`. 
    2.  Configure different `defaultSeverity` levels for different build types or environments. For instance, set `Level.Debug` for debug builds and `Level.Warn` for release builds. This can be achieved using conditional compilation or environment variables within your Kotlin code.
    3.  Ensure that the chosen `defaultSeverity` in production environments is restrictive enough (e.g., `Warn` or `Error`) to minimize verbose logging and potential information disclosure, while still capturing critical errors.
    4.  Document the configured log levels for each environment and communicate this to the development team to maintain consistency.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure (Medium) - Accidental logging of sensitive data in production due to overly verbose logging. Severity: Medium, as it depends on the sensitivity of the data and log destination access.
    *   Performance Impact (Low) - Reduced performance overhead in production by limiting the volume of logs generated by Kermit. Severity: Low, unless excessive logging is a major bottleneck.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Medium - Reduces the *likelihood* of accidental sensitive data logging in production by controlling the verbosity of Kermit logs.
    *   Performance Impact: Low - Minimally reduces performance impact by decreasing log volume generated by Kermit, especially in high-traffic scenarios.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, Log levels are currently set during Kermit initialization in `Application.kt`. `defaultSeverity` is configured to `Level.Debug` for debug builds and `Level.Warn` for release builds.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Dynamic log level adjustment for Kermit during runtime is not implemented.  Currently, log levels are fixed at application build time. Consider exploring if Kermit's API allows for runtime level changes or if a custom wrapper around Kermit could facilitate this.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Data Before Logging with Kermit](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_data_before_logging_with_kermit.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Before using Kermit's `log` functions, developers must explicitly sanitize any potentially sensitive data that will be included in the log message.
    2.  This sanitization should happen *in the code* immediately before the `Kermit.log` call.  Do not rely on log sinks or external systems to sanitize Kermit logs.
    3.  Utilize Kotlin's string manipulation capabilities or create dedicated sanitization functions to modify sensitive data before logging with Kermit. Examples include:
        *   Redacting parts of strings: `Kermit.i { "Phone number: ${phoneNumber.replaceRange(3, 7, "****")}" }`
        *   Logging hashes instead of raw values: `Kermit.w { "User hash: ${hashFunction(sensitiveData)}" }`
        *   Using placeholders: `Kermit.e { "Error processing user ID: [masked]" }`
    4.  Review all Kermit logging statements and ensure that sanitization is applied where necessary *before* the data is passed to Kermit's logging functions.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure (High) - Exposure of sensitive PII, credentials, or internal system details in logs generated by Kermit. Severity: High, as it can lead to privacy breaches, compliance violations, and security vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: High - Significantly reduces the *risk* of sensitive data exposure in Kermit logs by enforcing sanitization *before* logging using Kermit's API.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic redaction is used for logging API keys in network request logs within `NetworkModule.kt` before calling Kermit.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Consistent sanitization is not applied across all Kermit logging points. A comprehensive review is needed to identify all Kermit log usages and implement sanitization for user input, database interactions, and business logic *before* passing data to Kermit. Reusable sanitization utilities specifically for use with Kermit logging are not yet created.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Kermit's Tagging for Structured Logging](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_kermit's_tagging_for_structured_logging.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Effectively use Kermit's `withTag(tag: String)` function to categorize and structure logs. Assign meaningful tags to logs based on the component, module, or functionality from which they originate. For example: `Kermit.withTag("Network").i { "Request started..." }` or `Kermit.withTag("Database").e { "Connection error" }`.
    2.  Establish a consistent tagging convention across the project. Document the meaning of each tag and ensure developers adhere to this convention when using Kermit.
    3.  While Kermit's default output is plain text, using tags consistently allows for easier filtering and searching of logs based on components. This can be beneficial for security analysis and incident investigation.
    4.  Consider using tags to differentiate between different types of logs (e.g., "Security", "Performance", "BusinessLogic") in addition to component-based tags.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure (Medium) - While not directly preventing disclosure, Kermit's tagging helps in better organizing and analyzing logs, making it easier to identify and manage potentially sensitive data within logs during analysis. Severity: Medium, as it aids in post-incident analysis and detection of potential disclosures within Kermit logs.
    *   Log Injection (Low) - Structured logging with tags, when combined with careful message construction in Kermit, can indirectly reduce the risk of log injection by making logs more structured and less prone to misinterpretation. Severity: Low, as it's not a primary mitigation for log injection but a helpful practice when using Kermit.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Medium - Improves the ability to audit and analyze Kermit logs for potential sensitive data leaks by providing structured categorization through tags.
    *   Log Injection: Low - Provides a minor indirect benefit in reducing log injection risks in Kermit logs.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `withTag` is used in some modules to categorize Kermit logs, but consistent tagging across all modules is not fully enforced.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  A project-wide standard for Kermit tagging needs to be defined and enforced.  More consistent and comprehensive use of `withTag` across all modules using Kermit is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Optimize Kermit Log Output Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/optimize_kermit_log_output_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When configuring Kermit, choose efficient `LogWriter` implementations.  The default `PrintlnLogWriter` is suitable for basic use, but for more performance-sensitive applications or specific environments, consider custom `LogWriter` implementations if needed.
    2.  While Kermit's formatting is generally simple, avoid adding unnecessary complexity to log messages that could impact performance, especially in high-volume logging scenarios. Keep Kermit log messages concise and focused on essential information.
    3.  If using custom `LogWriter` implementations with Kermit, ensure they are optimized for performance and do not introduce unnecessary overhead. Consider asynchronous logging within custom `LogWriter` if logging operations are impacting application responsiveness.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Performance Impact (Low) - Reduces the performance overhead associated with Kermit logging operations, especially in high-volume scenarios. Severity: Low, unless Kermit logging is a significant performance bottleneck.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Indirectly reduces the risk of DoS by minimizing resource consumption related to Kermit logging. Severity: Low, as it's a minor contributing factor to overall system resilience.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Performance Impact: Low - Minimally reduces performance impact by optimizing Kermit logging operations.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Low - Provides a minor indirect benefit in improving system resilience against DoS related to logging.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Default `PrintlnLogWriter` is used. No specific optimization efforts for Kermit output have been undertaken.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Performance profiling of Kermit logging operations has not been conducted to identify potential bottlenecks.  Exploration of custom or more efficient `LogWriter` implementations for specific use cases within Kermit could be considered if performance becomes an issue.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Kermit Configuration within Application](./mitigation_strategies/secure_kermit_configuration_within_application.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Ensure that any Kermit configuration within the application code (e.g., `defaultSeverity`, custom `LogWriter` initialization) is reviewed and securely managed.
    2.  Avoid hardcoding sensitive configuration values directly within Kermit initialization if possible. While Kermit configuration is primarily code-based, if you are dynamically setting up Kermit based on external factors, ensure these factors are securely sourced.
    3.  If you extend Kermit with custom `LogWriter` implementations that require configuration (e.g., API keys for remote log sinks), manage these configurations securely using environment variables, secure configuration files, or secrets management systems, and not directly within the Kermit initialization code.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Configuration Changes (Low) - Prevents accidental or intentional modification of Kermit's behavior through insecure configuration practices within the application code itself. Severity: Low, as Kermit configuration is primarily code-based and less prone to external manipulation.
    *   Information Disclosure (Low) - Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive configuration parameters (e.g., API keys for custom Kermit `LogWriter` implementations) if configuration is not securely managed within the application. Severity: Low, depending on the sensitivity of the configuration data used with Kermit extensions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Configuration Changes: Low - Minimally reduces the *risk* of unauthorized modification of Kermit configuration within the application.
    *   Information Disclosure: Low - Minimally reduces the *risk* of accidental exposure of sensitive logging configuration data related to Kermit extensions.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `defaultSeverity` is configured using build-type dependent logic, which is reasonably secure.  No custom `LogWriter` implementations with external configuration are currently in use.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  If custom `LogWriter` implementations are introduced in the future that require external configuration, a secure configuration management strategy specifically for these Kermit extensions should be implemented.  Regular review of Kermit initialization code for any potential security misconfigurations is recommended.
