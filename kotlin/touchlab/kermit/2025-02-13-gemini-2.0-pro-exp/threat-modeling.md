# Threat Model Analysis for touchlab/kermit

## Threat: [Threat 1: Sensitive Data Exposure via Unprotected `LogWriter` Output (Kermit's Default Behavior)](./threats/threat_1_sensitive_data_exposure_via_unprotected__logwriter__output__kermit's_default_behavior_.md)

*   **Description:** Kermit, by default, provides basic `LogWriter` implementations (like `CommonWriter`, `NSLogWriter`, `OSLogWriter`) that output log messages directly to standard output (console), system logs, or platform-specific logging facilities. *These default writers do not perform any sanitization, redaction, or encryption.* If developers use these default writers *without modification* and log sensitive data, that data will be exposed in plain text wherever the logs are directed. The attacker gains access to the output destination (console, system log files, etc.).
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Confidentiality Breach:** Exposure of sensitive data (passwords, API keys, PII) leading to severe consequences (identity theft, financial loss, system compromise).
    *   **Kermit Component Affected:**
        *   Default `LogWriter` implementations: `CommonWriter`, `NSLogWriter`, `OSLogWriter`, and any other `LogWriter` that doesn't explicitly handle sensitive data. The core logging functions (`Logger.v()`, `Logger.d()`, etc.) are the entry points, but the *default writers* are the direct source of the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **1.  Mandatory Custom `LogWriter` for Sensitive Data:**  *Never* rely solely on the default `LogWriter` implementations in production, especially if the application handles *any* sensitive data.  *Always* implement a custom `LogWriter` that intercepts log messages *before* they are written. This custom writer *must* perform robust data masking/redaction using regular expressions, a dedicated PII redaction library, or a lookup table. This is the *primary and essential* mitigation.
        *   **2.  Code Reviews and Static Analysis:**  Enforce code reviews and use static analysis tools to detect any use of the default `LogWriter` implementations without accompanying redaction logic.  This acts as a secondary check.
        *   **3.  Secure Configuration:** If a custom `LogWriter` sends logs to a remote service, ensure that communication is encrypted (HTTPS) and that the receiving service has appropriate access controls and security measures.
        *   **4.  Log Level Restrictions:**  Enforce strict log level policies.  Prohibit the use of `Verbose` and `Debug` levels in production environments.

## Threat: [Threat 2: Log Injection *IF* Custom `LogWriter` is Vulnerable](./threats/threat_2_log_injection_if_custom__logwriter__is_vulnerable.md)

*   **Description:** While Kermit itself doesn't directly handle input validation, if a developer creates a *custom* `LogWriter` that is vulnerable to injection attacks, this becomes a Kermit-related threat.  For example, if the custom `LogWriter` takes the log message string and directly inserts it into an SQL query, HTML output, or a shell command *without proper sanitization or escaping*, an attacker could inject malicious code. This is a vulnerability in the *custom* `LogWriter`, but it's a direct consequence of extending Kermit.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Code Execution:**  Depending on the vulnerability in the custom `LogWriter`, the attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code on the system where the logs are being processed.
        *   **Data Corruption/Deletion:**  If the custom `LogWriter` interacts with a database, the attacker could inject SQL commands to modify or delete data.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the custom `LogWriter` outputs logs to a web interface, the attacker could inject JavaScript code, leading to XSS attacks.
    *   **Kermit Component Affected:**
        *   Custom `LogWriter` implementations. The vulnerability lies specifically in the *developer-written* code within the `LogWriter`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **1.  Secure Coding Practices for Custom `LogWriter`:**  Developers *must* follow secure coding practices when creating custom `LogWriter` implementations.  This includes:
            *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data *within the `LogWriter`* before using it in any potentially dangerous context (e.g., SQL queries, HTML output, shell commands).
            *   **Output Encoding:**  Use appropriate output encoding techniques (e.g., HTML encoding, URL encoding) to prevent injection attacks.
            *   **Parameterized Queries:**  If interacting with a database, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
            *   **Avoid Shell Commands:**  Avoid using shell commands if possible. If necessary, use secure APIs for interacting with the operating system.
        *   **2.  Code Reviews:**  Mandatory code reviews of *all* custom `LogWriter` implementations, with a specific focus on security vulnerabilities.
        *   **3.  Security Testing:**  Perform penetration testing and security audits to identify and address any vulnerabilities in custom `LogWriter` implementations.
