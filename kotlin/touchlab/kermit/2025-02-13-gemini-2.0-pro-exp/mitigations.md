## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Data Sanitization with Kermit Wrappers and Custom `LogWriter`](./mitigation_strategies/strict_data_sanitization_with_kermit_wrappers_and_custom__logwriter_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Wrapper Functions for Kermit:** Create Kotlin wrapper functions around Kermit's logging methods (e.g., `safeLogI(tag: String, message: () -> String)`, `safeLogE(tag: String, throwable: Throwable, message: () -> String)`).  These are the *only* allowed way to interact with Kermit.
2.  **Sanitization within Wrappers:**  Inside each wrapper function, call a centralized sanitization function (e.g., `sanitizeLogMessage(message: String): String`) to remove or mask sensitive data *before* passing the message to the underlying Kermit logging function.
3.  **Custom `LogWriter` (Defense in Depth):** Implement a custom `LogWriter` and configure Kermit to use it.  Within this `LogWriter`, *again* call the `sanitizeLogMessage` function on the received log message. This acts as a final safety net, catching any cases where the wrapper functions were bypassed.
4.  **`Throwable` Handling:**  Within the `safeLogE` wrapper (and the custom `LogWriter`), specifically sanitize the exception message and consider limiting the stack trace length before logging.
5. **Enforcement:** Enforce through code reviews and potentially static analysis that *only* the wrapper functions are used for logging. Direct calls to Kermit's API should be prohibited.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs (Severity: High):** Prevents sensitive data from being written to logs by sanitizing *all* messages passed to Kermit.
    *   **Log Injection (Severity: Medium):** Sanitization reduces the risk of injected content, although Kermit's string template usage already offers some protection.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Risk is significantly reduced (near-eliminated with correct implementation). The wrappers and custom `LogWriter` provide multiple layers of sanitization.
    *   **Log Injection:** Risk is reduced, but other strategies (outside the scope of Kermit) are more important for this threat.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "Wrapper functions (`safeLogI`, `safeLogE`, etc.) are in `logging/SafeLogger.kt`. A custom `LogWriter` is in `logging/SanitizingLogWriter.kt`."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "The custom `LogWriter` (`SanitizingLogWriter.kt`) needs to be updated to include the full sanitization logic. Code reviews are not consistently enforcing the use of the wrapper functions."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Kermit Configuration Hardening and Custom `LogWriter`](./mitigation_strategies/kermit_configuration_hardening_and_custom__logwriter_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Explicit `LogWriter`:**  *Always* explicitly configure Kermit to use a custom `LogWriter` in your application's initialization code.  Do *not* rely on Kermit's default `LogWriter` for the target platform without thorough review.
2.  **Custom `LogWriter` Functionality:** The custom `LogWriter` should:
    *   Implement sanitization (as described above).
    *   Implement rate limiting (see below).
    *   Potentially implement escaping for log analysis tools (though this is less directly related to Kermit).
3.  **Configuration Validation:** If any part of Kermit's configuration (including the `LogWriter` choice) is loaded from an external source, validate this configuration *before* initializing Kermit. This prevents malicious or unexpected settings.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Misconfiguration of Kermit (Severity: Low to Medium):** Prevents vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior due to incorrect Kermit settings.
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure (Severity: High):**  The custom `LogWriter` provides a crucial layer of sanitization.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** The custom `LogWriter` can implement rate limiting.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Misconfiguration:** Reduces the risk of misconfiguration.
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure:**  Significantly reduces risk through sanitization.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Reduces risk through rate limiting.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "The application explicitly configures a custom `LogWriter` (`SanitizingLogWriter.kt`) during initialization."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "Configuration validation is not currently implemented. The custom `LogWriter` does not yet implement rate limiting."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting within a Custom `LogWriter`](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_within_a_custom__logwriter_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Implement Rate Limiting:** Within your custom `LogWriter`, implement a rate-limiting mechanism. This could use a token bucket algorithm, a sliding window, or another suitable approach.
2.  **Configurable Thresholds:**  Define configurable thresholds for the rate limits (e.g., messages per second, per minute) for different log levels. Allow these thresholds to be adjusted without restarting the application (ideally).
3. **Integration with Kermit:** This strategy is entirely implemented *within* the custom `LogWriter` that you provide to Kermit. Kermit itself doesn't have built-in rate limiting.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Logging (Severity: Medium):** Prevents attackers or bugs from flooding the logging system.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service:** Significantly reduces the risk of DoS attacks targeting the logging system.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "Not yet implemented."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "Rate limiting needs to be implemented within the custom `LogWriter` (`SanitizingLogWriter.kt`)."
