## Attack Tree Path: [1. Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/1__denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **1.1. Excessive Log Generation [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker aims to overwhelm the system by causing it to generate an excessive amount of log data. This can lead to resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk I/O) and ultimately a denial of service.
    *   **1.1.1. Exploit Misconfigured Log Level**
        *   **1.1.1.1. Application sets excessively verbose log level (e.g., "Verbose" in production). [CRITICAL]**
            *   *Description:* The application is configured to log at a very detailed level (e.g., "Verbose" or "Debug") in a production environment. This results in a large volume of log data being generated even for normal operations.
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium
            *   *Impact:* Medium to High
            *   *Effort:* Very Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Novice
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy
        *   **1.1.1.2. Attacker triggers code paths that generate many log messages (e.g., repeated failed login attempts, error conditions). [CRITICAL]**
            *   *Description:* The attacker intentionally triggers actions within the application that are known to generate log messages.  This could be repeated failed login attempts, submitting invalid data, or exploiting error handling routines.
            *   *Likelihood:* High
            *   *Impact:* Medium to High
            *   *Effort:* Very Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Novice
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium

*   **1.2. Log Storage Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker aims to fill the available storage space allocated for logs, causing the application or system to become unstable or crash.
    *   **1.2.1. Fill Disk Space**
        *   **1.2.1.1. Combine with 1.1 (Excessive Log Generation) to rapidly fill available storage. [CRITICAL]**
            *   *Description:* This is a combination of the excessive log generation attack. By generating a large volume of logs, the attacker quickly consumes all available disk space.
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium
            *   *Impact:* High
            *   *Effort:* Low to Medium
            *   *Skill Level:* Novice to Intermediate
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Sensitive Information Leakage [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__sensitive_information_leakage__high-risk_.md)

*   **2.1. Log Injection [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker manipulates the content of log messages to inject their own data or disrupt log analysis.
    *   **2.1.1. Attacker controls part of the logged message.**
        *   **2.1.1.1. Application logs user-supplied data without sanitization. [CRITICAL]**
            *   *Description:* The application directly logs data provided by the user without properly sanitizing or escaping it. This allows the attacker to inject arbitrary content into the logs.
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium
            *   *Impact:* High to Very High
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Hard
            *   **2.1.1.1.1. Attacker injects sensitive data (e.g., other users' session tokens, internal IP addresses) into their input. [CRITICAL]**
                *   *Description:* The attacker leverages the lack of input sanitization to inject sensitive information belonging to other users or the system itself into the logs.
                *   *Likelihood:* Medium
                *   *Impact:* High to Very High
                *   *Effort:* Low
                *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
                *   *Detection Difficulty:* Hard
        *   **2.1.1.2. Application logs sensitive data directly (e.g., passwords, API keys, PII). This is a *major* application vulnerability, but Kermit facilitates the leak. [CRITICAL]**
            *   *Description:* The application is coded in a way that directly logs sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, or personally identifiable information (PII). This is a severe security violation.
            *   *Likelihood:* Low
            *   *Impact:* Very High
            *   *Effort:* Very Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Novice
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
