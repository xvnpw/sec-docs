# Attack Surface Analysis for touchlab/kermit

## Attack Surface: [Sensitive Data Exposure](./attack_surfaces/sensitive_data_exposure.md)

*   *Description:* Unintentional logging of sensitive information due to developer choices in *how* they use Kermit's logging functions.
    *   *Kermit Contribution:* Kermit provides the *mechanism* for logging; the developer's code determines *what* data is passed to Kermit, and thus, what is logged. Kermit's flexibility, if misused, directly enables this vulnerability.
    *   *Example:* A developer uses `kermit.i { "User data: $userData" }`, where `$userData` is a complex object containing sensitive fields like passwords or API keys.  The entire object, including the sensitive data, is logged.
    *   *Impact:*
        *   Compromise of user accounts.
        *   Data breaches and regulatory fines (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).
        *   Reputational damage.
        *   Financial loss.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **Critical**
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Strict Logging Policies:**  A "deny-by-default" policy for what *cannot* be logged. Explicitly prohibit logging of PII, credentials, etc.  This is a *policy* and *process* mitigation, enforced through training and code review.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Mandatory code reviews with a *specific focus* on all uses of Kermit's logging functions. Reviewers must be trained to identify potential sensitive data exposure.
        *   **Automated Scanning (SAST):** Integrate static analysis tools into the CI/CD pipeline. Configure custom rules to detect patterns indicative of sensitive data (e.g., variable names like `password`, `token`, regular expressions for credit card numbers).
        *   **Data Masking/Sanitization (Custom `LogWriter`):**  Implement a custom `LogWriter` that *intercepts* log messages *before* they are written. This `LogWriter` should automatically mask or redact sensitive data using regular expressions, string manipulation, or other techniques. This is a *critical* defense-in-depth measure, as it provides a safety net even if developers make mistakes.
        *   **Log Level Discipline:**  Use log levels appropriately. `Debug` and `Verbose` should *never* contain sensitive information and should be *disabled* in production.  This reduces the likelihood of accidental exposure.
        *   **Developer Training:**  Mandatory training for all developers on secure logging practices, emphasizing the risks of sensitive data exposure and the proper use of Kermit.

## Attack Surface: [Log Injection](./attack_surfaces/log_injection.md)

*   *Description:* Attackers inject malicious content into log messages by exploiting how developers use Kermit to log unsanitized user input.
    *   *Kermit Contribution:* Kermit accepts strings as input for log messages. If these strings contain unsanitized user-provided data, injection is possible. Kermit's API *allows* this, making it a direct contributor.
    *   *Example:* `kermit.w { "User input: ${userInput}" }` where `userInput` is directly from a web form without any validation or sanitization. An attacker could inject control characters, excessively long strings, or even HTML/JavaScript (if the log viewer is web-based).
    *   *Impact:*
        *   Log Forgery: Creation of fake log entries to mislead investigations.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS):  Injection of large strings or control characters to overwhelm the logging system or storage.
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):  If the log viewing tool doesn't properly escape log entries, injected HTML/JavaScript could be executed in the viewer's browser. This is a *major* risk if logs are viewed through a web interface.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **High** (can be Critical if XSS is exploitable and allows access to sensitive data or actions)
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** *Never* directly include raw user input in log messages passed to Kermit.  Validate and sanitize *all* user-provided data *before* logging. This is the *most important* mitigation.
        *   **Encoding:** Encode potentially dangerous characters (e.g., HTML entities) before passing them to Kermit's logging functions. The specific encoding depends on the log storage and viewing mechanism.
        *   **Custom `LogWriter` for Sanitization:** Implement a custom `LogWriter` that automatically sanitizes log messages *before* they are written. This provides a centralized and consistent sanitization layer, acting as a second line of defense.
        *   **Secure Log Viewers:** Ensure that any tools used to view logs properly handle and escape potentially malicious content to prevent XSS. This is *not* directly related to Kermit, but it's crucial for mitigating the impact of log injection.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Kermit or LogWriters](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_kermit_or_logwriters.md)

* *Description:* Security vulnerabilities within the Kermit library itself or in custom/third-party `LogWriter` implementations.
    * *Kermit Contribution:* Direct dependency on Kermit; any vulnerabilities in Kermit or chosen `LogWriters` become part of the application's attack surface.
    * *Example:* A hypothetical vulnerability in Kermit's string formatting logic could allow for code injection if exploited. Or, a custom `LogWriter` that sends logs to a remote server might have an authentication bypass vulnerability.
    * *Impact:* Varies widely depending on the specific vulnerability; could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
    * *Risk Severity:* **High** to **Critical** (depending on the vulnerability)
    * *Mitigation Strategies:*
        * **Keep Kermit Updated:** Regularly update Kermit to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        * **Dependency Scanning:** Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., Dependabot, Snyk) to automatically detect and alert on known vulnerabilities in Kermit and its dependencies, including any third-party `LogWriters`.
        * **Code Review (Custom `LogWriters`):** Thoroughly review the code of any custom `LogWriter` implementations for security vulnerabilities. Apply the same security principles as you would to the main application code.
        * **Vulnerability Disclosure Programs:** If you develop a custom `LogWriter` for public use, consider establishing a vulnerability disclosure program to encourage responsible reporting of security issues.
