# Attack Surface Analysis for touchlab/kermit

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure through Excessive Logging](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_through_excessive_logging.md)

* **Description:** Sensitive information is unintentionally logged and becomes accessible to unauthorized parties.
    * **How Kermit Contributes:** Kermit is the mechanism through which log messages are generated and potentially written to various outputs. If configured to log at overly verbose levels (e.g., `DEBUG` or `TRACE` in production) or if developers log sensitive data directly using Kermit, it facilitates this disclosure.
    * **Example:** An application uses `Kermit.d { "User details: ${user.toString()}" }` in a production environment, inadvertently logging sensitive user attributes.
    * **Impact:** Compromise of sensitive data, privacy violations, potential for identity theft or account takeover.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Implement proper log levels in Kermit:** Configure Kermit to use appropriate log levels for different environments (e.g., `INFO` or `WARN` in production).
        * **Avoid logging sensitive data directly with Kermit:** Refrain from passing raw user input, API keys, passwords, or other confidential information directly to Kermit's logging functions.
        * **Sanitize or redact sensitive data before logging with Kermit:** If logging sensitive data is absolutely necessary for debugging, implement mechanisms to sanitize or redact it *before* passing it to Kermit's logging functions.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure through Insecure Log Storage and Handling (Content Generated by Kermit)](./attack_surfaces/exposure_through_insecure_log_storage_and_handling__content_generated_by_kermit_.md)

* **Description:** Logs containing sensitive information (generated by Kermit) are stored or transmitted insecurely, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access.
    * **How Kermit Contributes:** Kermit is responsible for generating the log messages. If these messages, facilitated by Kermit, contain sensitive information and are then stored or transmitted insecurely, Kermit plays a role in the exposure of that information.
    * **Example:** Kermit is configured to write logs containing user PII to a file on the server with overly permissive access controls.
    * **Impact:** Compromise of sensitive data, privacy violations, potential for further attacks based on leaked information.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure log storage locations:** Implement appropriate access controls on directories and files where Kermit writes logs.
        * **Encrypt logs at rest:** Encrypt log files generated by Kermit when stored on disk.
        * **Encrypt logs in transit:** If Kermit is configured to send logs over a network, ensure secure protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL) are used.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Kermit](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_kermit.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in the Kermit library itself, which could be exploited by attackers.
    * **How Kermit Contributes:** The application's direct dependency on Kermit introduces the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities within the Kermit library's codebase.
    * **Example:** A known security vulnerability is discovered in a specific version of Kermit that allows for remote code execution if a specially crafted log message is processed.
    * **Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service within the application.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep Kermit updated:** Regularly update Kermit to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * **Monitor for security advisories related to Kermit:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases that might report issues with Kermit.
