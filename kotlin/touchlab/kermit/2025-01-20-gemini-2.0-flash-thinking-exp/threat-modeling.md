# Threat Model Analysis for touchlab/kermit

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_logs.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to log files or log streams containing sensitive information that was inadvertently logged by the application.
    *   **How:** While the primary cause is developer error, Kermit's core logging mechanism is the conduit for this exposure. If Kermit is configured to output logs to insecure locations or if its output is not properly secured, the risk is amplified.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Description:** Exposure of sensitive data can lead to identity theft, financial loss, reputational damage, legal repercussions (e.g., GDPR violations), and compromise of other systems or accounts if credentials are leaked.
    *   **Affected Kermit Component:**
        *   **Description:** Primarily affects the core logging mechanism within Kermit, specifically the `Logger` class and its `log` functions (e.g., `v`, `d`, `i`, `w`, `e`, `a`). Kermit's configuration options for log sinks also play a role in where this data might be exposed.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the exposed data).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict logging policies and guidelines for developers, emphasizing the prohibition of logging sensitive data.
        *   Regularly review log output and code to identify and remove instances of sensitive data being logged.
        *   Utilize log masking or redaction techniques *before* passing data to Kermit's logging functions.
        *   Configure Kermit to output logs to secure locations and ensure proper access controls are in place for those locations.
        *   Encrypt logs at rest and in transit if they contain sensitive information, regardless of Kermit's configuration.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Log Sinks](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_log_sinks.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities within a custom log sink implementation used with Kermit.
    *   **How:** If a custom log sink, integrated with Kermit, is poorly implemented, it might contain vulnerabilities such as:
        *   **Remote Code Execution:** If the sink processes log data in an unsafe manner.
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** If the sink sends log data to an insecure location.
        *   **Denial of Service:** If the sink can be crashed or overloaded.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Description:** The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom log sink, potentially leading to system compromise, data breaches, or service disruption.
    *   **Affected Kermit Component:**
        *   **Description:** Directly affects the custom log sink implementation, which is integrated with Kermit through its extensibility mechanisms (e.g., implementing the `LogWriter` interface).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review and vet any custom log sinks before integrating them into the application.
        *   Ensure proper input validation and sanitization within custom log sinks.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom log sinks.
        *   Keep dependencies of custom log sinks updated.

## Threat: [Kermit Library Vulnerabilities](./threats/kermit_library_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability within the Kermit library itself.
    *   **How:** This could involve triggering specific logging scenarios or providing crafted input that exploits a flaw in Kermit's code.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Description:** The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability in Kermit. It could potentially lead to:
            *   **Denial of Service:** Crashing the application or logging functionality.
            *   **Information Disclosure:** Leaking internal data or log information managed by Kermit.
            *   **Remote Code Execution:** In severe cases, if a vulnerability allows for it.
    *   **Affected Kermit Component:**
        *   **Description:** Any part of the Kermit library could be affected, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (refer to security advisories), can be Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Kermit updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories related to Kermit and its dependencies.
