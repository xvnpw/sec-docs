# Threat Model Analysis for touchlab/kermit

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_logs.md)

**Description:** Kermit, by default, logs information provided to it. If developers inadvertently log sensitive data (e.g., API keys, passwords, personally identifiable information, session tokens) using Kermit's logging functions, this information could be exposed if the configured Sinks (e.g., File Logger) store these logs insecurely.

**Impact:** Identity theft, financial loss, privacy breaches, reputational damage, unauthorized access to systems or data.

**Affected Kermit Component:** Kermit Log function; potentially related to configured Sinks (e.g., File Logger, Console Logger, custom Sinks).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Utilize Kermit's features or custom logic within Kermit Sinks to redact or filter sensitive information before logging.
- Implement custom Kermit Sinks that enforce secure storage and handling of log data.

## Threat: [Insecure Transmission of Logs to Remote Systems](./threats/insecure_transmission_of_logs_to_remote_systems.md)

**Description:** If Kermit is configured to use a Sink that transmits logs to remote systems (e.g., a custom Sink integrating with a logging aggregator) and this transmission is done over insecure channels (like plain HTTP) within the Sink's implementation, the log data, including potentially sensitive information, could be intercepted during transit.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, compromise of sensitive data in transit, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks on log data.

**Affected Kermit Component:** Kermit Sinks configured for remote logging (custom Sinks or integrations with external services).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Ensure that any custom Kermit Sinks for remote logging utilize secure protocols like HTTPS or TLS for transmission within their implementation.
- Verify the security configurations of any external logging services used by custom Kermit Sinks.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Vulnerabilities in Kermit or its Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_vulnerabilities_in_kermit_or_its_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Kermit itself or its direct dependencies might contain security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

**Impact:** Potential for various attacks depending on the nature of the vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Affected Kermit Component:** The Kermit library itself and its dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical or High).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Regularly update Kermit to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
- Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Kermit and its dependencies.
