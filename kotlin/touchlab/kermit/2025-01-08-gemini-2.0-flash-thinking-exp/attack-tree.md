## Attack Tree Path: [Log Injection (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/log_injection__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious content into the application's log files. This is possible when user-provided or external data is logged without proper sanitization.

**Leverage Unsanitized Input Passed to Logger (Critical Node):**
* **Attack Vector:** The application directly logs input received from users or external systems without validating or sanitizing it. This allows an attacker to embed malicious commands or data within the log messages.
    * **Exploit Lack of Input Validation in Application Code:**
        * **Attack Vector:** The application code fails to implement proper checks and sanitization on data before passing it to the Kermit logging functions.

**Achieve Malicious Outcome via Log Injection:**

* **Log Poisoning for Later Exploitation (High-Risk Path):**
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker injects misleading or false information into the logs. This can be used to cover up malicious activities, blame other users, or mislead security monitoring tools and administrators during incident response.
    * **Manipulate Logs to Mislead Administrators or Security Tools:**
        * **Attack Vector:** By carefully crafting log entries, attackers can make it appear as if legitimate activity is occurring or divert attention away from their actual malicious actions.

* **Information Leakage via Logs (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker manipulates input to force the application to log sensitive information that would not normally be logged. This could involve injecting specific strings or characters that trigger the logging of internal variables or data structures.
    * **Force Logging of Sensitive Data (e.g., through manipulated input):**
        * **Attack Vector:** By providing specific input, an attacker can trick the application into revealing sensitive data within the log messages.

* **Denial of Service via Log Flooding (High-Risk Path):**
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker exploits the logging mechanism to generate an extremely large number of log entries. This can overwhelm the logging system, fill up disk space, and potentially cause the application or the underlying system to crash or become unresponsive.
    * **Generate Excessive Log Entries to Exhaust Resources:**
        * **Attack Vector:** By triggering specific application functionalities or sending repeated requests, an attacker can force the application to generate a massive volume of log data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure via Logs (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure_via_logs__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Sensitive information is exposed within the application's log files, either intentionally or unintentionally.

**Expose Sensitive Data in Log Messages (Critical Node):**

* **Application Logs Sensitive Data Unintentionally (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
    * **Attack Vector:** Developers inadvertently log sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, session tokens, or personal information within log messages. This often happens due to a lack of awareness of secure logging practices.
    * **Lack of Awareness or Proper Configuration in Application Code:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Developers are not adequately trained on what data should not be logged, or the application is not configured to prevent the logging of sensitive information.

* **Debug Logs Left Enabled in Production (High-Risk Path):**
    * **Attack Vector:** Debug-level logging, which is intended for development and troubleshooting, is left enabled in a production environment. Debug logs often contain verbose information about the application's internal state, including sensitive data.

**Access Logs Containing Sensitive Information:**

* **Unauthorized Access to Log Files (High-Risk Path):**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the physical log files stored on the server. This could be due to weak file system permissions, vulnerabilities in the operating system, or compromised server credentials.
    * **Exploit OS-Level Permissions or Vulnerabilities:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage weaknesses in the operating system's security mechanisms or misconfigured file permissions to access the log files directly.
