# Attack Surface Analysis for touchlab/kermit

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Logs](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_logs.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information is inadvertently logged by the application using Kermit, making it accessible to anyone who can read the logs.

**How Kermit Contributes:** Kermit is the tool used to record these potentially sensitive details. If developers use Kermit to log data without considering its sensitivity, it increases the attack surface.

**Example:** A developer logs an API key during debugging using `Kermit.e("API Key: $apiKey")`. If these logs are stored insecurely, the API key is exposed.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data like API keys, passwords, personal information, or internal system details, leading to potential data breaches or unauthorized access.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid logging sensitive information altogether.
* If logging sensitive information is absolutely necessary for debugging, redact or mask the sensitive parts before logging using Kermit.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfiguration of Log Sinks](./attack_surfaces/misconfiguration_of_log_sinks.md)

**Description:** Kermit allows configuring different "log sinks" (destinations for log messages). Misconfigurations can expose logs or create vulnerabilities.

**How Kermit Contributes:** Kermit provides the flexibility to configure various log outputs. If these configurations are not done securely, it increases the attack surface.

**Example:** Configuring Kermit to send logs over an unencrypted network connection, exposing log data in transit.

**Impact:** Information disclosure if logs are sent insecurely, potential access to sensitive data on misconfigured log servers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully review and secure the configuration of all Kermit log sinks.
* Use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS, TLS) for network-based log sinks.
* Implement authentication and authorization for accessing remote log sinks.
* Avoid logging to publicly accessible locations without proper security measures.
