## Deep Analysis of Korge Attack Tree Path: Critical Nodes (Resource Loading Vulnerabilities)

This document provides a deep analysis of the identified attack tree path focusing on "Critical Nodes (Resource Loading Vulnerabilities)" within a Korge application. We will examine each vulnerability, its potential impact, likelihood, and offer mitigation strategies for the development team.

**Overall Context:**

Korge, being a multiplatform game engine, deals with loading various resources like images, audio, fonts, and potentially native libraries. Improper handling of these loading mechanisms can introduce significant security vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to compromise the application and potentially the user's system.

**Detailed Analysis of Each Vulnerability:**

**1. Vulnerability: Insecure handling of relative or absolute paths in resource loading:**

* **Detailed Explanation:** This vulnerability arises when the Korge application allows users or external data sources to influence the paths used for loading resources. Instead of strictly controlling the resource locations, the application might directly use user-provided strings as file paths or incorporate them without proper validation. This allows attackers to inject malicious path components like `../` (path traversal) or absolute paths pointing to sensitive system files.

    * **Mechanism of Exploitation:** An attacker could provide a malicious path as input, for example:
        * **Path Traversal:**  `../../../../etc/passwd` (on Linux) or `../../../../Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts` (on Windows). If the application attempts to load this as a resource, it could inadvertently read sensitive system files.
        * **Arbitrary File Execution:**  If the application attempts to load executable files as resources (e.g., a custom font loader), an attacker could provide a path to a malicious executable, leading to code execution.
        * **Denial of Service:**  By providing paths to extremely large or non-existent files, an attacker could cause the application to hang or crash due to excessive resource consumption or errors.

    * **Impact/Consequences:**
        * **Information Disclosure:** Reading sensitive system files or application configuration files.
        * **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Loading and executing malicious executables or scripts.
        * **Denial of Service:** Crashing the application or making it unresponsive.
        * **Data Corruption:**  If the application attempts to write to a file based on a manipulated path, it could overwrite critical system or application files.

    * **Likelihood:** This vulnerability is moderately to highly likely, especially if developers are not explicitly sanitizing or validating user-provided input used in resource loading functions. The ease of implementing such flawed logic makes it a common oversight.

    * **Detection:**
        * **Code Review:** Manually inspecting the code for instances where user input or external data influences file paths used in resource loading functions (e.g., `resourcesVfs["path"]`).
        * **Static Analysis:** Using tools that can identify potential path traversal vulnerabilities based on code patterns.
        * **Dynamic Testing:**  Providing various malicious path inputs to resource loading functionalities and observing the application's behavior. Tools like fuzzers can automate this process.

    * **Mitigation/Prevention:**
        * **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize any user-provided input that influences resource paths. Implement whitelisting of allowed characters and patterns.
        * **Use Relative Paths from a Known Root:**  Store resources within a well-defined directory structure and only allow access using relative paths from this root. Avoid directly using user-provided paths.
        * **Resource Identifiers:**  Instead of directly using file paths, use resource identifiers or keys that map to specific resources within the application's internal structure.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary permissions to access resources. This limits the impact if a path traversal vulnerability is exploited.
        * **Secure File System Operations:** Utilize Korge's built-in resource loading mechanisms, which might offer some level of abstraction and security compared to direct file system operations.

**2. Vulnerability: Using insecure deserialization methods without proper sanitization:**

* **Detailed Explanation:**  Deserialization is the process of converting data from a serialized format (e.g., JSON, XML, or binary formats like Java's serialization) back into an object. Insecure deserialization occurs when the application deserializes data from untrusted sources without verifying its integrity or structure. Attackers can craft malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized, can execute arbitrary code or perform other malicious actions.

    * **Mechanism of Exploitation:**
        * **Object Instantiation and Method Invocation:** Malicious serialized objects can be crafted to instantiate arbitrary classes and trigger the execution of dangerous methods within those classes during the deserialization process.
        * **Gadget Chains:** Attackers often leverage "gadget chains," which are sequences of existing classes within the application's dependencies that can be chained together to achieve arbitrary code execution.
        * **Data Manipulation:**  Malicious objects can be designed to manipulate application state or data in unintended ways upon deserialization.

    * **Impact/Consequences:**
        * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The most severe consequence, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
        * **Denial of Service:**  Crafting objects that consume excessive resources during deserialization.
        * **Data Corruption:**  Manipulating application data or state.
        * **Privilege Escalation:**  Potentially gaining higher privileges within the application or the system.

    * **Likelihood:** This vulnerability is highly likely if the application uses insecure deserialization methods (like Java's built-in serialization) on data received from untrusted sources (e.g., network requests, user-provided files).

    * **Detection:**
        * **Code Review:** Identifying instances where deserialization is performed on untrusted data. Look for usage of libraries like `ObjectInputStream` in Java or similar mechanisms in other languages if Korge utilizes them.
        * **Static Analysis:**  Tools can identify potential insecure deserialization patterns.
        * **Dynamic Testing:**  Attempting to deserialize crafted malicious objects and observing the application's behavior. Security testing frameworks often include payloads for testing deserialization vulnerabilities.

    * **Mitigation/Prevention:**
        * **Avoid Insecure Deserialization:**  If possible, avoid using built-in serialization mechanisms like Java's `ObjectInputStream` for untrusted data.
        * **Use Safe Serialization Formats:** Prefer data formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers, which are generally less prone to deserialization vulnerabilities.
        * **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Even with safer formats, validate the structure and content of deserialized data to ensure it conforms to expected schemas.
        * **Whitelisting:** If using deserialization is unavoidable, implement strict whitelisting of allowed classes that can be deserialized.
        * **Integrity Checks:**  Use cryptographic signatures or message authentication codes (MACs) to verify the integrity and authenticity of serialized data before deserialization.
        * **Sandboxing:**  If feasible, deserialize data within a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.
        * **Keep Dependencies Updated:**  Ensure that all libraries used for serialization and deserialization are up-to-date with the latest security patches.

**3. Vulnerability: Lack of integrity checks or secure loading mechanisms for native libraries:**

* **Detailed Explanation:**  Korge, as a multiplatform engine, might allow loading native libraries (e.g., `.dll` on Windows, `.so` on Linux, `.dylib` on macOS) for performance or to access platform-specific features. If the application loads these libraries without verifying their integrity or using secure loading mechanisms, attackers can replace legitimate libraries with malicious ones.

    * **Mechanism of Exploitation:**
        * **DLL Hijacking/Preloading:**  Attackers can place a malicious library with the same name as a legitimate one in a location where the operating system searches for libraries before the intended location.
        * **Path Manipulation:**  Similar to resource loading, if the path to the native library is not properly controlled, attackers can point the application to a malicious library.
        * **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:**  If libraries are downloaded over an insecure connection, attackers can intercept and replace them with malicious versions.

    * **Impact/Consequences:**
        * **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Malicious native libraries can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application.
        * **System Compromise:**  Depending on the application's privileges, a compromised native library could potentially lead to full system compromise.
        * **Data Theft:**  The malicious library could intercept and steal sensitive data.

    * **Likelihood:** This vulnerability is moderately likely, especially if the application relies on loading external native libraries without implementing proper security measures.

    * **Detection:**
        * **Code Review:**  Examine the code for how native libraries are loaded. Look for functions like `System.loadLibrary()` or platform-specific library loading mechanisms.
        * **Static Analysis:**  Tools might be able to identify potential insecure library loading patterns.
        * **File System Monitoring:**  Monitor the application's attempts to load native libraries during runtime.
        * **Security Audits:**  Perform security audits of the native libraries themselves to identify potential vulnerabilities.

    * **Mitigation/Prevention:**
        * **Integrity Checks (Checksums/Hashes):**  Calculate and verify the checksum or cryptographic hash of native libraries before loading them. Store the expected hashes securely.
        * **Secure Loading Paths:**  Load native libraries from trusted and well-defined locations with restricted write permissions. Avoid loading from user-controlled directories.
        * **Code Signing:**  Utilize code signing mechanisms provided by the operating system to verify the authenticity and integrity of native libraries.
        * **Secure Downloading:** If native libraries are downloaded, use secure protocols like HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Verify the digital signature of downloaded libraries.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges to load and execute native libraries.
        * **Dependency Management:**  Use a robust dependency management system to track and manage the versions of native libraries and ensure they are from trusted sources.
