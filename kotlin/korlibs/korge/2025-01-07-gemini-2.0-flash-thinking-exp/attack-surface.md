# Attack Surface Analysis for korlibs/korge

## Attack Surface: [Asset Loading and Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/asset_loading_and_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in image, audio, font, or data file parsing libraries *within Korge or its directly used dependencies* to cause crashes, memory corruption, or potentially remote code execution.

**How Korge Contributes:** Korge's core functionality involves loading and decoding various asset formats. Vulnerabilities within Korge's own asset loading code or in the specific libraries it directly integrates for this purpose create a direct attack surface.

**Example:** A crafted PNG image loaded as a sprite using Korge's image loading functions triggers a buffer overflow in Korge's internal image handling or a directly used image decoding library, leading to a crash or allowing arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** Critical

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Developers:**
    * Keep Korge updated to the latest versions, ensuring security patches for its asset loading components are applied.
    * If Korge allows for custom asset loaders or extensions, implement strict security reviews and validation for these.
    * Consider sandboxing or isolating the asset loading process to limit the impact of potential exploits.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Shader Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/malicious_shader_exploitation.md)

**Description:** Crafted shaders, if Korge provides functionality to load and execute them, can exploit vulnerabilities in Korge's shader handling or underlying graphics drivers, leading to denial-of-service or system instability.

**How Korge Contributes:** If Korge offers features to load and utilize custom shaders (GLSL or similar), it directly introduces the risk of malicious shader code being executed within the rendering pipeline.

**Example:** A malicious GLSL shader loaded through Korge's shader loading API causes the graphics driver to crash, leading to a denial-of-service or system freeze.

**Impact:** High

**Risk Severity:** Medium to High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Developers:**
    * Avoid allowing arbitrary user-provided shaders if the risk is too high.
    * If custom shaders are necessary, implement strict validation and potentially sanitization of shader code before compilation and execution within Korge.
    * Consider resource limits or sandboxing for shader execution within Korge's rendering context.

## Attack Surface: [Networking Vulnerabilities (within Korge's direct implementation)](./attack_surfaces/networking_vulnerabilities__within_korge's_direct_implementation_.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in networking features that are directly implemented within Korge's codebase (beyond basic asset downloading). This could lead to data breaches, man-in-the-middle attacks, or remote code execution within the game client.

**How Korge Contributes:** If Korge provides built-in networking capabilities for multiplayer functionality or complex data exchange, vulnerabilities in Korge's own networking code create a direct attack surface.

**Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in Korge's network message parsing allows an attacker to send a specially crafted message that overwrites memory and potentially executes arbitrary code on a remote player's machine.

**Impact:** High to Critical

**Risk Severity:** Medium to High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Developers:**
    * If using Korge's built-in networking features, ensure thorough testing and security audits of the networking code.
    * Apply security best practices for network programming, such as input validation and avoiding buffer overflows.
    * Keep Korge updated to benefit from any security patches in its networking components.

## Attack Surface: [Korge's Internal Logic Bugs Leading to Security Issues](./attack_surfaces/korge's_internal_logic_bugs_leading_to_security_issues.md)

**Description:** Bugs or vulnerabilities within Korge's core code that can be triggered by specific game logic or interactions, leading to memory corruption or other exploitable conditions.

**How Korge Contributes:** These are inherent vulnerabilities within the Korge engine itself that can be exposed through specific usage patterns.

**Example:** A specific sequence of API calls within Korge related to resource management leads to a double-free vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker.

**Impact:** Medium to High

**Risk Severity:** Medium

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Developers:**
    * Stay updated with new Korge releases that may contain bug fixes addressing potential security issues.
    * Report any suspected bugs or vulnerabilities in Korge's core logic to the Korge development team.
    * Implement defensive programming practices in the game logic to mitigate potential issues arising from unexpected Korge behavior.
