## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Malicious Image/Texture Loading](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_malicious_imagetexture_loading.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious image file (e.g., PNG, JPG) containing data designed to exploit a vulnerability in the image decoding process.

**Sequence of Actions:**

*   The attacker crafts the malicious image.
*   The application using Korge loads this image via the Korge API.
*   A vulnerability in Korge's image decoding logic is triggered.

**Critical Nodes (Vulnerabilities):**

*   **Buffer overflow in image decoding:**  The image data causes a buffer to overflow during the decoding process, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and allowing the attacker to inject and execute code.
*   **Integer overflow leading to memory corruption:**  Large values in the image header or data cause an integer overflow, leading to incorrect memory allocation or calculations, ultimately resulting in memory corruption that can be exploited.
*   **Exploiting specific image format parsing bugs:**  The attacker leverages specific flaws or inconsistencies in how Korge parses the image format (e.g., malformed chunks in PNG) to trigger unexpected behavior or memory corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Buffer Overflows in Rendering](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_buffer_overflows_in_rendering.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker provides excessive or malformed graphics data that, when processed by Korge's rendering pipeline, leads to a buffer overflow.

**Sequence of Actions:**

*   The attacker triggers a rendering operation with crafted or oversized graphics data.
*   Korge fails to properly handle the data size or format during rendering.

**Critical Nodes (Vulnerabilities):**

*   **Missing bounds checks in rendering loops:**  Korge's rendering code lacks proper checks to ensure that data being written to buffers stays within the allocated boundaries, allowing an attacker to overflow these buffers with malicious data.
*   **Incorrect memory allocation for rendering buffers:**  Korge allocates insufficient memory for rendering buffers based on attacker-controlled data, leading to overflows when the actual data exceeds the allocated size.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Input Injection Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_input_injection_attacks.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker sends malicious input events (e.g., keyboard, mouse) that are not properly sanitized by the application using Korge, leading to unexpected behavior or code execution.

**Sequence of Actions:**

*   The attacker sends crafted input events.
*   Korge processes these input events without adequate validation or sanitization.

**Critical Nodes (Vulnerabilities):**

*   **Lack of input validation leading to unexpected behavior:**  Korge does not properly validate user input, allowing attackers to send input that triggers unintended code paths, logic errors, or even direct code execution if input is used in unsafe ways.
*   **Exploiting event handling logic flaws:** The attacker leverages vulnerabilities in how Korge handles and dispatches input events, potentially causing out-of-bounds access, state corruption, or other exploitable conditions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes (Resource Loading Vulnerabilities)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes__resource_loading_vulnerabilities_.md)

*   **Vulnerability: Insecure handling of relative or absolute paths in resource loading:**  Korge improperly handles user-provided paths when loading resources, allowing attackers to use path traversal techniques (e.g., "../../evil.exe") to access and load arbitrary files from the system.
*   **Vulnerability: Using insecure deserialization methods without proper sanitization:** If Korge deserializes data from untrusted sources, attackers can craft malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code.
*   **Vulnerability: Lack of integrity checks or secure loading mechanisms for native libraries:** If Korge allows loading external native libraries, the absence of integrity checks (like checksums) or secure loading mechanisms allows attackers to load malicious native code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes (Platform-Specific Vulnerabilities)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes__platform-specific_vulnerabilities_.md)

*   **Vulnerability: Korge using outdated or vulnerable JVM libraries:** If the application runs on the JVM, using outdated or vulnerable JVM libraries can expose the application to known JVM exploits.
*   **Vulnerability: Korge relying on insecure browser features or outdated APIs:** If the application runs in a browser, relying on insecure or outdated browser features (like specific WebGL extensions) can make it vulnerable to browser-based exploits.
*   **Vulnerability: Korge using platform-specific libraries with known vulnerabilities:** When running natively, Korge might use platform-specific libraries (e.g., for graphics or audio). If these libraries have known vulnerabilities, the application becomes susceptible to them.
