# Threat Model Analysis for korlibs/korge

## Threat: [Malicious Asset Loading leading to Arbitrary Code Execution](./threats/malicious_asset_loading_leading_to_arbitrary_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a crafted malicious asset (e.g., image, audio file) that exploits a vulnerability *within Korge's* asset parsing logic. When the application attempts to load this asset *using Korge's functions*, the vulnerability is triggered, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Full compromise of the user's system. The attacker can gain complete control over the application and the underlying operating system.
    *   **Affected Component:** `korim` module (specifically image, audio, and font loading functions provided by Korge), potentially `korge-core` if the vulnerability is in Korge's core asset management. Example functions: `korim.format.PNG.decode()`, `korau.sound.readSound()`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all external assets before loading, especially when using Korge's loading mechanisms.
        *   Keep Korge and its dependencies updated to benefit from security patches in asset loading libraries used by Korge.
        *   Implement integrity checks for downloaded assets loaded through Korge.
        *   Consider sandboxing the asset loading process performed by Korge.

## Threat: [Malicious Asset Loading leading to Denial of Service](./threats/malicious_asset_loading_leading_to_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a crafted asset that, when loaded *by Korge*, consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory) or triggers an infinite loop *within Korge's asset handling*, leading to the application becoming unresponsive or crashing.
    *   **Impact:** High. The application becomes unusable, disrupting the user experience. In some cases, it might lead to system instability.
    *   **Affected Component:** `korim` module (specifically image, audio, and font loading functions provided by Korge), potentially `korge-core` if the vulnerability is in Korge's core asset management. Example functions: `korim.format.GIF.decode()`, `korau.sound.decode()`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement resource limits and timeouts during asset loading performed by Korge.
        *   Perform thorough testing with various asset types and sizes, including potentially malformed ones, when using Korge's asset loading.
        *   Implement error handling to gracefully manage loading failures within Korge's asset pipeline.

## Threat: [Exploiting Native Code Vulnerabilities via Korge Interop](./threats/exploiting_native_code_vulnerabilities_via_korge_interop.md)

*   **Description:** Korge's interoperation with platform-specific native code introduces a risk. An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in these underlying native libraries *through the Korge interop layer*. This could involve crafting specific calls or providing malicious data that triggers vulnerabilities in the native code *accessed via Korge*.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Potential for arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the application. This could lead to system compromise depending on the nature of the native vulnerability and how Korge interacts with it.
    *   **Affected Component:** Platform-specific implementations within Korge (e.g., `korge-android`, `korge-ios`, `korge-jvm`) where Korge interacts with native APIs, the Kotlin/Native interop layer used by Korge. Specific functions depend on the nature of the native interaction within Korge.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay informed about security advisories for the native libraries used by Korge on different platforms.
        *   Keep Korge and its dependencies updated to incorporate fixes for native vulnerabilities in components Korge utilizes.
        *   Carefully review and potentially sandbox any custom native code integrations *used in conjunction with Korge*.
        *   Minimize the amount of direct native code interaction *within Korge's codebase* if possible.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Korge's Networking Components](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_korge's_networking_components.md)

*   **Description:** If the Korge application utilizes *Korge's built-in* networking capabilities, vulnerabilities within these components could be exploited. This could involve sending crafted network packets that trigger bugs *within Korge's networking code*, leading to denial of service, information disclosure, or potentially remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** High. Potential for application compromise, denial of service, or information leakage depending on the vulnerability in Korge's networking implementation.
    *   **Affected Component:** Potentially a future `korge-network` module or specific networking utilities within `korge-core` provided by Korge. Specific functions depend on the networking features exposed by Korge.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Korge updated to benefit from security patches in its networking components.
        *   If using Korge's networking, follow secure networking practices, such as validating data received through Korge's networking functions.
        *   Consider using well-established and vetted networking libraries instead of relying solely on potentially less mature Korge networking features.

## Threat: [Exploiting Third-Party Library Vulnerabilities within Korge](./threats/exploiting_third-party_library_vulnerabilities_within_korge.md)

*   **Description:** Korge depends on various third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could directly affect Korge applications. An attacker could leverage known vulnerabilities in these libraries *as they are used by Korge*.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability in the third-party library. Could range from high (application compromise) to critical (arbitrary code execution).
    *   **Affected Component:** Various Korge modules depending on which third-party library *integrated into Korge* is vulnerable. Requires analyzing Korge's dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (assess based on the specific vulnerable library)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Korge to benefit from updates to its dependencies.
        *   Be aware of the dependencies Korge uses and their potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Korge's dependencies.

## Threat: [Platform-Specific Vulnerabilities in Korge Implementations](./threats/platform-specific_vulnerabilities_in_korge_implementations.md)

*   **Description:** Korge is multiplatform, and vulnerabilities might exist in its implementation for specific target platforms (e.g., Android, iOS, Desktop). An attacker might exploit platform-specific bugs or security flaws *within Korge's platform adaptors*.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the platform and the vulnerability. Could range from application crashes to potential system-level exploits on specific platforms due to flaws in Korge's platform-specific code.
    *   **Affected Component:** Platform-specific modules within Korge (e.g., `korge-android`, `korge-ios`, `korge-jvm`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay informed about platform-specific security advisories relevant to Korge's target platforms.
        *   Test the Korge application thoroughly on all target platforms.
        *   Keep Korge updated to benefit from platform-specific bug fixes.
