**Components:**

* **Core:** Provides foundational services and utilities. This includes coroutine management for asynchronous operations, resource management (loading and caching assets), dependency injection, and a central event management system.
* **Graphics:** Responsible for all aspects of 2D rendering. It abstracts platform-specific graphics APIs, providing a unified interface for drawing sprites, textures, shapes, and text using shaders and defined rendering pipelines.
* **Input:** Manages user input from various sources. It normalizes input events from keyboards, mice, touchscreens, and gamepads, providing a consistent cross-platform API for accessing input data.
* **Audio:** Handles audio playback and manipulation. It supports various audio formats, sound effects, and background music, abstracting the underlying platform's audio capabilities.
* **UI:** Offers a set of pre-built UI components and layout management tools. This allows developers to create interactive in-game user interfaces without needing to implement common UI elements from scratch.
* **Tiled:** Integrates support for the popular Tiled map editor. It enables loading and rendering of tile-based game levels created with Tiled, simplifying level design.
* **Particles:** Provides a particle system for creating dynamic visual effects. Developers can configure particle emitters to generate effects like explosions, smoke, and fire.
* **Animation:** Manages various animation techniques. This includes sprite animation (frame-by-frame), tweening animations for smooth property transitions, and potentially skeletal animation through extensions or integrations.
* **Networking (Optional):** Offers optional networking capabilities for implementing multiplayer games or online features. This component might provide basic networking primitives or rely on platform-specific libraries and external integrations.
* **Platform Layers (JVM, Native, JavaScript):** These layers provide the concrete implementations for the abstract interfaces defined in the core components. They adapt the core functionalities to the specifics of each target platform, enabling Korge to run seamlessly across different environments.

## 6. Data Flow

The typical data flow within a Korge game can be visualized as follows:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "User Interaction"
        A["'Input Events (Keyboard, Mouse, Touch)'"]
    end
    subgraph "Korge Engine"
        B["'Input Component'"]
        C["'Game Logic'"]
        D["'Scene Graph'"]
        E["'Graphics Component'"]
        F["'Audio Component'"]
    end
    subgraph "Platform"
        G["'Rendering API (OpenGL, DirectX, WebGL)'"]
        H["'Audio API'"]
        I["'Display'"]
        J["'Speakers'"]
    end

    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> E
    D --> F
    E --> G
    F --> H
    G --> I
    H --> J
```

**Data Flow Description:**

1. **Input Events:** User interactions, such as keyboard presses, mouse movements, and touch events, are initially captured by the underlying operating system or browser.
2. **Input Component:** The Korge Input component receives these platform-specific raw input events.
3. **Game Logic:** The Input component normalizes these events and makes them available to the game's core logic. The game logic processes the input, updates the game state based on user actions, and determines necessary changes to the game world.
4. **Scene Graph:** Changes to the game world, such as object positions, animations, or visibility, are reflected in the Scene Graph. The Scene Graph represents the hierarchical structure of all visible and interactive elements in the game.
5. **Graphics Component:** The Graphics component traverses the Scene Graph to determine what needs to be rendered. It uses the appropriate platform-specific Rendering API to draw the game objects on the screen.
6. **Audio Component:** The game logic can trigger audio events (e.g., playing a sound effect). The Audio component uses the platform's Audio API to play the corresponding sounds through the speakers.
7. **Rendering API:** The platform's Rendering API (like OpenGL, DirectX, or WebGL) handles the low-level details of drawing graphics primitives to the display.
8. **Audio API:** The platform's Audio API manages the playback of audio data through the system's audio output devices.

## 7. Deployment Model

Korge's multiplatform nature allows for deployment to various target environments:

* **JVM:** Games can be packaged as standard JAR files. This allows them to run on any system with a compatible Java Virtual Machine installed, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
* **Native (Desktop):** Utilizing Kotlin/Native, games can be compiled into platform-specific native executables for desktop operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux. This can offer performance advantages and closer integration with the operating system.
* **JavaScript (Browser):** Using Kotlin/JS, games can be compiled into JavaScript code that runs directly within modern web browsers. This enables web-based distribution and accessibility without requiring users to install additional software.

The typical deployment process involves:

* **Compilation:** Compiling the Kotlin source code using the appropriate Kotlin compiler (JVM, Native, or JS) for the target platform.
* **Packaging:** Bundling the compiled code, game assets (images, audio, fonts), and any necessary dependencies into a distributable package. This might be a JAR file for JVM, an executable for Native, or a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the browser.
* **Distribution:**  Distributing the packaged game to end-users through various channels, such as direct downloads, application stores, or web servers.

## 8. Security Considerations (Preliminary)

This section outlines preliminary security considerations. A dedicated threat modeling exercise will provide a more in-depth analysis.

* **Resource Exhaustion:**
    * **Memory Leaks:**  Ensure proper memory management to prevent the game from consuming excessive memory over time.
    * **CPU Hogging:**  Avoid computationally intensive operations that could freeze or slow down the game.
    * **GPU Overload:**  Optimize rendering processes to prevent the game from overwhelming the GPU.
* **Input Handling Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Injection Attacks:**  Sanitize user input to prevent malicious code injection, especially if the game involves any form of user-generated content or network communication.

* **Third-Party Dependencies:**
    * **Vulnerable Libraries:** Regularly update and audit third-party libraries for known security vulnerabilities.
    * **Supply Chain Attacks:**  Be aware of the risks associated with dependencies and ensure they come from trusted sources.
* **Code Execution Risks:**
    * **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Prevent the execution of untrusted code within the game engine or the game itself.
    * **Scripting Vulnerabilities:** If a scripting language is used, ensure it is sandboxed and secure.
* **Data Security:**
    * **Save Data Tampering:**  Protect saved game data from unauthorized modification.
    * **Network Data Interception:** If the game uses networking, secure communication channels to prevent data interception or manipulation.
* **Platform-Specific Security:**
    * **Sandbox Escapes:** Be aware of potential vulnerabilities that could allow the game to escape the platform's security sandbox.
    * **Permissions:**  Request only the necessary permissions on each platform.
