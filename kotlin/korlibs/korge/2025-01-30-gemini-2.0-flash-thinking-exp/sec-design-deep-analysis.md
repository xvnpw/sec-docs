### 3. Architecture, Components, and Data Flow Inference

Based on the C4 diagrams and descriptions, we can infer the following about Korge's architecture and data flow:

*   **Modular Architecture:** Korge is designed with a modular architecture, separating functionalities into distinct containers (Core Engine, Rendering Engine, Input Handling, etc.). This modularity can improve security by isolating potential vulnerabilities within specific components.
*   **Library-Based Foundation:** Korge relies heavily on the korlibs libraries for low-level functionalities. This means the security of korlibs is paramount for Korge's overall security.
*   **Developer-Centric API:** Korge provides APIs for game developers to interact with engine components. The security of these APIs and how developers use them is crucial.
*   **Multiplatform Support:** Korge targets multiple platforms (desktop, web, mobile). This implies that security considerations must be addressed across different platform environments and their respective security models (e.g., browser sandboxing for web games, OS-level permissions for desktop/mobile).
*   **Build Process Dependency:** The build process relies on Gradle, Kotlin Compiler, and potentially other tools. Security of the build pipeline and dependency management is critical to prevent supply chain attacks.
*   **Deployment Flexibility:** Games built with Korge can be deployed in various ways (web, app stores, desktop stores). Deployment security depends on the chosen platform and distribution method.

**Data Flow (Inferred):**

1.  **Input Data:** Player input (keyboard, mouse, touch, gamepad) flows into the **Input Handling** container.
2.  **Input Processing:** The **Input Handling** container processes and validates input, then passes relevant input events to the **Core Engine**.
3.  **Game Logic Execution:** The **Core Engine** executes game logic, potentially using input events, game state, and resources.
4.  **Rendering Commands:** Based on game logic and scene data, the **Core Engine** sends rendering commands to the **Rendering Engine**.
5.  **Graphics Rendering:** The **Rendering Engine** processes rendering commands and interacts with the underlying graphics API to render the game visuals.
6.  **Audio Playback:** The **Core Engine** interacts with the **Audio Engine** to play sound effects and music.
7.  **UI Interaction:** The **UI System** handles UI rendering and user interaction with UI elements, potentially interacting with the **Input Handling** and **Core Engine**.
8.  **Resource Loading:** The **Core Engine** loads game assets (images, audio, data files) from storage, potentially using functionalities from **korlibs Libraries**.

This inferred data flow highlights critical points for security considerations, particularly around input processing, resource handling, and interactions between components.
