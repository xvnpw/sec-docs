# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Korge project is an open-source multiplatform Kotlin game engine. Its primary business goal is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly framework for developers to create 2D games that can run on various platforms, including desktop, web, and mobile.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Provide a robust and feature-rich game engine.
- Support multiple target platforms.
- Maintain an active and supportive community.
- Encourage adoption and usage of the engine.
- Ensure the long-term sustainability of the project (primarily through open-source community contributions and potentially sponsorships).

Business Risks:
- Lack of community adoption and contribution, leading to stagnation.
- Technical debt accumulation and difficulty in maintaining and evolving the engine.
- Security vulnerabilities in the engine or games built with it, damaging reputation and user trust.
- Competition from other game engines.
- Platform compatibility issues and the need for continuous adaptation to platform changes.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Open-source development model with community review (location: GitHub repository - implicit through public access and contribution model).
- security control: Dependency management using Gradle and Kotlin libraries (location: build.gradle.kts files - standard Kotlin/Gradle project setup).
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party Kotlin libraries used by Korge.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline for Korge engine code.
- security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities.
- security control: Conduct regular security audits of the Korge engine codebase.
- security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for game developers using Korge to build games.

Security Requirements:

Authentication:
- Not directly applicable to the core game engine itself. Authentication would be relevant for services built on top of Korge or within games developed using Korge (e.g., user accounts in a multiplayer game).

Authorization:
- Not directly applicable to the core game engine itself. Authorization would be relevant for services built on top of Korge or within games developed using Korge (e.g., access control to game features or administrative panels).

Input Validation:
- security requirement: Korge engine should handle various input types (keyboard, mouse, touch, gamepad) safely and prevent vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or injection attacks when processing input data within games.
- security requirement: Games built with Korge should implement robust input validation to protect against game-specific vulnerabilities (e.g., cheating through manipulated input).

Cryptography:
- security requirement: Korge engine should provide secure cryptographic functionalities for games that require encryption, hashing, or secure random number generation (e.g., for secure storage of game data or network communication in multiplayer games).
- security requirement: Ensure proper usage of cryptographic libraries and avoid common cryptographic pitfalls within the engine and provide guidance for developers.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Core engine development and maintenance: Ensuring the engine remains functional, secure, and feature-rich is critical for its adoption and usage.
- Community engagement and support: A healthy community is vital for the long-term success of an open-source project like Korge.
- Build and release process: Secure and reliable build and release processes are essential to deliver updates and prevent supply chain attacks.

Data Sensitivity:
- Korge engine source code: High sensitivity. Compromise could lead to vulnerabilities, intellectual property theft, and reputational damage.
- Build artifacts (compiled engine, libraries): Medium sensitivity. Compromise could lead to distribution of malware or vulnerable versions of the engine.
- Community data (forum posts, issue reports): Low sensitivity. Publicly available information, but data breaches could impact user trust.
- Game developer data (if any, e.g., in a hypothetical Korge game store or service): Medium to High sensitivity depending on the data type (e.g., account information, payment details).
