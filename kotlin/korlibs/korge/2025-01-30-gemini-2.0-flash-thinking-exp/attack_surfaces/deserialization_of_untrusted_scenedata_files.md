### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Deserialization of Untrusted Scene/Data Files

#### 4.1. Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Surface

The "Deserialization of Untrusted Scene/Data Files" attack surface arises when a Korge application processes data from external sources by converting it from a serialized format (like JSON, XML, binary) back into in-memory objects. This process, deserialization, can become a vulnerability if the application deserializes data from untrusted sources without proper security measures.

**Key Components of the Attack Surface in Korge Context:**

*   **Data Source:** The origin of the data file. This could be:
    *   **Remote Server:** Downloading level data, game configurations, or assets from a web server or CDN. This is a high-risk source if not properly secured (HTTPS, authentication).
    *   **Local File System:** Loading data from files bundled with the application or stored in user directories. While seemingly less risky, local files can still be manipulated by attackers if they gain access to the user's system.
    *   **User Input:**  Less common for scene files, but potentially relevant if the application allows users to upload or import custom content (e.g., custom levels, character designs). This is a very high-risk source.
*   **Deserialization Process:** The code responsible for converting the serialized data into objects. This typically involves:
    *   **Choosing a Deserialization Library:**  Developers select a library (e.g., kotlinx.serialization, Jackson, Gson) to handle the deserialization process. The security of the chosen library is crucial.
    *   **Configuration and Usage of the Library:**  Incorrect configuration or insecure usage patterns of the deserialization library can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Application-Specific Deserialization Logic:**  Custom code that handles deserialization or processes the deserialized data. Vulnerabilities can be introduced in this custom logic.
*   **Data Processing After Deserialization:**  What happens to the deserialized objects within the Korge application?
    *   **Scene Construction:**  Deserialized data might be used to create game scenes, instantiate objects, and set up game logic.
    *   **Configuration Loading:**  Deserialized data might configure game settings, UI elements, or other application parameters.
    *   **Data Storage:**  Deserialized data might be stored in memory or persisted to local storage.

**Why Deserialization is a Vulnerability:**

Deserialization vulnerabilities occur because the process of reconstructing objects from serialized data can be exploited to execute arbitrary code or manipulate application state. This happens when:

*   **The deserialization library itself has vulnerabilities:**  Bugs in the library might allow attackers to craft malicious serialized data that triggers unexpected behavior, including code execution.
*   **The application deserializes untrusted data without validation:**  If the application blindly deserializes data without verifying its integrity and structure, attackers can inject malicious payloads.
*   **The application logic after deserialization is vulnerable:**  Even if deserialization itself is secure, vulnerabilities can arise in the code that processes the deserialized objects if it makes unsafe assumptions about the data's content.

#### 4.2. Vulnerability Examples and Exploitation Scenarios in Korge

Let's consider specific examples of deserialization vulnerabilities and how they could be exploited in a Korge game:

**Example 1: JSON Deserialization with kotlinx.serialization (Hypothetical Vulnerability)**

Imagine a Korge game loads level data from a JSON file using `kotlinx.serialization`.  Let's assume (for illustrative purposes, and it's important to check for actual vulnerabilities) a hypothetical vulnerability in an older version of `kotlinx.serialization` allowed for polymorphic deserialization issues.

*   **Vulnerability:**  An attacker could craft a malicious JSON file that exploits a flaw in how `kotlinx.serialization` handles polymorphic types during deserialization. This could potentially lead to the instantiation of arbitrary classes or the execution of malicious code during the deserialization process.
*   **Exploitation Scenario:**
    1.  The attacker identifies that the Korge game loads level data from a JSON file hosted on a server.
    2.  The attacker analyzes the game's code (if possible through decompilation or reverse engineering) or makes educated guesses about the expected JSON structure and the deserialization library used.
    3.  The attacker crafts a malicious JSON file containing a payload designed to exploit the hypothetical `kotlinx.serialization` vulnerability. This payload might involve specifying a malicious class to be instantiated during deserialization.
    4.  The attacker replaces the legitimate level data file on the server (or performs a Man-in-the-Middle attack) with the malicious JSON file.
    5.  When the Korge game loads the level data, it downloads and deserializes the malicious JSON file.
    6.  The vulnerability in `kotlinx.serialization` is triggered, leading to the execution of code embedded in the malicious JSON file within the context of the Korge game. This could result in RCE, allowing the attacker to take control of the player's machine.

**Example 2: Insecure Custom Binary Format Deserialization**

Suppose a Korge game uses a custom binary format for level data to optimize loading speed. The deserialization logic is implemented manually without using a well-vetted library.

*   **Vulnerability:**  The custom deserialization code might be vulnerable to buffer overflows, integer overflows, or other memory corruption issues if it doesn't properly validate the input data. For example, if the code reads a length field from the binary data and uses it to allocate a buffer without checking for excessively large values, an attacker could cause a buffer overflow.
*   **Exploitation Scenario:**
    1.  The attacker discovers that the Korge game loads level data from a custom binary file.
    2.  The attacker reverse engineers the binary format and identifies a vulnerability in the custom deserialization logic, such as a buffer overflow when processing a length field.
    3.  The attacker crafts a malicious binary file with an oversized length field designed to trigger the buffer overflow.
    4.  The attacker replaces the legitimate level data file (or uses another attack vector to deliver the malicious file).
    5.  When the Korge game loads and deserializes the malicious binary file, the buffer overflow occurs.
    6.  The attacker can leverage the buffer overflow to overwrite memory and potentially gain control of the program's execution flow, leading to RCE.

**Example 3: XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (If using XML)**

If a Korge game uses XML for configuration files and uses a vulnerable XML parser, it could be susceptible to XXE injection.

*   **Vulnerability:**  XXE injection occurs when an XML parser is configured to process external entities and the application deserializes untrusted XML data. An attacker can inject malicious XML code that instructs the parser to access local files or network resources.
*   **Exploitation Scenario:**
    1.  The attacker identifies that the Korge game loads configuration data from an XML file.
    2.  The attacker crafts a malicious XML file containing an external entity declaration that points to a local file (e.g., `/etc/passwd` on Linux or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows) or an internal network resource.
    3.  The attacker replaces the legitimate configuration file.
    4.  When the Korge game loads and parses the malicious XML file, the XML parser processes the external entity declaration.
    5.  The parser attempts to access the specified local file or network resource, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing the attacker to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.

#### 4.3. Korge Specific Considerations

*   **Scene Management:** Korge's scene management system often involves loading and deserializing scene data. If scene files are loaded from untrusted sources, this becomes a prime attack vector.
*   **Asset Loading:** Korge games frequently load assets (images, sounds, fonts, etc.) from external files. While asset loading itself might not directly involve deserialization vulnerabilities in the same way as object deserialization, vulnerabilities in asset processing libraries or custom asset loading code could still exist.
*   **Kotlin/JVM Ecosystem:** Korge runs on the JVM and leverages the Kotlin ecosystem. Developers need to be aware of security considerations specific to Kotlin and JVM deserialization libraries.
*   **Cross-Platform Nature:** Korge's cross-platform nature means that vulnerabilities might need to be considered across different target platforms (desktop, web, mobile). Deserialization behavior and library vulnerabilities can sometimes vary across platforms.

#### 4.4. Impact and Risk Severity

The impact of successful deserialization attacks on Korge applications can be severe:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  The most critical impact. Attackers can gain complete control over the player's machine, allowing them to install malware, steal data, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Data Corruption:**  Attackers might be able to manipulate deserialized data to corrupt game state, save files, or configuration data, leading to game instability or unfair advantages.
*   **Application Logic Bypass:**  By manipulating deserialized data, attackers could bypass game logic, cheat, or gain unauthorized access to features or content.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Maliciously crafted data could cause the application to crash or become unresponsive, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  In cases like XXE injection, attackers might be able to access sensitive information from the server or client system.

**Risk Severity:**  As stated in the initial attack surface description, the risk severity is **High** due to the potential for Remote Code Execution. Even without RCE, data corruption and application logic bypass can significantly impact the game experience and potentially lead to financial losses or reputational damage.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed and Korge-Specific)

To mitigate the risks associated with deserialization of untrusted scene/data files in Korge applications, developers should implement the following strategies:

1.  **Secure Deserialization Libraries & Practices:**

    *   **Choose Secure Libraries:**  Carefully select deserialization libraries known for their security and actively maintained. Stay updated with security advisories and patch vulnerabilities promptly. For Kotlin/JVM, consider libraries like `kotlinx.serialization` and ensure you are using the latest stable versions.
    *   **Principle of Least Functionality:**  Configure deserialization libraries to only deserialize the necessary data types and disable features that are not required and could introduce vulnerabilities (e.g., polymorphic deserialization if not strictly needed, or features that allow arbitrary class instantiation).
    *   **Input Validation and Schema Enforcement:**  **Crucially, implement robust input validation *after* deserialization within your application code.**  Do not rely solely on the deserialization library for security.
        *   **Schema Definition:** Define a strict schema or data structure for your scene and data files.
        *   **Validation Logic:**  Write code to validate the deserialized data against this schema. Check data types, ranges, allowed values, and relationships between data fields.
        *   **Example (Kotlin):**
            ```kotlin
            data class LevelData(val levelName: String, val width: Int, val height: Int, val objects: List<GameObjectData>)
            data class GameObjectData(val type: String, val x: Int, val y: Int)

            fun validateLevelData(data: LevelData): Boolean {
                if (data.levelName.isBlank() || data.width <= 0 || data.height <= 0) return false
                for (obj in data.objects) {
                    if (obj.type !in listOf("enemy", "player", "obstacle")) return false
                    if (obj.x < 0 || obj.y < 0) return false // Example range check
                }
                return true
            }

            // ... after deserialization ...
            val levelData = Json.decodeFromString<LevelData>(jsonString)
            if (validateLevelData(levelData)) {
                // Proceed to load level
            } else {
                // Handle invalid data, log error, and potentially refuse to load
                println("Error: Invalid level data detected!")
            }
            ```
    *   **Sanitize Deserialized Data:**  If possible, sanitize or transform deserialized data to remove potentially harmful elements before using it in the application logic.

2.  **Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data Directly:**

    *   **Authentication and Authorization:**  Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for data sources.
        *   **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS for downloading data from remote servers to prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks.
        *   **API Keys/Tokens:**  Use API keys or tokens to authenticate requests to data servers.
        *   **Signed Data:**  Consider digitally signing data files to ensure their integrity and authenticity. Verify signatures before deserialization.
    *   **Minimize Untrusted Sources:**  Reduce reliance on data from completely untrusted sources. If possible, bundle critical data with the application or obtain it from trusted, controlled servers.
    *   **Sandboxing/Isolation:** If you must process data from untrusted sources, consider running the deserialization process in a sandboxed or isolated environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.

3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**

    *   **Restrict Application Permissions:**  Run the Korge application with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running the game process as administrator or root. This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they achieve RCE.
    *   **Operating System Level Security:**  Utilize operating system-level security features like Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP) to make exploitation more difficult.

4.  **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Web Builds:**

    *   If deploying Korge games to the web, implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the resources the application can load and execute. This can help mitigate the impact of certain types of deserialization exploits, especially those involving loading external scripts or resources.

5.  **Regular Security Audits and Testing:**

    *   **Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular code reviews, specifically focusing on deserialization logic and data handling.
    *   **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools to automatically detect potential deserialization vulnerabilities in the codebase.
    *   **Dynamic Testing/Fuzzing:**  Perform dynamic testing and fuzzing of deserialization routines with malformed and malicious data to identify vulnerabilities.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Consider engaging security professionals to perform penetration testing on your Korge application to identify and exploit vulnerabilities, including deserialization flaws.

6.  **Developer Training and Awareness:**

    *   Educate the development team about deserialization vulnerabilities, secure coding practices, and the importance of input validation and secure library usage.
    *   Promote a security-conscious development culture within the team.

By implementing these mitigation strategies, Korge developers can significantly reduce the risk of deserialization vulnerabilities and build more secure and robust games. Remember that security is an ongoing process, and continuous vigilance and adaptation are essential to stay ahead of evolving threats.
