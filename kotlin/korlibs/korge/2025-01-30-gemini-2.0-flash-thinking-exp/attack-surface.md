# Attack Surface Analysis for korlibs/korge

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Asset Loading (Images, Audio, Fonts)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_asset_loading__images__audio__fonts_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in image, audio, or font parsing libraries by providing maliciously crafted asset files.
*   **Korge Contribution:** Korge's asset loading mechanisms are the direct entry point for loading and processing various asset formats (PNG, JPG, MP3, OGG, TTF, etc.). Korge relies on underlying libraries (Kotlin/JVM, platform-specific) for decoding, and vulnerabilities in these libraries are directly exploitable through Korge's asset loading.
*   **Example:** A game loads a PNG image for a character sprite. The PNG file is crafted to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in the image decoding library used by Korge. This leads to application crash (DoS) or potentially remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE), data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (RCE potential).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Asset Sources:**  Prioritize loading assets from trusted and verified sources. For user-generated content, implement strict vetting and scanning processes *before* assets are loaded by Korge.
    *   **Keep Korge and Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update Korge to benefit from updates to its dependencies, including underlying libraries that handle asset decoding. This is crucial for patching known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Sandboxing/Isolation (Advanced):**  Consider isolating asset loading and processing within a sandboxed environment to limit the potential damage from exploits.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Scene/Data Files](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_scenedata_files.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities during the deserialization of game scenes or data files (e.g., JSON, custom formats) loaded from external sources.
*   **Korge Contribution:** If Korge applications are designed to load game levels, configurations, or other critical data from external files, and if Korge or application code uses insecure deserialization practices, it becomes a direct attack surface. Korge provides the environment where this deserialization takes place and processes the loaded data.
*   **Example:** A game loads level data from a JSON file downloaded from a server. The JSON deserialization process is vulnerable to injection attacks. A malicious JSON file could be crafted to inject code or manipulate application state during deserialization, leading to RCE.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data corruption, application logic bypass.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (RCE potential).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Deserialization Libraries & Practices:**  Utilize secure and well-vetted deserialization libraries. Implement robust input validation and schema enforcement on deserialized data *within the application code that uses Korge*.
    *   **Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data Directly:** Minimize or eliminate the direct deserialization of data from completely untrusted sources. Implement strong authentication and authorization for data sources.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges to contain the impact of potential exploits during deserialization.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Korge Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_korge_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities present in the third-party libraries and dependencies that Korge directly relies upon.
*   **Korge Contribution:** Korge's architecture and functionality are built upon a set of dependencies. Vulnerabilities within these *direct* dependencies of Korge itself (not just general Kotlin/JVM ecosystem, but libraries Korge *bundles or explicitly requires*) directly impact the security of Korge applications.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a specific version of a graphics library or a core Kotlin library that Korge directly depends on. Applications using the vulnerable Korge version inherit this vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, could range from DoS to RCE, data breaches, etc.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical to High depending on the dependency and vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Management and Updates (Crucial):**  Regularly update Korge to the latest stable version. Korge updates often include updates to its dependencies, addressing known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Monitor Korge Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories specifically related to Korge and its direct dependencies. Follow Korge's official communication channels for security updates.

## Attack Surface: [Outdated Korge Version](./attack_surfaces/outdated_korge_version.md)

*   **Description:** Using an outdated version of Korge that contains known, publicly disclosed vulnerabilities.
*   **Korge Contribution:**  Directly using an outdated version of Korge is the primary factor.  Known vulnerabilities in older Korge versions are directly exploitable in applications built with those versions.
*   **Example:** A critical security vulnerability is found and patched in Korge version 2.1.0. An application remaining on Korge version 2.0.0 is directly vulnerable to this exploit.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, could range from DoS to RCE, data breaches, etc.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical to High depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Korge Updates (Essential):**  Always use the latest stable version of Korge. Prioritize updating Korge, especially when security updates are announced.
    *   **Automated Update Processes:** Implement processes to regularly check for and apply Korge updates to minimize the window of vulnerability exposure.
