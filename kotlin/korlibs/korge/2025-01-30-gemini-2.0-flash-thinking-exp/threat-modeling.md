# Threat Model Analysis for korlibs/korge

## Threat: [Code Injection via Assets](./threats/code_injection_via_assets.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious assets (e.g., images, data files) that exploit vulnerabilities in Korge's asset processing or underlying libraries to inject and execute arbitrary code within the application's context. This is possible if asset formats allow for embedded code or if vulnerabilities exist in asset parsing libraries used by Korge.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full application compromise, data theft, malware installation on the user's machine.
    *   **Korge Component Affected:** `korlibs.image`, `korlibs.audio`, `korlibs.io.serialization`, custom asset loaders, and any underlying libraries used by Korge for asset processing (e.g., image decoding libraries).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use well-vetted and secure asset processing libraries.
        *   Sanitize and validate asset content rigorously before processing.
        *   Implement sandboxing or isolation for asset processing if possible.
        *   Regularly update Korge and its dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities in asset processing libraries.

## Threat: [Korge Engine Tampering (Supply Chain Risk)](./threats/korge_engine_tampering__supply_chain_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Developers use compromised or untrusted versions of the Korge engine or its libraries, which contain backdoors or vulnerabilities. This could happen if developers download Korge from unofficial sources or if the official Korge distribution is compromised.
    *   **Impact:** Application compromise, introduction of vulnerabilities at development time, potential widespread impact if compromised Korge versions are widely used.
    *   **Korge Component Affected:** Entire Korge engine and its ecosystem, build process, development environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Download Korge and its dependencies only from official and trusted sources (e.g., official GitHub repository, Maven Central).
        *   Verify the integrity of downloaded Korge distributions using checksums or digital signatures.
        *   Implement dependency scanning and vulnerability analysis in the development pipeline.
        *   Use dependency management tools to ensure consistent and verifiable builds.

## Threat: [Memory Leaks and Data Exposure](./threats/memory_leaks_and_data_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs in Korge or developer code lead to memory leaks, potentially exposing sensitive game data or engine internals in memory dumps, through debugging mechanisms, or by exploiting memory corruption vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Information leakage, potential exploitation of exposed data, application instability, denial of service if memory leaks are severe.
    *   **Korge Component Affected:** Core Korge engine, rendering pipeline, memory management within Korge and user code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly test and debug Korge applications to identify and fix memory leaks.
        *   Use memory profiling tools to monitor memory usage and identify potential leaks.
        *   Regularly update Korge to benefit from bug fixes and memory leak patches.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive data in memory for extended periods if possible.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Asset Loading (DoS)](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_asset_loading__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the application with requests for excessively large or numerous assets, overwhelming resources (memory, CPU, network) and potentially crashing the application or making it unresponsive.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, degraded performance, denial of service, server overload if assets are served from a server.
    *   **Korge Component Affected:** Asset loading mechanisms, network communication, resource management within Korge, server infrastructure if assets are served remotely.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting for asset requests.
        *   Set limits on asset sizes and quantities that can be loaded.
        *   Use caching mechanisms to reduce asset loading overhead.
        *   Optimize asset sizes and formats for efficient loading.
        *   Implement server-side protection against denial-of-service attacks if assets are served remotely.

## Threat: [Rendering Pipeline Exploits (DoS)](./threats/rendering_pipeline_exploits__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts specific game scenes or asset combinations that exploit vulnerabilities or inefficiencies in Korge's rendering pipeline or underlying graphics libraries (WebGL, OpenGL), causing crashes, performance degradation, or denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Application crashes, degraded performance, denial of service, negative player experience.
    *   **Korge Component Affected:** Rendering pipeline (`korlibs.render`), graphics libraries (WebGL, OpenGL), shader compilation and execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Korge and graphics drivers to patch known rendering vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization for scene data and asset properties that influence rendering.
        *   Limit the complexity of game scenes and assets to prevent resource exhaustion.
        *   Perform performance testing and profiling to identify rendering bottlenecks and potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Plugin/Extension Vulnerabilities (Elevation of Privilege)](./threats/pluginextension_vulnerabilities__elevation_of_privilege_.md)

*   **Description:** If Korge applications use plugins or extensions, vulnerabilities in these extensions could allow attackers to gain elevated privileges within the application's context or even the underlying system. This depends on the plugin architecture and permissions model.
    *   **Impact:** Application compromise, potentially system-level access, arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges.
    *   **Korge Component Affected:** Plugin/extension system (if implemented), any custom plugin/extension code, interaction between Korge core and plugins.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and audit plugins/extensions for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a secure plugin architecture with a least-privilege permission model.
        *   Regularly update plugins/extensions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Provide clear guidelines and security best practices for plugin developers.

## Threat: [Native Code Vulnerabilities (Elevation of Privilege)](./threats/native_code_vulnerabilities__elevation_of_privilege_.md)

*   **Description:** If the Korge application uses native code extensions or is deployed as a native application, vulnerabilities in the native code or its interaction with Korge could lead to elevation of privilege on the target system. This could include buffer overflows, format string bugs, or other memory corruption vulnerabilities in native libraries.
    *   **Impact:** System compromise, arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges, full control over the user's machine.
    *   **Korge Component Affected:** Native code extensions, JNI/Native interface, interaction between Kotlin/JVM and native code, underlying operating system and hardware.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use secure coding practices when developing native code extensions.
        *   Thoroughly test and audit native code for vulnerabilities, including memory safety issues.
        *   Use memory-safe languages or libraries for native code development where possible.
        *   Implement sandboxing or isolation for native code execution if feasible.
        *   Regularly update native libraries and dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
