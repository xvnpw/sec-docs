### 4. Deep Analysis of Code Injection via Assets

#### 4.1. Threat Description Breakdown

The "Code Injection via Assets" threat exploits the process of loading and processing external assets within a Korge application.  An attacker aims to inject and execute malicious code by crafting seemingly benign asset files (images, audio, data files, etc.) that, when processed by Korge or its underlying libraries, trigger a vulnerability leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted Asset Files:** Attackers create asset files that exploit vulnerabilities in asset parsing libraries. This could involve:
    *   **Buffer Overflows:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in image or audio decoders that occur when processing oversized or malformed data, allowing the attacker to overwrite memory and potentially control program execution.
    *   **Format String Bugs:**  If asset processing involves string formatting functions with user-controlled input (asset content), attackers could inject format specifiers to read or write arbitrary memory locations.
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities:** If Korge uses serialization libraries to process data assets (e.g., JSON, XML, custom formats), vulnerabilities in these libraries could allow attackers to inject code during deserialization.
    *   **Exploiting Logic Vulnerabilities in Custom Asset Loaders:** If developers implement custom asset loaders, vulnerabilities in their logic (e.g., improper input validation, insecure file handling) could be exploited.
    *   **Polyglot Files:** Crafting files that are valid in multiple formats, where one format is benign for initial checks but another format, triggered during deeper processing, contains malicious code or exploits.

**Attacker Motivation:**

*   **Application Compromise:** Gain full control over the Korge application, allowing them to modify its behavior, steal data, or disrupt its functionality.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Execute arbitrary code on the user's machine running the Korge application. This is the most severe impact, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Data Theft:** Access and exfiltrate sensitive data processed or stored by the Korge application or accessible on the user's system.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Use the compromised application as a vector to distribute malware to users' machines.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Craft assets that crash the application or consume excessive resources, leading to denial of service. While not code injection in the strictest sense, it's a related impact of malicious asset handling.

#### 4.2. Vulnerability Analysis in Korge Components

Let's examine the Korge components mentioned and potential vulnerabilities:

*   **`korlibs.image`:** This component handles image loading and processing. Potential vulnerabilities could arise from:
    *   **Underlying Image Decoding Libraries:** Korge likely relies on platform-specific or cross-platform image decoding libraries (e.g., for PNG, JPEG, etc.). These libraries are complex and historically prone to vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, integer overflows, etc.). If Korge uses outdated or vulnerable versions of these libraries, it becomes susceptible.
    *   **Image Processing Logic in Korge:** While less likely, vulnerabilities could exist in Korge's own image processing code if it performs operations like resizing, filtering, or format conversion without proper input validation.

*   **`korlibs.audio`:** This component handles audio loading and processing. Similar to images, vulnerabilities could stem from:
    *   **Underlying Audio Decoding Libraries/Codecs:** Korge uses audio codecs (e.g., MP3, OGG, WAV) and libraries for decoding. Vulnerabilities in these codecs or libraries could be exploited through malicious audio files.
    *   **Audio Processing Logic in Korge:**  If Korge performs audio manipulation (e.g., mixing, effects) without proper input sanitization, vulnerabilities could be introduced.

*   **`korlibs.io.serialization`:** This component deals with serialization and deserialization of data. Potential vulnerabilities include:
    *   **Insecure Deserialization:** If `korlibs.io.serialization` or libraries it uses are vulnerable to insecure deserialization, attackers could craft malicious serialized data that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code. This is a well-known class of vulnerability, especially in languages like Java and potentially Kotlin if serialization is not handled carefully.
    *   **Format String Bugs (less likely but possible):** If serialization/deserialization logic involves string formatting with user-controlled data, format string bugs could be exploited.

*   **Custom Asset Loaders:**  Developers often create custom asset loaders for specific game data formats. These are high-risk areas because:
    *   **Lack of Security Expertise:** Developers might not have the same level of security expertise as library maintainers, potentially introducing vulnerabilities in their custom loaders.
    *   **Complex Parsing Logic:** Custom loaders often involve complex parsing logic, increasing the chance of introducing bugs, including security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Insufficient Input Validation:** Custom loaders might lack proper input validation and sanitization, making them vulnerable to malicious input.

*   **Underlying Libraries:**  It's crucial to consider all underlying libraries used by Korge for asset processing, even if not directly listed in the threat description. This includes:
    *   **Operating System Libraries:**  Korge might rely on OS-level libraries for file I/O, networking, and other operations. Vulnerabilities in these libraries could be indirectly exploitable through asset processing.
    *   **Third-Party Libraries:** Korge might depend on other third-party libraries for specific functionalities. These dependencies need to be assessed for vulnerabilities.

#### 4.3. Attack Scenarios

Here are a few concrete attack scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Image File Buffer Overflow**

1.  **Attacker Action:** An attacker crafts a malicious PNG image file. This file contains carefully crafted header or data chunks that, when processed by the image decoding library used by `korlibs.image`, trigger a buffer overflow vulnerability.
2.  **Korge Application Action:** The Korge application loads and attempts to display this image asset, either directly or indirectly (e.g., as a texture in a game scene).
3.  **Exploitation:** The buffer overflow allows the attacker to overwrite memory regions, potentially including the instruction pointer.
4.  **Outcome:** The attacker gains control of the program execution flow and can inject and execute arbitrary code within the context of the Korge application. This could lead to full application compromise and potentially system-level access depending on application permissions.

**Scenario 2: Malicious Data File Deserialization**

1.  **Attacker Action:** An attacker crafts a malicious JSON or XML data file. This file contains serialized data that exploits an insecure deserialization vulnerability in the library used by `korlibs.io.serialization`. The malicious data could contain instructions to execute arbitrary code during the deserialization process.
2.  **Korge Application Action:** The Korge application loads and deserializes this data file, perhaps as game configuration, level data, or user profiles.
3.  **Exploitation:** The insecure deserialization vulnerability is triggered, allowing the attacker to execute code embedded within the malicious data.
4.  **Outcome:** Similar to Scenario 1, the attacker achieves remote code execution and can compromise the application and potentially the user's system.

**Scenario 3: Exploiting Custom Asset Loader Logic**

1.  **Attacker Action:** An attacker targets a Korge application that uses a custom asset loader for a specific game data format (e.g., a custom level format). The attacker analyzes the application and identifies a vulnerability in the custom loader's parsing logic, such as insufficient input validation or a path traversal vulnerability.
2.  **Korge Application Action:** The Korge application loads a malicious asset file designed to exploit the vulnerability in the custom loader.
3.  **Exploitation:** The vulnerability in the custom loader is triggered. For example, a path traversal vulnerability could allow the attacker to overwrite critical application files or execute code from an attacker-controlled location.
4.  **Outcome:** Depending on the vulnerability, the attacker could achieve code execution, data theft, or application disruption.

#### 4.4. Impact Assessment

The impact of successful code injection via assets is **Critical**, as stated in the threat description.  The potential consequences are severe:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This is the most critical impact. An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine. This allows them to:
    *   Install malware (viruses, ransomware, spyware).
    *   Steal sensitive data (personal information, credentials, game data, financial information).
    *   Take control of the user's system.
    *   Use the compromised system as part of a botnet.
*   **Full Application Compromise:** The attacker gains complete control over the Korge application. This allows them to:
    *   Modify game logic and behavior.
    *   Inject malicious content into the game.
    *   Steal in-game assets or currency.
    *   Disrupt game functionality and availability.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers can access and exfiltrate data processed or stored by the Korge application. This could include user data, game progress, configuration files, and potentially sensitive information if the application handles it.
*   **Reputation Damage:** If a Korge application is compromised and used for malicious purposes, it can severely damage the reputation of the developers and the Korge framework itself.
*   **Financial Losses:**  For commercial Korge applications, security breaches can lead to financial losses due to downtime, recovery costs, legal liabilities, and loss of customer trust.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Analysis and Recommendations

The provided mitigation strategies are essential and should be implemented rigorously:

*   **Use Well-Vetted and Secure Asset Processing Libraries:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Korge should prioritize using well-established, actively maintained, and security-audited libraries for asset processing. When choosing libraries, security should be a primary consideration alongside performance and functionality.
    *   **Korge Specific:** Regularly review and update the libraries used by `korlibs.image`, `korlibs.audio`, `korlibs.io.serialization`, and any other asset processing components. Consider using libraries with known security track records and active vulnerability disclosure processes.

*   **Sanitize and Validate Asset Content Rigorously Before Processing:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all asset types before they are processed by Korge. This includes:
        *   **Format Validation:** Verify that asset files adhere to the expected format specifications.
        *   **Size Limits:** Enforce reasonable size limits for asset files to prevent buffer overflows and resource exhaustion.
        *   **Content Sanitization:**  If possible, sanitize asset content to remove potentially malicious elements or code. This is complex for binary formats but might be applicable to text-based data assets.
    *   **Korge Specific:**  Develop or utilize validation mechanisms within Korge's asset loading pipeline. For custom asset loaders, provide clear guidelines and examples for developers on how to implement secure input validation. Consider using checksums or digital signatures to verify asset integrity if assets are distributed from a trusted source.

*   **Implement Sandboxing or Isolation for Asset Processing if Possible:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Explore options for sandboxing or isolating asset processing to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities. This could involve:
        *   **Process Isolation:** Running asset processing in a separate, less privileged process with restricted access to system resources.
        *   **Containerization:** Using containers to isolate the application and its asset processing environment.
        *   **Security Contexts:** Utilizing operating system security features to restrict the permissions of the asset processing components.
    *   **Korge Specific:**  Investigate if Kotlin/Native or the target platforms for Korge applications offer mechanisms for process isolation or sandboxing that can be leveraged for asset processing. This might be more complex but significantly enhances security.

*   **Regularly Update Korge and its Dependencies to Patch Known Vulnerabilities in Asset Processing Libraries:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Establish a robust dependency management and update process for Korge and its projects. Regularly monitor security advisories for Korge dependencies and promptly update to patched versions.
    *   **Korge Specific:**  Korge should have a clear process for managing dependencies and communicating security updates to developers using the framework.  Consider using dependency management tools that facilitate vulnerability scanning and automated updates.

**Additional Mitigation Recommendations Specific to Korge:**

*   **Secure Default Configurations:** Ensure that Korge's default configurations promote secure asset handling. For example, disable features that are known to be potentially vulnerable if they are not essential.
*   **Developer Security Guidance:** Provide comprehensive security guidelines and best practices for developers using Korge, specifically focusing on secure asset handling. This should include:
    *   Best practices for writing custom asset loaders.
    *   Examples of secure asset validation and sanitization techniques.
    *   Guidance on choosing secure asset processing libraries.
    *   Information on Korge's security update process.
*   **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of Korge itself and example Korge applications to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively.
*   **Community Security Engagement:** Encourage security researchers and the Korge community to report vulnerabilities responsibly and contribute to improving Korge's security posture. Implement a clear vulnerability disclosure policy.
