# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for korlibs/korge

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Korge and Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_korge_and_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Regularly monitor the official Korge GitHub repository or relevant package repositories (e.g., Maven Central for JVM, npm for JS) for new Korge releases.
    *   Step 2: Review Korge release notes and changelogs, paying close attention to any security fixes or vulnerability patches mentioned for the Korge engine itself or its core libraries.
    *   Step 3: Update the Korge dependency version in your project's build configuration (e.g., `build.gradle.kts` for Gradle, `package.json` for npm) to the latest stable and secure version.
    *   Step 4:  Check for updates to Korge's direct and transitive dependencies. Use dependency management tools to identify and update these, ensuring compatibility with the updated Korge version.
    *   Step 5: After updating Korge and its dependencies, thoroughly test your Korge application to confirm that the update hasn't introduced regressions and that all Korge engine features function as expected.
    *   Step 6: Establish a recurring schedule for checking and applying Korge and dependency updates to maintain a secure engine version.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Korge Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated Korge versions may contain known vulnerabilities within the engine's code itself. Updating directly addresses these Korge-specific flaws.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Korge's Dependencies (High Severity):** Korge relies on libraries. Vulnerabilities in these libraries, if exploited within the context of Korge, can be mitigated by updating.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Korge Vulnerabilities:** High reduction in risk. Directly patches vulnerabilities within the Korge engine.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Korge's Dependencies:** High reduction in risk related to vulnerabilities in libraries used by Korge.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. We check for Korge updates every 6 months, but dependency updates are less consistent and focused on Korge's specific dependency tree.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Need to implement more frequent checks for Korge updates (e.g., quarterly).
    *   Need to specifically track and update dependencies critical to Korge's functionality and security.
    *   Need to integrate automated checks for Korge and its dependency updates into the CI/CD pipeline.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Vulnerability Scanning (Korge Focused)](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_vulnerability_scanning__korge_focused_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Integrate a dependency vulnerability scanning tool into your Korge project's development workflow. Focus the scanning on the dependencies used directly and indirectly by Korge.
    *   Step 2: Configure the scanning tool to specifically analyze the dependency tree of your Korge project during build or CI/CD processes.
    *   Step 3: Review the scan reports, prioritizing vulnerabilities reported in dependencies that are core to Korge's functionality or are known to be used extensively by the engine.
    *   Step 4: Address identified vulnerabilities by updating dependencies to patched versions or applying mitigations recommended in the context of Korge usage.
    *   Step 5: Regularly rerun vulnerability scans to detect newly discovered vulnerabilities in Korge's dependency chain.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Korge Dependencies (High Severity):** Proactively identifies known vulnerabilities within the libraries Korge relies on, preventing exploits targeting these dependencies within a Korge application.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks via Korge Dependencies (Medium Severity):** Helps detect potentially compromised or malicious dependencies that could be introduced through Korge's dependency chain.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Korge Dependencies:** High reduction in risk. Proactive scanning and remediation significantly reduces the attack surface related to Korge's dependencies.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks via Korge Dependencies:** Medium reduction in risk. Scanning can detect some supply chain attacks targeting Korge dependencies, but might not catch all sophisticated attacks.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not currently implemented. We manually review dependency updates but lack automated vulnerability scanning specifically focused on Korge's dependency context.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Need to integrate a dependency vulnerability scanning tool into our CI/CD pipeline, configured to analyze Korge's dependencies.
    *   Need to train developers to interpret vulnerability scan reports in the context of Korge and its usage of dependencies.
    *   Need to establish a process for tracking and resolving vulnerabilities identified in Korge's dependency chain.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Asset Sources for Korge](./mitigation_strategies/secure_asset_sources_for_korge.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify all sources from which your Korge application loads game assets (images, sounds, spritesheets, level data, etc.). Consider both bundled assets and dynamically loaded assets.
    *   Step 2: Prioritize using trusted and controlled asset sources for your Korge game. Ideally, bundle essential game assets directly within the application package or serve them from your own secure servers.
    *   Step 3: If your Korge game needs to load assets from external sources (e.g., user-provided URLs for custom content, third-party content servers), implement strict validation and sanitization of asset paths and URLs *within the Korge asset loading mechanisms*.
    *   Step 4:  Use allowlists to restrict Korge asset loading to specific, trusted domains or paths. Configure Korge's asset loading to respect these allowlists.
    *   Step 5: Minimize or avoid directly loading assets from untrusted user-provided sources in Korge if possible. If necessary for game features, implement robust security checks and consider sandboxing asset loading within Korge.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Path Traversal Vulnerabilities via Korge Asset Loading (High Severity):** Maliciously crafted asset paths provided to Korge's asset loading functions could allow attackers to access files outside the intended asset directories on the user's system.
    *   **Loading Malicious Assets into Korge (High Severity):** Loading assets from untrusted sources into Korge can introduce malicious data or potentially trigger vulnerabilities within Korge's asset processing or rendering pipelines.
    *   **Data Exfiltration via Compromised Korge Asset Sources (Medium Severity):** Compromised asset sources could be used to attempt to exfiltrate sensitive data from the Korge application or the user's environment.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Path Traversal Vulnerabilities via Korge Asset Loading:** High reduction in risk. Input validation and allowlists applied to Korge asset paths effectively prevent path traversal exploits through Korge's asset loading.
    *   **Loading Malicious Assets into Korge:** High reduction in risk. Using trusted sources and validation minimizes the risk of loading malicious assets that could harm the Korge application or user.
    *   **Data Exfiltration via Compromised Korge Asset Sources:** Medium reduction in risk. Secure asset sources reduce the risk of data exfiltration through vulnerabilities in Korge's asset handling or compromised asset delivery.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. We primarily load assets bundled with the Korge application or from our controlled servers. However, features allowing user-provided image URLs for in-game content lack strict validation within the Korge asset loading context.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Need to implement robust validation and sanitization specifically for user-provided asset URLs used with Korge's asset loading functions.
    *   Need to implement allowlists for external asset sources that Korge is permitted to load from.
    *   Need to review and secure all asset loading paths and mechanisms within the Korge application code.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Asset Integrity Verification for Korge Assets](./mitigation_strategies/asset_integrity_verification_for_korge_assets.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Generate checksums (e.g., SHA-256 hashes) or digital signatures for all critical game assets used by your Korge application.
    *   Step 2: Store these checksums or signatures securely alongside the assets (e.g., in a manifest file bundled with the Korge application) or in a secure location accessible during asset loading.
    *   Step 3: Before Korge loads and uses an asset, calculate its checksum or verify its digital signature *within the Korge asset loading process*.
    *   Step 4: Compare the calculated checksum/signature with the stored, trusted value. If they do not match, prevent Korge from loading or using the asset and log an error within the Korge application's logging system.
    *   Step 5: Implement a process to regenerate and update checksums/signatures whenever game assets are modified or updated for your Korge application.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Asset Tampering Affecting Korge (High Severity):** Ensures that game assets used by Korge have not been maliciously modified or corrupted during transit, storage, or delivery, which could lead to unexpected or harmful behavior within the Korge game.
    *   **Malicious Asset Injection into Korge (High Severity):** Detects if malicious assets have been injected into the asset delivery pipeline intended for Korge, preventing their use by the game engine.
    *   **Data Corruption of Korge Assets (Medium Severity):** Helps detect accidental data corruption of game assets that could cause instability or errors within the Korge application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Asset Tampering Affecting Korge:** High reduction in risk. Integrity verification effectively detects tampering of assets intended for use by Korge.
    *   **Malicious Asset Injection into Korge:** High reduction in risk. Verification helps prevent the Korge engine from using malicious assets.
    *   **Data Corruption of Korge Assets:** Medium reduction in risk. Detects data corruption of assets used by Korge, but might not prevent the corruption itself.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not currently implemented. We do not currently use checksums or digital signatures to verify the integrity of assets loaded by Korge.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Need to implement a system for generating and securely storing asset checksums/signatures for Korge game assets.
    *   Need to integrate asset integrity verification directly into Korge's asset loading pipeline.
    *   Need to establish a process for managing and updating checksums/signatures when Korge game assets are updated.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Dynamic Asset Loading from Untrusted Sources in Korge](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_dynamic_asset_loading_from_untrusted_sources_in_korge.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Review your Korge application's architecture and identify all instances where it dynamically loads assets, especially from external or user-controlled sources, using Korge's asset loading features.
    *   Step 2: Minimize or completely eliminate dynamic loading of code or executable assets (e.g., scripts, shaders, plugins) from untrusted sources *within the Korge engine context*. Focus on loading only data assets dynamically if necessary.
    *   Step 3: If dynamic loading of data assets from external sources is essential for your Korge game, restrict it to trusted sources and implement strict security controls *within the Korge application logic*.
    *   Step 4:  For dynamically loaded data assets, apply rigorous validation and sanitization *before they are processed or used by Korge game logic* to prevent potential exploits.
    *   Step 5: Consider alternative approaches to dynamic content updates for your Korge game that do not involve loading executable code or assets from untrusted sources, such as using configuration files or data-driven content updates.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Korge (Critical Severity):** Dynamically loading and executing code or executable assets from untrusted sources within Korge is a major RCE risk, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code within the game's context.
    *   **Malware Injection via Korge Assets (High Severity):** Malicious code or data can be injected into the Korge application through dynamically loaded assets, potentially compromising the game or the user's system.
    *   **Privilege Escalation via Korge (Medium Severity):** Dynamically loaded code or assets could potentially be used to escalate privileges within the Korge application or the user's system if vulnerabilities exist in Korge's handling of these assets.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Korge:** High reduction in risk. Minimizing dynamic code loading within Korge significantly reduces the risk of RCE exploits targeting the game engine.
    *   **Malware Injection via Korge Assets:** High reduction in risk. Reduces the attack surface for malware injection through Korge's asset loading mechanisms.
    *   **Privilege Escalation via Korge:** Medium reduction in risk. Limits potential avenues for privilege escalation through vulnerabilities related to dynamic asset loading in Korge.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. We generally avoid dynamic loading of executable code within our Korge applications. However, some features might still rely on loading data files from external sources that could potentially be exploited if not handled securely within the Korge context.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Need to conduct a thorough review to identify and eliminate or secure all instances of dynamic asset loading, especially code execution, within our Korge applications.
    *   Need to implement strict validation and sanitization for any unavoidable dynamic asset loading within Korge.
    *   Need to explore and implement safer alternative approaches to dynamic content updates for our Korge games that minimize security risks.
