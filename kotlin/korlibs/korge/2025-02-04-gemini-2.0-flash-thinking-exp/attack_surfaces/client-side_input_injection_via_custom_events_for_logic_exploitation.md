## Deep Analysis: Client-Side Input Injection via Custom Events for Logic Exploitation in Korge Applications

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Client-Side Input Injection via Custom Events for Logic Exploitation" attack surface in applications built using the Korge framework (https://github.com/korlibs/korge). It outlines the objective, scope, methodology, a detailed analysis of the attack surface, and mitigation strategies.

### 1. Define Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the potential risks associated with client-side input injection through custom events within the Korge event system.  This analysis aims to:

*   **Understand the technical vulnerabilities:**  Identify how the Korge event system, when misused, can become a vector for client-side input injection.
*   **Explore exploitation scenarios:**  Detail practical examples of how attackers could leverage this vulnerability to manipulate application logic.
*   **Assess the potential impact:**  Determine the severity and scope of damage that can be inflicted through successful exploitation.
*   **Provide actionable mitigation strategies:**  Offer concrete and practical recommendations for Korge developers to secure their applications against this attack surface.
*   **Raise awareness:**  Educate Korge developers about this specific attack vector and the importance of secure event handling practices.

Ultimately, the goal is to empower Korge developers to build more secure and robust applications by understanding and mitigating this critical attack surface.

### 2. Scope

This analysis is focused specifically on the following aspects:

*   **Korge's Custom Event System:** We will examine how Korge's event dispatching (`Stage.dispatch`, `EventDispatcher.on`) and handling mechanisms for custom events can be exploited.
*   **Client-Side Input Injection:** We will concentrate on scenarios where attackers can inject or manipulate event data originating from the client-side (e.g., user input, browser interactions, or malicious client-side code).
*   **Logic Exploitation:** The analysis will focus on how injected or manipulated event data can be used to bypass or subvert application logic, leading to unintended behavior or unfair advantages.
*   **Impact on Application Security:** We will assess the potential security implications, including game manipulation, logic flaws, denial of service (DoS), and other adverse effects.
*   **Mitigation within Korge Context:**  The mitigation strategies will be tailored to the Korge framework and its development practices.

**Out of Scope:**

*   **Korge Core System Vulnerabilities:** We assume the core Korge event system is robust and secure in its fundamental design. This analysis focuses on vulnerabilities arising from *developer usage* of the system.
*   **Server-Side Vulnerabilities:**  This analysis is limited to client-side input injection and logic exploitation. Server-side vulnerabilities, if any, are outside the scope.
*   **Generic Web Security Issues:** While client-side injection is a broader web security concept, we will focus specifically on its manifestation and implications within the Korge framework and its event handling paradigm.
*   **Specific Code Audits:** This is a general analysis of the attack surface, not a code audit of any particular Korge application.

### 3. Methodology

To conduct this deep analysis, we will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Korge Event System Review:**  Thoroughly examine the Korge documentation and code examples related to event dispatching and handling, particularly focusing on custom events. This will establish a solid understanding of the framework's intended event flow and developer usage patterns.
2.  **Threat Modeling:**  Adopt an attacker's perspective to identify potential injection points and manipulation techniques within the Korge event system.  We will consider how client-side code can influence event data before it reaches event handlers.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Analyze the described attack surface ("Client-Side Input Injection via Custom Events for Logic Exploitation") to pinpoint the root cause of the vulnerability (lack of input validation) and its potential consequences within Korge applications.
4.  **Exploitation Scenario Development:**  Create detailed, practical examples of how an attacker could exploit this vulnerability in various Korge application types (games, interactive applications, etc.). These scenarios will illustrate the attack flow and potential impact.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Evaluation and Enhancement:**  Assess the effectiveness of the initially provided mitigation strategies.  We will expand upon these strategies, providing more specific and actionable guidance tailored to Korge development practices and the Kotlin language.
6.  **Documentation and Reporting:**  Compile all findings, analysis, exploitation scenarios, and mitigation strategies into this comprehensive markdown document, ensuring clarity, structure, and actionable recommendations for Korge developers.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Client-Side Input Injection via Custom Events

#### 4.1. Understanding the Vulnerability

The core vulnerability lies in the **trust placed in client-side event data** within Korge applications that utilize custom events. Korge's event system is designed for flexibility and extensibility, allowing developers to create custom events to manage complex application logic and interactions.  However, this flexibility can become a security weakness if not handled carefully.

**How Injection Occurs:**

*   **Client-Side Control:** In Korge applications, especially those running in web browsers or on desktop environments, the client-side code (written in Kotlin/JS or Kotlin/JVM) has control over event dispatching.  While the *application logic* resides in the Kotlin code, the *trigger* for events can often originate from user interactions or even programmatically controlled client-side scripts.
*   **Lack of Server-Side Validation (Irrelevant Here but Good to Note):** Unlike server-side applications where input validation is often enforced at the server level, client-side event handling in Korge relies heavily on the application's own code for validation. There's no inherent "firewall" for custom events within Korge itself.
*   **Event Data as Untrusted Input:**  If event handlers directly process event data without validation, they are essentially treating client-side input as trusted. An attacker, by manipulating the client-side environment or even through legitimate user actions crafted maliciously, can inject crafted events with malicious data.

**Why Custom Events are a Target:**

*   **Logic Encapsulation:** Custom events are often used to encapsulate critical application logic. For example, game actions, state transitions, or important data updates might be triggered by custom events. Exploiting these events directly manipulates the core logic.
*   **Developer-Defined Structure:**  The structure and meaning of custom events are defined by the developer. This means there's no standardized validation mechanism built-in. Developers must explicitly implement validation for *each* custom event and its data.
*   **Potential for Complex Data:** Custom events can carry complex data structures (strings, numbers, objects, etc.). This increases the attack surface, as multiple data fields within an event can be targets for injection.

#### 4.2. Exploitation Scenarios (Beyond the Fighting Game)

Let's explore more diverse exploitation scenarios to illustrate the breadth of this attack surface:

*   **Scenario 1: RPG Inventory Manipulation:**
    *   **Application:** A Korge RPG game uses a custom event `AddItemEvent(itemId: String, quantity: Int)` to add items to the player's inventory.
    *   **Vulnerability:** The event handler for `AddItemEvent` doesn't validate `itemId` or `quantity`.
    *   **Exploitation:** An attacker could inject `AddItemEvent(itemId: "powerful_admin_sword", quantity: 999)` to grant themselves powerful, unintended items or excessive quantities of resources, breaking game balance and gaining unfair advantages.

*   **Scenario 2: Strategy Game Resource Cheating:**
    *   **Application:** A Korge strategy game uses `ResourceChangeEvent(resourceType: String, amount: Int)` to update player resources (gold, wood, etc.).
    *   **Vulnerability:**  No validation on `resourceType` or `amount` in the event handler.
    *   **Exploitation:** Injecting `ResourceChangeEvent(resourceType: "gold", amount: 1000000)` allows an attacker to instantly gain massive resources, bypassing normal resource gathering mechanics and dominating the game.

*   **Scenario 3: Interactive Application Feature Unlocking:**
    *   **Application:** A Korge interactive learning application uses `UnlockFeatureEvent(featureId: String)` to unlock access to different learning modules.
    *   **Vulnerability:** The `UnlockFeatureEvent` handler directly unlocks the feature based on `featureId` without checking user progression or permissions.
    *   **Exploitation:** An attacker could inject `UnlockFeatureEvent(featureId: "premium_module")` to bypass payment or progression requirements and access premium content for free.

*   **Scenario 4: Denial of Service (DoS) via Logic Bomb:**
    *   **Application:** A Korge application uses `ProcessDataEvent(dataType: String, data: String)` to process various types of data.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  The `ProcessDataEvent` handler doesn't validate `dataType` and processes `data` based on `dataType`.  A specific `dataType` might trigger resource-intensive or error-prone logic.
    *   **Exploitation:**  An attacker could repeatedly inject `ProcessDataEvent(dataType: "vulnerable_type", data: "large_malicious_payload")` to trigger a logic bomb in the handler, causing excessive resource consumption, crashes, or application freezes, leading to DoS.

#### 4.3. Impact Assessment

The impact of successful client-side input injection via custom events can be significant and varied:

*   **Logic Flaws and Game Manipulation:** As demonstrated in the examples, attackers can directly manipulate core application logic, leading to unintended game states, broken mechanics, and unfair advantages in games.
*   **Unfair Advantages and Cheating:** In competitive games or applications with progression systems, this vulnerability can enable cheating and unfair advantages, ruining the experience for legitimate users.
*   **Data Corruption and Integrity Issues:**  Injected events could potentially corrupt application data or lead to inconsistent states if event handlers modify data based on malicious input.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploiting logic flaws through event injection can lead to resource exhaustion, crashes, or freezes, effectively denying service to legitimate users.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  If vulnerabilities are widely exploited, it can damage the reputation of the application and the developers.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** In some cases, logic exploitation can be a stepping stone to further vulnerabilities. For instance, manipulating application state might expose other weaknesses or allow for more complex attacks.

#### 4.4. Risk Severity: High

The risk severity is classified as **High** due to the following factors:

*   **Direct Impact on Application Logic:**  This vulnerability directly targets the core logic of the application, allowing attackers to bypass intended mechanics and controls.
*   **Ease of Exploitation (Potentially):**  Depending on the application's architecture and how events are handled, exploitation can be relatively straightforward for someone with client-side control or the ability to manipulate client-side interactions.
*   **Wide Range of Potential Impacts:** The consequences can range from minor game imbalances to severe application instability and DoS.
*   **Common Misconception of Client-Side Security:**  Developers might mistakenly believe that client-side code is less critical to secure than server-side code, leading to insufficient attention to client-side input validation, especially within custom event handlers.

### 5. Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate the risk of Client-Side Input Injection via Custom Events, Korge developers should implement the following strategies:

*   **5.1. Strict Input Validation in Event Handlers (Crucial):**

    *   **Validate All Event Data:**  Every event handler for custom events *must* rigorously validate all data fields within the received event object. This validation should occur *at the beginning* of the event handler logic.
    *   **Type Checking:** Ensure that data fields are of the expected data type (e.g., `itemId` is a String, `quantity` is an Int). Kotlin's type system can be leveraged here.
    *   **Format Validation:** If data fields have specific formats (e.g., string patterns, number ranges), enforce these formats. Regular expressions or custom validation functions can be used.
    *   **Value Range Validation:**  Check if numerical values are within acceptable ranges. For example, `quantity` should be a positive integer within a reasonable limit.
    *   **Whitelist Validation (Preferred for Strings):**  For string-based data like `itemId` or `resourceType`, consider using whitelists of allowed values. This is more secure than blacklisting and ensures only expected inputs are processed.
    *   **Example (Kotlin in Event Handler):**

        ```kotlin
        class SpecialAttackEvent(val attackType: String, val powerLevel: Int) : Event()

        // ... in your event handler ...
        stage.on(SpecialAttackEvent::class) { event ->
            val validatedAttackType = when (event.attackType) {
                "fire", "ice", "lightning" -> event.attackType // Valid attack types
                else -> {
                    console.warn("Invalid attackType: ${event.attackType}. Defaulting to 'fire'.")
                    "fire" // Default to a safe value or reject the event
                }
            }

            val validatedPowerLevel = event.powerLevel.coerceIn(1, 100) // Clamp powerLevel to a valid range

            // Now use validatedAttackType and validatedPowerLevel in your game logic
            println("Performing special attack: $validatedAttackType with power level: $validatedPowerLevel")
            // ... game logic ...
        }
        ```

*   **5.2. Secure Event Design:**

    *   **Minimize Event Data:**  Reduce the amount of data carried within events to only what is strictly necessary.  Less data means a smaller attack surface.
    *   **Consider Event Purpose:**  Carefully design the purpose and scope of each custom event. Avoid using events for actions that should be directly triggered by trusted application logic rather than potentially untrusted client-side input.
    *   **Immutable Event Data (If Possible):**  Design event classes to be immutable where feasible. This prevents accidental modification of event data after creation, ensuring data integrity within the event handling pipeline.

*   **5.3. Principle of Least Privilege (Event Handlers):**

    *   **Limit Handler Permissions:**  Event handlers should only have the minimum necessary permissions and access to application resources. Avoid granting overly broad capabilities that could be abused if event data is manipulated.
    *   **Decouple Sensitive Operations:**  If an event handler needs to perform sensitive operations, consider decoupling these operations into separate, more controlled functions or modules that have stricter access control. The event handler should only trigger these operations with validated and sanitized data.

*   **5.4. Rate Limiting (Event Processing - Primarily for DoS, but Helpful):**

    *   **Implement Event Rate Limits:** While primarily intended to prevent Denial of Service attacks, rate limiting the processing of certain types of events can also mitigate the impact of rapid-fire logic exploitation attempts. If an attacker tries to inject a large number of malicious events quickly, rate limiting can slow down or block these attempts.
    *   **Context-Aware Rate Limiting:**  Consider implementing context-aware rate limiting. For example, limit the rate of `SpecialAttackEvent` per player per second to prevent rapid-fire attacks, while allowing normal game events to proceed at a higher rate.

*   **5.5. Code Reviews and Security Testing:**

    *   **Regular Code Reviews:** Conduct regular code reviews, specifically focusing on event handlers and custom event usage.  Ensure that validation is implemented consistently and correctly across all relevant event handlers.
    *   **Security Testing:**  Incorporate security testing into the development process.  Specifically test for client-side input injection vulnerabilities by attempting to inject malicious event data and observe the application's behavior.  Automated testing tools can be helpful, but manual testing is also crucial for logic-based vulnerabilities.

By diligently implementing these mitigation strategies, Korge developers can significantly reduce the risk of Client-Side Input Injection via Custom Events and build more secure and robust applications.  Prioritizing input validation in event handlers is the most critical step in addressing this attack surface.
