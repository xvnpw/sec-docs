## Attack Tree Path: [Code Injection Vulnerabilities in Korge Core](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection_vulnerabilities_in_korge_core.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, format string bugs, or deserialization flaws within Korge's core Kotlin/Native/JS code.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   Identify input vectors in Korge (e.g., asset loading, configuration files, network handling if any).
    *   Craft malicious inputs to exploit identified vulnerabilities.
    *   Achieve arbitrary code execution on the target platform (JVM, JS, Native).
*   **Actionable Insights & Mitigations:**
    *   **Code Review & Static Analysis:** Conduct thorough code reviews and static analysis of Korge's codebase, focusing on input handling, memory management, and serialization/deserialization routines.
    *   **Fuzzing:** Implement fuzzing techniques to test Korge's robustness against malformed inputs, especially for asset loading and data parsing components.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Adhere to secure coding practices in Korge development, including input validation, output encoding, and memory safety.
    *   **Dependency Updates:** Regularly update Korge's dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities in underlying libraries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Korge's Platform Bindings/Interactions](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_korge's_platform_bindingsinteractions.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses in Korge's integration with platform-specific APIs (e.g., WebGL, Canvas, Native OS APIs).
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   Identify weaknesses in Korge's platform-specific binding code for WebGL/Canvas (JS/WASM) or Native OS APIs (Desktop/Mobile).
    *   Craft attacks to exploit platform API vulnerabilities via Korge's bindings (e.g., WebGL shader exploits, browser API bypasses).
    *   Gain access to platform resources or capabilities beyond intended application scope.
*   **Actionable Insights & Mitigations:**
    *   **Secure Binding Development:** Develop platform bindings with security in mind, carefully validating inputs and outputs when interacting with platform APIs.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of Bindings:** Conduct regular security audits of Korge's platform binding code, focusing on potential vulnerabilities in API interactions.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design Korge's platform bindings to operate with the least privilege necessary.
    *   **Browser Security Features:** Leverage browser security features (Content Security Policy, Subresource Integrity) in web-based Korge applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in External Libraries Used by Korge (Transitive Dependencies)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_external_libraries_used_by_korge__transitive_dependencies_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in external libraries (direct and transitive dependencies) used by Korge.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   Identify external libraries used by Korge (direct and transitive dependencies).
    *   Analyze dependencies for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) using vulnerability scanners.
    *   Identify code paths in Korge that utilize vulnerable functions in dependencies.
    *   Trigger vulnerable code paths in external libraries through Korge's usage.
*   **Actionable Insights & Mitigations:**
    *   **Dependency Management:** Implement robust dependency management practices for Korge development:
        *   Regular Dependency Scanning for vulnerabilities.
        *   Prompt Dependency Updates to patched versions.
        *   Dependency Minimization.
        *   Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation and maintenance.
    *   **Vulnerability Disclosure and Patching:** Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and patching process for Korge.
