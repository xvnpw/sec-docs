# Threat Model Analysis for korlibs/korge

## Threat: [Malicious Asset Injection](./threats/malicious_asset_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could replace legitimate game assets (images, audio, data files) with malicious ones. This could be done by compromising asset servers or intercepting asset downloads. The malicious assets could exploit vulnerabilities in Korge's asset loaders or the underlying platform's file handling, leading to code execution or other malicious actions when Korge attempts to load and process them.

**Impact:** Code execution on the user's machine, data corruption within the application, denial of service, potential cross-site scripting if assets are used in a web context and not properly sanitized.

**Korge Component Affected:** `korio.file`, `korio.net`, Asset loading functions (e.g., `resourcesVfs["path/to/asset"].readBitmap()`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Validate Asset Sources: Only load assets from trusted and controlled sources.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP): If running in a web environment, implement a strict CSP.
*   Asset Integrity Checks: Use checksums (e.g., SHA-256) or digital signatures to verify asset integrity.
*   Input Sanitization: Sanitize and validate any user input used to construct asset paths.

## Threat: [Input Injection through Game Commands or Text Fields](./threats/input_injection_through_game_commands_or_text_fields.md)

**Description:** If the Korge application includes in-game consoles, chat features, or any text input fields that process commands or data without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious commands or code. If `eval()` or similar functions are misused with Korge UI elements to process input, injection is highly likely.

**Impact:** Code execution within the application's context, manipulation of game logic, cheating, cross-site scripting (if input is rendered in a web context without sanitization).

**Korge Component Affected:** UI elements (`korge-ui`), Input handling system, Game logic processing user input.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Input Sanitization and Validation: Sanitize and validate all user input, especially text inputs.
*   Avoid `eval()` and Similar Functions: Never use `eval()` or similar functions to process user input as code.
*   Input Whitelisting: Define a whitelist of allowed characters, commands, or input formats.
*   Context-Aware Output Encoding: If user input is displayed in the UI, use context-aware output encoding.

## Threat: [Insecure Network Communication using Korge's Networking APIs](./threats/insecure_network_communication_using_korge's_networking_apis.md)

**Description:** If the Korge application uses Korge's networking features without proper security measures, network communication could be vulnerable. This includes transmitting sensitive data in plaintext, lacking authentication and authorization, or being susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Impact:** Data breaches (exposure of sensitive game data, user credentials), unauthorized access to game accounts, cheating, man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Korge Component Affected:** `korio.net` (if used), Networking code implemented by developers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use HTTPS/TLS: Always use HTTPS/TLS for all network communication.
*   Strong Authentication and Authorization: Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   Input Validation and Sanitization (Network Data): Validate and sanitize all data received from the network.
*   Secure Network Programming Practices: Follow secure network programming practices.

## Threat: [Client-Side Vulnerabilities in Network Message Handling](./threats/client-side_vulnerabilities_in_network_message_handling.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in how the Korge application parses and processes network messages received from servers could be exploited. This could include buffer overflows (in native contexts if Korge uses native libraries), or logic errors in message handling. Attackers could send specially crafted network messages to trigger these vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Code execution on the client's machine, denial of service, game logic manipulation, cheating.

**Korge Component Affected:** Network message parsing and handling code, potentially related to data serialization/deserialization.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thorough Input Validation (Network Data): Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data received from the network.
*   Safe Data Parsing Libraries: Use safe and well-vetted data parsing and serialization libraries.
*   Robust Error Handling: Implement robust error handling for network message processing.
*   Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits of network message handling code.

## Threat: [WebGL/Browser Specific Vulnerabilities](./threats/webglbrowser_specific_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** When targeting web platforms using WebGL/WASM, Korge applications may be affected by vulnerabilities in the underlying WebGL implementation or browser security features. While Korge abstracts some of these, underlying issues could still surface or be exposed through specific Korge functionalities or interactions with browser APIs.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), code execution (in browser sandbox context), denial of service, information disclosure.

**Korge Component Affected:** WebGL backend (`korge-webgl` or similar), Browser integration layer.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date: Keep Korge and browser dependencies up to date.
*   Web Security Best Practices: Follow general web security best practices.
*   Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks.
*   Regular Security Scanning: Use web security scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Korge Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_korge_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Korge relies on various libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could indirectly affect Korge applications. Attackers could exploit known vulnerabilities in these dependencies to compromise the application.

**Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability in the dependency, including code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, and other security breaches.

**Korge Component Affected:** Korge core and modules, indirectly through dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regular Dependency Updates: Regularly update Korge and all its dependencies.
*   Dependency Scanning: Use dependency scanning tools to identify and manage vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
*   Security Monitoring: Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for Korge and its dependencies.
*   Dependency Pinning/Locking: Use dependency pinning or locking mechanisms.
