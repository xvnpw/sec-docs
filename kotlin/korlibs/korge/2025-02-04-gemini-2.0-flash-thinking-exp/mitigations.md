# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for korlibs/korge

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate and Sanitize External Asset Sources (Korge Context)](./mitigation_strategies/validate_and_sanitize_external_asset_sources__korge_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Korge Asset Source Validation and Sanitization
*   **Description**:
    1.  **Korge Asset Loading Points:** Identify where your Korge application uses Korge's asset loading mechanisms (e.g., `resourcesVfs`, `loadBitmap`, `loadSound`, etc.) to load assets, especially from potentially external or user-provided paths.
    2.  **Korge Path Handling:** When using Korge's asset loading functions with user-provided paths, ensure you sanitize these paths *before* passing them to Korge's asset loading methods. Use Kotlin's `Path` API or similar to normalize paths and prevent traversal outside of intended asset directories within your Korge project structure.
    3.  **Korge File Extension Filtering:** Leverage Korge's built-in asset loading capabilities which often implicitly handle file extensions. However, if you are directly manipulating file paths before loading with Korge, explicitly check and whitelist allowed file extensions (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, `.ogg`, `.wav`) *before* Korge attempts to load them.
    4.  **Korge Web Asset Loading and CSP:** For Korge applications targeting web platforms, configure your web server to serve appropriate Content Security Policy (CSP) headers. This is crucial for web Korge applications to control the origins from which Korge can load assets, preventing loading from untrusted domains. Ensure your CSP directives are compatible with Korge's asset loading requirements for web builds.
    5.  **Korge Asset Bundling:** Consider using Korge's asset bundling features to package assets within your application. This reduces reliance on external asset sources at runtime and can simplify asset management and security.

*   **Threats Mitigated**:
    *   **Path Traversal via Korge Asset Loading (High Severity):** Attackers could potentially manipulate paths provided to Korge's asset loading functions to access and load arbitrary files from the application's file system or server, if not properly sanitized before Korge processes them.
    *   **Malicious File Injection via Korge Assets (Medium Severity):** If Korge is used to load assets from untrusted sources, malicious files disguised as valid assets could exploit vulnerabilities in Korge's asset processing or underlying libraries when Korge attempts to decode or render them.

*   **Impact**:
    *   **Path Traversal via Korge:** High risk reduction. By sanitizing paths before Korge uses them, you directly prevent path traversal attacks through Korge's asset loading.
    *   **Malicious File Injection via Korge Assets:** Medium risk reduction. Whitelisting file extensions and using CSP for web builds within the Korge context reduces the attack surface and limits the types of files Korge will process from potentially untrusted sources.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented within Korge asset loading.
    *   Korge's default asset loading from `resourcesVfs` inherently works with relative paths within the project's resources.
    *   Basic file extension filtering is implicitly done by Korge based on the expected asset types for loading functions (e.g., `loadBitmap` expects image formats).

*   **Missing Implementation**:
    *   Explicit sanitization of user-provided paths *before* they are used with Korge asset loading functions is missing.
    *   CSP configuration specifically tailored for Korge web application asset loading is missing.
    *   Documentation on best practices for secure asset loading within Korge applications is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Korge and its Dependencies (Korge Context)](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_korge_and_its_dependencies__korge_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Korge Engine and Korge Plugin Updates
*   **Description**:
    1.  **Korge Version Monitoring:** Regularly monitor the official Korge GitHub repository and release channels for new Korge engine versions and security advisories. Pay attention to announcements related to security patches or vulnerability fixes in Korge itself.
    2.  **Korge Plugin Updates:** If your Korge application uses Korge plugins (official or community-developed), monitor for updates and security advisories for these plugins as well. Vulnerabilities in plugins can also affect your Korge application.
    3.  **Kotlin and Korge Dependency Updates:**  Korge relies on specific versions of Kotlin and other libraries. When updating Korge, ensure you also update Kotlin and other relevant dependencies as recommended by the Korge update instructions. Keeping Kotlin and core dependencies aligned with Korge's requirements is crucial for stability and security.
    4.  **Korge Project Dependency Management:** Use Gradle or Maven (as recommended for Korge projects) to manage your Korge project's dependencies. This facilitates easier updating of Korge and its related libraries.
    5.  **Testing After Korge Updates:** After updating Korge or any Korge plugins, thoroughly test your Korge application to ensure compatibility and that the updates haven't introduced regressions or broken Korge-specific functionalities in your game.

*   **Threats Mitigated**:
    *   **Exploitation of Korge Engine Vulnerabilities (High Severity):**  Vulnerabilities directly within the Korge engine code itself could be exploited. Regularly updating Korge to the latest version with security patches mitigates this risk.
    *   **Exploitation of Korge Plugin Vulnerabilities (Medium to High Severity):** Vulnerabilities in Korge plugins can also be exploited. Keeping plugins updated is essential for plugin-related security.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Korge's Kotlin/Dependency Stack (Medium Severity):**  Korge relies on Kotlin and other libraries. Vulnerabilities in these underlying components, if exploited through Korge's usage, can be mitigated by keeping Korge and its recommended Kotlin/dependency versions updated.

*   **Impact**:
    *   **Korge Engine Vulnerabilities:** High risk reduction. Directly addresses vulnerabilities within the Korge engine itself.
    *   **Korge Plugin Vulnerabilities:** Medium to High risk reduction. Mitigates risks from plugin-related vulnerabilities.
    *   **Korge's Kotlin/Dependency Stack:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces risks from vulnerabilities in the underlying technology stack used by Korge.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented for Korge engine updates.
    *   Developers are generally aware of Korge updates and occasionally update the Korge engine version.
    *   Plugin updates are less consistently tracked and applied.

*   **Missing Implementation**:
    *   A formal schedule for monitoring and updating Korge engine and plugins is missing.
    *   A documented process for testing Korge-specific functionalities after engine/plugin updates is missing.
    *   Dependency management practices specifically focused on keeping Korge and its recommended Kotlin/dependency versions aligned are not formalized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Resource Limits for Asset Loading (Korge Context)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_resource_limits_for_asset_loading__korge_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Korge Asset Loading Resource Control
*   **Description**:
    1.  **Korge Asset Size Awareness:** Be mindful of the size of assets used in your Korge application, especially when loading assets dynamically or from external sources. Large assets can consume significant memory and processing power within the Korge engine.
    2.  **Korge Asynchronous Loading:** Utilize Korge's asynchronous asset loading capabilities (e.g., `async` blocks within asset loading functions) to prevent blocking the main Korge game loop during asset loading. This improves responsiveness and reduces the impact of potentially slow or resource-intensive asset loading operations.
    3.  **Korge Asset Streaming (If Applicable):** For very large assets (e.g., large audio files, long animations), explore if Korge or its related libraries offer asset streaming capabilities. Streaming can reduce memory footprint by loading assets in chunks as needed, rather than loading the entire asset into memory at once.
    4.  **Korge Memory Management:** Be aware of Korge's memory management and garbage collection behavior.  While Korge and Kotlin have garbage collection, excessive asset loading or creation of temporary objects within Korge game loops can still lead to performance issues or memory pressure. Optimize asset usage and object creation within your Korge game logic.
    5.  **Korge Error Handling for Asset Failures:** Implement robust error handling within your Korge asset loading code. If Korge fails to load an asset (e.g., due to size limits, corrupted files, network errors), handle the error gracefully and prevent the Korge application from crashing or entering an unstable state. Provide fallback assets or informative error messages within the Korge game UI.

*   **Threats Mitigated**:
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Korge Asset Overload (Medium to High Severity):** Attackers could attempt to overload the Korge application by providing excessively large or numerous assets that, when loaded by Korge, exhaust system resources (memory, CPU), leading to performance degradation or application crashes specifically within the Korge engine's context.

*   **Impact**:
    *   **Denial of Service via Korge Assets:** Medium to High risk reduction. By controlling asset sizes, using asynchronous loading, and implementing error handling within Korge asset loading, you reduce the application's vulnerability to DoS attacks targeting asset resources within the Korge engine.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented within Korge project structure.
    *   Asynchronous asset loading is used in some parts of the Korge application.
    *   Basic error handling for asset loading failures within Korge is present (e.g., displaying default error textures).

*   **Missing Implementation**:
    *   Explicit size limits for assets loaded by Korge are not enforced.
    *   Asset streaming techniques within Korge are not explored or implemented.
    *   Detailed memory usage monitoring specifically within the Korge application context is not implemented.
    *   More sophisticated error handling and fallback mechanisms for Korge asset loading failures are missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate and Sanitize Network Input (Korge Networking Context - if applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/validate_and_sanitize_network_input__korge_networking_context_-_if_applicable_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Korge Network Input Validation (If Using Korge Networking)
*   **Description**:
    1.  **Identify Korge Network Input Points:** If your Korge application utilizes any networking features provided directly by Korge or its related libraries (e.g., for multiplayer games, online leaderboards, or data fetching), identify all points where your Korge code receives data from network sources.
    2.  **Korge Data Deserialization:** If Korge provides specific mechanisms for network data serialization/deserialization, ensure you use these mechanisms securely. Be aware of potential vulnerabilities related to deserialization of untrusted data formats within the Korge context.
    3.  **Input Validation within Korge Game Logic:** Implement input validation within your Korge game logic to check any network data received before using it to update game state, UI, or trigger actions within your Korge game. Validate data types, ranges, and formats according to your expected game data structure.
    4.  **Korge UI Output Encoding:** If you display network data within your Korge game UI (e.g., player names, chat messages), ensure you use appropriate output encoding techniques to prevent injection vulnerabilities, especially if targeting web platforms where XSS could be a concern even within a Korge canvas context.

*   **Threats Mitigated**:
    *   **Injection Vulnerabilities via Korge Network Input (Medium to High Severity):** If Korge or related libraries are used for networking and network input is not properly validated within the Korge application, attackers could potentially inject malicious data that, when processed by Korge game logic or displayed in the Korge UI, leads to exploits or unexpected behavior within the game.

*   **Impact**:
    *   **Injection Vulnerabilities via Korge Networking:** Medium to High risk reduction. Input validation and output encoding within the Korge networking context are crucial to prevent injection attacks that could compromise the game's logic or UI.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented for score submission (assuming Korge is used for network requests).
    *   Basic validation is performed on score data before network submission, potentially within Korge-related code.

*   **Missing Implementation**:
    *   Comprehensive input validation and sanitization for all network input points within the Korge application are missing, especially if Korge is used for more complex networking features.
    *   Specific output encoding techniques for displaying network data within the Korge UI are not consistently applied.
    *   Documentation on secure networking practices within Korge applications is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Address Platform-Specific Vulnerabilities (Korge Multiplatform Context)](./mitigation_strategies/address_platform-specific_vulnerabilities__korge_multiplatform_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Korge Platform-Aware Security
*   **Description**:
    1.  **Korge Platform Build Targets:** Be aware of the different platforms Korge supports (JVM, JS, Native, Android, iOS) and how Korge applications are built and deployed on each platform. Understand the security implications specific to each Korge target platform.
    2.  **Korge Platform-Specific APIs:** If your Korge application uses platform-specific APIs through Korge's multiplatform abstractions or platform-specific code, be aware of the security considerations for those APIs on each target platform.
    3.  **Korge Web Build Security (JS):** For Korge web builds, pay close attention to web security best practices (CSP, SRI, etc.) as they directly apply to Korge applications running in web browsers. Configure your web server and Korge web build settings to enhance security in the web environment.
    4.  **Korge Mobile Build Security (Android/iOS):** For Korge Android and iOS builds, leverage platform-specific security features and best practices for mobile application development. This includes Android permissions, iOS App Transport Security (ATS), secure storage APIs, and code signing, ensuring these are appropriately configured for your Korge mobile applications.
    5.  **Korge Native Build Security (Desktop):** For Korge native desktop builds, consider operating system-level security features and sandboxing if applicable to enhance the security of your Korge desktop application.

*   **Threats Mitigated**:
    *   **Platform-Specific Exploits Affecting Korge Applications (Medium to High Severity):** Each platform Korge targets may have unique vulnerabilities that could be exploited in the context of a Korge application. Addressing platform-specific security considerations ensures that Korge applications are protected against platform-specific threats.

*   **Impact**:
    *   **Platform-Specific Exploits in Korge:** Medium to High risk reduction. By being platform-aware and implementing platform-specific security measures within the Korge context, you reduce the risk of platform-specific exploits affecting your Korge applications.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic platform considerations are taken into account during Korge development.
    *   Android permissions are configured in the Android manifest for Korge Android builds.
    *   Code signing is used for release builds across platforms where applicable.
