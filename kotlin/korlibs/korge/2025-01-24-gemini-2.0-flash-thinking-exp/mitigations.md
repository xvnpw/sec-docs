# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for korlibs/korge

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Korge and Dependency Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_korge_and_dependency_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Regularly check for new releases of Korge on the official GitHub repository ([https://github.com/korlibs/korge](https://github.com/korlibs/korge)) or relevant community channels.
    *   Step 2: Review Korge release notes and changelogs specifically for security-related updates, bug fixes, and announcements that might impact application security.
    *   Step 3: Update the Korge version in your project's build configuration (e.g., `build.gradle.kts` for Gradle projects) to the latest stable version. Follow Korge's documentation for the correct update procedure.
    *   Step 4:  Korge relies on Kotlin and other libraries. Ensure you are also updating Kotlin and any other dependencies managed alongside Korge in your project, as vulnerabilities in these can also affect your application. Use dependency management tools to identify and update outdated dependencies.
    *   Step 5: After updating Korge and its related dependencies, thoroughly test your Korge application. Pay special attention to areas that might be affected by engine updates, such as rendering, input handling, and resource loading, to ensure no regressions or new issues are introduced.
    *   Step 6: Establish a recurring schedule (e.g., monthly or quarterly) to check for and apply Korge updates to maintain a secure and up-to-date engine version.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerable Korge Engine (Medium to High Severity):** Bugs or security flaws within the Korge engine itself, if discovered and publicly known, can be exploited. Updates often include patches for these vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerable Dependencies of Korge (High Severity):** Korge depends on other libraries. Outdated versions of these dependencies can contain known security vulnerabilities that could be exploited through your Korge application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerable Korge Engine:** High Reduction - Directly addresses and eliminates known vulnerabilities within the Korge engine, reducing the risk of exploits targeting engine flaws.
    *   **Vulnerable Dependencies of Korge:** High Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities in libraries used by Korge, indirectly securing your application.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Hypothetical Project - Dependency update process exists, but focus is primarily on feature updates, not specifically driven by security concerns or a regular schedule for Korge version review.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Proactive and scheduled checks for Korge security updates are missing.
    *   No automated reminders or alerts for new Korge releases with security implications.
    *   Security impact is not a primary driver for Korge version updates, potentially lagging behind on important security patches.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Asset Loading in Korge](./mitigation_strategies/secure_asset_loading_in_korge.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: When loading assets in Korge (images, sounds, fonts, data files, etc.), be mindful of the source of these assets. Ideally, bundle assets within your application package to control their origin and integrity.
    *   Step 2: If loading assets from external sources (e.g., remote servers, user-provided URLs), treat these sources as potentially untrusted.
    *   Step 3: Implement validation checks on assets loaded from external sources. For example, verify file types, sizes, and potentially checksums or digital signatures if available, to ensure they are expected and haven't been tampered with.
    *   Step 4: Be cautious when using Korge APIs that load and process external data, especially if the data format is complex or could be manipulated to exploit vulnerabilities (e.g., image parsing vulnerabilities, font rendering issues).
    *   Step 5: If loading assets from remote servers, ensure these servers are secured (using HTTPS - see general network security practices) to prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks during asset download.
    *   Step 6: Avoid dynamically constructing asset paths based on user input without proper sanitization, as this could potentially lead to path traversal vulnerabilities if Korge's asset loading mechanisms are susceptible (though less likely in typical Korge usage, it's a general principle).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Asset Injection (Medium to High Severity):** If Korge loads and processes malicious assets (e.g., crafted images, fonts) from untrusted sources, it could potentially lead to vulnerabilities like Denial of Service (DoS), or in more severe cases, potentially code execution if Korge or underlying libraries have vulnerabilities in asset processing.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Tampered assets loaded from external sources could lead to unexpected game behavior, glitches, or exploits of game logic if the game relies on the integrity of these assets.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Asset Injection:** Medium Reduction - Reduces the risk of vulnerabilities arising from processing malicious assets by validating and controlling asset sources and types.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues:** Medium Reduction - Improves the reliability and predictability of game behavior by ensuring assets are from trusted sources and are not tampered with.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Hypothetical Project - Assets are mostly bundled, but some features might load user-provided images or data files without thorough validation. Remote asset loading is limited but might exist for specific features.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal validation process for externally loaded assets is missing.
    *   No checks for file types, sizes, or integrity of assets loaded from external sources.
    *   Lack of clear guidelines for developers on secure asset loading practices within the Korge project.
