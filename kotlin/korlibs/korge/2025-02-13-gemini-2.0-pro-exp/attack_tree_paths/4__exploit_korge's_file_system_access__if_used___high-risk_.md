# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Korge File System Access - Path Traversal

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the potential for path traversal vulnerabilities within a Korge application that utilizes the framework's file system access capabilities.  We aim to identify specific attack vectors, assess their feasibility and impact, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies to eliminate or significantly reduce the risk.  The ultimate goal is to ensure the application's file system interactions are secure and cannot be exploited to compromise the system.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following:

*   **Korge-Specific File System APIs:**  We will examine how Korge's `ResourcesVfs`, `LocalVfs`, and related classes handle file paths and access controls.  We'll pay close attention to any wrappers or abstractions Korge provides over the underlying platform's file system.
*   **User-Provided Input:**  Any scenario where the application accepts file paths, file names, or directory names from user input (e.g., through UI elements, network requests, configuration files) is within scope.
*   **External Data Sources:**  If the application reads file paths or related data from external sources (e.g., databases, APIs, downloaded files), these interactions are also in scope.
*   **Target Platforms:**  We will consider the implications of path traversal on different target platforms supported by Korge (JVM, JS, Native - specifically focusing on common OS differences like Windows, Linux, macOS).
*   **Exclusions:**  This analysis *does not* cover general file system security best practices unrelated to Korge (e.g., operating system file permissions, user account management).  It also excludes vulnerabilities stemming from third-party libraries *unless* those libraries are directly integrated with Korge's file system handling.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will meticulously examine the application's source code, focusing on all instances where Korge's file system APIs are used.  We'll look for patterns that indicate potential vulnerabilities, such as:
    *   Direct use of user-provided input in file paths.
    *   Lack of input sanitization or validation.
    *   Use of relative paths without proper anchoring.
    *   Assumptions about file path structure.

2.  **Static Analysis:**  We will utilize static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube, FindBugs/SpotBugs, potentially custom linters) to automatically identify potential path traversal vulnerabilities.  This will help catch issues that might be missed during manual code review.

3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing):**  We will employ fuzzing techniques to test the application's resilience to malicious input.  This involves providing a wide range of specially crafted file paths (including `../`, `..\`, absolute paths, encoded characters, long paths, etc.) to the application and observing its behavior.  We'll use tools like AFL, libFuzzer, or custom fuzzing scripts tailored to Korge's input mechanisms.

4.  **Exploit Development (Proof-of-Concept):**  For any identified vulnerabilities, we will attempt to develop a proof-of-concept exploit to demonstrate the practical impact.  This will involve crafting specific inputs that trigger the vulnerability and achieve a defined malicious outcome (e.g., reading a sensitive file, writing to an unauthorized location).

5.  **Mitigation Recommendation and Verification:**  Based on the findings, we will propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies.  After implementing these mitigations, we will re-run the analysis (steps 1-4) to verify their effectiveness.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 4.1: Path Traversal Vulnerabilities

**Attack Tree Path:** 4. Exploit Korge's File System Access (if used) -> 4.1 Path Traversal Vulnerabilities

**Description (as provided):** An attacker provides a malicious file path that attempts to access files or directories outside of the intended scope. This could allow the attacker to read, write, or delete arbitrary files on the system.

**Likelihood (as provided):** Medium

**Impact (as provided):** High

**Effort (as provided):** Low

**Skill Level (as provided):** Intermediate

**Detection Difficulty (as provided):** Medium

**Mitigation (as provided):**
*   Sanitize all file paths provided by the user or from external sources.
*   Use a whitelist of allowed directories and file names.
*   Avoid using relative paths; use absolute paths based on a secure root directory.
*   Validate that the resulting file path is within the intended directory.

### 2.1 Korge-Specific Considerations

Korge provides a virtual file system (VFS) abstraction (`ResourcesVfs`, `LocalVfs`, etc.) that aims to simplify file access across different platforms.  However, this abstraction can also introduce subtle security risks if not used carefully.

*   **`ResourcesVfs`:**  This is generally safer, as it's designed for read-only access to resources embedded within the application.  However, if the application dynamically generates or modifies the contents of `ResourcesVfs` based on user input, path traversal could still be possible.
*   **`LocalVfs`:**  This provides direct access to the underlying file system.  This is where the greatest risk of path traversal lies, especially if user input is used to construct file paths.
*   **Platform-Specific Behavior:**  The behavior of `LocalVfs` will depend on the target platform.  For example:
    *   **JVM:**  Relies on Java's file system APIs.  Path traversal is well-understood on the JVM.
    *   **JS:**  Operates within the browser's sandbox.  Direct file system access is typically restricted, but vulnerabilities in the browser or Korge's JS implementation could still allow for limited file access or other exploits.
    *   **Native:**  Provides the most direct access to the file system, making it the most vulnerable target.  Different operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS) have different path separators and security models.

### 2.2 Attack Scenarios

Here are some specific attack scenarios, considering Korge's VFS:

1.  **Direct User Input:**
    *   **Scenario:**  A Korge game allows users to load custom levels from files.  The user provides a file path through a text input field, which is directly passed to `LocalVfs["/path/to/levels/" + userInput].readBytes()`.
    *   **Exploit:**  The user enters `../../../../etc/passwd` (on Linux) or `..\..\..\Windows\System32\config\SAM` (on Windows) to read sensitive system files.
    *   **Korge-Specific:**  The vulnerability lies in the direct concatenation of user input with the base path, without any sanitization or validation.

2.  **Indirect User Input (Configuration File):**
    *   **Scenario:**  The application reads a configuration file that specifies a directory for storing user data.  The configuration file is loaded using `ResourcesVfs["config.txt"].readString()`, and the directory path is extracted and used with `LocalVfs`.
    *   **Exploit:**  An attacker modifies the configuration file (if they have write access to it or can influence its contents) to include a path traversal sequence, pointing to a sensitive directory.
    *   **Korge-Specific:**  Even though `ResourcesVfs` is used initially, the extracted path is later used with `LocalVfs`, creating the vulnerability.

3.  **Encoded Path Traversal:**
    *   **Scenario:**  The application attempts to sanitize user input by replacing `../` with an empty string.
    *   **Exploit:**  The attacker uses URL encoding (`%2E%2E%2F`) or double URL encoding (`%252E%252E%252F`) to bypass the simple replacement.  They might also use null bytes (`%00`) or other special characters.
    *   **Korge-Specific:**  Korge's VFS might not handle encoded characters correctly, especially if it relies on the underlying platform's file system APIs without proper decoding and validation.

4.  **Symlink Attacks (Native Targets):**
    *   **Scenario:**  The application writes files to a specific directory.
    *   **Exploit:**  An attacker creates a symbolic link (symlink) within the allowed directory that points to a sensitive location outside the directory.  When the application writes to the symlink, it effectively writes to the target of the symlink.
    *   **Korge-Specific:**  Korge's `LocalVfs` on native targets needs to handle symlinks securely, potentially by checking for and disallowing them or by resolving them to their canonical paths before performing any file operations.

### 2.3 Detailed Mitigation Strategies

The provided mitigations are a good starting point, but we need to expand on them and make them Korge-specific:

1.  **Input Sanitization (Robust):**
    *   **Do NOT simply replace `../`:**  This is easily bypassed.
    *   **Use a whitelist of allowed characters:**  Only allow alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens (or a similar restricted set) in file names.  Reject any input containing other characters.
    *   **Normalize the path:**  Use Korge's `VfsFile.normalizedPath` or a similar function to resolve relative paths and remove redundant separators.  This helps prevent simple `../` attacks.
    *   **Decode URL encoding and other encodings:**  Before validating the path, decode any URL encoding or other encodings that might be present.  Use a robust decoding library, not a simple string replacement.
    *   **Consider using a dedicated path sanitization library:**  Libraries like OWASP's ESAPI provide robust path canonicalization and validation functions.

2.  **Whitelist of Allowed Directories/Files (Strict):**
    *   **Maintain a list of allowed directories and/or file names:**  This is the most secure approach.  Any file access request that doesn't match the whitelist is rejected.
    *   **Use enums or constants for allowed paths:**  Avoid hardcoding paths directly in the code.  Use enums or constants to make it easier to manage and audit the allowed paths.

3.  **Absolute Paths and Secure Root Directory (Anchoring):**
    *   **Define a secure base directory:**  This should be a directory that the application has exclusive control over and that is not accessible to other users or processes.
    *   **Construct absolute paths:**  Always construct absolute paths by combining the secure base directory with the sanitized file name or relative path (after normalization).  Never rely on relative paths alone.
    *   **Use Korge's `VfsFile.absolutePath`:**  This can help ensure that you're working with absolute paths.

4.  **Path Validation (Canonicalization):**
    *   **After constructing the absolute path, validate it:**  Ensure that the resulting path is still within the intended directory.  You can do this by comparing the canonical path of the requested file with the canonical path of the allowed directory.
    *   **Use `VfsFile.canonicalPath` (with caution):**  This resolves symbolic links and returns the "real" path of the file.  Be aware that resolving symlinks can have performance implications and might introduce other security risks if not handled carefully.  It's generally safer to *disallow* symlinks altogether if possible.
    *   **Check for path prefixes:** A simpler (and often safer) alternative to canonicalization is to check if the absolute path *starts with* the allowed base directory path.

5.  **Korge-Specific API Usage:**
    *   **Prefer `ResourcesVfs` for read-only resources:**  Whenever possible, use `ResourcesVfs` for accessing files that are embedded within the application and don't need to be modified.
    *   **Use `LocalVfs` with extreme caution:**  Only use `LocalVfs` when absolutely necessary, and always apply the mitigation strategies described above.
    *   **Avoid dynamic VFS creation based on user input:**  If you need to create a VFS dynamically, ensure that the base path for the VFS is not derived from user input.

6. **Platform specific mitigations:**
    * **JVM:** Use Java's `java.nio.file.Paths` and `java.nio.file.Files` for more secure file handling. These APIs provide better protection against path traversal than older `java.io.File` APIs.
    * **JS:** Be aware of the limitations of the browser's sandbox. Avoid any file system access if possible. If you must interact with files, use the browser's File API and carefully validate any user-provided file names or data.
    * **Native:** Be extremely careful with `LocalVfs` on native targets. Consider using platform-specific security mechanisms, such as chroot jails (on Linux) or AppArmor/SELinux, to further restrict the application's file system access.

### 2.4 Example (Illustrative - Kotlin/Korge)

```kotlin
import com.soywiz.korge.view.*
import com.soywiz.korio.file.VfsFile
import com.soywiz.korio.file.std.localVfs

suspend fun Container.addLoadLevelButton() {
    val allowedBaseDir = localVfs("/path/to/safe/levels/") // Secure base directory

    // ... (UI elements for file input) ...

    val userInputField = textInput() // Assume this is a text input field

    onClick {
        val userInput = userInputField.text
        val sanitizedFilename = sanitizeFilename(userInput) // Implement robust sanitization

        if (sanitizedFilename != null) {
            val absoluteFilePath = allowedBaseDir[sanitizedFilename].absolutePath

            // Check if the absolute path starts with the allowed base directory
            if (absoluteFilePath.startsWith(allowedBaseDir.absolutePath)) {
                try {
                    val levelData = allowedBaseDir[sanitizedFilename].readBytes()
                    // ... (Load and process level data) ...
                } catch (e: Exception) {
                    // Handle file access errors (e.g., file not found)
                    println("Error loading level: ${e.message}")
                }
            } else {
                println("Invalid file path: $userInput") // Reject the request
            }
        } else {
            println("Invalid file name: $userInput") // Reject the request
        }
    }
}

// Robust filename sanitization function
fun sanitizeFilename(filename: String): String? {
    // 1. Whitelist allowed characters
    val allowedChars = Regex("[a-zA-Z0-9_\\-.]+")
    if (!allowedChars.matches(filename)) {
        return null // Reject if invalid characters are present
    }

    // 2. Normalize the path (remove redundant separators, resolve "..")
    val normalizedPath = VfsFile(filename).normalizedPath

    // 3. Check for empty or excessively long filenames
    if (normalizedPath.isEmpty() || normalizedPath.length > 255) {
        return null
    }
    // 4. Decode URL
    val decodedPath = try {
        java.net.URLDecoder.decode(normalizedPath, "UTF-8")
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        return null // Reject on decoding errors
    }

    return decodedPath
}

```

### 2.5 Verification

After implementing the mitigations, it's crucial to re-test the application using the methodology described in section 1.3.  This includes:

*   **Code Review:**  Ensure the mitigations are correctly implemented and cover all relevant code paths.
*   **Static Analysis:**  Re-run static analysis tools to confirm that no new vulnerabilities are introduced.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing):**  Repeat the fuzzing tests with a wide range of malicious inputs, including variations of previously successful exploits.
*   **Exploit Development:**  Attempt to develop new exploits based on the updated code.  If any exploits are successful, the mitigations need to be revised and re-tested.
