Okay, let's break down this "Asset Spoofing (Fonts)" threat for a KorGE application with a detailed analysis.

## Deep Analysis: Asset Spoofing (Fonts) - Exploitable Renderer

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

*   **Objective:**  To thoroughly understand the "Asset Replacement - Font (Exploitable Renderer)" threat, identify specific attack vectors, assess the effectiveness of proposed mitigations, and propose additional security measures.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to minimize the risk of this threat.

*   **Scope:** This analysis focuses specifically on the scenario where an attacker replaces legitimate font files used by a KorGE application with malicious ones.  We will consider:
    *   The entire font loading and rendering pipeline within KorGE.
    *   The interaction with underlying platform-specific font rendering libraries.
    *   The attacker's capabilities and potential attack methods.
    *   The effectiveness of the provided mitigation strategies.
    *   The feasibility and impact of additional security measures.

*   **Methodology:**
    1.  **Threat Modeling Review:**  Re-examine the initial threat description and its assumptions.
    2.  **Code Analysis (KorGE & Potential Dependencies):**  Analyze relevant parts of the KorGE codebase (`korlibs.io.file.VfsFile`, `korlibs.image.font.*`) to understand how fonts are loaded, parsed, and rendered.  Identify potential vulnerabilities and points of interaction with platform-specific libraries.  This will involve looking at the source code on GitHub.
    3.  **Vulnerability Research:** Research known vulnerabilities in font rendering engines (e.g., FreeType, HarfBuzz, and platform-specific libraries like DirectWrite on Windows, Core Text on macOS, and the Android font rendering system).  This includes searching CVE databases and security advisories.
    4.  **Attack Vector Identification:**  Define specific, plausible attack scenarios based on the code analysis and vulnerability research.
    5.  **Mitigation Analysis:** Evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies (HTTPS, checksums, CSP, limited font set, updates, sandboxing, system fonts) against the identified attack vectors.
    6.  **Recommendation Generation:**  Provide concrete, prioritized recommendations for developers and users to mitigate the threat, including any necessary code changes, configuration adjustments, or operational procedures.

### 2. Threat Modeling Review

The initial threat description is well-defined.  Key points to reiterate:

*   **Asset:** Font files.
*   **Threat:** Replacement with malicious files.
*   **Vulnerability:** Exploitable code in the font rendering process (KorGE or underlying libraries).
*   **Impact:** Client-side code execution, system compromise (High severity).
*   **Affected Components:**  `VfsFile`, `korlibs.image.font.*`, and platform-specific libraries.

The core assumption is that vulnerabilities *exist* in the font rendering pipeline.  This is a reasonable assumption given the history of font rendering vulnerabilities.

### 3. Code Analysis (KorGE & Potential Dependencies)

This section requires examining the KorGE source code.  Here's a breakdown of what we'd look for, and some initial observations based on a preliminary review of the KorGE repository:

*   **`korlibs.io.file.VfsFile`:** This class handles virtual file system access.  We need to understand:
    *   How `VfsFile` retrieves font files (local, embedded, remote).
    *   Whether it performs any validation *before* passing the font data to the rendering engine.  **Crucially, does it check file integrity (e.g., checksums) or enforce any security policies?**  Initial observation:  `VfsFile` itself doesn't appear to have built-in checksumming or signature verification.  This is a potential weakness.  It relies on the underlying VFS implementation.
    *   How it interacts with different VFS implementations (e.g., `LocalVfs`, `UrlVfs`, `ResourcesVfs`).  Each implementation might have different security implications.  For example, `UrlVfs` should ideally use HTTPS.

*   **`korlibs.image.font.*`:** This package contains classes for font loading and rendering.  Key areas:
    *   **Font Parsing:**  How does KorGE parse font file formats (TTF, OTF, etc.)?  Does it use its own parser, or does it delegate entirely to platform-specific libraries?  KorGE appears to use `korlibs-ext-korge-swf` and `korlibs-image-font-opentype` for font parsing. This means it has its own parsing logic, which *could* introduce vulnerabilities, but also allows for more control over security checks.
    *   **Interaction with Platform Libraries:**  At what point does KorGE hand off font data to the underlying system (e.g., FreeType, DirectWrite)?  Are there any security checks or sanitization steps performed before this handoff?  This is a critical area for potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Bitmap Font Handling:**  If KorGE supports bitmap fonts, these might have different vulnerability profiles than vector fonts.

*   **Dependencies:**
    *   **`korlibs-ext-korge-swf` and `korlibs-image-font-opentype`:** These are KorGE's own libraries for handling SWF and OpenType fonts, respectively.  They need to be audited for vulnerabilities.
    *   **Platform-Specific Libraries:**  Identify the specific font rendering libraries used on each target platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, Web).  These are often system libraries, and their security is the responsibility of the OS vendor.

### 4. Vulnerability Research

This is an ongoing process, but here are some general areas and examples:

*   **FreeType:**  Numerous CVEs exist for FreeType (e.g., CVE-2022-27404, CVE-2022-27405, CVE-2022-27406).  These often involve buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues.
*   **HarfBuzz:**  Similar to FreeType, HarfBuzz has had its share of vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2020-27763).
*   **DirectWrite (Windows):**  Windows font rendering has been a target for attackers (e.g., CVE-2021-1647, a zero-day exploited in the wild).
*   **Core Text (macOS):**  Apple regularly patches font rendering vulnerabilities in macOS.
*   **Android Font Rendering:**  Android's font rendering system has also had vulnerabilities.

The key takeaway is that font rendering is a complex process, and vulnerabilities are frequently discovered.  Staying up-to-date is paramount.

### 5. Attack Vector Identification

Based on the above, here are some plausible attack vectors:

*   **Attack Vector 1: Remote Font Loading (Exploitable FreeType/HarfBuzz):**
    1.  Attacker hosts a malicious font file on a website.
    2.  The KorGE application loads the font file via `UrlVfs` (hopefully over HTTPS).
    3.  KorGE uses `korlibs-image-font-opentype` to parse the font.
    4.  KorGE (likely via a platform-specific backend) uses FreeType or HarfBuzz to render the font.
    5.  The malicious font file exploits a vulnerability in FreeType/HarfBuzz, leading to code execution.

*   **Attack Vector 2: Local Font Replacement (Exploitable DirectWrite):**
    1.  Attacker gains access to the user's system (e.g., through phishing or another exploit).
    2.  Attacker replaces a legitimate font file used by the KorGE application with a malicious one.
    3.  The KorGE application loads the malicious font file via `LocalVfs`.
    4.  KorGE uses `korlibs-image-font-opentype` to parse the font.
    5.  KorGE uses DirectWrite (on Windows) to render the font.
    6.  The malicious font file exploits a vulnerability in DirectWrite, leading to code execution.

*   **Attack Vector 3: Embedded Font Exploitation (Exploitable `korlibs-image-font-opentype`):**
    1.  Attacker crafts a malicious font file.
    2.  The malicious font file is embedded within the KorGE application (e.g., as a resource).
    3.  The KorGE application loads the font file via `ResourcesVfs`.
    4.  KorGE uses `korlibs-image-font-opentype` to parse the font.  *This is the key difference: the vulnerability is in KorGE's own parsing code.*
    5.  The malicious font file exploits a vulnerability in `korlibs-image-font-opentype`, leading to code execution.

### 6. Mitigation Analysis

Let's evaluate the proposed mitigations:

*   **HTTPS for downloads:**  Effective against Attack Vector 1 (remote loading) *if* the attacker cannot compromise the HTTPS connection (e.g., through a man-in-the-middle attack).  Does not protect against Attack Vectors 2 or 3.

*   **Checksum verification:**  **Crucially important.**  If implemented correctly, this can prevent *all* the attack vectors.  The KorGE application should:
    *   Have a list of known-good checksums (hashes) for all font files it uses.
    *   Calculate the checksum of the font file *after* loading it (regardless of the source) and *before* passing it to the rendering engine.
    *   Compare the calculated checksum to the known-good checksum.  If they don't match, *reject the font file*.
    *   **This is the single most important mitigation.**

*   **CSP (Content Security Policy):**  Primarily useful for web-based KorGE applications.  A strict CSP can limit the sources from which fonts can be loaded, mitigating Attack Vector 1.  It's less effective against local attacks (Attack Vector 2) or vulnerabilities in embedded fonts (Attack Vector 3).

*   **Use a *very* limited set of well-vetted fonts:**  Reduces the attack surface.  Fewer fonts mean fewer potential vulnerabilities.  "Well-vetted" implies using fonts from reputable sources and ideally those that are actively maintained and patched.

*   **Keep font rendering libraries up-to-date:**  Essential for mitigating vulnerabilities in platform-specific libraries (FreeType, DirectWrite, etc.).  This is primarily the user's responsibility (through OS updates), but the developer should emphasize the importance of updates.  For KorGE's own libraries (`korlibs-ext-korge-swf`, `korlibs-image-font-opentype`), the developer is responsible for updates.

*   **Sandboxing the font rendering process:**  If feasible, this is a strong mitigation.  It isolates the font rendering code, limiting the damage an attacker can do even if they exploit a vulnerability.  This is likely complex to implement, especially in a cross-platform way.

*   **Explore using system-provided fonts:**  This can shift the responsibility for patching to the OS vendor.  However, it might limit the developer's control over the appearance of the application, and system fonts can still be vulnerable.

### 7. Recommendations

Here are prioritized recommendations:

1.  **Implement Robust Checksum Verification (Highest Priority):**
    *   **Developer:**  Modify `VfsFile` (or the relevant VFS implementations) to calculate and verify checksums for all loaded font files.  Maintain a list of known-good checksums (e.g., in a configuration file or embedded resource).  *Reject any font file that fails the checksum verification.*  Provide clear error messages and logging when a checksum mismatch occurs.  Consider using a strong hashing algorithm like SHA-256.
    *   **User:**  None (this is a developer-side mitigation).

2.  **Enforce HTTPS for Remote Font Loading (High Priority):**
    *   **Developer:**  Ensure that `UrlVfs` *always* uses HTTPS for font downloads.  Reject any attempts to load fonts over HTTP.
    *   **User:**  If manually configuring font sources, always use HTTPS URLs.

3.  **Regularly Update Dependencies (High Priority):**
    *   **Developer:**  Keep `korlibs-ext-korge-swf` and `korlibs-image-font-opentype` up-to-date.  Monitor for security advisories related to these libraries.  Establish a process for quickly releasing updates to address vulnerabilities.
    *   **User:**  Keep your operating system and all installed software (including the KorGE application) up-to-date.  Enable automatic updates if possible.

4.  **Audit `korlibs-image-font-opentype` (High Priority):**
    *   **Developer:** Conduct a thorough security audit of `korlibs-image-font-opentype`, focusing on potential memory corruption vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, use-after-free, etc.).  Consider using static analysis tools and fuzzing to identify vulnerabilities.

5.  **Minimize Font Usage (Medium Priority):**
    *   **Developer:**  Use the fewest fonts necessary to achieve the desired application design.  Avoid using obscure or rarely used fonts.

6.  **Consider Sandboxing (Medium Priority):**
    *   **Developer:**  Explore the feasibility of sandboxing the font rendering process.  This might involve using platform-specific sandboxing APIs or techniques.  Weigh the security benefits against the complexity of implementation.

7.  **User Education (Medium Priority):**
    *   **Developer:**  Include clear warnings in the application documentation about the risks of using untrusted fonts.  Advise users to download the application only from trusted sources.
    *   **User:**  Only download the KorGE application from official sources (e.g., the developer's website, a trusted app store).  Be wary of any application that asks you to install custom fonts.

8. **CSP for Web (if applicable):**
    * **Developer:** If the application is web-based, implement a strict Content Security Policy that restricts font sources to trusted domains.

This deep analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the "Asset Spoofing (Fonts)" threat and offers actionable recommendations to mitigate the risk. The most critical mitigation is robust checksum verification, which should be implemented immediately. Regular updates and security audits are also essential.
