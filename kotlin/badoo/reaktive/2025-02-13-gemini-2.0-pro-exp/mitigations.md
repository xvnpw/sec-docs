# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for badoo/reaktive

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Data Handling in Operators](./mitigation_strategies/careful_data_handling_in_operators.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Create a list of all data considered sensitive.
2.  **Operator Review:** For *every* Reaktive operator in a reactive chain (`map`, `filter`, `flatMap`, `combineLatest`, `switchMap`, etc.):
    *   **Input Check:** Determine if the operator receives sensitive data.
    *   **Transformation:** If sensitive data is present:
        *   **Redaction:** If the full data isn't needed downstream, replace sensitive parts with placeholders *within the operator* (e.g., `creditCardNumber.map { "************${it.takeLast(4)}" }`).
        *   **Transformation:** Encrypt or hash sensitive data *before* it continues (e.g., `apiKey.map { encrypt(it) }`).
        *   **Filtering:** Use `filter` or a custom operator to *remove* the data if it's not needed downstream.
        *   **Scoping:** Use operators like `take`, `takeUntil`, or custom operators to limit the lifetime and scope of Observables containing sensitive data. Ensure they are disposed of properly.
    *   **Output Check:** Verify the operator's output doesn't expose sensitive data.
3.  **Dedicated Streams:** Create separate `Observable`, `Flow`, `Single`, `Maybe`, or `Completable` streams for sensitive data, limiting subscribers and lifespans.
4.  **`doOnXXX` Caution:** In `doOnNext`, `doOnError`, `doOnComplete`, etc., *never* log sensitive data. Use conditional compilation (`#if DEBUG`) for debugging.
5.  **Sensitive Data Wrapper:** Consider a `SensitiveData<T>` wrapper to enforce controlled access.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unintentional Exposure of Sensitive Data Through Observables:** (Severity: **High**) - Prevents leaks via logs, UI, or external systems.
*   **Logic Errors Due to Complex Reactive Chains:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Simplifies data flow, reducing accidental exposure.

**Impact:**
*   **Unintentional Exposure:** Risk reduction: **High** (comprehensive implementation).
*   **Logic Errors:** Risk reduction: **Medium**.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Redaction of credit card numbers in `PaymentService` (`processPayment` observable).
*   `#if DEBUG` in `NetworkService` to prevent logging API keys in release builds.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No `SensitiveData<T>` wrapper.
*   Inconsistent redaction/transformation of user profile data in `UserProfileViewModel` Observables.
*   Lack of comprehensive review of *all* operators.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Proper Backpressure Handling](./mitigation_strategies/implement_proper_backpressure_handling.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify High-Volume Sources:** Determine which `Observable`s or `Flow`s produce data rapidly or in bursts.
2.  **Choose Backpressure Strategy:** For each high-volume source:
    *   **`onBackpressureBuffer`:** If data loss is unacceptable, but buffering is okay. *Carefully* consider buffer size. Monitor memory.
    *   **`onBackpressureDrop`:** If losing some data is acceptable.
    *   **`onBackpressureLatest`:** If only the most recent value matters.
    *   **`bouncy flow`:** If applicable, use it.
3.  **Apply Operator:** Add the operator *directly* after the source (e.g., `userInput.onBackpressureDrop()...`).
4.  **Monitor and Tune:** Observe behavior under load. Adjust as needed.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Uncontrolled Backpressure or Resource Exhaustion:** (Severity: **High**) - Prevents resource exhaustion.

**Impact:**
*   **DoS:** Risk reduction: **High** (applied to all relevant sources).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `onBackpressureDrop` on `locationUpdates` in `LocationService`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No backpressure on `searchQuery` in `SearchViewModel`.
*   No backpressure on Observables consuming network data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Timeouts with Reaktive's `timeout` Operator](./mitigation_strategies/timeouts_with_reaktive's__timeout__operator.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify External Interactions:** List all interactions with external systems.
2.  **Apply `timeout`:** Use Reaktive's `timeout` operator on `Observable`s, `Flow`s, `Single`s, and `Maybe`s that interact with external systems.  Set reasonable timeout durations.
3.  **Handle Timeout Errors:** Use `onErrorReturn`, `onErrorResumeNext`, or similar operators to handle timeout errors gracefully (retry, error message, etc.).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Uncontrolled Backpressure or Resource Exhaustion:** (Severity: **High**) - Prevents hangs.
*   **Logic Errors Due to Complex Reactive Chains:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Prevents unexpected behavior.

**Impact:**
*   **DoS:** Risk reduction: **High**.
*   **Logic Errors:** Risk reduction: **Medium**.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `timeout` used on network requests in `NetworkService`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No timeouts on database operations that might take a long time.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Simplify Reactive Chains and Use Descriptive Naming](./mitigation_strategies/simplify_reactive_chains_and_use_descriptive_naming.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Modularize:** Break down large chains into smaller, well-defined functions. Each function should have a single responsibility.
2.  **Naming:** Use descriptive names for `Observable`s, `Subscriber`s, and operators (e.g., `userLoginAttempts`, `filteredProducts`, `encryptPassword`). This applies *directly* to how you name your Reaktive components.
3. **Use helper functions:** Extract complex logic from operators into separate, well-named functions.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Logic Errors Due to Complex Reactive Chains:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Reduces errors and makes them easier to find.
*   **Unintentional Exposure of Sensitive Data:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Easier to track data flow.
*   **Concurrency Issues and Race Conditions:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Well-structured code is less prone to concurrency bugs.

**Impact:**
*   **Logic Errors:** Risk reduction: **High**.
*   **Unintentional Exposure:** Risk reduction: **Medium**.
*   **Concurrency Issues:** Risk reduction: **Medium**.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Descriptive naming is generally used.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Some overly complex chains in `OrderProcessingService` could be simplified.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Manage Concurrency with Reaktive Schedulers](./mitigation_strategies/manage_concurrency_with_reaktive_schedulers.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Scheduler Awareness:** Understand Reaktive's Schedulers (`computation`, `io`, `single`, `trampoline`). Use `subscribeOn` and `observeOn` *only* when necessary. Avoid unnecessary thread switching.
2.  **Immutability:** Prefer immutable data within operators.
3.  **Minimize Shared State:** If shared mutable state is necessary:
    *   **Synchronization:** Use locks or atomic variables.
    *   **Thread-Safe Data Structures:** Use `AtomicReference`, etc.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Concurrency Issues and Race Conditions:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Prevents data corruption and unpredictable behavior.

**Impact:**
*   **Concurrency Issues:** Risk reduction: **High**.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Generally good adherence to immutability.
*   `Schedulers.IO` for network operations.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Shared mutable state in `SessionManager` without proper synchronization.
