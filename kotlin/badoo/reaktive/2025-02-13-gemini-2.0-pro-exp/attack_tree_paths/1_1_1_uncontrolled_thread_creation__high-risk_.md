# Deep Analysis: Uncontrolled Thread Creation in Reaktive Applications

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly investigate the "Uncontrolled Thread Creation" attack vector (attack tree path 1.1.1) within applications built using the Badoo Reaktive library.  The primary goal is to understand how an attacker could exploit Reaktive's concurrency features to trigger excessive thread creation, leading to denial-of-service (DoS) or other detrimental effects.  We will identify specific vulnerable patterns, propose mitigation strategies, and provide actionable recommendations for the development team.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on:

*   **Reaktive Library Usage:**  How the application utilizes Reaktive's operators, schedulers, and concurrency mechanisms (e.g., `subscribeOn`, `observeOn`, `flatMap`, `parallel`, `threadLocal`, etc.).  We are *not* analyzing general thread creation outside the context of Reaktive.
*   **Application Logic:**  The specific application code that interacts with Reaktive, particularly areas where user input or external data influences the execution of reactive streams.
*   **Resource Constraints:**  The target environment's limitations regarding thread creation, memory allocation, and CPU resources.  This includes understanding the underlying JVM's thread pool configuration and any containerization limits (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):**  The primary impact we are concerned with is DoS, where the application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to thread exhaustion.  We will also briefly consider other potential impacts, such as resource leakage.

This analysis *excludes*:

*   **General Kotlin Coroutines:** While Reaktive can interoperate with coroutines, this analysis focuses on Reaktive's own concurrency model.  We assume that if coroutines are used, they are managed correctly and are not the *primary* source of uncontrolled thread creation.
*   **Other Attack Vectors:**  We are solely focused on the "Uncontrolled Thread Creation" path.  Other vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting, are out of scope.
*   **Third-Party Libraries (Except Reaktive):**  We assume that other libraries used by the application are not directly contributing to uncontrolled thread creation within the Reaktive context.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review:**  A thorough review of the application's codebase, focusing on:
    *   Identification of all uses of Reaktive operators and schedulers.
    *   Analysis of how user input or external data flows into and influences reactive streams.
    *   Detection of potentially problematic patterns (detailed in the "Analysis" section below).
    *   Examination of error handling and resource cleanup within reactive streams.

2.  **Static Analysis:**  Use of static analysis tools (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA's built-in inspections, Detekt, or specialized security analysis tools) to identify potential vulnerabilities related to thread creation and resource management.

3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**
    *   **Fuzz Testing:**  Crafting malicious or unexpected inputs to trigger edge cases in the reactive streams and observe thread creation behavior.
    *   **Load Testing:**  Simulating high load scenarios to determine the application's resilience to thread exhaustion.  This will involve monitoring thread counts, CPU usage, and memory consumption.
    *   **Profiling:**  Using JVM profiling tools (e.g., JProfiler, VisualVM, YourKit) to identify thread creation hotspots and analyze thread lifetimes.

4.  **Threat Modeling:**  Refining the understanding of the attacker's capabilities and motivations, and how they might exploit the identified vulnerabilities.

5.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  Developing specific, actionable recommendations to address the identified vulnerabilities and prevent uncontrolled thread creation.

6.  **Documentation:**  Clearly documenting the findings, analysis, and recommendations in a format accessible to the development team.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.1: Uncontrolled Thread Creation

**4.1. Potential Vulnerable Patterns in Reaktive:**

Several patterns within Reaktive usage can lead to uncontrolled thread creation if not handled carefully:

*   **Unbounded `flatMap` with `subscribeOn`:**  The `flatMap` operator can create a new inner stream for each element of the outer stream.  If the outer stream is unbounded (e.g., processing an infinite stream of user inputs) *and* each inner stream uses `subscribeOn` with a new scheduler (or a scheduler that creates new threads on demand), this can lead to unbounded thread creation.

    ```kotlin
    // DANGEROUS:  If 'userInputSource' is unbounded, this can create unlimited threads.
    userInputSource
        .flatMap { input ->
            processInput(input)
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io) // Or Schedulers.newThread()
        }
        .subscribe()
    ```

*   **Uncontrolled `parallel`:** The `parallel` operator distributes work across multiple threads.  If the parallelism level is not carefully controlled (e.g., based on a fixed configuration or system resources), an attacker could potentially influence the parallelism level, leading to excessive thread creation.

    ```kotlin
    // DANGEROUS:  If 'attackerControlledParallelism' is very large, this can create too many threads.
    source
        .parallel(attackerControlledParallelism)
        .runOn(Schedulers.computation)
        .subscribe()
    ```

*   **Nested `subscribeOn` Calls:**  While less common, deeply nested `subscribeOn` calls, especially with different schedulers, can create a complex thread management scenario and potentially lead to unexpected thread creation.

*   **Improper Resource Cleanup:**  If subscriptions are not properly disposed of (e.g., using `Disposable.dispose()`), the associated threads might not be released, leading to a gradual thread leak over time.  This is a slower form of resource exhaustion, but it can still lead to DoS.

*   **Custom Schedulers:**  If the application defines custom schedulers, these must be carefully implemented to avoid unbounded thread creation.  A custom scheduler that creates a new thread for every task without any limits is highly vulnerable.

*   **Blocking Operations within Reactive Streams:**  Performing long-running or blocking operations (e.g., I/O, database calls) *directly* within a reactive stream (especially on a single-threaded scheduler) can block the thread and prevent other tasks from being processed.  While this doesn't directly create *new* threads, it can effectively reduce the available concurrency and make the application more susceptible to DoS.  This is particularly relevant if the blocking operation is triggered by attacker-controlled input.

**4.2. Attacker Exploitation Scenarios:**

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities in several ways:

*   **Flooding with Requests:**  If the application processes user input using an unbounded `flatMap` with `subscribeOn`, the attacker could send a large number of requests, each triggering the creation of a new thread.
*   **Manipulating Parallelism:**  If the application uses `parallel` with a parallelism level that can be influenced by user input, the attacker could provide a very large value to force the creation of many threads.
*   **Triggering Long-Running Operations:**  If the application performs blocking operations within reactive streams based on user input, the attacker could craft input that triggers these operations, tying up threads and reducing the application's capacity to handle legitimate requests.
*   **Causing Resource Leaks:**  The attacker might try to trigger scenarios where subscriptions are not properly disposed of, leading to a gradual thread leak.

**4.3. Mitigation Strategies:**

The following mitigation strategies should be implemented to prevent uncontrolled thread creation:

*   **Bounded Concurrency:**
    *   **Limit `flatMap` Concurrency:**  Use the `maxConcurrency` parameter of `flatMap` to limit the number of inner streams that can be processed concurrently.  This is crucial for preventing unbounded thread creation.

        ```kotlin
        // SAFE:  Limits the number of concurrent inner streams to 10.
        userInputSource
            .flatMap(maxConcurrency = 10) { input ->
                processInput(input)
                    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io)
            }
            .subscribe()
        ```

    *   **Control `parallel` Parallelism:**  Use a fixed parallelism level for `parallel` or dynamically determine it based on available system resources (e.g., number of CPU cores).  Avoid using attacker-controlled input directly to set the parallelism level.

        ```kotlin
        // SAFE:  Uses a fixed parallelism level.
        source
            .parallel(4)
            .runOn(Schedulers.computation)
            .subscribe()

        // SAFE:  Dynamically determines parallelism based on CPU cores.
        val parallelism = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()
        source
            .parallel(parallelism)
            .runOn(Schedulers.computation)
            .subscribe()
        ```

*   **Use Appropriate Schedulers:**
    *   **`Schedulers.io` (with caution):**  Suitable for I/O-bound operations, but be mindful of the potential for thread creation.  Use in conjunction with `flatMap`'s `maxConcurrency`.
    *   **`Schedulers.computation`:**  Suitable for CPU-bound operations.  Typically uses a fixed-size thread pool.
    *   **`Schedulers.single`:**  Uses a single thread.  Useful for tasks that need to be executed sequentially.
    *   **Avoid `Schedulers.newThread()`:**  This creates a new thread for *every* task and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary (and with extreme caution).

*   **Proper Resource Management:**
    *   **Dispose of Subscriptions:**  Always dispose of subscriptions when they are no longer needed using `Disposable.dispose()`.  Use `CompositeDisposable` to manage multiple disposables.  Consider using `using` operator for automatic resource management.

        ```kotlin
        val compositeDisposable = CompositeDisposable()

        val disposable = source.subscribe()
        compositeDisposable.add(disposable)

        // Later, when the subscription is no longer needed:
        compositeDisposable.dispose()
        ```

*   **Non-Blocking Operations:**
    *   **Avoid Blocking Calls:**  Do not perform blocking operations directly within reactive streams.  Use asynchronous APIs or offload blocking operations to a separate thread pool (using `subscribeOn` with an appropriate scheduler).
    *   **Use Reaktive's Asynchronous Operators:**  Reaktive provides operators for working with asynchronous data sources (e.g., `fromCallable`, `fromFuture`, `fromPublisher`).

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Validate User Input:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user input to prevent attackers from injecting malicious data that could trigger excessive thread creation.
    *   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from flooding the application with requests.

*   **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    *   **Monitor Thread Counts:**  Monitor the number of threads created by the application and set up alerts for unusual spikes.
    *   **Monitor Resource Usage:**  Monitor CPU usage, memory consumption, and other relevant metrics.

* **Thread Pool Configuration (JVM):**
    * Understand and configure the JVM's default thread pool settings (e.g., core pool size, maximum pool size, keep-alive time) to ensure they are appropriate for the application's workload and the target environment.

* **Custom Scheduler Review:**
    If custom schedulers are used, ensure they have built-in limits on thread creation and proper resource management.

## 5. Conclusion

Uncontrolled thread creation is a serious vulnerability that can lead to denial-of-service attacks in Reaktive applications. By understanding the potential vulnerable patterns, implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, and conducting thorough testing, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this attack vector.  Regular code reviews, static analysis, and dynamic testing should be incorporated into the development lifecycle to ensure ongoing security.  The key is to be mindful of concurrency and resource management when working with Reaktive's powerful features.
