## Mitigation Strategy: [Employ Reactive Streams Operators for Synchronization](./mitigation_strategies/employ_reactive_streams_operators_for_synchronization.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Employ Reactive Streams Operators for Synchronization
*   **Description**:
    1.  **Identify Shared Resources:** Pinpoint shared resources (e.g., databases, external APIs, in-memory caches) accessed concurrently by different reactive streams built with Reaktive.
    2.  **Apply `serialize()` Operator:**  Use the `serialize()` operator from Reaktive when you need to ensure sequential processing of events within a stream, especially when dealing with shared mutable state or resources that cannot handle concurrent access. Place `serialize()` strategically before operations that interact with shared resources within your Reaktive streams.
    3.  **Utilize `publish()` and `refCount()` for Shared Streams:** When multiple subscribers need to share the same Reaktive stream and you want to control resource consumption and prevent multiple executions, use `publish()` to make the stream hot and `refCount()` to manage the stream's lifecycle based on the number of subscribers. These are Reaktive operators for managing shared streams.
    4.  **Choose Appropriate Concurrency Operators:**  Explore other concurrency operators provided by Reaktive like `subscribeOn()` and `observeOn()` to control thread execution and manage concurrency in different parts of your Reaktive pipeline. Use them judiciously to avoid unnecessary context switching and overhead within your Reaktive flows.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Race Conditions (High Severity):**  Prevents race conditions by controlling concurrent access to shared resources within Reaktive streams.
    *   **Resource Contention (Medium Severity):** Reduces resource contention by managing concurrent stream execution using Reaktive operators.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Race Conditions:** High risk reduction when `serialize()` is correctly applied to critical sections in Reaktive streams.
    *   **Resource Contention:** Medium risk reduction by optimizing stream sharing and execution using Reaktive's concurrency features.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  `serialize()` is used in database access streams built with Reaktive to prevent concurrent database modifications. `publish()` and `refCount()` are used for shared data streams consumed by multiple UI components using Reaktive.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Not consistently applied across all microservices using Reaktive, especially in newer services where concurrency patterns are still being refined within Reaktive flows.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Backpressure Strategies](./mitigation_strategies/implement_backpressure_strategies.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Backpressure Strategies
*   **Description**:
    1.  **Analyze Data Flow:**  Examine your reactive streams built with Reaktive and identify potential points where data producers might overwhelm consumers. Look for streams that process external data sources, user inputs, or high-volume events within Reaktive pipelines.
    2.  **Choose Backpressure Strategy:** Select an appropriate backpressure strategy based on your application's requirements and resource constraints, utilizing Reaktive's backpressure operators. Options include:
        *   **`onBackpressureBuffer()`:** Buffer incoming events when the consumer is slow using Reaktive's operator. Configure buffer size limits to prevent unbounded buffering in Reaktive streams.
        *   **`onBackpressureDrop()`:** Drop the latest or oldest events when the consumer is slow using Reaktive's operator. Suitable for scenarios where losing some data is acceptable in Reaktive streams.
        *   **`onBackpressureLatest()`:** Keep only the latest event and drop older ones when the consumer is slow using Reaktive's operator. Useful for scenarios where only the most recent data is relevant in Reaktive streams.
        *   **`throttleLatest()`/`debounce()`:** Control the rate of events emitted by the producer using Reaktive's operators.
    3.  **Apply Backpressure Operators:**  Insert the chosen backpressure operators from Reaktive into your reactive pipelines at appropriate points, typically between producers and consumers that might have different processing speeds within Reaktive flows.
    4.  **Monitor Backpressure Effectiveness:**  Monitor metrics related to backpressure, such as buffer sizes, dropped events, and consumer processing times in your Reaktive applications. Adjust backpressure strategies and parameters as needed based on monitoring data for Reaktive streams.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Prevents DoS attacks by limiting resource consumption when Reaktive data producers overwhelm consumers.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Memory, CPU) (High Severity):** Prevents resource exhaustion by controlling data flow and preventing unbounded buffering in Reaktive streams.
    *   **Application Instability (Medium Severity):**  Improves application stability by preventing overload situations in Reaktive applications.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** High risk reduction by mitigating stream overload vulnerabilities in Reaktive applications.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** High risk reduction by preventing uncontrolled resource consumption in Reaktive streams.
    *   **Application Instability:** Medium risk reduction by improving resilience to high data volumes in Reaktive-based systems.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic backpressure using `onBackpressureBuffer()` with limited buffer sizes is implemented in some data ingestion pipelines using Reaktive.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Backpressure strategies are not consistently applied across all reactive streams built with Reaktive.  Lack of dynamic backpressure adjustment based on system load within Reaktive flows. No comprehensive monitoring of backpressure effectiveness in Reaktive applications.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Error Handling in Reactive Pipelines](./mitigation_strategies/robust_error_handling_in_reactive_pipelines.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Robust Error Handling in Reactive Pipelines
*   **Description**:
    1.  **Identify Error-Prone Operations:** Analyze your reactive streams built with Reaktive and identify operations that are likely to produce errors (e.g., network requests, data parsing, database interactions) within Reaktive pipelines.
    2.  **Implement `onErrorReturn()`:** Use `onErrorReturn()` from Reaktive to provide fallback values or default results when errors occur in a stream. This prevents errors from propagating and crashing the entire Reaktive stream.
    3.  **Utilize `onErrorResumeNext()`:** Employ `onErrorResumeNext()` from Reaktive to switch to an alternative stream when an error occurs. This allows you to gracefully handle errors by providing alternative data sources or error handling streams within Reaktive flows.
    4.  **Apply `retry()` Operator:** Use `retry()` from Reaktive to automatically retry failed operations, especially for transient errors like network glitches. Configure retry policies (number of retries, delay) to avoid infinite retry loops in Reaktive streams.
    5.  **Centralized Error Logging:**  Integrate error handling with a centralized logging system to capture and monitor errors occurring in reactive streams built with Reaktive. Log sufficient context information for debugging and analysis of Reaktive errors.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Prevents accidental disclosure of sensitive information through unhandled exceptions in Reaktive streams.
    *   **Application Instability (Medium Severity):**  Improves application stability by preventing unhandled errors from crashing the application using Reaktive.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior (Medium Severity):**  Reduces unexpected application behavior caused by unhandled errors in Reaktive pipelines.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Medium risk reduction by preventing error details from being exposed through Reaktive error handling.
    *   **Application Instability:** Medium risk reduction by improving error resilience in Reaktive applications.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior:** Medium risk reduction by ensuring predictable error handling within Reaktive flows.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic error logging is in place for Reaktive applications. `onErrorReturn()` is used in some API integration streams built with Reaktive to provide default responses on failure.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  No consistent error handling strategy across all reactive streams built with Reaktive.  `onErrorResumeNext()` and `retry()` are not widely used in Reaktive pipelines.  Error handling logic is often duplicated across different Reaktive streams.
