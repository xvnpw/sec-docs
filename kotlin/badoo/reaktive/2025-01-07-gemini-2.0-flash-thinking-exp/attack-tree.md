## Attack Tree Visualization

```
**Objective:** Compromise application by exploiting vulnerabilities within the Reaktive library.

**Attacker's Goal:** Disrupt application functionality, access sensitive data, or gain unauthorized control by exploiting weaknesses in the Reaktive library.

**Sub-Tree:**

Compromise Application via Reaktive [CRITICAL]
* Exploit Reactive Stream Logic [CRITICAL]
    * Data Injection Vulnerability [HIGH RISK]
        * Attacker injects malicious data into a reactive stream.
        * Application processes the malicious data, leading to unintended consequences.
    * Error Handling Exploitation [HIGH RISK]
        * Attacker triggers specific errors within Reaktive streams.
        * Application's error handling logic is flawed or exposes sensitive information.
            * Attacker gains information about the application's internal state or vulnerabilities through error messages.
            * Application crashes or enters an unstable state due to unhandled errors. [HIGH RISK]
    * Backpressure Abuse [HIGH RISK]
        * Attacker overwhelms the application with a high volume of events in a reactive stream.
        * Application's backpressure strategy is insufficient, leading to resource exhaustion.
* Exploit Asynchronous Nature for Malicious Purposes [HIGH RISK]
    * Resource Starvation via Asynchronous Operations [HIGH RISK]
        * Attacker triggers a large number of asynchronous operations through Reaktive.
        * Application's resources (e.g., threads, memory) are exhausted.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Reaktive](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_reaktive.md)

**Critical Node: Compromise Application via Reaktive**

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved their objective of disrupting the application, accessing sensitive data, or gaining unauthorized control by exploiting weaknesses within the Reaktive library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Reactive Stream Logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_reactive_stream_logic.md)

**Critical Node: Exploit Reactive Stream Logic**

* This node represents a broad category of attacks that target the core functionality of Reaktive. Successful exploitation here indicates a fundamental weakness in how the application utilizes reactive streams.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Reactive Stream Logic -> Data Injection Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_reactive_stream_logic_-_data_injection_vulnerability.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Reactive Stream Logic -> Data Injection Vulnerability**

* **Attacker injects malicious data into a reactive stream:** The attacker crafts malicious input designed to exploit how the application processes data within its reactive streams. This could involve injecting code, special characters, or unexpected data formats.
* **Application processes the malicious data, leading to unintended consequences:** Due to a lack of proper input validation and sanitization, the application processes the malicious data, leading to outcomes such as:
    * **Data corruption:** Malicious data overwrites or alters legitimate data within the application.
    * **Unexpected behavior:** The application behaves in ways not intended by the developers, potentially leading to errors or security vulnerabilities.
    * **Potential code execution:** In severe cases, the injected data could be interpreted as code, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Reactive Stream Logic -> Error Handling Exploitation -> Attacker gains information about the application's internal state or vulnerabilities through error messages.](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_reactive_stream_logic_-_error_handling_exploitation_-_attacker_gains_information_about_the_a_7005c0bc.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Reactive Stream Logic -> Error Handling Exploitation -> Attacker gains information about the application's internal state or vulnerabilities through error messages.**

* **Attacker triggers specific errors within Reaktive streams:** The attacker intentionally manipulates input or application state to cause errors within the Reaktive streams.
* **Application's error handling logic is flawed or exposes sensitive information:** The application's error handling mechanisms are not properly implemented, leading to:
    * **Attacker gains information about the application's internal state or vulnerabilities through error messages:** Error messages displayed to the user or logged without proper redaction reveal sensitive details about the application's configuration, data structures, or potential weaknesses. This information can be used to plan further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Reactive Stream Logic -> Error Handling Exploitation -> Application crashes or enters an unstable state due to unhandled errors.](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_reactive_stream_logic_-_error_handling_exploitation_-_application_crashes_or_enters_an_unsta_597dc0e0.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Reactive Stream Logic -> Error Handling Exploitation -> Application crashes or enters an unstable state due to unhandled errors.**

* **Attacker triggers specific errors within Reaktive streams:**  Similar to the previous path, the attacker aims to induce errors within the reactive streams.
* **Application crashes or enters an unstable state due to unhandled errors:** The application lacks proper error recovery mechanisms, and unhandled exceptions or errors within the reactive streams lead to:
    * **Denial of service:** The application becomes unavailable to legitimate users due to crashes or instability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Reactive Stream Logic -> Backpressure Abuse](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_reactive_stream_logic_-_backpressure_abuse.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Reactive Stream Logic -> Backpressure Abuse**

* **Attacker overwhelms the application with a high volume of events in a reactive stream:** The attacker sends a large number of requests or data events to the application's reactive streams at a rate faster than the application can process them.
* **Application's backpressure strategy is insufficient, leading to resource exhaustion:** The application does not have adequate mechanisms to handle the influx of events (backpressure), resulting in:
    * **Denial of service:** The application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to resource exhaustion (e.g., CPU, memory).
    * **Application slowdown:** The application becomes significantly slower for legitimate users as resources are consumed by the excessive event processing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Asynchronous Nature for Malicious Purposes -> Resource Starvation via Asynchronous Operations](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_asynchronous_nature_for_malicious_purposes_-_resource_starvation_via_asynchronous_operations.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Asynchronous Nature for Malicious Purposes -> Resource Starvation via Asynchronous Operations**

* **Attacker triggers a large number of asynchronous operations through Reaktive:** The attacker exploits the asynchronous nature of Reaktive by initiating a massive number of concurrent operations.
* **Application's resources (e.g., threads, memory) are exhausted:** The application's resources are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of concurrent operations, leading to:
    * **Denial of service:** The application becomes unavailable as it runs out of resources to handle new requests.
