# Threat Model Analysis for badoo/reaktive

## Threat: [Unbounded Stream Exploitation](./threats/unbounded_stream_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might intentionally or unintentionally cause a Reaktive `Observable` or `Subject` to emit an excessive and continuous flow of data without proper termination or backpressure. This could be due to logic flaws in how the reactive stream is constructed or how data is pushed into a `Subject`.
*   **Impact:**  Subscribers within the Reaktive flow could be overwhelmed, leading to excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory), performance degradation, and potentially a denial-of-service (DoS) condition within the application.
*   **Affected Reaktive Component:** `Observable`, `Subject`, custom `Operator` implementations, `Flowable` (if used improperly or not at all).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement backpressure mechanisms when dealing with potentially high-volume streams, utilizing Reaktive's `Flowable` or appropriate operators like `buffer`, `debounce`, `throttle` on `Observable`.
    *   Set timeouts or limits on the duration or number of emissions for `Observable`s or `Subject`s that might be susceptible to unbounded data using operators like `takeUntil`, `timeout`.
    *   Carefully design reactive pipelines to ensure proper termination conditions are in place.

## Threat: [Race Conditions in Shared State Modification via Reaktive `Subject`](./threats/race_conditions_in_shared_state_modification_via_reaktive__subject_.md)

*   **Description:** When multiple parts of the application (potentially on different threads if using custom `Scheduler`s) concurrently interact with a shared `Subject` (like `PublishSubject`, `BehaviorSubject`, `ReplaySubject`) to modify shared mutable state without proper synchronization, an attacker might exploit timing vulnerabilities to cause race conditions.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, potential for privilege escalation or unauthorized access if the shared state controls access or permissions.
*   **Affected Reaktive Component:** `Subject` (especially `PublishSubject`, `BehaviorSubject`, `ReplaySubject`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Minimize the use of shared mutable state, especially when interacted with through `Subject`s.
    *   If shared state is necessary, carefully consider the threading context and ensure proper synchronization if different threads are involved (Reaktive itself doesn't enforce threading, but custom schedulers can introduce concurrency).
    *   Consider using immutable data structures and reactive patterns that reduce the need for shared mutable state.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Uncontrolled Resource Acquisition in Custom Reaktive Operators](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_uncontrolled_resource_acquisition_in_custom_reaktive_operators.md)

*   **Description:** If developers create custom `Operator` implementations that acquire external resources (e.g., database connections, file handles, network sockets) and fail to release them properly within the operator's lifecycle (e.g., in `doFinally` or similar mechanisms), an attacker could trigger these operators repeatedly, leading to resource exhaustion.
*   **Impact:** Application becomes unable to acquire necessary resources, leading to errors, performance degradation, or crashes. External systems might also be affected by resource exhaustion.
*   **Affected Reaktive Component:** Custom `Operator` implementations.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement proper resource management within custom `Operator` implementations, ensuring that acquired resources are always released. Use `doFinally` or similar operators to guarantee resource release.
    *   Thoroughly test custom operators for resource leaks under various conditions.
    *   Consider using existing Reaktive operators or established patterns for resource management instead of creating custom solutions where possible.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion or Supply Chain Attacks via Reaktive Dependencies](./threats/dependency_confusion_or_supply_chain_attacks_via_reaktive_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could attempt to inject malicious code by exploiting vulnerabilities in Reaktive's dependencies (transitive dependencies) or by performing a dependency confusion attack, where a malicious package with the same name as an internal dependency is introduced into the build process. This isn't a direct Reaktive vulnerability, but it's a risk associated with using any library with dependencies.
*   **Impact:**  Compromise of the application's codebase, potential for data breaches, malware injection, or other malicious activities.
*   **Affected Reaktive Component:**  The build system and dependency management tools used with Reaktive (e.g., Gradle, Maven) and indirectly, Reaktive's declared dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Reaktive's dependencies.
    *   Regularly update Reaktive and its dependencies to the latest secure versions.
    *   Implement safeguards against dependency confusion attacks (e.g., using private registries, verifying checksums).
    *   Follow secure software supply chain practices.
