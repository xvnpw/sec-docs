# Attack Surface Analysis for badoo/reaktive

## Attack Surface: [Unbounded Streams leading to Resource Exhaustion (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/unbounded_streams_leading_to_resource_exhaustion__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** A Reaktive stream that continuously emits items without a defined termination condition or backpressure mechanism can consume excessive memory or CPU resources, leading to application instability or denial of service.
*   **How Reaktive Contributes:** Reaktive's core functionality revolves around creating and processing asynchronous streams. If not carefully managed *within Reaktive's constructs*, these streams can become unbounded. Operators like `interval` or custom sources implemented using Reaktive primitives that continuously emit without limits are prime examples. The lack of explicit backpressure handling within the stream definition directly contributes to this.
*   **Example:** An observable created using `interval(1.seconds)` that feeds directly into a `buffer()` operator without any size or time limit specified. Reaktive will continue to buffer the emitted items indefinitely, eventually leading to an out-of-memory error.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, service unavailability, performance degradation affecting other users or services.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Backpressure within Reaktive Streams:** Utilize Reaktive's backpressure operators like `onBackpressureBuffer`, `onBackpressureDrop`, or `onBackpressureLatest` to manage the rate of emissions when the consumer cannot keep up.
    *   **Introduce Termination Conditions in Stream Definitions:** Ensure streams have clear termination conditions using operators like `take`, `takeUntil`, `takeWhile`, or by completing the underlying `Subject` or source.
    *   **Limit Buffer Sizes in Reaktive Operators:** When using buffering operators like `buffer`, `window`, specify maximum sizes or time windows to prevent unbounded growth within the Reaktive pipeline.
    *   **Monitor Reaktive Stream Resource Usage:** Implement monitoring specifically targeting the resource consumption of active Reaktive streams (e.g., memory usage related to buffers).

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Custom Operators](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_custom_operators.md)

*   **Description:** If the application implements custom Reaktive operators, these could contain logic flaws or vulnerabilities that allow attackers to inject malicious data, cause unexpected behavior, or even lead to code execution if the operator interacts with external systems unsafely.
*   **How Reaktive Contributes:** Reaktive's design encourages the creation of custom operators to encapsulate specific stream processing logic. The responsibility for the security of these custom operators lies entirely with the developer, and vulnerabilities introduced here are directly within the Reaktive processing pipeline.
*   **Example:** A custom operator implemented using Reaktive's `ObservableTransformer` that takes data from the stream and uses it to construct a system command without proper sanitization. An attacker could inject malicious commands through the stream.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, remote code execution, application compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rigorous Security Review of Custom Operator Code:** Conduct thorough security code reviews specifically focusing on custom Reaktive operators, paying close attention to input handling, data transformations, and interactions with external systems.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization within Custom Operators:**  Implement robust input validation and sanitization logic *within* the custom operators to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Comprehensive Unit Testing of Custom Operators:** Write comprehensive unit tests for custom operators, including tests for various input scenarios, edge cases, and potential malicious inputs.
    *   **Adhere to Secure Coding Practices when Developing Reaktive Operators:** Follow secure coding principles, such as the principle of least privilege and avoiding hardcoded secrets, when implementing custom Reaktive operators.

## Attack Surface: [Race Conditions due to Shared Mutable State within Reaktive Streams](./attack_surfaces/race_conditions_due_to_shared_mutable_state_within_reaktive_streams.md)

*   **Description:** When multiple Reaktive streams or operators access and modify shared mutable state without proper synchronization *within the Reaktive processing context*, it can lead to race conditions. Attackers might exploit these race conditions to manipulate data or cause unexpected behavior.
*   **How Reaktive Contributes:** Reaktive facilitates asynchronous operations, increasing the potential for race conditions if shared state is accessed by multiple concurrent streams or operators. Operators like `publish` or `share` can lead to multiple subscribers operating on the same data concurrently. The lack of inherent thread-safety for mutable shared state within Reaktive streams contributes to this risk.
*   **Example:** Two separate Reaktive streams subscribing to the same `BehaviorSubject` and attempting to update its value concurrently without any synchronization mechanisms. An attacker might manipulate the timing of events to force the shared state into an inconsistent or exploitable state.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, potential for privilege escalation or unauthorized actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Minimize Shared Mutable State in Reaktive Pipelines:** Reduce the reliance on shared mutable state within Reaktive streams. Favor immutable data structures and functional programming paradigms.
    *   **Utilize Reaktive's Concurrency Primitives Carefully:** When shared mutable state is unavoidable, use Reaktive's concurrency tools and schedulers thoughtfully to control the execution context and minimize race conditions. Consider using operators that inherently manage concurrency or provide thread-safety.
    *   **Implement External Synchronization Mechanisms (If Necessary):** If Reaktive's built-in tools are insufficient, consider using external synchronization mechanisms like `synchronized` blocks or `java.util.concurrent` utilities, ensuring they are correctly integrated with the Reaktive streams.
    *   **Thorough Concurrency Testing of Reaktive Streams:** Implement rigorous testing, specifically targeting concurrency scenarios within Reaktive streams, to identify and address potential race conditions.
