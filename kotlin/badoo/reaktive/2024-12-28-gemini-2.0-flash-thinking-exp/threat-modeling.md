### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Reaktive

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the Reaktive library, presented using markdown lists.

**Threat: Unintended Data Exposure through Shared Observables**

*   **Description:** An attacker might gain access to sensitive data that is being emitted by a shared `Observable` or `Subject` but was intended for a different, more privileged component. This could happen if the observable is not properly scoped or if access controls are insufficient within the Reaktive stream. The attacker might passively listen to the stream or actively intercept the data flow.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive user data, potential regulatory violations (e.g., GDPR).
*   **Affected Reaktive Component:** `kotlin.badoo.reaktive.subject.Subject`, `kotlin.badoo.reaktive.observable.Observable` (core module).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully scope the visibility of `Observables` and `Subjects`. Avoid making them globally accessible unless absolutely necessary.
    *   Use specific `Observables` or `Subjects` for different security contexts.
    *   Implement filtering and mapping operators (`filter`, `map`) within the Reaktive stream to ensure only the necessary data is exposed to each consumer.
    *   Consider using immutable data structures to prevent accidental modification of shared data within the reactive flow.

**Threat: Injection of Malicious Data into Streams**

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious data into a `Subject` or an `Observable` that is sourced from external input. This injected data could then propagate through the Reaktive stream and potentially disrupt application logic, trigger vulnerabilities in downstream components that consume the stream, or even lead to remote code execution if not properly handled within the reactive pipeline.
*   **Impact:** Integrity compromise, application malfunction, potential remote code execution, denial of service.
*   **Affected Reaktive Component:** `kotlin.badoo.reaktive.subject.Subject` (core module), potentially any Reaktive operator processing the injected data.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize and validate all external input *before* it enters any Reaktive stream.
    *   Use appropriate Reaktive operators to transform and filter data to prevent malicious payloads from propagating through the stream.
    *   Implement input validation at multiple stages within the reactive data flow.
    *   Consider using data types and operators within Reaktive that enforce constraints and prevent the injection of unexpected values.

**Threat: Resource Exhaustion through Unbounded Streams**

*   **Description:** An attacker could trigger the creation of an `Observable` that emits data at an uncontrolled rate or without proper termination within the Reaktive framework. This could lead to excessive memory consumption, CPU usage, or network bandwidth exhaustion within the reactive processing pipeline, ultimately causing a denial-of-service. The attacker might exploit a vulnerability that allows them to influence the data source of the Reaktive stream or bypass Reaktive's backpressure mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, application crash, performance degradation.
*   **Affected Reaktive Component:** `kotlin.badoo.reaktive.observable.Observable` (core module), potentially Reaktive operators involved in data generation or processing.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement backpressure mechanisms within the Reaktive stream using operators like `throttle`, `debounce`, `buffer`, or custom backpressure strategies.
    *   Ensure Reaktive streams have clear termination conditions or use operators like `takeUntil`, `take`, or `timeout`.
    *   Set limits on the number of items emitted by a Reaktive stream or the duration of the stream.
    *   Monitor resource usage related to Reaktive streams and implement alerts for unusual activity.

**Threat: Race Conditions and Inconsistent State due to Concurrent Stream Processing**

*   **Description:** When multiple Reaktive streams interact or when Reaktive operators perform side effects, concurrent processing can lead to race conditions. An attacker might exploit these race conditions within the Reaktive flow to manipulate the order of operations, leading to inconsistent application state, data corruption within the reactive pipeline, or unexpected behavior. This is especially relevant when shared mutable state is accessed or modified within Reaktive operators.
*   **Impact:** Integrity compromise, data corruption, unpredictable application behavior, potential security bypasses.
*   **Affected Reaktive Component:**  Schedulers (`kotlin.badoo.reaktive.scheduler`), Reaktive operators that perform side effects (e.g., `doOnNext`), potentially `Subject` when used for shared state within the Reaktive flow.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully manage concurrency using appropriate Reaktive schedulers. Understand the threading implications of different Reaktive operators.
    *   Minimize the use of shared mutable state within Reaktive streams and operators. Prefer immutable data structures.
    *   Use synchronization mechanisms (though generally discouraged in reactive programming) within Reaktive operators if absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
    *   Thoroughly test concurrent scenarios involving Reaktive streams and operators to identify and fix potential race conditions.

**Threat: Vulnerabilities in Custom Operators**

*   **Description:** If the application uses custom-built Reaktive operators, these operators might contain security vulnerabilities if not implemented carefully. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities within the reactive pipeline to cause unexpected behavior, data corruption within the stream, or even remote code execution if the operator interacts with external systems.
*   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the vulnerability, potentially leading to integrity compromise, denial of service, or remote code execution.
*   **Affected Reaktive Component:** Custom operators implemented by the application developers using Reaktive's operator creation mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly test and review any custom Reaktive operators for potential security flaws.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom Reaktive operators.
    *   Consider using well-established and vetted built-in Reaktive operators whenever possible.
    *   Perform static analysis and code reviews of custom Reaktive operator implementations.
