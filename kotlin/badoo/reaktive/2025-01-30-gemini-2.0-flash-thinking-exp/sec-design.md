# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a high-performance, robust, and developer-friendly reactive programming library for Kotlin.
  - Enable developers to build efficient and scalable applications using reactive paradigms.
  - Foster a strong community around the library to ensure its long-term maintenance and evolution.
- Business Risks:
  - Risk of critical defects in the library leading to application failures or unexpected behavior in applications that depend on it.
  - Risk of performance bottlenecks introduced by the library, negatively impacting the performance of applications using it.
  - Risk of security vulnerabilities within the library itself, potentially exploitable by malicious actors in applications using the library.
  - Risk of low adoption by the Kotlin developer community if the library is perceived as too complex, unreliable, or lacking in features.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code Review - Implemented as part of the standard development process, especially for contributions from external developers, and during pull requests. Location: GitHub repository pull request process.
  - security control: Unit Testing - Implemented to ensure the correctness of individual components and functions within the library. Location: Source code repository under test directories.
  - security control: Integration Testing - Implemented to verify the interaction between different components of the library and ensure they work together as expected. Location: Source code repository under test directories.
  - security control: Static Analysis - Likely used by developers locally using IDE plugins and potentially as part of CI pipelines to identify potential code quality and security issues. Location: Developer local environment and potentially CI pipelines.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Open Source Vulnerability Disclosure - As an open-source project, vulnerabilities may be publicly disclosed before a patch is available, potentially increasing the window of exploitation.
  - accepted risk: Community-Driven Security - Reliance on the open-source community for identifying and reporting security vulnerabilities, which may lead to delays in vulnerability discovery and patching compared to dedicated security teams.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Dependency Scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Reaktive during the build process.
  - security control: Fuzz Testing - Integrate fuzz testing into the CI pipeline to automatically test the library's robustness against various inputs and identify potential crash-inducing inputs or vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits, especially for critical components or before major releases, by security experts to identify potential vulnerabilities that might be missed by standard development practices.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a library. Reaktive itself does not handle user authentication. Applications built using Reaktive will need to implement their own authentication mechanisms.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a library. Reaktive itself does not enforce authorization. Applications built using Reaktive will need to implement their own authorization mechanisms.
  - Input Validation: Reaktive library APIs should implement robust input validation to prevent unexpected behavior, crashes, or potential vulnerabilities due to malformed or malicious input data passed to the library functions by applications. This is crucial for library stability and security.
  - Cryptography: While Reaktive itself might not directly implement cryptographic functions, it should be designed to be compatible with secure cryptographic practices if used in security-sensitive applications. If cryptographic operations are needed within Reaktive in the future, established and well-vetted cryptographic libraries should be used, avoiding custom cryptographic implementations.

## DEPLOYMENT

- Deployment Architecture:
  - Reaktive library itself is not deployed as a standalone application. It is deployed as a library artifact to package repositories (Maven Central) and then included as a dependency in Kotlin applications. The deployment diagram below illustrates the deployment of an application that *uses* the Reaktive library, rather than the library itself. We assume a typical deployment scenario for a Kotlin backend application using Reaktive, deployed to a cloud environment.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Development and maintenance of high-quality, reliable, and performant Kotlin applications by developers using the Reaktive library.
  - Distribution of a secure and trustworthy reactive programming library to the Kotlin community.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - Source code of the Reaktive library: Moderately sensitive. Confidentiality is less critical for open-source, but integrity and availability are crucial.
  - Potential data processed by applications using Reaktive: Sensitivity varies greatly depending on the application. Reaktive itself does not handle specific application data, but applications built with it might process highly sensitive data (e.g., personal data, financial data). The security of Reaktive indirectly impacts the security of this application data.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- BUSINESS POSTURE:
  - Assumption: The primary business goal is to provide a valuable and widely adopted reactive programming library for the Kotlin ecosystem.
  - Question: Are there specific industry verticals or application domains that Reaktive is primarily targeting? Understanding this could help prioritize certain security or feature aspects.

- SECURITY POSTURE:
  - Assumption: Security is a significant concern for the Reaktive project to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of applications built using it.
  - Question: Is there a formal security incident response plan in place for Reaktive? How are security vulnerabilities reported and handled?
  - Question: Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., OWASP, GDPR, HIPAA) that Reaktive needs to consider, even indirectly as a library?

- DESIGN:
  - Assumption: Reaktive is designed to be a modular library with a core module and optional extensions.
  - Question: What is the strategy for managing dependencies of Reaktive and its extensions? Are there plans to minimize dependencies to reduce the attack surface?
  - Question: Are there any specific performance or scalability requirements that have driven the design of Reaktive? Understanding these can help assess the trade-offs between performance and security.
