For example, unusual error rates, unexpected data processing patterns, or backpressure events in critical reactive streams could be indicators of malicious activity.
    *   **Impact Reduction (Medium):**  Real-time monitoring and alerting significantly reduce the delay in detecting attacks. Instead of relying on periodic log reviews or user reports, security teams can be notified immediately when suspicious activity occurs within reactive streams, enabling faster incident response and containment.

*   **Difficult Debugging and Incident Response (Medium Severity):**
    *   **How Mitigation Works:** Comprehensive logging of reactive stream activity provides valuable context and diagnostic information for debugging and incident response. Structured logs with stream IDs, event types, timestamps, and error details allow developers and operations teams to trace the flow of data, identify error sources, and understand the sequence of events leading to an issue. Stack traces in error logs are crucial for pinpointing the location of exceptions in the code.
    *   **Impact Reduction (High):**  Detailed logging dramatically improves debugging and incident response capabilities.  Without logging, troubleshooting reactive streams can be extremely challenging due to their asynchronous and non-linear nature. Logs provide the necessary visibility to understand the behavior of these complex systems, enabling faster diagnosis, root cause analysis, and resolution of issues. This significantly reduces the time and effort required for debugging and incident response in reactive applications.

Employ asynchronous logging, selective logging, and efficient logging libraries to minimize performance impact. Consider using sampling techniques for performance metrics collection in very high-volume streams.
*   **Operator Instrumentation:** Instrument key Reaktive operators with logging logic to capture relevant events at different stages of the reactive pipeline. Custom operators can be created to encapsulate logging logic and promote code reusability.
*   **Contextual Logging:** Leverage Reaktive's context propagation mechanisms (if available or implement custom solutions) to enrich log events with relevant contextual information, making logs more meaningful and actionable.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement robust error handling within reactive streams and ensure that errors are properly logged, including stack traces, to facilitate debugging and prevent silent failures.
