# Attack Surface Analysis for badoo/reaktive

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Data Injection into Reactive Streams](./attack_surfaces/malicious_data_injection_into_reactive_streams.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Malicious Data Injection into Reactive Streams
    * **Description:** Untrusted or unsanitized data is fed directly into Reaktive streams (Observables, Subjects, Relays).
    * **How Reaktive Contributes:** Reaktive provides the mechanisms for data flow through these streams. If the entry points to these streams are not secured, malicious data can propagate throughout the application logic.
    * **Example:** An application uses a `Subject` to process user input from a web form. If the input is not sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious scripts or commands that are then processed by downstream operators.
    * **Impact:**  Can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS), command injection, data corruption, or other vulnerabilities depending on how the data is used downstream.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all external data before it enters any Reaktive stream.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers to mitigate XSS risks if the data is used in web contexts.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure components processing the data have only the necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Race Conditions in State Management with `MutableState`](./attack_surfaces/race_conditions_in_state_management_with__mutablestate_.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Race Conditions in State Management with `MutableState`
    * **Description:** Concurrent updates to shared `MutableState` without proper synchronization can lead to inconsistent or incorrect state.
    * **How Reaktive Contributes:** `MutableState` provides a mechanism for managing mutable state within reactive applications. While updates are atomic, complex operations involving multiple state changes can still be vulnerable to race conditions if not carefully managed.
    * **Example:** Two concurrent operations attempt to update a shared counter stored in a `MutableState`. Due to a race condition, the final counter value might be incorrect. This could lead to incorrect business logic execution or security bypasses.
    * **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, potential security vulnerabilities.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Minimize Shared Mutable State:** Reduce the use of shared mutable state where possible. Favor immutable data structures and reactive streams for data flow.
        * **Atomic Operations:** Utilize atomic operations provided by Reaktive or underlying platforms for state updates.
        * **Careful Design of State Updates:** Design state update logic to be as simple and atomic as possible. Avoid complex sequences of updates that could be interrupted.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Reactive Operators](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_reactive_operators.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in Custom Reactive Operators
    * **Description:** Security flaws or logic errors in custom reactive operators introduced by developers.
    * **How Reaktive Contributes:** Reaktive allows developers to create custom operators to extend its functionality. Vulnerabilities in these custom operators can introduce new attack vectors.
    * **Example:** A custom operator designed to filter data has a bug that allows bypassing the filter under certain conditions, leading to unauthorized data access.
    * **Impact:**  Varies depending on the vulnerability in the custom operator, potentially leading to data breaches, code execution, or other security issues.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the operator's function)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices when developing custom operators.
        * **Thorough Testing:** Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests for custom operators, including security-focused test cases.
        * **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews of custom operators to identify potential vulnerabilities.
