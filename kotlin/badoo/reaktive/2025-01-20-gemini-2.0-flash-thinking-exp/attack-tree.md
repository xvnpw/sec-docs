## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploit Vulnerabilities within Reaktive Library -> Cause Resource Exhaustion -> Create Infinite or Very Long-Lived Streams](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploit_vulnerabilities_within_reaktive_library_-_cause_resource_exhaustion_-_creat_c3aac083.md)

- Exploit Vulnerabilities within Reaktive Library: The attacker aims to leverage inherent flaws or bugs within the Reaktive library's code. This could involve exploiting logic errors in how reactive streams are processed or managed.
- Cause Resource Exhaustion: The attacker's goal is to deplete the application's resources (CPU, memory, network) to the point where it becomes unavailable or performs poorly.
- Create Infinite or Very Long-Lived Streams: The attacker crafts or manipulates reactive streams in a way that causes them to emit events indefinitely or for an excessively long period. This can tie up resources and prevent the application from serving legitimate requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Abuse Application's Incorrect Usage of Reaktive -> Exploit Inadequate Error Handling in Reactive Streams -> Trigger Errors Leading to Application Crash or Unexpected State](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_abuse_application's_incorrect_usage_of_reaktive_-_exploit_inadequate_error_handling_29555f85.md)

- Abuse Application's Incorrect Usage of Reaktive: The attacker targets vulnerabilities arising from how developers have implemented Reaktive within the application. This focuses on mistakes or oversights in the application's code rather than flaws in the library itself.
- Exploit Inadequate Error Handling in Reactive Streams: The attacker aims to trigger errors within reactive streams that the application does not handle gracefully. This could involve sending unexpected data or causing operations to fail.
- Trigger Errors Leading to Application Crash or Unexpected State: By exploiting the lack of proper error handling, the attacker can cause the application to terminate unexpectedly or enter an inconsistent or vulnerable state.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Abuse Application's Incorrect Usage of Reaktive -> Exploit Lack of Proper Backpressure Handling -> Overwhelm Downstream Components with Excessive Events](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_abuse_application's_incorrect_usage_of_reaktive_-_exploit_lack_of_proper_backpressu_0a0c9654.md)

- Abuse Application's Incorrect Usage of Reaktive:  Similar to the previous path, the attacker focuses on vulnerabilities introduced by the application's implementation of Reaktive.
- Exploit Lack of Proper Backpressure Handling: The attacker exploits the absence of mechanisms to control the rate at which events are emitted and processed in reactive streams. This allows a fast producer of events to overwhelm a slower consumer.
- Overwhelm Downstream Components with Excessive Events: The attacker manipulates the system to generate a flood of events that the application's downstream components (e.g., UI, database, other services) cannot handle. This can lead to performance degradation or denial of service.
