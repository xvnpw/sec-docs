# Threat Model Analysis for badoo/reaktive

## Threat: [Race Condition in Shared State Updates](./threats/race_condition_in_shared_state_updates.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit a race condition where multiple reactive streams concurrently update shared state (e.g., using `BehaviorSubject`) without proper synchronization. This could lead to inconsistent data, incorrect application logic, or even allow manipulation of critical application state. For example, an attacker might trigger simultaneous actions that modify a user's permissions, potentially granting them unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, potential for privilege escalation or unauthorized access.

**Affected Reaktive Component:** `BehaviorSubject`, `PublishSubject`, any shared `MutableStateFlow` or similar state-holding constructs used within reactive streams.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use thread-safe state management mechanisms provided by Reaktive or Kotlin Coroutines (e.g., `Mutex`, `AtomicInteger`).
*   Employ operators like `serialize()` to ensure sequential processing of events affecting shared state.
*   Carefully design reactive streams to minimize shared mutable state or encapsulate it within a single, controlled source.
*   Thoroughly test concurrent scenarios to identify and fix race conditions.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion from Unbounded Streams](./threats/resource_exhaustion_from_unbounded_streams.md)

**Description:** An attacker could flood the application with events that are processed by a reactive stream without proper backpressure handling or termination conditions. This could lead to excessive memory consumption or CPU usage, eventually causing the application to crash or become unavailable. For example, an attacker might continuously send data to a WebSocket endpoint that feeds into an unbounded reactive stream.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (resource exhaustion, application crash).

**Affected Reaktive Component:** `Observable`, `Flowable` (if backpressure is not handled), operators that generate or process streams (e.g., `interval()`, event listeners converted to streams).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement backpressure strategies using operators like `buffer()`, `throttle()`, `debounce()`, `sample()`, or `drop()`.
*   Set appropriate limits on the number of events processed or buffered.
*   Ensure reactive streams have proper termination conditions.
*   Monitor resource usage (memory, CPU) to detect potential resource exhaustion.

## Threat: [Misuse of `unsafeSubscribe` or Similar Unsafe Operations](./threats/misuse_of__unsafesubscribe__or_similar_unsafe_operations.md)

**Description:** An attacker might be able to leverage the misuse of "unsafe" operations (if available in future versions or through extensions) that bypass standard safety mechanisms in Reaktive. This could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities if not handled with extreme care.

**Impact:** Unpredictable behavior, potential for data corruption or crashes.

**Affected Reaktive Component:** Any "unsafe" operations provided by Reaktive or its extensions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using "unsafe" operations unless absolutely necessary and with a deep understanding of the implications.
*   Thoroughly document and review any code using "unsafe" operations.
*   Consider alternative, safer approaches whenever possible.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The Reaktive library itself or its transitive dependencies might contain known vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if the application uses an outdated version of Reaktive or its dependencies.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, could lead to remote code execution, data breaches, or Denial of Service.

**Affected Reaktive Component:** The entire Reaktive library and its dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the Reaktive library and all its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   Use dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
*   Monitor security advisories for Reaktive and its dependencies.
