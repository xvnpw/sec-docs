### 5.2. Component Description

* **External Client:** Represents any entity interacting with the Helidon application, such as web browsers, mobile applications, or other microservices.
* **Web Server (Netty):**  Helidon leverages Netty, a high-performance, asynchronous event-driven network application framework, to handle incoming HTTP requests and responses. This component is the entry point for external interactions.
* **Routing & Endpoint Handling:** This component is responsible for mapping incoming HTTP requests to specific handlers or resources within the application based on defined routes. It defines the application's API surface and is crucial for controlling access to different functionalities.
* **Business Logic:** This encompasses the core functionality of the microservice, implementing specific business rules, data processing, and workflows. This is where the application's primary purpose is realized.
* **Configuration Management:** Helidon provides a robust configuration system allowing applications to be configured through various sources like files, environment variables, and external configuration servers. Secure management of configuration is vital.
* **Security Framework:** This component handles security concerns such as authentication (verifying user identity), authorization (granting access to resources), and secure communication (TLS). It integrates with various security standards and providers.
* **Metrics & Health Checks:** Helidon offers built-in support for exposing application metrics (e.g., request rates, error counts) and health check endpoints. These are essential for monitoring and detecting anomalies, including potential security breaches.
* **Tracing & Observability:** Helidon supports distributed tracing, enabling the tracking of requests across multiple services. This is crucial for understanding complex interactions and identifying potential security issues in distributed environments.
* **External Data Stores:** Represents external systems the Helidon application interacts with, such as databases, message queues, or other APIs. Secure interaction with these stores is paramount.

### 5.3. Data Flow

The following diagram illustrates a typical request flow within a Helidon application, highlighting security-relevant steps:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["'External Client'"] --> B("'Web Server (Netty)'")
    B --> C("'Routing'")
    C --> D("'Security Interceptor (Authentication)'")
    D -- "Authenticated" --> E("'Security Interceptor (Authorization)'")
    D -- "Not Authenticated" --> F("'Authentication Failure Response'")
    E -- "Authorized" --> G("'Endpoint Handler'")
    E -- "Not Authorized" --> H("'Authorization Failure Response'")
    G --> I("'Business Logic'")
    I --> J("'External Data Store (Optional)'")
    J --> I
    I --> K("'Response Builder'")
    K --> B
    B --> A
    style D fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Detailed Data Flow Steps:**

1. **External Client** initiates an HTTP request to the Helidon application.
2. **Web Server (Netty)** receives the incoming request.
3. **Routing** component analyzes the request URI and method to determine the appropriate endpoint handler.
4. **Security Interceptor (Authentication)** intercepts the request to verify the identity of the client. This might involve checking for valid credentials, tokens, or certificates.
    * If authentication is **successful**, the request proceeds to the **Authorization** step.
    * If authentication **fails**, an **Authentication Failure Response** is generated and sent back to the client.
5. **Security Interceptor (Authorization)** determines if the authenticated client has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource or perform the requested action. This often involves checking roles, permissions, or policies.
    * If authorization is **successful**, the request proceeds to the **Endpoint Handler**.
    * If authorization **fails**, an **Authorization Failure Response** is generated and sent back to the client.
6. **Endpoint Handler** invokes the relevant **Business Logic** to process the request.
7. **Business Logic** may interact with **External Data Stores** to retrieve or persist data. Secure communication and data handling are crucial here.
8. **Response Builder** constructs the HTTP response based on the outcome of the business logic execution.
9. **Web Server (Netty)** sends the response back to the **External Client**.

### 5.4. Deployment Considerations

Helidon applications are designed for flexible deployment across various environments:

* **Containers (Docker, Kubernetes):** Helidon's lightweight nature makes it ideal for containerization. Security considerations include container image security, secure orchestration, and network policies.
* **Cloud Platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP):** Helidon integrates well with cloud services. Security best practices for cloud deployments, such as IAM roles, security groups, and encryption, are essential.
* **Traditional Application Servers:** While optimized for cloud-native, Helidon MP applications can be deployed in traditional Java EE application servers. Security configurations of the application server must be considered.
* **Standalone JAR:** Helidon SE applications can be packaged as self-contained executable JAR files. Security involves protecting the JAR file and the environment it runs in.

### 5.5. Technology Stack

* **Java:** The primary programming language for Helidon development.
* **Netty:**  Provides the foundation for the non-blocking, event-driven web server.
* **MicroProfile (for Helidon MP):**  A collection of specifications for building portable cloud-native microservices.
* **CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection):**  Used for managing dependencies and application components.
* **JSON-B (JSON Binding):**  For serializing and deserializing Java objects to and from JSON.
* **RESTeasy (for Helidon MP):**  An implementation of the JAX-RS specification for building RESTful APIs.
* **Security Libraries:**  Integrations with various security standards and libraries (e.g., JWT, OAuth 2.0, JCA/JCE providers).

## 6. Security Considerations (For Threat Modeling)
