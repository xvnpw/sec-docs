*   **Attack Surface:** Exposure of Helidon Management Endpoints
    *   **Description:** Helidon exposes endpoints for managing the application, including health checks, metrics, and potentially configuration. If not properly secured, these endpoints can reveal sensitive information or allow for unauthorized actions.
    *   **How Helidon Contributes:** Helidon provides built-in endpoints for these management functions, making them readily available if not explicitly secured. The default configuration might not enforce strict authentication or authorization on these endpoints.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could access the `/health` endpoint without authentication to understand the application's status and potentially identify failing components. More critically, an unsecured `/metrics` endpoint could expose detailed performance data, revealing internal workings and potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for denial-of-service by overloading management endpoints, and in severe cases, unauthorized modification of application configuration if configuration management endpoints are exposed without proper security.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement Authentication and Authorization: Secure all management endpoints using Helidon's security features or integrate with an external authentication/authorization provider.
        *   Restrict Access: Limit access to management endpoints to specific IP addresses or networks.
        *   Disable Unnecessary Endpoints: If certain management endpoints are not required, disable them in the Helidon configuration.
        *   Review Default Configurations: Ensure that default security settings for management endpoints are reviewed and hardened.

*   **Attack Surface:** Configuration Injection through External Sources
    *   **Description:** Helidon allows configuration to be sourced from various external sources (e.g., environment variables, system properties, configuration files). If these sources are controllable by an attacker, they could inject malicious configuration values.
    *   **How Helidon Contributes:** Helidon's flexible configuration mechanism, while powerful, can be a vulnerability if not carefully managed. It automatically loads configuration from multiple sources, increasing the potential attack surface.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could set a malicious environment variable that overrides a critical application setting, such as a database connection string or an API key.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the application, including data breaches, unauthorized access, and code execution, depending on the injected configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Control Configuration Sources: Limit the sources from which Helidon loads configuration, especially in production environments.
        *   Input Validation and Sanitization: If external configuration sources are necessary, validate and sanitize the input to prevent malicious values from being loaded.
        *   Principle of Least Privilege: Run the application with the minimum necessary permissions to limit the impact of configuration injection.
        *   Secure Configuration Storage: Protect configuration files and environment variables from unauthorized access.

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in Custom HTTP Handlers
    *   **Description:** Developers can create custom HTTP handlers in Helidon to implement specific application logic. Vulnerabilities within these custom handlers can introduce significant security risks.
    *   **How Helidon Contributes:** Helidon provides the framework for creating and registering these custom handlers. The security of these handlers is the responsibility of the developer.
    *   **Example:** A custom handler might not properly sanitize user input, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) or SQL injection vulnerabilities if it interacts with a database. Another example is a handler that exposes sensitive data without proper authorization checks.
    *   **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including data breaches, unauthorized access, code execution, and denial-of-service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure Coding Practices: Follow secure coding guidelines when developing custom HTTP handlers, including input validation, output encoding, and proper error handling.
        *   Security Reviews and Testing: Conduct thorough security reviews and penetration testing of custom handlers.
        *   Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure custom handlers only have access to the resources they absolutely need.
        *   Framework Security Features: Utilize Helidon's built-in security features (e.g., authentication, authorization) within custom handlers.

*   **Attack Surface:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Helidon relies on various third-party libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited if not properly managed.
    *   **How Helidon Contributes:** Helidon's functionality is built upon these dependencies, making the application vulnerable if those dependencies have known security flaws.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in a logging library used by Helidon could allow an attacker to inject malicious log entries that lead to code execution.
    *   **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability in the dependency, including remote code execution, denial-of-service, and data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Dependency Management: Use a robust dependency management tool (like Maven or Gradle) to track and manage dependencies.
        *   Vulnerability Scanning: Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk.
        *   Keep Dependencies Updated:  Keep Helidon and all its dependencies updated to the latest stable versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor Security Advisories: Stay informed about security advisories for Helidon and its dependencies.
