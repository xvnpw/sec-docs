### High and Critical Helidon-Specific Threats

This list contains threats with high or critical severity that directly involve Helidon components.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Default Configurations
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit default, insecure configurations present in a Helidon application. This might involve accessing default administrative interfaces with default credentials or exploiting permissive CORS policies to perform cross-site scripting attacks.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the application or its resources, or the ability to perform actions on behalf of legitimate users.
    *   **Affected Helidon Component:**  Helidon Nima/SE/MP Core, Configuration API, Security module, WebServer.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Change all default credentials for administrative interfaces immediately upon deployment.
        *   Explicitly configure CORS policies to restrict allowed origins.
        *   Harden default settings by following security best practices and Helidon documentation.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Configuration Details
    *   **Description:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive configuration details, such as database credentials or API keys. This could happen through accessing configuration files stored without proper encryption or exploiting vulnerabilities in how Helidon handles environment variables.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the application and potentially connected systems, unauthorized access to data, and the ability to impersonate the application.
    *   **Affected Helidon Component:** Helidon Nima/SE/MP Core, Configuration API.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing secrets directly in configuration files. Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets).
        *   Encrypt sensitive data within configuration files if direct storage is unavoidable.
        *   Ensure proper access controls and permissions are in place for configuration files and environment variables.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Helidon's MicroProfile Implementations
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities within Helidon's implementation of MicroProfile specifications (e.g., JAX-RS, CDI, Fault Tolerance). This might involve crafting specific requests to bypass security filters, injecting malicious components through CDI, or causing denial of service through flaws in the Fault Tolerance implementation.
    *   **Impact:**  Bypassing security controls, executing arbitrary code, denial of service, and information disclosure.
    *   **Affected Helidon Component:** Helidon MP modules (e.g., `helidon-microprofile-jaxrs`, `helidon-microprofile-cdi`, `helidon-microprofile-fault-tolerance`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Helidon dependencies up-to-date to benefit from security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Helidon and its dependencies.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when using MicroProfile features.

*   **Threat:** Incorrect Usage of MicroProfile Features
    *   **Description:** Developers might incorrectly use MicroProfile features, leading to security vulnerabilities. For example, misconfiguring JAX-RS security annotations could result in unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access and potential for further exploitation.
    *   **Affected Helidon Component:** Helidon MP modules (e.g., `helidon-microprofile-jaxrs`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Provide thorough training to developers on secure usage of MicroProfile features.
        *   Implement code reviews to identify potential security flaws in MicroProfile usage.
        *   Utilize static analysis tools to detect potential misconfigurations.

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities in Helidon's MicroProfile Libraries
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in the underlying libraries used by Helidon's MicroProfile implementations. This could involve crafting specific inputs or requests that trigger vulnerabilities in these dependencies.
    *   **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, denial of service, and information disclosure.
    *   **Affected Helidon Component:**  Various Helidon MP modules and their dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Helidon and its dependencies to the latest versions.
        *   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify and manage known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories for vulnerabilities in used libraries.

*   **Threat:** Bypass Vulnerabilities in Helidon Security
    *   **Description:** An attacker could discover and exploit vulnerabilities in Helidon's own security features, allowing them to bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms. This could involve flaws in how Helidon handles authentication tokens or authorization policies.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the application and its resources, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.
    *   **Affected Helidon Component:** Helidon Security module (`helidon-security-*`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Helidon Security modules up-to-date.
        *   Thoroughly test security configurations and implementations.
        *   Follow security best practices when configuring Helidon Security.

*   **Threat:** Incorrect Configuration of Helidon Security
    *   **Description:** Developers might misconfigure Helidon's security features, leading to weaknesses. This could involve setting up weak authentication schemes or defining overly permissive authorization policies.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and potential compromise of the application.
    *   **Affected Helidon Component:** Helidon Security module (`helidon-security-*`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring authorization policies.
        *   Use strong and recommended authentication schemes.
        *   Regularly review and audit security configurations.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Helidon Client Libraries
    *   **Description:** If the application uses Helidon's client libraries to interact with other services, vulnerabilities in these client libraries could be exploited by malicious servers or through compromised network connections.
    *   **Impact:**  Information disclosure, remote code execution on the client application, and potential compromise of the application.
    *   **Affected Helidon Component:** Helidon client libraries (e.g., `helidon-webclient`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Helidon client libraries up-to-date.
        *   Validate responses from external services.
        *   Use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) when interacting with external services.

*   **Threat:** Logging of Sensitive Information
    *   **Description:** Helidon's default logging configuration or developer practices might lead to the logging of sensitive information, such as user credentials or API keys. Attackers gaining access to these logs could exploit this information.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breaches, identity theft, and potential regulatory violations.
    *   **Affected Helidon Component:** Helidon Logging framework.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Review and adjust logging configurations to avoid logging sensitive information in production.
        *   Implement mechanisms to redact or mask sensitive data before logging.
        *   Secure access to log files.
