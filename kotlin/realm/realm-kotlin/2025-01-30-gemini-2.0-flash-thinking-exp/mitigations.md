# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for realm/realm-kotlin

## Mitigation Strategy: [Encrypt Sensitive Data at Rest](./mitigation_strategies/encrypt_sensitive_data_at_rest.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Choose a strong encryption key:** Generate a cryptographically secure key (e.g., 256-bit AES).
    2.  **Securely store the encryption key:** Utilize platform-specific secure storage (Android Keystore, iOS Keychain). Avoid hardcoding keys. Consider key derivation from user secrets.
    3.  **Enable Realm file encryption:** Provide the encryption key during Realm instance configuration. Realm will encrypt the database file on disk.
**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Breach due to physical device theft/loss (High Severity): Unencrypted Realm files expose data if devices are compromised.
    *   Data Breach due to unauthorized file system access (Medium Severity): Malware could access unencrypted Realm files.
    *   Data Leakage during device disposal (Medium Severity): Unencrypted data can be recovered from improperly wiped devices.
**Impact:**
    *   Data Breach due to physical device theft/loss: High Risk Reduction - Encryption renders data unreadable without the key.
    *   Data Breach due to unauthorized file system access: Medium Risk Reduction - Encryption significantly hinders unauthorized access.
    *   Data Leakage during device disposal: Medium Risk Reduction - Encryption protects data even if devices are not properly wiped.
**Currently Implemented:** Realm file encryption is enabled using a key derived from user-specific salt and device-specific secret in secure storage.
**Missing Implementation:** Key rotation strategy is not formally defined and automated.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Realm File Location](./mitigation_strategies/secure_realm_file_location.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Understand Default Location:** Know the default Realm file paths on Android and iOS (application-private directories).
    2.  **Avoid Public Locations:** Do not store Realm files in public directories (e.g., SD card root). Use application-private storage.
    3.  **Restrict File System Permissions (Advanced):** On platforms allowing it, further restrict access to the Realm file directory using platform APIs. (Often complex and may not be necessary due to OS sandboxing).
**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Breach due to misconfiguration (Low to Medium Severity): Accidental public placement of Realm files increases vulnerability.
    *   Data Breach in rooted/jailbroken environments (Medium Severity): Weakened OS sandboxing in compromised environments could expose files if permissions are lax.
**Impact:**
    *   Data Breach due to misconfiguration: Medium Risk Reduction - Private location significantly reduces accidental public exposure.
    *   Data Breach in rooted/jailbroken environments: Low to Medium Risk Reduction - Adds a minor defense layer even in compromised environments.
**Currently Implemented:** Realm uses default application-private storage on Android and iOS.
**Missing Implementation:** No runtime checks to verify secure file location. No platform-specific file permission hardening beyond default OS sandboxing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Secure Communication (TLS/SSL) for Realm Sync](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_secure_communication__tlsssl__for_realm_sync.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Enable HTTPS on Realm Object Server (ROS):** Configure ROS to use HTTPS for all client-server communication.
    2.  **Use Valid SSL Certificates:** Ensure ROS uses valid, properly configured SSL certificates.
    3.  **Disable Insecure Protocols:** Disable or restrict insecure communication protocols if possible on ROS.
    4.  **Client-Side Verification:**  (Realm Kotlin handles this implicitly) Realm Kotlin clients will typically enforce TLS/SSL for connections to ROS.
**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks (High Severity): Without TLS/SSL, attackers can intercept and potentially modify data transmitted between the client and ROS.
    *   Data Eavesdropping (High Severity): Unencrypted communication allows attackers to eavesdrop on sensitive data being synced.
**Impact:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks: High Risk Reduction - TLS/SSL encryption prevents attackers from intercepting and manipulating communication.
    *   Data Eavesdropping: High Risk Reduction - Encryption protects data confidentiality during transmission.
**Currently Implemented:** Realm Sync is configured to use HTTPS with valid SSL certificates for all communication.
**Missing Implementation:** No explicit checks within the application to verify secure connection establishment to ROS.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Strong Authentication and Authorization for Realm Sync](./mitigation_strategies/implement_strong_authentication_and_authorization_for_realm_sync.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Realm Sync Authentication:** Use Realm Sync's built-in authentication mechanisms (e.g., username/password, custom authentication providers).
    2.  **Define Authorization Rules on ROS:** Configure ROS authorization rules to control user access to specific Realm data based on roles and permissions.
    3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the necessary permissions to access and modify data.
    4.  **Regularly Review Permissions:** Periodically review and update ROS authorization rules to reflect changing application needs and security requirements.
**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access via Sync (High Severity): Weak authentication/authorization allows unauthorized users to access synced data.
    *   Data Modification by Unauthorized Users via Sync (High Severity): Lack of proper authorization can lead to unauthorized data changes through sync.
    *   Account Compromise leading to data breach (High Severity): Weak authentication makes accounts easier to compromise, potentially exposing synced data.
**Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access via Sync: High Risk Reduction - Strong authentication and authorization prevent unauthorized access.
    *   Data Modification by Unauthorized Users via Sync: High Risk Reduction - Authorization controls who can modify synced data.
    *   Account Compromise leading to data breach: High Risk Reduction - Stronger authentication makes account compromise more difficult.
**Currently Implemented:** Realm Sync uses username/password authentication. Basic role-based authorization is configured on ROS.
**Missing Implementation:** Granular permission control on ROS could be improved. No formal audit logging of sync access attempts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization for Synced Data](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_for_synced_data.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Treat Synced Data as Untrusted:**  Assume data received via Realm Sync, especially from other users or external sources, is potentially untrusted.
    2.  **Apply Validation Rules:** Implement validation logic for synced data, similar to data validation for local inputs.
    3.  **Sanitize Synced Data:** Sanitize synced data before displaying it in UI or using it in sensitive operations (e.g., HTML escaping, input encoding).
    4.  **Server-Side Validation (ROS):** Ideally, implement validation on the Realm Object Server as well to prevent invalid data from being synced in the first place.
**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or similar injection attacks via synced data (Medium Severity): Unsanitized synced data displayed in UI can lead to injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Data Corruption due to malicious synced data (Low to Medium Severity): Malicious or malformed data synced from other sources can corrupt local Realm data.
**Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or similar injection attacks via synced data: Medium Risk Reduction - Sanitization neutralizes malicious code in synced data.
    *   Data Corruption due to malicious synced data: Low to Medium Risk Reduction - Validation and sanitization reduce the risk of data corruption from synced sources.
**Currently Implemented:** Basic HTML escaping is used in some UI components displaying synced data. No server-side validation on ROS.
**Missing Implementation:** Comprehensive validation and sanitization for all synced data types. Server-side validation on ROS.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting and DoS Prevention for Realm Sync](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_and_dos_prevention_for_realm_sync.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Implement Rate Limiting on ROS:** Configure rate limiting on the Realm Object Server to restrict the number of sync requests from a single client or IP address within a given time period.
    2.  **Monitor Sync Traffic:** Monitor ROS for unusual or excessive sync activity that could indicate a DoS attack.
    3.  **Resource Limits on ROS:** Configure appropriate resource limits (e.g., connection limits, memory limits) on ROS to prevent resource exhaustion from malicious sync requests.
**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks via excessive sync requests (Medium to High Severity): Attackers can flood the ROS with sync requests, potentially overwhelming the server and making the application unavailable.
**Impact:**
    *   Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks via excessive sync requests: Medium to High Risk Reduction - Rate limiting and resource limits mitigate the impact of DoS attacks by preventing server overload.
**Currently Implemented:** Basic rate limiting is configured on ROS.
**Missing Implementation:** More sophisticated DoS prevention mechanisms (e.g., anomaly detection, adaptive rate limiting).  No automated alerts for suspicious sync traffic patterns.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Realm Kotlin Library Up-to-Date](./mitigation_strategies/keep_realm_kotlin_library_up-to-date.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Regularly Check for Updates:** Monitor Realm Kotlin release notes and update channels for new versions.
    2.  **Apply Updates Promptly:** Update the Realm Kotlin library to the latest stable version as soon as reasonably possible after release.
    3.  **Review Release Notes:** Carefully review release notes for security patches and bug fixes included in updates.
**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in Realm Kotlin library (Variable Severity): Outdated libraries may contain known security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
**Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in Realm Kotlin library: Variable Risk Reduction - Keeping the library updated ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched, reducing the risk of exploitation.
**Currently Implemented:** We have a process to check for library updates periodically, but updates are not always applied immediately.
**Missing Implementation:** Automated dependency update checks and alerts.  Formalized process for prioritizing and applying security updates for Realm Kotlin and other dependencies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Dynamic Queries and String-Based Operations in Realm Kotlin](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_dynamic_queries_and_string-based_operations_in_realm_kotlin.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Use Type-Safe Query API:** Utilize Realm Kotlin's type-safe query builder API for constructing queries.
    2.  **Avoid String Concatenation for Queries:** Do not construct queries using string concatenation or dynamic string building.
    3.  **Parameterize Queries (If Necessary):** If dynamic query parameters are needed, use parameterized queries provided by Realm Kotlin (if available and applicable) or carefully sanitize inputs before incorporating them into queries (though type-safe API is preferred).
**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Injection Vulnerabilities (e.g., Realm Query Injection - Low to Medium Severity): Constructing queries dynamically using strings can potentially introduce injection vulnerabilities if user inputs or untrusted data are incorporated without proper sanitization (though Realm Kotlin's type-safe API significantly reduces this risk compared to string-based query languages).
**Impact:**
    *   Injection Vulnerabilities: Low to Medium Risk Reduction - Using the type-safe query API largely eliminates the risk of injection vulnerabilities in Realm queries.
**Currently Implemented:** We primarily use the type-safe query API provided by Realm Kotlin.
**Missing Implementation:** Code review processes to specifically check for and prevent dynamic query construction using strings.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Key Management for Realm Encryption](./mitigation_strategies/secure_key_management_for_realm_encryption.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Do Not Hardcode Keys:** Never hardcode encryption keys directly in the application code.
    2.  **Use Secure Storage:** Utilize platform-specific secure storage mechanisms (Android Keystore, iOS Keychain) to store and manage encryption keys.
    3.  **Key Derivation (Consider):** Derive encryption keys from user secrets or device-specific secrets combined with salts for added security.
    4.  **Key Rotation (Consider):** Implement a key rotation strategy to periodically change encryption keys.
**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Encryption Key Compromise (High Severity): If encryption keys are hardcoded or stored insecurely, attackers can potentially extract them and decrypt the Realm database.
**Impact:**
    *   Encryption Key Compromise: High Risk Reduction - Secure key management significantly reduces the risk of key compromise and unauthorized decryption of data.
**Currently Implemented:** Encryption keys are not hardcoded and are stored in platform-specific secure storage. Key derivation is implemented.
**Missing Implementation:** Formalized and automated key rotation strategy.  Regular security audits of key management practices.
