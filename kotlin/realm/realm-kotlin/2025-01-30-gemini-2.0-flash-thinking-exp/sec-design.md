# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Provide a mobile database solution that is efficient, easy to use, and performant for Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) developers.
 - Enable developers to build offline-first applications with seamless data synchronization capabilities.
 - Offer a robust and reliable data management solution for mobile applications, reducing development complexity and time to market.
 - Support a wide range of mobile platforms and architectures through Kotlin Multiplatform.
 - Foster a strong open-source community around Realm Kotlin, encouraging contributions and adoption.
- Business Risks:
 - Data integrity and consistency issues leading to application malfunction or data loss.
 - Security vulnerabilities in the database or synchronization components potentially exposing sensitive user data.
 - Performance bottlenecks impacting user experience and application responsiveness.
 - Compatibility issues across different mobile platforms and Kotlin versions.
 - Developer adoption challenges due to complexity, lack of documentation, or perceived instability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Code reviews are conducted for contributions to the project. (Location: GitHub Pull Request process)
 - security control: Unit and integration tests are implemented to ensure code correctness and prevent regressions. (Location: GitHub repository - test directories)
 - security control: Reliance on operating system level security features for data storage and access control on mobile devices. (Location: Implicit in mobile application development)
 - accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies. (Location: Implicit risk in software development)
 - accepted risk: Potential for security misconfigurations by developers using the library in their applications. (Location: Implicit risk in library usage)
- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement automated static application security testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
 - security control: Integrate dependency scanning tools to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
 - security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits of the Realm Kotlin library and its components.
 - security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices documentation for developers using Realm Kotlin to build secure applications.
 - security control: Implement a process for security vulnerability reporting and response.
- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Requirement: Realm Kotlin itself does not handle user authentication. Applications using Realm Kotlin are responsible for implementing their own authentication mechanisms to verify user identity.
  - Requirement: If Realm Sync is used, it should support secure authentication mechanisms to verify client and server identities.
 - Authorization:
  - Requirement: Realm Kotlin should provide mechanisms for applications to implement fine-grained authorization to control access to data within the Realm database.
  - Requirement: If Realm Sync is used, it should enforce authorization rules to ensure users only access data they are permitted to see and modify.
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement: Realm Kotlin should perform input validation to prevent injection attacks and data corruption when handling data from applications or external sources (e.g., Realm Sync).
  - Requirement: Applications using Realm Kotlin should validate user inputs before storing them in the Realm database.
 - Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Realm Kotlin should provide options for encrypting data at rest within the Realm database on mobile devices to protect sensitive information.
  - Requirement: If Realm Sync is used, it must encrypt data in transit between the client and server to ensure confidentiality and integrity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Secure and reliable data storage and retrieval within mobile applications.
 - Maintaining data integrity and consistency for applications using Realm Kotlin.
 - Ensuring the availability and performance of the Realm Kotlin library.
 - Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of user data managed by applications using Realm Kotlin.
- Data Sensitivity:
 - Data handled by Realm Kotlin depends entirely on the applications using it.
 - Sensitivity can range from low (application settings, non-sensitive data) to high (personal data, financial information, health records) depending on the application's purpose.
 - The sensitivity level is determined by the application developers and the nature of the data they choose to store in Realm databases.
 - Potential impact of data breaches or data loss varies significantly based on the sensitivity of the data stored in applications using Realm Kotlin.
