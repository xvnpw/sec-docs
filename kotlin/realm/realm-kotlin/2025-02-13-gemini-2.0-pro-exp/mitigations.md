# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for realm/realm-kotlin

## Mitigation Strategy: [Encryption at Rest (Realm Encryption)](./mitigation_strategies/encryption_at_rest__realm_encryption_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Key Generation:** Generate a 64-byte (512-bit) cryptographically secure random key.  Do *not* use a password directly; use a key derivation function (KDF) if deriving the key from a password.
    2.  **Secure Key Storage:** (This part is *external* to Realm, but crucial.  I'm including it for completeness, but it's not a Realm API.) Use platform-specific secure storage (Android Keystore, iOS Keychain, etc.).
    3.  **Realm Configuration:**  Pass the key to the `RealmConfiguration` when opening the Realm using the `.encryptionKey()` method:
        ```kotlin
        val config = RealmConfiguration.Builder(schema = setOf(MyRealmObject::class))
            .encryptionKey(realmKey) // realmKey from secure storage
            .build()
        val realm = Realm.open(config)
        ```
    4.  **Key Rotation:** Use Realm's `Realm.writeCopyTo()` to re-encrypt the Realm with a new key.  This is a Realm-specific API call.  You provide the new configuration (with the new key) to this method.
        ```kotlin
        // Assuming you have a 'newRealmKey' and 'oldRealm'
        val newConfig = RealmConfiguration.Builder(schema = setOf(MyRealmObject::class))
            .encryptionKey(newRealmKey)
            .build()

        oldRealm.writeCopyTo(newConfig) // Re-encrypts the data
        ```
    5.  **User-Based Keys (if applicable):** If you have multiple users, derive a unique key per user.  The key *derivation* is external to Realm, but you'd use the resulting key with `.encryptionKey()` as above.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breach from Device Compromise (Severity: Critical):**  Protects against unauthorized access to the Realm database file.
    *   **Data Tampering (Severity: High):**  Encryption (with authenticated encryption) provides integrity checks.
    *   **Reverse Engineering (Severity: Medium):** Makes data extraction harder.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach from Device Compromise:** Risk reduced from *Critical* to *Low*.
    *   **Data Tampering:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Low*.
    *   **Reverse Engineering:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**  [**FILL IN:** e.g., "Implemented using Android Keystore.  `writeCopyTo` used for key rotation."]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [**FILL IN:** e.g., "User-based keys are not used, even though the application supports multiple users."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Fine-Grained Access Control (Realm Query-Based Permissions - *Realm Sync Only*)](./mitigation_strategies/fine-grained_access_control__realm_query-based_permissions_-_realm_sync_only_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Roles and Permissions:** Define roles and the permissions each role should have.
    2.  **Implement Permission Rules:** Use Realm's query-based permissions system (configured in the Realm Cloud UI or via the Admin API).  These rules are written in a JavaScript-like syntax.  This is *entirely* within the Realm ecosystem.
        ```javascript
        // Example (in the Realm Cloud UI)
        {
          "roles": ["user"],
          "rules": {
            "MyObject": {
              "read": "owner == '%user.id'",
              "write": "owner == '%user.id'"
            }
          }
        }
        ```
    3.  **Assign Roles to Users:** (This is often done *outside* of Realm's direct APIs, in your application's user management, but it *affects* how Realm permissions work.)
    4.  **Test Permissions:** Thoroughly test your permission rules.  This testing often involves interacting with the Realm SDK to simulate different users.
    5.  **Regular Audits:** Periodically review your permission rules (within the Realm Cloud UI or via the Admin API).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (Severity: Critical):** Prevents unauthorized access via Realm Sync.
    *   **Unauthorized Data Modification (Severity: High):** Prevents unauthorized modification via Realm Sync.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):**  Limits the impact of compromised accounts.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Risk reduced from *Critical* to *Low*.
    *   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Low*.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [**FILL IN:** e.g., "Basic permission rules implemented. Rules allow users to read/write their own data."]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [**FILL IN:** e.g., "No automated testing of permission rules within the CI/CD pipeline."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Validation (Schema Enforcement)](./mitigation_strategies/data_validation__schema_enforcement_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Realm Schema Definition:** Define your Realm object model using Realm's schema definition features.  This is *fundamental* to how Realm works.
        *   Use specific data types (`Int`, `String`, `Boolean`, `Date`, `RealmList`, `RealmSet`, etc.).
        *   Use `@Required` for non-nullable fields.
        *   Use `@PrimaryKey` for unique identifiers.
        *   Use `@Index` to improve query performance (and, indirectly, security by making brute-force attempts slower).
        ```kotlin
        open class MyObject : RealmObject {
            @PrimaryKey
            var id: Int = 0

            @Required
            var name: String = ""

            var age: Int? = null // Optional

            @Index
            var email: String = ""
        }
        ```
    2.  **Input Validation (Before Writing to Realm):** While *additional* validation is recommended (and often done outside of Realm's direct APIs), Realm's schema *enforces* the basic types and `@Required` constraints.  This is a *direct* Realm mitigation.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Corruption (Severity: Medium):** Prevents invalid data types from being stored.
    *   **Logic Errors (Severity: Low):** Enforces basic data integrity constraints.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.
    *   **Logic Errors:** Risk reduced from *Low* to *Very Low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [**FILL IN:** e.g., "Realm schema defined with data types, `@Required`, and `@PrimaryKey`."]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [**FILL IN:** e.g., "No `@Index` annotations used on frequently queried fields."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Object Deletion (Basic Deletion)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_object_deletion__basic_deletion_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Standard Deletion:** Use `Realm.delete()` or `Realm.deleteFromRealm()` (or the newer `delete()` within a `write` block) to remove objects from the Realm.  This is the *core* Realm deletion API.
        ```kotlin
        realm.write {
            val myObject = query<MyObject>("id == $0", objectId).first().find()
            myObject?.let { delete(it) }
        }
        ```
       2. **Shredding:** While the *shredding* logic itself is not part of the Realm API, the fact that you are *modifying* the Realm object *before* calling Realm's `delete()` makes this relevant. You are using Realm's write transaction to perform the shredding.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Recovery After Deletion (Severity: Low to Medium):** Reduces the chance of simple data recovery.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Recovery After Deletion:** Risk reduced from *Low/Medium* to *Low* (without shredding) or *Very Low* (with shredding).

*   **Currently Implemented:** [**FILL IN:** e.g., "Standard `delete()` used within `write` blocks."]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [**FILL IN:** e.g., "Shredding not implemented."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Threading Considerations (Realm's Threading Model)](./mitigation_strategies/threading_considerations__realm's_threading_model_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Thread Confinement:** Use `Realm.open()` (or `Realm.getInstance()`) on *each* thread that needs to access the database.  This is a fundamental requirement of Realm's threading model.
    2.  **Transactions:** Use `Realm.write` (or the older `Realm.executeTransaction`) to ensure write operations are atomic.  This is a core Realm API for safe writes.
    3.  **Refreshing:** Use `Realm.refresh()` to update a Realm instance with changes from other threads. This is a Realm-provided method.
    4.  **Kotlin Coroutines:** Use Realm's `asFlow()` and suspend functions for asynchronous database operations.  These are Realm-provided extensions for coroutine integration.
    5. **Object Passing:** Avoid passing live Realm objects between threads. Use detached copies (obtained via `Realm.copyFromRealm()`, a Realm API) or pass primary keys and re-fetch the object on the other thread.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Application Crashes (Severity: High):** Prevents crashes from incorrect thread access.
    *   **Data Corruption (Severity: High):** Prevents data corruption from unsynchronized concurrent access.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Application Crashes:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Very Low*.
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Very Low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [**FILL IN:** e.g., "Kotlin Coroutines and `asFlow()` used. `Realm.write` used for transactions."]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [**FILL IN:** e.g., "`copyFromRealm()` not consistently used when passing data between coroutines."]
