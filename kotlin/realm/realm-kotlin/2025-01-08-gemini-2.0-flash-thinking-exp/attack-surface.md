# Attack Surface Analysis for realm/realm-kotlin

## Attack Surface: [Native Library Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/native_library_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Security flaws residing within the underlying native Realm Core library (written in C++). These could include memory corruption bugs, buffer overflows, or other low-level vulnerabilities.

**How realm-kotlin Contributes:** Realm Kotlin directly depends on and interacts with the native Realm Core library via JNI. Any vulnerability in the native library directly impacts applications using Realm Kotlin.

**Example:** A buffer overflow in the native query parsing logic could be triggered by a specially crafted query, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** Critical. Exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the application and potentially the device.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Rely on the Realm team to promptly identify and patch vulnerabilities in the Realm Core library.
* Keep the Realm Kotlin SDK updated to benefit from the latest security fixes in the underlying native library.

## Attack Surface: [Local Realm File Security](./attack_surfaces/local_realm_file_security.md)

**Description:** Unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of the local Realm database file stored on the user's device.

**How realm-kotlin Contributes:** Realm Kotlin manages the creation, access, and persistence of this local database file. Insecure default permissions or lack of proper encryption can expose the data.

**Example:** On an unrooted Android device, if the Realm file is not encrypted, another application with sufficient permissions could potentially read or modify the database. On a rooted device, the risk is even higher.

**Impact:** High. Exposure of sensitive data stored within the Realm database. Potential for data tampering or denial of service by deleting the database.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Enable Realm encryption:** Utilize Realm's built-in encryption feature to protect the database at rest.
* **Secure key management:**  Store the encryption key securely using platform-specific secure storage mechanisms (e.g., Android Keystore, iOS Keychain). Avoid hardcoding keys.

## Attack Surface: [Encryption Key Management Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/encryption_key_management_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Weak or insecure handling of the encryption key used to protect the local Realm database.

**How realm-kotlin Contributes:** If encryption is enabled, Realm Kotlin relies on the developer to provide and manage the encryption key. Improper handling of this key negates the benefits of encryption.

**Example:** Storing the encryption key in shared preferences, hardcoding it in the application code, or transmitting it insecurely.

**Impact:** Critical. If the encryption key is compromised, the entire Realm database can be decrypted, exposing all stored data.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Utilize platform-specific secure storage:** Store the encryption key in the Android Keystore or iOS Keychain.
* **Avoid hardcoding keys:** Never embed the encryption key directly in the application code.

## Attack Surface: [Synchronization Authentication and Authorization Bypass (if using Realm Object Server/MongoDB Atlas App Services)](./attack_surfaces/synchronization_authentication_and_authorization_bypass__if_using_realm_object_servermongodb_atlas_a_31e18eee.md)

**Description:**  Circumventing the authentication and authorization mechanisms of the Realm Object Server or MongoDB Atlas App Services, allowing unauthorized access to synchronized data.

**How realm-kotlin Contributes:** Realm Kotlin is the client-side SDK used to connect to and interact with the synchronization service. Vulnerabilities in how the SDK handles authentication tokens or authorization checks could be exploited.

**Example:**  A flaw in the token refresh mechanism could allow an attacker to obtain a valid access token without proper credentials.

**Impact:** Critical. Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential for data manipulation or deletion across all synchronized clients.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Enforce strong authentication:** Utilize robust authentication methods provided by Realm Object Server/MongoDB Atlas App Services.
* **Implement fine-grained authorization rules:** Define clear and restrictive permissions on the server-side.
* **Secure token handling:** Ensure proper storage and handling of authentication tokens on the client-side.

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection or Tampering During Synchronization (if using Realm Object Server/MongoDB Atlas App Services)](./attack_surfaces/data_injection_or_tampering_during_synchronization__if_using_realm_object_servermongodb_atlas_app_se_55ddd983.md)

**Description:** Maliciously injecting or modifying data during the synchronization process between the client and the server.

**How realm-kotlin Contributes:** If the communication channel is not properly secured, an attacker could intercept and manipulate data being exchanged through the Realm Kotlin client.

**Example:** A man-in-the-middle attacker intercepts a synchronization request and modifies the data before it reaches the server, or vice-versa.

**Impact:** High. Data corruption, inconsistencies across synchronized clients, potential for malicious data to be propagated to other users.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Enforce HTTPS:** Ensure all communication with the Realm Object Server/MongoDB Atlas App Services is over HTTPS with proper certificate validation.
* **Implement server-side validation:** Always validate data received from clients on the server-side.

## Attack Surface: [Kotlin SDK API Misuse Leading to Security Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/kotlin_sdk_api_misuse_leading_to_security_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Developers using the Realm Kotlin API in an insecure manner, unintentionally creating vulnerabilities in their application.

**How realm-kotlin Contributes:** The complexity of the API, if not fully understood, can lead to incorrect usage that introduces security flaws.

**Example:**  Constructing dynamic Realm queries based on unsanitized user input, potentially leading to data leakage or unintended data access.

**Impact:** High. Can lead to data leaks or unintended data access.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Follow secure coding practices:**  Educate developers on secure usage of the Realm Kotlin API.
* **Perform thorough input validation:** Sanitize and validate all user inputs before using them in Realm queries or data operations.
* **Conduct code reviews:**  Have experienced developers review code that interacts with Realm.
