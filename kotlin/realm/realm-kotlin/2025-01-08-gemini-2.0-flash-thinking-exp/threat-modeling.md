# Threat Model Analysis for realm/realm-kotlin

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Unencrypted Realm Files](./threats/information_disclosure_through_unencrypted_realm_files.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains physical access to a device (e.g., through loss or theft) and accesses the unencrypted Realm database file created and managed by `realm-kotlin`. They can then read and extract sensitive data stored within the database using Realm tools or custom scripts.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, potentially leading to identity theft, financial loss, privacy violations, and reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** Realm file on disk (managed by `realm-kotlin`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Always enable Realm database encryption using the encryption configuration options provided by `realm-kotlin`. Implement secure key management practices, avoiding hardcoding keys in the application.

## Threat: [Data Tampering on the File System](./threats/data_tampering_on_the_file_system.md)

**Description:** An attacker with physical access to the device modifies the Realm database file directly, corrupting data or injecting malicious data. This is possible because `realm-kotlin` stores data in a file accessible on the file system. This could lead to application malfunction, incorrect data processing, or the introduction of vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Data corruption, application instability, potential security breaches if malicious data is introduced and processed by the application.

**Affected Component:** Realm file on disk (managed by `realm-kotlin`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement integrity checks within the application to detect unexpected data modifications in the Realm database. Consider using platform-specific file system permissions to restrict access to the Realm database file.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Sync Connections (if using Realm Sync)](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attacks_on_sync_connections__if_using_realm_sync_.md)

**Description:** When using Realm Sync, an attacker intercepts network traffic between the client application (using `realm-kotlin`'s sync features) and the Realm Object Server (or Atlas). If the connection is not properly secured with HTTPS/TLS, the attacker can eavesdrop on the synchronized data, potentially stealing sensitive information or even modifying data in transit.

**Impact:** Exposure of synchronized data, potential data manipulation, and compromise of user credentials if they are transmitted insecurely.

**Affected Component:** Realm Sync Client Module within `realm-kotlin`, network communication layer used by `realm-kotlin`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Ensure that `realm-kotlin` is configured to enforce HTTPS/TLS for all Realm Sync connections. Utilize the options within `realm-kotlin`'s sync configuration to verify server certificates.

## Threat: [Compromised Sync Credentials (if using Realm Sync)](./threats/compromised_sync_credentials__if_using_realm_sync_.md)

**Description:** An attacker obtains valid credentials (username/password, API keys, etc.) used by `realm-kotlin` to authenticate with the Realm Object Server or Atlas. This could be through various means outside of `realm-kotlin` itself, but if these credentials are used within the `realm-kotlin` application, it allows the attacker to access and manipulate data on the server as a legitimate user.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to synchronized data, potential data breaches, manipulation of shared data, and impersonation of legitimate users.

**Affected Component:** Realm Sync Client Module within `realm-kotlin` (authentication mechanisms used by the library).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement secure storage and management of sync credentials used by `realm-kotlin`. Avoid hardcoding credentials. Consider using secure authentication flows and leveraging platform-specific secure storage mechanisms.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Realm Core (Native Layer)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_realm_core__native_layer_.md)

**Description:** `realm-kotlin` relies on a native core library (written in C++). Security vulnerabilities within this core library could potentially be exploited, leading to crashes, data corruption, or even remote code execution within the context of the application using `realm-kotlin`.

**Impact:** Application crashes, data corruption within the Realm database managed by `realm-kotlin`, potential for arbitrary code execution on the user's device.

**Affected Component:** Realm Core (native library integrated with `realm-kotlin`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Stay updated with the latest `realm-kotlin` releases, as these often include security patches for the underlying core library. Monitor Realm's security advisories and release notes.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Realm Kotlin Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_realm_kotlin_dependencies.md)

**Description:** `realm-kotlin` relies on other third-party Kotlin libraries. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker might be able to exploit them through the application using `realm-kotlin`.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but it could range from denial of service to remote code execution within the application using `realm-kotlin`.

**Affected Component:** `realm-kotlin` library and its direct and transitive dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be High or Critical).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Regularly update `realm-kotlin` and its dependencies to the latest versions, which often include security fixes. Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
