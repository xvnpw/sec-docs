## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Local Realm Database via Insecure Realm File Permissions](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_local_realm_database_via_insecure_realm_file_permissions.md)

Attack Vector: An attacker gains access to the device's filesystem with sufficient privileges to read the Realm database file due to insecure file permissions set by the application.
Impact: Complete compromise of the local data, allowing for reading, modification, and deletion of sensitive information.
Mitigation: Ensure the application sets restrictive file permissions on the Realm database file, limiting access to the application's process only.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Local Realm Database via Exploiting Weak or Default Encryption Keys](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_local_realm_database_via_exploiting_weak_or_default_encryption_keys.md)

Attack Vector: If the Realm database is encrypted, but a weak or default encryption key is used, an attacker who obtains the database file can decrypt it.
Impact: Full access to the encrypted data.
Mitigation: Implement strong encryption with robust, randomly generated keys that are securely managed and not hardcoded or easily guessable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Local Realm Database Content via Exploiting Lack of Input Validation](./attack_tree_paths/modify_local_realm_database_content_via_exploiting_lack_of_input_validation.md)

Attack Vector: The application does not properly validate or sanitize data before writing it to the Realm database. An attacker can inject malicious data that, when later processed by the application, leads to unintended behavior, data corruption, or further vulnerabilities.
Impact: Corruption of application data, potential for application crashes or unexpected behavior, and potentially enabling further exploits.
Mitigation: Implement thorough input validation and sanitization for all data written to the Realm database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exfiltrate Sensitive Data from Local Realm Database](./attack_tree_paths/exfiltrate_sensitive_data_from_local_realm_database.md)

Attack Vector: After gaining unauthorized access to the local Realm database (through any of the methods above), the attacker copies the database file or extracts sensitive data for their own purposes.
Impact: Disclosure of sensitive user data, potential privacy violations, and reputational damage.
Mitigation: Secure the local database as described above to prevent unauthorized access. Implement monitoring for unusual file access patterns.

## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept and Manipulate Synchronization Traffic via Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_and_manipulate_synchronization_traffic_via_man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack.md)

Attack Vector: An attacker intercepts the communication between the application and the Realm Object Server, typically on an unsecured network, and modifies the data being synchronized.
Impact: Manipulation of data on the server and other clients, potentially leading to data corruption, unauthorized actions, or account takeover.
Mitigation: Always use HTTPS (TLS) for communication with the Realm Object Server and implement certificate pinning to prevent MITM attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept and Manipulate Synchronization Traffic via Exploiting Insecure Communication Protocols](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_and_manipulate_synchronization_traffic_via_exploiting_insecure_communication_protocols.md)

Attack Vector: The application uses insecure communication protocols or has misconfigurations in its TLS implementation, allowing an attacker to eavesdrop on or modify synchronization data.
Impact: Similar to MITM, potential for data manipulation and unauthorized access.
Mitigation: Enforce the use of secure communication protocols and regularly review and update TLS configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in the Realm Backend via Authentication/Authorization Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_the_realm_backend_via_authenticationauthorization_flaws.md)

Attack Vector: The Realm Object Server has vulnerabilities in its authentication or authorization mechanisms, allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the backend.
Impact: Full control over the synchronized data, ability to manipulate data for all users, and potential for server compromise.
Mitigation: Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms on the Realm Object Server, following secure development practices. Regularly audit and pen-test the backend.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in the Realm Backend via API Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_the_realm_backend_via_api_vulnerabilities.md)

Attack Vector: The Realm Object Server's API has vulnerabilities that can be exploited by sending malicious requests.
Impact: Data manipulation, unauthorized actions, or denial of service on the backend.
Mitigation: Securely design and implement the Realm Object Server API, perform thorough input validation on all API endpoints, and implement rate limiting and other security controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise User Identity and Impersonate Legitimate Users via Stealing or Guessing User Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_user_identity_and_impersonate_legitimate_users_via_stealing_or_guessing_user_credentials.md)

Attack Vector: An attacker obtains valid user credentials (username and password) through phishing, data breaches, or brute-force attacks and uses them to access the synchronization service.
Impact: Account takeover, ability to access and manipulate data associated with the compromised account.
Mitigation: Enforce strong password policies, implement multi-factor authentication, and educate users about phishing attacks. Monitor for suspicious login activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Data via Synchronization](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_data_via_synchronization.md)

Attack Vector: An attacker with access to the synchronization service (either legitimately or through compromise) synchronizes crafted data that exploits vulnerabilities in other parts of the application or on other devices.
Impact: Can trigger vulnerabilities in other parts of the application, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service on other clients.
Mitigation: Implement robust server-side validation of all data being synchronized, regardless of the source. Follow the principle of least privilege for synchronization permissions.
