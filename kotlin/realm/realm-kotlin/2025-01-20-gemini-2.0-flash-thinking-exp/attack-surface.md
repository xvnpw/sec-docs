# Attack Surface Analysis for realm/realm-kotlin

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Realm Database File](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_realm_database_file.md)

*   **Description:** The Realm database file stored on the device is not encrypted, allowing unauthorized access to its contents if the device is compromised.
*   **How Realm-Kotlin Contributes:** Realm Kotlin, by default, creates an unencrypted database file unless explicitly configured otherwise. The library provides the API to enable encryption but doesn't enforce it.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains physical access to a user's rooted Android device and is able to copy the `default.realm` file, subsequently reading sensitive user data.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive user data, potential regulatory violations.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always enable Realm encryption with a strong, securely managed key during Realm configuration.
    *   Avoid using default or weak encryption keys.
    *   Consider using Android's Keystore system for secure key storage.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Realm Sync Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_realm_sync_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfiguration of the client-side Realm Sync settings can lead to unauthorized access or data breaches.
*   **How Realm-Kotlin Contributes:** Realm Kotlin provides the client-side API for connecting to and synchronizing with the Realm Object Server. Incorrectly configured connection details or authentication methods within the Realm Kotlin code can create vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** The client-side Realm configuration uses an insecure URL (e.g., HTTP instead of HTTPS) or hardcodes weak credentials.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, potential data breaches affecting multiple users.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use TLS (HTTPS) for all communication between the client and the Realm Object Server.
    *   Securely manage Realm Object Server credentials and connection strings within the application, avoiding hardcoding.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring client-side sync permissions (if applicable).

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in the Underlying Realm Core (C++)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_the_underlying_realm_core__c++_.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws within the native C++ Realm Core library, which Realm Kotlin relies on, can be exploited through the Kotlin API.
*   **How Realm-Kotlin Contributes:** Realm Kotlin acts as a wrapper around the Realm Core. Any vulnerabilities in the core can be indirectly exposed and exploitable through the Kotlin API. Developers using Realm Kotlin are dependent on the security of the underlying core.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Realm Core when handling specific types of data. An attacker crafts malicious data that, when processed by Realm Kotlin, triggers this overflow, potentially leading to code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, data corruption, information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Stay updated with the latest Realm Kotlin and Realm Core releases, which often include security patches.
    *   Monitor Realm's security advisories and release notes for information on known vulnerabilities.
    *   While direct mitigation within the Kotlin code might be limited, be aware of potential input validation issues that could trigger underlying core vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Improper Handling of Realm Sync Conflict Resolution](./attack_surfaces/improper_handling_of_realm_sync_conflict_resolution.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the application's logic for resolving data conflicts during synchronization can be exploited to manipulate data or cause inconsistencies.
*   **How Realm-Kotlin Contributes:** Realm Kotlin provides mechanisms for handling data conflicts during sync. If the developer's implementation of conflict resolution is flawed or doesn't adequately validate data, it can create an attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker intentionally creates conflicting data updates that, when resolved by the application's flawed logic, overwrite legitimate data with malicious values.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, data manipulation, potential business logic flaws.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust and well-tested conflict resolution strategies.
    *   Thoroughly validate data during conflict resolution to prevent malicious data from being accepted.
    *   Consider using optimistic locking or other concurrency control mechanisms.
