# Threat Model Analysis for realm/realm-kotlin

## Threat: [Exploiting Insufficient Realm Encryption](./threats/exploiting_insufficient_realm_encryption.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Insufficient Realm Encryption
    *   **Description:** If Realm encryption is not implemented, or if a weak encryption key is used and compromised *within the Realm Kotlin encryption features*, an attacker gaining access to the device's file system can decrypt and read the Realm database.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the data stored within the Realm database, leading to exposure of sensitive information.
    *   **Affected Component:** Realm encryption module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always enable Realm encryption for sensitive data using the `RealmConfiguration.Builder().encryptionKey(...)` method.
        *   Use strong, randomly generated encryption keys.
        *   Securely manage and store the encryption key (consider platform-specific secure storage mechanisms, but the key itself is managed through the Realm Kotlin API).

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Realm Sync Traffic (if using Realm Sync)](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_realm_sync_traffic__if_using_realm_sync_.md)

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Realm Sync Traffic (if using Realm Sync)
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the client application *using the Realm Kotlin Sync SDK* and the Realm Object Server. If the connection *established by the Realm Kotlin Sync SDK* is not properly secured (e.g., using HTTPS with valid certificates), the attacker could eavesdrop on or even modify the synchronized data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, and potential compromise of user accounts or the entire Realm.
    *   **Affected Component:** Realm Sync client module (within `realm-kotlin-sync`), network communication handled by the SDK.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Ensure the Realm Kotlin Sync SDK is configured to enforce HTTPS for all communication with the Realm Object Server.** This is often a default or configurable setting within the SDK.
        *   **Consider implementing certificate pinning within the application using the Realm Kotlin Sync SDK's configuration options** to prevent attackers from using forged certificates.
        *   Ensure the Realm Object Server is configured with strong TLS settings, which is a prerequisite for secure communication with the Realm Kotlin Sync SDK.

## Threat: [Compromised Realm Sync User Credentials (if using Realm Sync)](./threats/compromised_realm_sync_user_credentials__if_using_realm_sync_.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Realm Sync User Credentials (if using Realm Sync)
    *   **Description:** An attacker obtains valid user credentials for Realm Sync (e.g., through phishing, credential stuffing, or a data breach on the authentication provider) and uses them *with the Realm Kotlin Sync SDK* to access and manipulate data associated with that user.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user data, potential data breaches, and the ability to perform actions as the compromised user.
    *   **Affected Component:** Realm Sync authentication module (interaction through the `realm-kotlin-sync` SDK).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies for Realm Sync users (this is often managed on the Realm Object Server or a linked authentication provider, but impacts how users interact with the Realm Kotlin SDK).
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Realm Sync users (again, often configured server-side but impacts the authentication flow within the Realm Kotlin SDK).
        *   Educate users about phishing and other social engineering attacks that could compromise their Realm Sync credentials.
        *   Monitor for suspicious login activity within the Realm Object Server logs related to users authenticating through the Realm Kotlin SDK.

## Threat: [Authorization and Access Control Vulnerabilities in Realm Sync (if using Realm Sync)](./threats/authorization_and_access_control_vulnerabilities_in_realm_sync__if_using_realm_sync_.md)

*   **Threat:** Authorization and Access Control Vulnerabilities in Realm Sync (if using Realm Sync)
    *   **Description:** Incorrectly configured permissions and roles on the Realm Object Server could allow users *interacting with the server through the Realm Kotlin Sync SDK* to access or modify data they are not authorized to.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, and potential privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected Component:** Realm Sync authorization module on the server (enforced on requests made by the `realm-kotlin-sync` SDK).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully design and implement the Realm Sync permission model on the Realm Object Server, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
        *   Regularly review and audit access control configurations on the Realm Object Server that govern access for clients using the Realm Kotlin SDK.
        *   Thoroughly test the permission model to ensure it behaves as expected for clients connecting via the Realm Kotlin SDK.

## Threat: [Replay Attacks on Realm Sync (if using Realm Sync)](./threats/replay_attacks_on_realm_sync__if_using_realm_sync_.md)

*   **Threat:** Replay Attacks on Realm Sync (if using Realm Sync)
    *   **Description:** An attacker captures valid synchronization requests made by the *Realm Kotlin Sync SDK* and replays them to the Realm Object Server, potentially causing unintended data modifications or actions.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized actions performed on behalf of a legitimate user.
    *   **Affected Component:** Realm Sync client and server modules (interaction through the `realm-kotlin-sync` SDK), network communication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement mechanisms to prevent replay attacks, such as using nonces (unique, single-use values) or timestamps in synchronization requests. This might involve configuring settings on the Realm Object Server or potentially using features within the Realm Kotlin Sync SDK if available.
        *   Ensure the Realm Object Server validates the freshness and uniqueness of requests originating from the Realm Kotlin SDK.
