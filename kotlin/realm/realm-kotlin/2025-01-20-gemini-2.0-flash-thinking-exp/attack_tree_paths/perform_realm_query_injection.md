### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Perform Realm Query Injection

**Introduction:**

The "Perform Realm Query Injection" attack path targets vulnerabilities in how an application constructs and executes queries against a Realm database using user-provided input. Similar to SQL injection, this attack allows malicious actors to inject arbitrary Realm Query Language (RQL) code into the application's queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.

**Attack Description:**

Realm Kotlin uses its own query language, which, while different from SQL, can still be susceptible to injection vulnerabilities if not handled carefully. The core of the attack lies in the application's failure to properly sanitize or parameterize user input before incorporating it into Realm queries.

**How it Works:**

1. **Vulnerable Code:** The application constructs a Realm query by directly concatenating user-provided input into the query string. For example:

   ```kotlin
   val userInput = getUserInput() // Assume this is from user input
   val query = "name == '$userInput'"
   val results = realm.query<User>(query).find()
   ```

2. **Malicious Input:** An attacker provides malicious input designed to manipulate the intended query logic. For instance, instead of a simple name, the attacker might input:

   ```
   ' OR 1 == 1 //
   ```

3. **Injected Query:** The resulting query becomes:

   ```
   name == '' OR 1 == 1 // '
   ```

   The `OR 1 == 1` clause will always evaluate to true, effectively bypassing the intended filtering and potentially returning all records in the `User` table. The `//` comments out the remaining part of the original query, preventing syntax errors.

**Potential Impact:**

A successful Realm Query Injection attack can have severe consequences:

* **Data Breach:** Attackers can bypass intended access controls and retrieve sensitive data they are not authorized to see.
* **Data Modification:** Malicious queries can be crafted to update or delete data within the Realm database, leading to data corruption or loss.
* **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, attackers might be able to manipulate queries to gain access to administrative or higher-privileged data or functionalities.
* **Application Logic Bypass:** Attackers can manipulate queries to bypass intended application logic and workflows.
* **Information Disclosure:**  Error messages resulting from malformed injected queries might reveal information about the database schema or internal application workings.

**Prerequisites for Successful Attack:**

* **Vulnerable Code:** The application must construct Realm queries by directly incorporating unsanitized user input.
* **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not adequately validate or sanitize user input before using it in queries.
* **Direct Query Construction:** The application uses string concatenation or similar methods to build queries instead of using parameterized queries or safe query builders.

**Detection Strategies:**

* **Code Reviews:** Manually reviewing the codebase to identify instances where user input is directly used in query construction.
* **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Utilizing SAST tools that can identify potential query injection vulnerabilities by analyzing the application's source code.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Employing DAST tools to simulate attacks by injecting malicious input into application endpoints and observing the application's behavior.
* **Penetration Testing:** Engaging security professionals to perform manual testing and attempt to exploit potential vulnerabilities, including query injection.
* **Runtime Monitoring and Logging:** Monitoring application logs for suspicious query patterns or error messages that might indicate injection attempts. Look for unusual characters or keywords in query parameters.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Parameterized Queries (Recommended):**  Realm Kotlin supports parameterized queries, which are the most effective way to prevent query injection. Instead of directly embedding user input, use placeholders that are filled in separately. This ensures that user input is treated as data, not executable code.

   ```kotlin
   val userInput = getUserInput()
   val results = realm.query<User>("name == $0", userInput).find()
   ```

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Implement strict input validation to ensure that user-provided data conforms to expected formats and lengths. Sanitize input by removing or escaping potentially harmful characters. However, relying solely on sanitization can be error-prone and is generally less secure than parameterized queries.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user or role used by the application has only the necessary permissions to perform its intended operations. This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause even if they successfully inject a query.

* **Output Encoding:** While primarily for preventing cross-site scripting (XSS), encoding output can also help in certain scenarios where query results are displayed back to the user.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including query injection flaws.

* **Security Training for Developers:** Educate developers on secure coding practices and the risks associated with query injection vulnerabilities.

**Example Scenario:**

Consider an application with a search functionality that allows users to search for users by their name.

**Vulnerable Code:**

```kotlin
fun searchUsersByName(name: String): List<User> {
    val query = "name CONTAINS '$name'"
    return realm.query<User>(query).find()
}

// ... elsewhere in the code
val searchTerm = getUserInput()
val searchResults = searchUsersByName(searchTerm)
```

**Attack:**

An attacker could input the following as the `searchTerm`:

```
' OR email LIKE '%@%' //
```

**Injected Query:**

```
name CONTAINS '' OR email LIKE '%@%' // '
```

This injected query would return all users whose email contains "@", effectively bypassing the intended name-based search.

**Mitigated Code (using parameterized queries):**

```kotlin
fun searchUsersByName(name: String): List<User> {
    return realm.query<User>("name CONTAINS $0", name).find()
}

// ... elsewhere in the code
val searchTerm = getUserInput()
val searchResults = searchUsersByName(searchTerm)
```

In the mitigated version, the `name` parameter is passed separately, preventing the malicious input from being interpreted as part of the query structure.

**Specific Considerations for Realm Kotlin:**

* **Realm Query Language (RQL):**  Understanding the specific syntax and operators of RQL is crucial for identifying potential injection points. While different from SQL, the underlying principle of untrusted data leading to code execution remains the same.
* **Realm Object Server (if used):** If the application uses Realm Object Server, consider potential injection points in the synchronization logic or custom functions.
* **Realm Studio:** While not directly related to runtime injection, be cautious about using user-provided data when constructing queries within Realm Studio for debugging or analysis, as this could inadvertently execute malicious queries against a development database.

**Conclusion:**

Realm Query Injection is a significant security risk for applications using Realm Kotlin. By understanding the attack mechanism, potential impact, and implementing robust mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the likelihood of successful exploitation. Parameterized queries are the most effective defense, and a combination of secure coding practices, thorough testing, and developer education is essential for building secure applications with Realm Kotlin.
