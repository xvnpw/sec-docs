## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Realm Kotlin Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_realm_kotlin_exploitation.md)

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a complete failure of the application's security related to Realm Kotlin.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Realm Kotlin SDK Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_realm_kotlin_sdk_vulnerabilities.md)

* This node represents attacks that directly target weaknesses within the Realm Kotlin library itself. Successful exploitation can have severe consequences and potentially affect multiple applications using the same vulnerable version.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Data Injection during Sync](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_data_injection_during_sync.md)

* Attackers inject crafted data during the synchronization process to exploit parsing vulnerabilities in the Realm SDK. This can lead to:
    * Remote Code Execution: The injected data triggers a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issue, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device.
    * Data Corruption: Malformed data can corrupt the Realm database, leading to application instability or data loss.
    * Denial of Service: The application crashes or becomes unresponsive due to the parsing error.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Query Language Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_query_language_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attackers inject malicious code or logic into Realm queries, similar to SQL injection. This can result in:
    * Data Breach: Attackers can extract sensitive data from the Realm database that they are not authorized to access.
    * Data Manipulation: Attackers can modify or delete data in the Realm database.
    * Privilege Escalation: In some cases, attackers might be able to leverage query injection to gain higher privileges within the application's data model.

## Attack Tree Path: [Perform Realm Query Injection](./attack_tree_paths/perform_realm_query_injection.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfiguration or Improper Usage of Realm Kotlin](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfiguration_or_improper_usage_of_realm_kotlin.md)

* This highlights vulnerabilities arising from how developers implement and configure Realm Kotlin. These are often easier to exploit than inherent SDK vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Sensitive Data through Insecure Realm File Storage](./attack_tree_paths/expose_sensitive_data_through_insecure_realm_file_storage.md)

* This category covers scenarios where the raw Realm database file is accessible to attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Realm File on Rooted/Compromised Device](./attack_tree_paths/access_realm_file_on_rootedcompromised_device.md)

* Attackers gain root access to the device, bypassing the application's sandbox and directly accessing the Realm database file. This allows them to:
    * Steal all data stored in the Realm database.
    * Modify or delete data in the Realm database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Extract Realm File from Device Backups](./attack_tree_paths/extract_realm_file_from_device_backups.md)

* Attackers retrieve the Realm database file from device backups (e.g., cloud backups, local backups) if these backups are not properly secured (e.g., unencrypted). This allows them to:
    * Access sensitive data offline.
    * Analyze the database structure for further vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Improperly Secured Realm Sync Configuration (if used)](./attack_tree_paths/improperly_secured_realm_sync_configuration__if_used_.md)

* This focuses on vulnerabilities related to the setup and management of Realm Sync.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak or Default Sync Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_or_default_sync_credentials.md)

* Attackers use default or easily guessable credentials to authenticate with the Realm Object Server or sync user accounts. This grants them unauthorized access to:
    * Read and modify all data synchronized through the server.
    * Potentially compromise other users' data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept and Decrypt Sync Traffic (Man-in-the-Middle)](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_and_decrypt_sync_traffic__man-in-the-middle_.md)

* Attackers intercept network traffic between the application and the Realm Object Server. If the communication is not properly secured (e.g., using HTTPS with certificate pinning), they can decrypt the traffic and:
    * Eavesdrop on sensitive data being transmitted.
    * Modify data in transit.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities in Realm Object Server](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server-side_vulnerabilities_in_realm_object_server.md)

* Attackers target vulnerabilities in the Realm Object Server software itself. Successful exploitation can lead to:
    * Complete compromise of the server and all synchronized data.
    * Potential access to other resources on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insufficient Data Validation and Sanitization](./attack_tree_paths/insufficient_data_validation_and_sanitization.md)

* The application fails to properly validate and sanitize data before storing it in the Realm database. This can lead to:

## Attack Tree Path: [Store Malicious Data in Realm Database](./attack_tree_paths/store_malicious_data_in_realm_database.md)

* Attackers inject malicious data into the Realm database due to insufficient input validation. This can lead to:
    * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)-like attacks within the application when the malicious data is retrieved and displayed.
    * Data Corruption: Malicious data can disrupt the application's logic or data integrity.
    * Application Crashes: Retrieving and processing malicious data can cause the application to crash.
