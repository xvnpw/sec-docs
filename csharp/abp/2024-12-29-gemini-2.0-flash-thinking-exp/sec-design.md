**5. Data Flow (with Security Context)**

The following diagram illustrates a typical request flow, highlighting key security checkpoints.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["User Interaction ('UI Client')"] --> B["HTTP Request (Authentication Credentials)"];
    B --> C["Authentication Middleware (Presentation Layer)"];
    C -- "Authenticated User" --> D["API Controller (Authorization Checks)"];
    D -- "Authorized Request" --> E["Application Service (Authorization Checks)"];
    E --> F["Domain Service (Business Logic, Data Validation)"];
    F --> G["Repository (Parameterized Queries)"];
    G --> H["Database"];
    H --> G;
    G --> F;
    F --> E;
    E --> D;
    D --> I["HTTP Response"];
    I --> A;
```

*   **User Interaction ('UI Client'):** The user interacts with the application, potentially providing credentials.
*   **HTTP Request (Authentication Credentials):** The UI sends an HTTP request, which may include authentication credentials (e.g., cookies, tokens).
*   **Authentication Middleware (Presentation Layer):** The authentication middleware verifies the user's identity based on the provided credentials. This is a crucial security checkpoint.
*   **API Controller (Authorization Checks):** The API controller checks if the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource or perform the action.
*   **Application Service (Authorization Checks):** The application service may perform further authorization checks to enforce business rules.
*   **Domain Service (Business Logic, Data Validation):** The domain service executes business logic and performs data validation to prevent invalid or malicious data from being processed.
*   **Repository (Parameterized Queries):** The repository interacts with the database using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
*   **Database:** The database stores and retrieves data. Access control and data encryption are important security measures at this level.
*   **HTTP Response:** The server sends an HTTP response back to the user. Ensure sensitive data is not exposed in the response.

**6. Deployment Model (with Security Considerations)**

ABP applications can be deployed in various environments, each with its own security implications.

*   **Cloud Platforms (Azure, AWS, GCP):**
    *   **Security Considerations:** Leverage cloud-native security services (e.g., Azure Active Directory, AWS IAM, Google Cloud IAM). Securely configure network access (e.g., Network Security Groups, Security Groups). Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit using cloud provider services. Regularly review and update security configurations.
*   **On-Premises Servers:**
    *   **Security Considerations:** Implement robust firewall rules and network segmentation. Secure the operating system and web server. Implement strong access controls for the server environment. Regularly patch and update systems.
