**Breakdown of Checklist Items:**

*   **Proper use of parameterized queries in EF Core:**
    *   **Threat Mitigated:** SQL Injection
    *   **Effectiveness:** High - Parameterized queries are the primary defense against SQL Injection.
    *   **Review Focus:** Verify that all user inputs used in queries are properly parameterized using EF Core's mechanisms (e.g., `FromSqlInterpolated`, `FromSqlRaw` with parameters, LINQ parameters).
*   **Justification and secure implementation of raw SQL within EF Core:**
    *   **Threat Mitigated:** SQL Injection, potentially others depending on raw SQL implementation.
    *   **Effectiveness:** Medium - Raw SQL bypasses EF Core's query building and requires careful manual security review. Justification is crucial to ensure raw SQL is necessary and not introducing vulnerabilities. Secure implementation means rigorous input validation and parameterization within the raw SQL itself.
    *   **Review Focus:**  Question the necessity of raw SQL. If justified, scrutinize the raw SQL for SQL Injection vulnerabilities and ensure proper parameterization and input validation within the raw SQL context.
*   **Secure handling of dynamic LINQ with EF Core:**
    *   **Threat Mitigated:** SQL Injection (if user input influences LINQ query construction), Authorization Bypass (if dynamic LINQ allows access to unintended data).
    *   **Effectiveness:** Medium - Dynamic LINQ can be powerful but introduces complexity and potential security risks if not handled carefully.
    *   **Review Focus:**  Identify instances of dynamic LINQ usage. Analyze how user input influences the LINQ query construction. Ensure proper input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious manipulation of the query logic. Consider alternative approaches to dynamic querying if security risks are high.
*   **Potential mass assignment vulnerabilities related to EF Core entities:**
    *   **Threat Mitigated:** Mass Assignment, Data Integrity issues.
    *   **Effectiveness:** Medium - Mass assignment can lead to unintended modification of entity properties if not carefully controlled.
    *   **Review Focus:**  Identify scenarios where entities are being updated based on external data (e.g., HTTP request data). Verify that only intended properties are being updated and that appropriate data transfer objects (DTOs) or view models are used to control data binding and prevent unintended property updates. Consider using `[Bind]` attribute or explicit property mapping.
*   **Over-fetching of data and potential information disclosure through EF Core queries:**
    *   **Threat Mitigated:** Information Disclosure, Performance issues.
    *   **Effectiveness:** Medium - Over-fetching can expose sensitive data that should not be accessible to the user.
    *   **Review Focus:**  Analyze EF Core queries to identify potential over-fetching. Check if queries retrieve more data than necessary for the intended purpose. Encourage the use of projection (`.Select()`) to retrieve only required columns and avoid loading unnecessary related entities.
*   **Efficient query design to prevent performance issues when using EF Core:**
    *   **Threat Mitigated:** Denial of Service (DoS) (performance-based), Indirect Information Disclosure (through timing attacks if performance varies based on data).
    *   **Effectiveness:** Low (primarily performance, indirectly security) - While primarily focused on performance, inefficient queries can contribute to DoS vulnerabilities and indirectly to security issues.
    *   **Review Focus:**  Examine query complexity and potential performance bottlenecks. Look for N+1 query problems, inefficient filtering, and lack of proper indexing. Encourage the use of eager loading (`.Include()`), efficient filtering (`.Where()`), and appropriate indexing to optimize query performance.

**4.1.3. Security Expertise in EF Core Reviews:**
