# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Entity Framework Core (EF Core) project aims to provide a modern object-database mapper for .NET. It enables developers to work with data using .NET objects, simplifying data access code and improving developer productivity. EF Core supports various database systems and platforms, making it a versatile tool for building data-centric applications.

Business Priorities:
- Provide a reliable and performant ORM for .NET developers.
- Ensure compatibility with a wide range of database systems.
- Maintain a vibrant and active open-source community around the project.
- Continuously improve the features and capabilities of EF Core based on user feedback and industry trends.
- Facilitate secure data access practices for applications using EF Core.

Business Goals:
- Increase developer adoption of EF Core for .NET application development.
- Establish EF Core as the leading ORM solution in the .NET ecosystem.
- Empower developers to build efficient and scalable data-driven applications.
- Foster innovation and collaboration within the .NET data access community.

Most Important Business Risks:
- Security vulnerabilities in EF Core could lead to data breaches and compromise applications using it.
- Performance issues in EF Core could negatively impact the performance of applications.
- Lack of compatibility with new database systems or .NET features could limit adoption.
- Decline in community support could hinder project development and user assistance.
- Bugs or instability in EF Core releases could disrupt application development and production environments.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: GitHub repository with access control and audit logs. Implemented by GitHub.

- security control: Unit and integration testing. Implemented in development and CI pipelines.

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Vulnerabilities might be introduced by community contributions.
- accepted risk: Open source nature makes the codebase publicly available for scrutiny by both security researchers and malicious actors.
- accepted risk: Dependency on third-party libraries and database providers, which might have their own vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Security issues might be discovered after release, requiring patching and updates.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement regular security audits and penetration testing of EF Core codebase.
- security control: Enhance static and dynamic code analysis with dedicated security scanning tools.
- security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and incident response process.
- security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for developers using EF Core.
- security control: Implement dependency scanning and management to track and update vulnerable dependencies.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - requirement: EF Core itself does not handle user authentication, but it must securely manage database connection credentials provided by the application.
    - requirement: Connection strings should be protected and not hardcoded in application code.
    - requirement: Support for various database authentication methods should be robust and secure.
- Authorization:
    - requirement: EF Core should facilitate implementation of application-level authorization logic to control data access based on user roles and permissions.
    - requirement: Query generation should prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities that could bypass authorization checks.
    - requirement: Data access should adhere to the principle of least privilege.
- Input Validation:
    - requirement: EF Core should encourage or enforce input validation to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, NoSQL injection).
    - requirement: Data type validation and range checks should be performed before database queries are executed.
    - requirement: Parameterized queries or prepared statements must be used by default to prevent SQL injection.
- Cryptography:
    - requirement: EF Core should support encryption of sensitive data at rest in the database and in transit.
    - requirement: Secure handling of cryptographic keys and secrets used for encryption should be ensured.
    - requirement: Support for data masking and anonymization techniques for sensitive data should be considered.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Development of .NET applications using EF Core.
- Data access within .NET applications using EF Core.
- Integrity and confidentiality of data managed by applications using EF Core.
- Availability and performance of applications relying on EF Core.
- Community trust and adoption of EF Core as a reliable ORM solution.

Data Sensitivity:
- EF Core itself does not store or process application data directly. It facilitates access to data stored in external database systems.
- The sensitivity of data handled through EF Core depends entirely on the applications using it and the databases they interact with.
- Data sensitivity can range from publicly available information to highly confidential personal or financial data, depending on the application domain.
- It is crucial for applications using EF Core to properly classify and protect the data they handle, using appropriate security measures at the application and database levels.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What are the primary target applications and use cases for EF Core from a business perspective?
- What are the most critical security concerns for users of EF Core?
- Are there specific regulatory compliance requirements that EF Core needs to address?
- What is the expected level of security expertise among developers using EF Core?

Assumptions:
- EF Core is intended to be used in a wide variety of .NET applications, ranging from small projects to large enterprise systems.
- Security is a significant concern for users of EF Core, especially given its role in data access.
- Developers using EF Core are expected to have a basic understanding of security best practices, but may not be security experts.
- The primary threat vectors for EF Core are likely to be related to injection attacks (SQL injection, NoSQL injection), insecure data handling, and vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- The open-source nature of EF Core is considered a benefit for transparency and community security review, but also requires careful management of contributions and vulnerabilities.
