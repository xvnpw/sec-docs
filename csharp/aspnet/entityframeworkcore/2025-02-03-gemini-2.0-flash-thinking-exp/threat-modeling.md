# Threat Model Analysis for aspnet/entityframeworkcore

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Raw SQL Queries](./threats/sql_injection_via_raw_sql_queries.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code into raw SQL queries executed by the application using EF Core features like `FromSqlRaw` or `ExecuteSqlRaw`. This is achieved by manipulating user inputs that are directly incorporated into SQL strings without proper parameterization. Successful injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands against the database.

**Impact:** Data Breach (unauthorized access to sensitive data), Data Modification (altering or corrupting data), Data Deletion (removing critical data), Database Server Compromise (potentially gaining control over the database server).

**Affected EF Core Component:** `RelationalDatabase`, `RawSqlQueryExecution` functions (`FromSqlRaw`, `ExecuteSqlRaw`, etc.).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Always use parameterized queries:**  Employ parameterized queries for all raw SQL operations. EF Core's LINQ queries are parameterized by default.
*   **Prefer LINQ queries:** Utilize LINQ queries as much as possible, as EF Core handles parameterization automatically.
*   **Input validation and sanitization:** Implement input validation and sanitization as a defense-in-depth measure, even with parameterized queries, to prevent unexpected input formats.

## Threat: [Inefficient Queries Leading to Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/inefficient_queries_leading_to_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft requests that trigger inefficient SQL queries generated by EF Core. These queries, resulting from poorly designed LINQ, missing indexes, or inappropriate loading strategies, consume excessive database resources. Repeated requests can overload the database server, causing performance degradation or service unavailability for legitimate users.

**Impact:** Application Unavailability (service becomes unresponsive), Performance Degradation (slow response times for all users), Resource Exhaustion (database server overload).

**Affected EF Core Component:** `QueryCompilation`, `QueryExecution`, `Database Provider` (for query translation and execution).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Query optimization:** Regularly profile and analyze generated SQL queries using database tools to identify and optimize slow queries.
*   **Index optimization:** Ensure appropriate database indexes are in place for frequently queried columns to improve query performance.
*   **Eager loading vs. Lazy loading:** Carefully choose between eager and lazy loading strategies to avoid N+1 query problems and optimize data retrieval.
*   **Implement query timeouts:** Set timeouts for database queries to prevent long-running queries from consuming resources indefinitely.
*   **Rate limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to restrict the number of requests from a single source, mitigating abuse.

## Threat: [Insecure Database Migrations](./threats/insecure_database_migrations.md)

**Description:** An attacker gaining unauthorized access to the migration process could inject malicious migration scripts. Executing these scripts can alter the database schema harmfully, potentially adding backdoors, modifying data access, or corrupting data structures.

**Impact:** Data Corruption (damage to database integrity), Data Manipulation (unauthorized data changes), Backdoors (creation of hidden access points), Database Schema Compromise (malicious alteration of database structure).

**Affected EF Core Component:** `Migrations`, `Database Schema Management`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Version control migration scripts:** Treat migration scripts as code and manage them under version control.
*   **Code review migration scripts:** Implement a code review process for all migration scripts before application.
*   **Restrict access to migration execution:** Limit who can execute migrations in production environments.
*   **Test migrations in non-production environments:** Thoroughly test all migrations in development and staging environments before production.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in EF Core Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_ef_core_dependencies.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit known security vulnerabilities in EF Core's dependencies (NuGet packages). Vulnerabilities in these third-party libraries can indirectly affect applications using EF Core, potentially leading to various impacts depending on the vulnerability.

**Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, potentially including Remote Code Execution (gaining control over the application server), Denial of Service (making the application unavailable), Information Disclosure (accessing sensitive information).

**Affected EF Core Component:** `Dependencies`, `NuGet Packages`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Regularly update EF Core and its dependencies:** Keep EF Core and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Monitor security advisories:** Regularly monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for EF Core and its dependencies.
*   **Use dependency scanning tools:** Employ dependency scanning tools to automatically identify vulnerable dependencies in the project and alert developers to update them.
