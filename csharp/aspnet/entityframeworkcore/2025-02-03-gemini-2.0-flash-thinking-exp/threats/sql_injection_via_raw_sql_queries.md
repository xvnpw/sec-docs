### 4. Deep Analysis of Threat: SQL Injection via Raw SQL Queries

#### 4.1. Vulnerability Details

SQL Injection via Raw SQL Queries arises when an application constructs SQL queries dynamically by directly embedding user-supplied input into the SQL string without proper sanitization or parameterization. In the context of EF Core, this vulnerability is primarily associated with the use of functions like `FromSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlRaw`.

**How it works in EF Core:**

EF Core provides `FromSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlRaw` to execute raw SQL queries against the database. While powerful for complex scenarios or leveraging database-specific features, they introduce the risk of SQL injection if not used carefully.

**Vulnerable Code Example:**

```csharp
public async Task<List<Blog>> GetBlogsByTitleUnsafe(string title)
{
    using (var context = new BloggingContext())
    {
        // Vulnerable to SQL Injection!
        var blogs = await context.Blogs
            .FromSqlRaw($"SELECT * FROM Blogs WHERE Title = '{title}'")
            .ToListAsync();
        return blogs;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `title` parameter, which could originate from user input (e.g., a web request parameter), is directly concatenated into the SQL query string. An attacker can manipulate the `title` input to inject malicious SQL code.

**Attack Scenario:**

Let's say an attacker provides the following input for the `title` parameter:

```
' OR 1=1 --
```

The resulting SQL query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Blogs WHERE Title = '' OR 1=1 --'
```

*   `' OR 1=1`: This part injects a condition that is always true (`1=1`).
*   `--`: This is an SQL comment, which comments out the rest of the original query (potentially any intended filtering or conditions after the injected part).

This injected query will bypass the intended `Title` filtering and return **all** blogs from the `Blogs` table, potentially exposing sensitive data.  More sophisticated attacks can be crafted to perform data modification, deletion, or even database server compromise.

#### 4.2. Attack Vectors

Attack vectors for SQL Injection via Raw SQL Queries in EF Core applications primarily revolve around user-controlled input that is used in raw SQL queries. Common sources of such input include:

*   **Web Request Parameters (Query String, Form Data):**  Data submitted through HTTP GET or POST requests.
*   **URL Path Segments:**  Parts of the URL path used to identify resources or actions.
*   **Cookies:**  Data stored in the user's browser and sent with each request.
*   **Input from External Systems:** Data received from APIs, file uploads, or other external sources.

Any of these input sources, if directly incorporated into raw SQL queries without proper parameterization, can become an attack vector for SQL injection.

#### 4.3. Impact in Detail

The impact of successful SQL Injection via Raw SQL Queries can be severe and far-reaching:

*   **Data Breach (Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data):**
    *   **Reading Sensitive Data:** Attackers can bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms to access confidential data such as user credentials, personal information, financial records, and proprietary business data.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:**  Once accessed, sensitive data can be extracted from the database and potentially sold or used for malicious purposes.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker could inject SQL to query the `Users` table and retrieve usernames, passwords (if not properly hashed and salted), email addresses, and other personal details.

*   **Data Modification (Altering or Corrupting Data):**
    *   **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify existing data in the database, leading to data integrity issues and potentially disrupting business operations.
    *   **Account Takeover:**  By modifying user records, attackers can change passwords or elevate privileges to gain control of user accounts.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could inject SQL to update the `IsAdmin` flag in the `Users` table for their own account, granting them administrative privileges.

*   **Data Deletion (Removing Critical Data):**
    *   **Data Loss:** Attackers can delete critical data from the database, leading to significant business disruption and potential financial losses.
    *   **Denial of Service:**  Deleting essential application data can render the application unusable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could inject SQL to `DELETE` records from the `Orders` table, causing order history loss and impacting order processing.

*   **Database Server Compromise (Potentially Gaining Control over the Database Server):**
    *   **Operating System Command Execution:** In some database systems, attackers can leverage SQL injection to execute operating system commands on the database server itself. This can lead to complete server compromise.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:**  Attackers might be able to escalate their privileges within the database system, gaining administrative control.
    *   **Lateral Movement:**  Compromising the database server can be a stepping stone for attackers to move laterally within the network and compromise other systems.
    *   **Example:**  Depending on database server configurations and permissions, an attacker might be able to use functions like `xp_cmdshell` (in SQL Server, if enabled and accessible) to execute arbitrary commands on the server's operating system.

#### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

The primary and most effective mitigation strategy for SQL Injection via Raw SQL Queries is to **always use parameterized queries**.

*   **Parameterized Queries (or Prepared Statements):**

    Parameterized queries separate the SQL code structure from the user-supplied data. Placeholders (parameters) are used in the SQL query for data values. The database driver then handles the safe substitution of these parameters, ensuring that user input is treated as data, not as executable SQL code.

    **Secure Code Example using Parameterized Queries in EF Core:**

    ```csharp
    public async Task<List<Blog>> GetBlogsByTitleSafe(string title)
    {
        using (var context = new BloggingContext())
        {
            // Using parameterized query - Safe from SQL Injection
            var blogs = await context.Blogs
                .FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM Blogs WHERE Title = {0}", title) // {0} is a placeholder
                .ToListAsync();
            return blogs;
        }
    }
    ```

    In this secure example, `{0}` is a placeholder for the `title` parameter. EF Core, through the underlying database provider, will properly parameterize the query. Even if the `title` input contains malicious SQL syntax, it will be treated as a literal string value, preventing SQL injection.

    **Key benefits of Parameterized Queries:**

    *   **Prevents SQL Injection:**  Effectively eliminates the risk of SQL injection by separating code from data.
    *   **Improved Performance (Potentially):**  Database systems can often optimize parameterized queries as they can reuse the query execution plan for multiple executions with different parameter values.
    *   **Code Clarity and Maintainability:** Parameterized queries often make code easier to read and understand.

*   **Prefer LINQ Queries:**

    EF Core's LINQ (Language Integrated Query) provider is designed to generate parameterized queries automatically. Whenever possible, developers should leverage LINQ queries instead of resorting to raw SQL.

    **LINQ Example (Safe by Default):**

    ```csharp
    public async Task<List<Blog>> GetBlogsByTitleLinq(string title)
    {
        using (var context = new BloggingContext())
        {
            // Using LINQ - Parameterized by default, Safe from SQL Injection
            var blogs = await context.Blogs
                .Where(b => b.Title == title)
                .ToListAsync();
            return blogs;
        }
    }
    ```

    EF Core translates this LINQ query into a parameterized SQL query behind the scenes, ensuring protection against SQL injection.

    **Benefits of LINQ:**

    *   **Safety by Default:**  LINQ queries are inherently parameterized, reducing the risk of SQL injection.
    *   **Type Safety and Compile-time Checking:** LINQ queries are type-safe and can be checked at compile time, catching potential errors early in the development process.
    *   **Improved Developer Productivity:** LINQ provides a more expressive and intuitive way to query data compared to writing raw SQL.
    *   **Database Agnostic (to a degree):** LINQ abstracts away some database-specific syntax, making code more portable across different database systems.

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Defense in Depth):**

    While parameterized queries are the primary defense, input validation and sanitization should be implemented as a defense-in-depth measure. This involves:

    *   **Validation:**  Verifying that user input conforms to expected formats, lengths, and character sets. Rejecting invalid input before it reaches the database query.
    *   **Sanitization (or Encoding):**  Encoding or escaping special characters in user input that could be interpreted as SQL syntax. However, **sanitization is generally less reliable than parameterized queries for preventing SQL injection and should not be used as the primary defense.**  Encoding is more useful for preventing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

    **Example Input Validation:**

    ```csharp
    public async Task<List<Blog>> GetBlogsByTitleValidated(string title)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(title) || title.Length > 200) // Example validation
        {
            // Handle invalid input (e.g., return an error, log, etc.)
            return new List<Blog>();
        }

        using (var context = new BloggingContext())
        {
            var blogs = await context.Blogs
                .FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM Blogs WHERE Title = {0}", title)
                .ToListAsync();
            return blogs;
        }
    }
    ```

    **Important Note:** Input validation should be used to enforce business rules and improve data quality, but **it should not be relied upon as the sole defense against SQL injection.** Parameterized queries are the fundamental and most effective solution.

#### 4.5. Detection and Prevention

**Detection:**

*   **Static Code Analysis:** Utilize static code analysis tools that can identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in the codebase by flagging instances of raw SQL query construction with user input concatenation.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Employ DAST tools to scan the running application and simulate SQL injection attacks to identify vulnerable endpoints.
*   **Penetration Testing:** Engage security professionals to conduct manual penetration testing, specifically targeting SQL injection vulnerabilities in areas using raw SQL queries.
*   **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** WAFs can detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts in real-time by analyzing HTTP requests and responses.
*   **Database Activity Monitoring (DAM):** DAM systems can monitor database activity for suspicious SQL queries and patterns indicative of SQL injection attacks.
*   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews, paying close attention to areas where raw SQL queries are used and how user input is handled.

**Prevention:**

*   **Developer Training:** Educate developers about SQL injection vulnerabilities, parameterized queries, and secure coding practices in EF Core.
*   **Secure Coding Guidelines:** Establish and enforce secure coding guidelines that mandate the use of parameterized queries for all raw SQL operations and prioritize LINQ queries whenever possible.
*   **Code Review Process:** Implement a mandatory code review process to ensure adherence to secure coding guidelines and identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities before code deployment.
*   **Automated Security Checks in CI/CD Pipeline:** Integrate static code analysis and DAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect and prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities during the development lifecycle.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify and address potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in the application.

#### 4.6. Conclusion

SQL Injection via Raw SQL Queries is a critical threat in EF Core applications that can lead to severe consequences, including data breaches, data manipulation, and system compromise. The vulnerability stems from the unsafe practice of directly embedding user-controlled input into raw SQL queries without proper parameterization.

The most effective mitigation is to **always use parameterized queries** when executing raw SQL in EF Core.  Prioritizing LINQ queries further reduces the risk by leveraging EF Core's built-in parameterization. Input validation serves as a valuable defense-in-depth measure but should not replace parameterized queries as the primary protection.

By understanding the mechanisms, impact, and mitigation strategies outlined in this analysis, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of SQL Injection via Raw SQL Queries and build more secure EF Core applications. Continuous vigilance, developer training, and the implementation of robust security practices are essential to protect against this prevalent and dangerous vulnerability.
