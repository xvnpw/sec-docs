### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3.1] Inject into string interpolation or concatenation used in raw SQL

#### 4.1. Vulnerability Description

**[1.1.3.1] Inject into string interpolation or concatenation used in raw SQL** arises when developers construct raw SQL queries using string interpolation or concatenation and directly embed user-supplied input into these queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

In EF Core, raw SQL queries are typically executed using methods like `FromSql` (for queries) and `ExecuteSqlRaw` (for commands).  When these methods are used in conjunction with string interpolation (e.g., `$"{variable}"`) or concatenation (e.g., `"+" variable +"`), any malicious SQL code injected into the `variable` will be directly incorporated into the final SQL query executed against the database.

This creates a direct pathway for attackers to manipulate the intended SQL query, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.

#### 4.2. Technical Breakdown

Let's illustrate the technical details with an example based on the provided description:

**Vulnerable Code Example:**

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class BloggingContext : DbContext
{
    public BloggingContext(DbContextOptions<BloggingContext> options) : base(options) { }

    public DbSet<Blog> Blogs { get; set; }
}

public class Blog
{
    public int BlogId { get; set; }
    public string Url { get; set; }
}

public class VulnerableService
{
    private readonly BloggingContext _context;

    public VulnerableService(BloggingContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public async Task<List<Blog>> GetBlogsByNameUnsafe(string blogName)
    {
        // Vulnerable code using string interpolation
        string sqlQuery = $"SELECT * FROM Blogs WHERE Url LIKE '%{blogName}%'";
        return await _context.Blogs.FromSqlRaw(sqlQuery).ToListAsync();
    }
}
```

**Attack Scenario:**

Imagine an attacker provides the following input for `blogName`:

```
%'; DROP TABLE Blogs; --
```

When this input is used in the vulnerable code, the resulting SQL query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Blogs WHERE Url LIKE '%'; DROP TABLE Blogs; --%'
```

**Explanation of the Attack:**

1.  **Injection Point:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code within the `blogName` parameter, which is directly embedded into the SQL query string using string interpolation.
2.  **SQL Injection Payload:**
    *   `%';` : This closes the `LIKE` condition prematurely, effectively making it always true (since anything is like '%').
    *   `DROP TABLE Blogs;` : This is the malicious SQL command that will attempt to delete the `Blogs` table.
    *   `--` : This is a SQL comment that comments out the rest of the original query (`%'`), preventing syntax errors and ensuring the injected command is executed.
3.  **Execution:** When `_context.Blogs.FromSqlRaw(sqlQuery).ToListAsync()` is executed, the database engine will interpret and execute the entire crafted SQL query, including the injected `DROP TABLE Blogs;` command.

**Consequences:** In this scenario, a successful SQL injection could lead to the complete deletion of the `Blogs` table, resulting in significant data loss and application disruption.

#### 4.3. Impact and Consequences

Successful exploitation of this SQL injection vulnerability can have severe consequences, including:

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, personal information, financial records, and proprietary business data.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database, leading to data corruption, loss of data integrity, and application malfunction.
*   **Authentication and Authorization Bypass:** Attackers can bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to application functionalities and administrative privileges.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can execute resource-intensive queries that overload the database server, leading to application downtime and denial of service for legitimate users.
*   **Remote Code Execution (in some cases):** In certain database configurations and with specific database features enabled, attackers might be able to achieve remote code execution on the database server itself, gaining complete control over the system.
*   **Compliance Violations:** Data breaches resulting from SQL injection can lead to violations of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and significant financial penalties.
*   **Reputational Damage:** Security breaches can severely damage an organization's reputation and erode customer trust.

#### 4.4. Real-World Scenarios

This vulnerability can manifest in various real-world application scenarios where developers might be tempted to use raw SQL for flexibility or performance reasons:

*   **Dynamic Search Filters:** Implementing complex search functionalities where filter conditions are dynamically constructed based on user input. For example, allowing users to search blogs based on various criteria (title, content, author) and building the SQL query dynamically.
*   **Custom Reporting and Analytics:** Generating custom reports or performing complex data analysis using raw SQL queries to aggregate and filter data based on user-defined parameters.
*   **Legacy Database Integration:** Interacting with legacy databases or database features that are not fully supported by EF Core's LINQ provider, requiring the use of raw SQL for specific operations.
*   **Performance Optimization (Misguided):**  Developers might incorrectly believe that using raw SQL with string interpolation is a faster or more efficient way to perform certain database operations compared to parameterized queries or LINQ.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies

The primary and most effective mitigation strategy for this vulnerability is to **always use parameterized queries** when executing raw SQL in EF Core.

**Parameterized Queries with `FromSql` and `ExecuteSqlRaw`:**

EF Core provides mechanisms to use parameterized queries with `FromSql` and `ExecuteSqlRaw`. Placeholders are used in the SQL query string, and parameters are passed separately. This ensures that user input is treated as data and not as executable SQL code.

**Secure Code Example (Parameterized Query):**

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class SecureService
{
    private readonly BloggingContext _context;

    public SecureService(BloggingContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public async Task<List<Blog>> GetBlogsByNameSafe(string blogName)
    {
        // Secure code using parameterized query
        string sqlQuery = "SELECT * FROM Blogs WHERE Url LIKE {0}"; // Placeholder {0}
        return await _context.Blogs
                             .FromSqlRaw(sqlQuery, $"%{blogName}%") // Parameter passed separately
                             .ToListAsync();
    }

    public async Task ExecuteBlogUpdateSafe(int blogId, string newUrl)
    {
        string sqlCommand = "UPDATE Blogs SET Url = {0} WHERE BlogId = {1}"; // Placeholders {0} and {1}
        await _context.Database
                      .ExecuteSqlRawAsync(sqlCommand, newUrl, blogId); // Parameters passed separately
    }
}
```

**Explanation of Mitigation:**

1.  **Placeholders:** In the secure examples, placeholders like `{0}`, `{1}`, etc., are used within the SQL query string instead of directly embedding user input.
2.  **Parameter Passing:** The user-provided input (`blogName`, `newUrl`, `blogId`) is passed as separate parameters to `FromSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlRaw`.
3.  **Database Engine Handling:** The database engine treats these parameters as data values, not as SQL code. It properly escapes and sanitizes them before incorporating them into the executed query, effectively preventing SQL injection.

**Additional Best Practices:**

*   **Input Validation:** While parameterized queries are the primary defense, input validation can provide an additional layer of security. Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and lengths, reducing the potential attack surface. However, **do not rely on input validation as the sole defense against SQL injection.**
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant database users only the necessary permissions required for their tasks. This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause if they successfully exploit a SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and remediate potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in your application.
*   **Code Reviews:** Implement code review processes to ensure that developers are following secure coding practices and avoiding the use of string interpolation or concatenation in raw SQL queries.
*   **Static Analysis Tools:** Utilize static analysis tools that can automatically detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in your codebase.

#### 4.6. Detection and Prevention

Identifying and preventing this vulnerability requires a multi-faceted approach:

*   **Code Review:** Manually review code, specifically looking for instances where `FromSql` or `ExecuteSqlRaw` are used with string interpolation or concatenation to construct SQL queries. Pay close attention to how user input is incorporated into these queries.
*   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Employ SAST tools that can automatically scan your codebase for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. These tools can identify patterns of unsafe raw SQL usage.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) / Penetration Testing:** Conduct DAST or penetration testing to actively probe your application for SQL injection vulnerabilities. Security testers will attempt to inject malicious SQL payloads to identify exploitable injection points.
*   **Security Training for Developers:** Provide developers with comprehensive security training on SQL injection vulnerabilities, secure coding practices, and the importance of using parameterized queries.
*   **Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC):** Integrate security considerations into every stage of the SDLC, from design and development to testing and deployment. This includes incorporating security reviews, threat modeling, and vulnerability scanning into the development process.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect suspicious database activity that might indicate a SQL injection attack in progress. Monitor for unusual query patterns, database errors, and unauthorized data access attempts.

### 5. Conclusion

The attack path "[1.1.3.1] Inject into string interpolation or concatenation used in raw SQL" represents a critical vulnerability in EF Core applications.  Failure to properly handle user input when constructing raw SQL queries can lead to severe security breaches and significant damage.

**The key takeaway is to always prioritize parameterized queries when using `FromSql` and `ExecuteSqlRaw` in EF Core.** By treating user input as data rather than executable code, developers can effectively mitigate this type of SQL injection vulnerability and build more secure applications.  Combining parameterized queries with other security best practices like input validation, code reviews, and security testing provides a robust defense against SQL injection attacks.
