# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for aspnet/entityframeworkcore

## Mitigation Strategy: [Always Utilize Parameterized Queries](./mitigation_strategies/always_utilize_parameterized_queries.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Default LINQ Usage:** Developers should primarily use LINQ syntax for data access as EF Core inherently parameterizes queries generated from LINQ. This is the default secure approach within EF Core.
    2.  **Avoid String Manipulation with EF Core Methods:**  Strictly avoid building SQL queries using string concatenation or interpolation when using EF Core methods like `FromSqlRaw` or `ExecuteSqlRaw`, especially when incorporating user-provided data.
    3.  **Parameterized Raw SQL within EF Core:** If raw SQL queries (`FromSqlRaw`, `ExecuteSqlRaw`) are absolutely necessary within EF Core:
        *   Use parameter placeholders (e.g., `@p0`, `@p1`, `:param1`) within the SQL string.
        *   Provide parameter values separately using the appropriate method overload (e.g., `FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = @username", new SqlParameter("@username", username))`).  This is crucial for secure raw SQL in EF Core.
    4.  **Code Reviews Focusing on EF Core Data Access:** Implement mandatory code reviews specifically targeting EF Core data access code to identify and rectify any instances of non-parameterized queries within EF Core contexts.
    5.  **Developer Training on Secure EF Core Practices:** Train developers on the importance of parameterized queries and secure coding practices *specifically within EF Core*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection: High Severity - Exploiting SQL injection through vulnerabilities in EF Core query construction can lead to complete database compromise, data breaches, data manipulation, and denial of service.

*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: High Risk Reduction - Parameterized queries, when correctly used within EF Core, effectively prevent most common SQL injection attacks by treating user inputs as data, not executable code *in the context of EF Core generated SQL*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Largely implemented in new feature development and core data access components that utilize EF Core. LINQ is the standard query method in most modules using EF Core.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Legacy modules using EF Core might contain older code patterns using string concatenation for queries within `FromSqlRaw` or similar methods. Need to conduct a code audit of older sections using EF Core and refactor to use parameterized queries or LINQ.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Exercise Caution with Raw SQL Queries (in EF Core)](./mitigation_strategies/exercise_caution_with_raw_sql_queries__in_ef_core_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize Raw SQL Usage within EF Core:**  Reduce the usage of `FromSqlRaw`, `ExecuteSqlRaw`, and similar EF Core methods to an absolute minimum. Prioritize LINQ and other EF Core features for data access.
    2.  **Justification and Review for Raw SQL in EF Core:**  Require justification and mandatory security review for any instance where raw SQL is deemed necessary *within EF Core*.
    3.  **Strict Parameterization (If Used in EF Core):** If raw SQL is unavoidable *within EF Core*, enforce strict parameterization as described in the "Always Utilize Parameterized Queries" strategy.  Double-check parameterization in raw SQL sections within EF Core code.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection: High Severity - Raw SQL used within EF Core, even with attempts at parameterization, can be more prone to errors and bypasses if not handled with extreme care, increasing SQL injection risk through EF Core.
    *   Accidental SQL Syntax Errors: Medium Severity - Manual SQL construction within EF Core increases the risk of syntax errors that could lead to application malfunctions or unexpected behavior *when using EF Core data access*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: Medium Risk Reduction - While parameterization helps, raw SQL used in EF Core still introduces a higher risk compared to pure LINQ due to manual construction within the EF Core context.
    *   Accidental SQL Syntax Errors: Medium Risk Reduction - Reducing raw SQL usage within EF Core minimizes the chance of manual syntax errors in EF Core data access.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Generally discouraged in development guidelines for EF Core data access. Code reviews usually flag excessive raw SQL usage within EF Core contexts.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No formal process to strictly justify and review raw SQL usage *specifically within EF Core*. Need to implement a mandatory review step for code introducing raw SQL queries in EF Core.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Dynamic LINQ usage *with EF Core* is limited in the project. Where used with EF Core, basic input validation is present.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Lack of strict whitelisting for dynamic LINQ inputs *used with EF Core*. Need to implement a more robust whitelisting approach for properties and operators used in dynamic queries *within EF Core*.  No specific security testing focused on dynamic LINQ manipulation *in the EF Core context*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   All EF Core related threats: Medium Risk Reduction - Code reviews are effective in catching a wide range of security and coding errors *related to EF Core* before they reach production.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Code reviews are a standard part of the development process, but security aspects are not always explicitly emphasized for data access *using EF Core*.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
