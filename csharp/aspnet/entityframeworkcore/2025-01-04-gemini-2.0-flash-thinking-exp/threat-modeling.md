# Threat Model Analysis for aspnet/entityframeworkcore

## Threat: [Raw SQL Injection](./threats/raw_sql_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL commands by providing unsanitized input to Entity Framework Core methods like `FromSqlRaw`, `ExecuteSqlRaw`, or similar. This allows them to bypass intended query logic and execute arbitrary database operations.

**Impact:**
*   Data Breach: Accessing sensitive data.
*   Data Manipulation: Modifying or deleting data.
*   Denial of Service: Disrupting database availability.
*   Privilege Escalation: Gaining unauthorized access to database functionalities.

**Affected Component:**
*   `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational.DatabaseFacadeExtensions.FromSqlRaw()`
*   `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational.DatabaseFacadeExtensions.ExecuteSqlRaw()`

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Always use parameterized queries:** Utilize `FromSqlInterpolated` or parameterize inputs when using `FromSqlRaw`. 
*   **Avoid constructing SQL strings dynamically from user input.**

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate request parameters to modify entity properties that were not intended to be directly updated through Entity Framework Core's change tracking mechanism. This can lead to unintended data changes, privilege escalation, or bypassing business logic.

**Impact:**
*   Data Corruption: Modifying data fields inappropriately.
*   Privilege Escalation: Setting administrative flags or roles.
*   Bypassing Business Rules: Circumventing intended application logic.

**Affected Component:**
*   EF Core's change tracking mechanism when binding request data to entity properties during actions like `Add` or `Update`.
*   `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbContext.SaveChanges()` processing changes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) or View Models:** Define specific classes for receiving and validating input, mapping only allowed properties to entities.
*   **Utilize the `[Bind]` attribute or `[FromBody]` with explicit property definitions** to control which properties can be bound from external input.

## Threat: [Exposed Connection Strings](./threats/exposed_connection_strings.md)

**Description:** Storing database connection strings used by Entity Framework Core in easily accessible locations (e.g., directly in code or unencrypted configuration files) can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the database if the application is compromised.

**Impact:**
*   Full Database Access: Attackers can read, modify, or delete any data in the database.
*   Data Breach: Exposure of all sensitive information.
*   Reputational Damage: Loss of trust due to security breach.

**Affected Component:**
*   `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbContext` configuration and initialization.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Store connection strings securely using environment variables.**
*   **Utilize Azure Key Vault or similar secrets management services.**
*   **Encrypt connection strings in configuration files.**
*   **Avoid hardcoding connection strings in the application code.**

## Threat: [Malicious Migrations](./threats/malicious_migrations.md)

**Description:** If an attacker gains control over the Entity Framework Core migration process (e.g., through compromised development environments or CI/CD pipelines), they could introduce malicious database schema changes that could compromise data integrity, introduce vulnerabilities, or disrupt application functionality.

**Impact:**
*   Data Corruption: Altering database schema to cause data inconsistencies.
*   Introduction of Vulnerabilities: Adding new tables or columns that can be exploited.
*   Denial of Service: Modifying schema to negatively impact performance or availability.

**Affected Component:**
*   EF Core Migrations infrastructure (`Add-Migration`, `Update-Database`).
*   Migration files themselves.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure the migration process:** Restrict access to migration tools and environments.
*   **Implement code reviews for migration scripts.**
*   **Use a dedicated database user with limited privileges for applying migrations in production.**

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in EF Core Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_ef_core_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Entity Framework Core relies on various underlying libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could indirectly affect the security of the application.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. It could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.

**Affected Component:**
*   Various packages within the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.*` namespace and their transitive dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, can be High or Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Regularly update EF Core and its dependencies to the latest stable versions.**
*   **Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases** for known issues in used libraries.
*   **Use dependency scanning tools** to identify potential vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
