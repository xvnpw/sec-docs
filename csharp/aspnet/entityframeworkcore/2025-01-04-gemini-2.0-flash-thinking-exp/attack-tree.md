## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Query Construction Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path, Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_query_construction_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

This category encompasses vulnerabilities arising from how EF Core constructs and executes database queries. If the query construction process is flawed, attackers can inject malicious code or manipulate the query logic to their advantage.

    * **LINQ Injection (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate user inputs (e.g., search terms, filter criteria) that are directly incorporated into LINQ queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows them to inject malicious clauses that alter the query's logic.
        * **Consequences:** Data exfiltration (retrieving unauthorized data), data modification (altering or deleting data), or denial of service (making the application unavailable).
        * **Mitigations:** Parameterize all inputs used in LINQ queries, avoid string interpolation when building queries, and use safe filtering techniques.

    * **Raw SQL Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):**
        * **Attack Vector:**  When developers use raw SQL queries with methods like `FromSqlRaw` or `ExecuteSqlRaw`, and user-provided input is directly concatenated into these SQL strings without proper parameterization, it creates an opportunity for SQL injection attacks.
        * **Consequences:** Full database compromise (gaining complete control over the database), data manipulation, and privilege escalation (gaining higher levels of access).
        * **Mitigations:** Avoid using raw SQL where possible. If raw SQL is necessary, rigorously sanitize and parameterize all inputs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Raw SQL Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path, Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/raw_sql_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  When developers use raw SQL queries with methods like `FromSqlRaw` or `ExecuteSqlRaw`, and user-provided input is directly concatenated into these SQL strings without proper parameterization, it creates an opportunity for SQL injection attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Modification Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path, Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_modification_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

This category focuses on vulnerabilities related to how EF Core handles data updates and modifications. If these processes are not secured, attackers can manipulate data in unintended ways.

    * **Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):**
        * **Attack Vector:** If entity properties are directly bound to user input without explicitly defining which properties are allowed to be modified, an attacker can inject unexpected or malicious values into other properties during update operations.
        * **Consequences:** Data corruption (modifying data to an incorrect state) and privilege escalation (e.g., modifying user roles to gain administrative access).
        * **Mitigations:** Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to explicitly map allowed properties for updates. Use the `[Bind]` attribute with extreme caution and a clear understanding of its implications. Implement strong authorization checks before allowing data updates.

## Attack Tree Path: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path, Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path, Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

This category highlights risks associated with the configuration of EF Core and the application's database connection.

    * **Connection String Exposure (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):**
        * **Attack Vector:** If the database connection string, which contains sensitive credentials, is hardcoded in the application's code or stored insecurely in configuration files, an attacker gaining access to these resources can retrieve the credentials.
        * **Consequences:** Full database access, potentially compromising other applications that share the same database.
        * **Mitigations:** Store connection strings securely using mechanisms like Azure Key Vault, environment variables, or other secure configuration management tools. Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in the application code.
