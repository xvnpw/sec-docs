Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve Entity Framework Core:

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection via Raw SQL or LINQ Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker could craft malicious SQL statements within user-supplied input that is then used to construct a raw SQL query executed by EF Core. This involves using string concatenation or interpolation with the `.FromSqlRaw()` method or similar approaches. Alternatively, if LINQ queries are built dynamically based on untrusted input without proper sanitization, attackers might inject malicious logic that EF Core translates into harmful SQL.
    *   **Impact:**  Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. Attackers might be able to bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms, potentially gaining full control over the database.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `Database` abstraction layer when using `.FromSqlRaw()` or similar raw SQL execution methods.
        *   `Query Compilation` pipeline when dynamically building LINQ queries based on untrusted input.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use parameterized queries with `.FromSqlRaw()` and related methods.
        *   Avoid dynamic construction of LINQ queries based on direct user input.
        *   Utilize EF Core's built-in features for filtering and searching.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all user-provided data *before* using it in EF Core queries.

*   **Threat:** Mass Assignment Vulnerability
    *   **Description:** If EF Core entities are directly bound to user input (e.g., from a web form) without proper filtering of allowed properties, an attacker could manipulate request parameters to modify unintended entity properties. EF Core's change tracking mechanism will then persist these unintended changes to the database. This can lead to privilege escalation or data corruption.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of data, potentially leading to privilege escalation (e.g., setting an `IsAdmin` flag) or data integrity issues.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `Entity Tracking` and `Change Detection`, specifically when entity instances are directly populated from external data sources without proper filtering.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) or View Models to represent data received from the client.
        *   Map only the necessary properties from the DTO to the entity.
        *   Avoid directly binding request data to EF Core entities.
        *   Implement authorization checks before updating entity properties *within the application logic, not just relying on EF Core*.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Connection String Storage
    *   **Description:** Storing database connection strings directly in the application code or configuration files without proper encryption can expose sensitive credentials. While not a vulnerability *in* EF Core itself, the way EF Core *uses* connection strings makes this a critical concern. If an attacker gains access to the application's deployment package or configuration, they can retrieve the connection string used by EF Core.
    *   **Impact:** Database compromise, unauthorized access to data.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `Database Context Configuration`, where the connection string is typically defined and used by EF Core.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store connection strings securely using environment variables, Azure Key Vault, or other secure configuration management solutions.
        *   Avoid hardcoding connection strings in the application code.
        *   Encrypt connection strings in configuration files if other options are not feasible.
