# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for aspnet/entityframeworkcore

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Utilize Parameterized Queries and LINQ](./mitigation_strategies/1__utilize_parameterized_queries_and_linq.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Parameterized Queries and LINQ Usage (EF Core Focus)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Primarily Use LINQ:**  Construct the vast majority of database queries using LINQ. EF Core's LINQ provider automatically generates parameterized SQL queries, which is a core security feature to prevent SQL injection.
    2.  **Favor Stored Procedures (Parameterized by Design):** For complex or performance-critical queries, consider using stored procedures. EF Core can execute stored procedures, which inherently use parameters and are pre-compiled in the database.
    3.  **Strictly Parameterize Raw SQL (When Absolutely Necessary):** If using raw SQL via `FromSqlRaw` or `FromSqlInterpolated` is unavoidable for specific scenarios:
        *   **`FromSqlRaw`:**  Use parameter placeholders (`@p0`, `@p1`, etc.) in the SQL string and provide parameter values as separate arguments to the method.
        *   **`FromSqlInterpolated`:** Use interpolated strings (`$``````""`) but ensure that any dynamic values inserted into the SQL string are parameters, not directly user-provided strings.  Let EF Core handle parameterization through interpolation.
    4.  **Code Review Focus on Query Construction:** During code reviews, specifically scrutinize how database queries are built, ensuring that parameterized approaches are consistently used and raw SQL is minimized and properly parameterized.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** Directly mitigates SQL injection vulnerabilities by ensuring that user-provided input is treated as data, not executable SQL code, when interacting with the database through EF Core.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** High Risk Reduction -  Effectively eliminates the primary SQL injection vector *introduced through EF Core query construction* when consistently applied.  This leverages EF Core's built-in parameterization capabilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented within EF Core usage. LINQ is the standard query method, leveraging EF Core's parameterization. Stored procedures are used in specific modules.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Instances of `FromSqlRaw` with potential for non-parameterized dynamic input still exist in older modules and reporting functionalities.  These need to be refactored to fully leverage EF Core's secure query mechanisms.  Specifically, legacy data access code and certain reporting queries require review and update to ensure complete parameterization when using raw SQL features of EF Core.

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Optimize EF Core Queries for Performance and Resource Management](./mitigation_strategies/2__optimize_ef_core_queries_for_performance_and_resource_management.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** EF Core Query Optimization and Efficient Data Retrieval
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Query Performance (EF Core Profiling/Logging):** Utilize EF Core's logging capabilities and database profiling tools to identify slow-performing queries generated by EF Core.
    2.  **Optimize LINQ Query Structure:** Refine LINQ queries to be efficient by:
        *   **Strategic Eager Loading (`Include`):** Use `Include` judiciously to load related data in a single query when needed, minimizing round trips, but avoid over-eager loading.
        *   **Targeted Explicit Loading (`Load`):** Employ `Load` to fetch related data on demand only when required, preventing unnecessary data retrieval upfront.
        *   **Precise Projection (`Select`):** Use `Select` to retrieve only the specific columns and properties needed, reducing data transfer and processing overhead by the database and EF Core.
        *   **Effective Filtering (`Where`):** Apply `Where` clauses early in the query pipeline to reduce the dataset processed by EF Core and the database.
        *   **Read-Only Queries (`AsNoTracking`):** Use `AsNoTracking()` for queries where data modification is not intended. This optimizes performance by disabling EF Core's change tracking mechanism.
    3.  **Database Indexing (Supporting EF Core Queries):** Ensure that database indexes are appropriately configured on columns frequently used in `Where`, `OrderBy`, and join conditions within EF Core LINQ queries. This directly improves the efficiency of database operations triggered by EF Core.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Amplification via Inefficient Queries (Medium to High Severity):**  Mitigates the risk of DoS attacks that exploit poorly performing EF Core queries to consume excessive database and application resources, leading to service degradation or unavailability.  Optimized EF Core queries reduce the attack surface by minimizing resource strain.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS Amplification:** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the potential for DoS attacks that leverage inefficient database interactions initiated by EF Core.  Improved query performance makes the application more resilient to resource exhaustion attacks related to data access.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic query optimization techniques are applied in many areas where EF Core is used. Indexing is generally in place for core database tables.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Regular, systematic performance analysis of EF Core queries is not consistently performed.  Proactive optimization of complex LINQ queries and database index tuning specifically for EF Core usage is needed.  A more proactive approach to monitoring and optimizing EF Core generated SQL is required to ensure long-term performance and resilience.
