### 4. Deep Analysis of SQL Injection via Raw SQL Queries

#### 4.1 Understanding the Vulnerability

SQL Injection is a code injection technique that exploits security vulnerabilities in an application's software when it constructs SQL statements from user-supplied input. When an application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize user input before incorporating it into a SQL query, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code. This injected code can then be executed by the database server, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other malicious activities.

In the context of EF Core, the primary entry point for this vulnerability lies in the use of methods that allow direct execution of raw SQL queries:

*   **`context.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw(string sql, params object[] parameters)`:** This method executes a non-query SQL command directly against the database. The SQL string is provided as is, and if it contains unsanitized user input, it becomes a prime target for SQL Injection.

*   **`context.Database.ExecuteSqlInterpolated($"...", parameters)`:** While offering a more readable syntax using string interpolation, this method is still vulnerable if the interpolated values are not treated as parameters. If user input is directly embedded within the interpolated string without proper parameterization, it remains susceptible to injection.

#### 4.2 EF Core's Contribution to the Attack Surface

EF Core, while providing robust features for secure data access through its LINQ-based query system, also offers the flexibility to execute raw SQL queries for scenarios where LINQ might be insufficient or less performant. This flexibility, however, introduces the risk of SQL Injection if not handled carefully.

The core issue is that these methods bypass EF Core's built-in query translation and parameterization mechanisms. When developers construct SQL queries by directly concatenating strings with user input, they are essentially creating a pathway for attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

#### 4.3 Detailed Example and Attack Vectors

Let's revisit and expand on the provided example:

```csharp
string userInput = GetUserInput(); // Potentially malicious input
var query = $"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '{userInput}'";
context.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw(query);
```

**Attack Vector:** An attacker could provide the following input for `userInput`:

```
' OR '1'='1
```

This would result in the following SQL query being executed:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '' OR '1'='1'
```

The `OR '1'='1'` condition is always true, effectively bypassing the intended `WHERE` clause and returning all rows from the `Users` table.

**More Sophisticated Attacks:**

*   **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker could inject SQL to select data from other tables or databases. For example:

    ```
    '; SELECT CreditCardNumber FROM SensitiveData --
    ```

    This could lead to the execution of a second query retrieving sensitive information.

*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could inject SQL to modify or delete data:

    ```
    '; UPDATE Users SET IsAdmin = 1 WHERE Username = 'victim'; --
    ```

    This could elevate privileges or compromise user accounts.

*   **Denial of Service:**  Malicious SQL could be injected to overload the database server or cause errors, leading to a denial of service.

#### 4.4 Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful SQL Injection attack via raw SQL queries can be severe and far-reaching:

*   **Full Database Compromise:** Attackers can gain complete control over the database server, allowing them to read, modify, or delete any data.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive information, including user credentials, financial data, and proprietary information, can be stolen.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Critical data can be altered or corrupted, leading to business disruption and financial losses.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can bypass authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to the application.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can elevate their privileges within the application or the database.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The database server can be overloaded or crashed, making the application unavailable.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and customer trust.
*   **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:** Data breaches can lead to significant fines and legal repercussions.

Given the potential for widespread and severe damage, the **Risk Severity** remains **Critical**.

#### 4.5 Mitigation Strategies

Preventing SQL Injection via raw SQL queries requires a strong focus on secure coding practices and leveraging the features provided by EF Core.

*   **Always Use Parameterized Queries:** This is the most effective defense against SQL Injection. Instead of directly embedding user input into the SQL string, use parameters. EF Core will handle the proper escaping and quoting of parameter values, preventing malicious code from being interpreted as SQL.

    **Example using `ExecuteSqlRaw` with parameters:**

    ```csharp
    string userInput = GetUserInput();
    var usernameParam = new SqlParameter("@username", userInput);
    var query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = @username";
    context.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw(query, usernameParam);
    ```

    **Example using `ExecuteSqlInterpolated` with parameters:**

    ```csharp
    string userInput = GetUserInput();
    var query = $"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = {userInput}";
    context.Database.ExecuteSqlInterpolated($"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = {userInput}"); // Incorrect and vulnerable

    // Correct and secure usage:
    context.Database.ExecuteSqlInterpolated($"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = {SqlParameter.CreateParameter("@username", userInput)}");
    ```

    **Important Note on `ExecuteSqlInterpolated`:** While it offers a more readable syntax, it's crucial to understand that simply using string interpolation does **not** automatically protect against SQL Injection. You must still ensure that user-provided values are treated as parameters. The recommended approach is to explicitly create `SqlParameter` objects within the interpolated string.

*   **Avoid String Concatenation for Query Building:**  Never construct SQL queries by directly concatenating strings with user input. This practice is inherently insecure and makes the application vulnerable to SQL Injection.

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Secondary Defense):** While parameterization is the primary defense, input validation and sanitization can act as a secondary layer of protection. Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and sanitize it by removing or escaping potentially harmful characters. However, **do not rely solely on input validation for SQL Injection prevention.** Parameterization is essential.

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user account used by the application has only the necessary permissions to perform its intended operations. This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause even if they successfully inject SQL.

*   **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities and other security flaws. Pay close attention to areas where raw SQL queries are used.

*   **Use an ORM's Built-in Querying Capabilities:** Whenever possible, leverage EF Core's LINQ-based querying capabilities. These methods automatically handle parameterization and are generally safer than raw SQL queries. Reserve the use of `ExecuteSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlInterpolated` for scenarios where LINQ is genuinely insufficient.

*   **Stay Updated with Security Best Practices:** Keep abreast of the latest security best practices and vulnerabilities related to SQL Injection and EF Core.

#### 4.6 Specific Considerations for `ExecuteSqlInterpolated`

While `ExecuteSqlInterpolated` can improve code readability, developers must be particularly cautious. Simply interpolating user input directly into the string does **not** provide protection against SQL Injection. The correct and secure way to use `ExecuteSqlInterpolated` with user input is to explicitly create `SqlParameter` objects within the interpolated string, as shown in the mitigation examples.

Failing to do so renders `ExecuteSqlInterpolated` just as vulnerable as `ExecuteSqlRaw` with string concatenation.

#### 4.7 Developer Best Practices

*   **"Parameterize Everything":** Adopt a strict policy of always parameterizing user-provided values when executing raw SQL queries.
*   **Favor LINQ:**  Utilize EF Core's LINQ capabilities whenever feasible to avoid the risks associated with raw SQL.
*   **Educate Developers:** Ensure that all developers on the team are aware of the risks of SQL Injection and understand how to use EF Core's raw SQL features securely.
*   **Implement Automated Security Testing:** Integrate static and dynamic analysis tools into the development pipeline to automatically detect potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

### 5. Conclusion

SQL Injection via raw SQL queries remains a critical security risk in applications using Entity Framework Core. While EF Core provides the flexibility to execute raw SQL, developers must exercise extreme caution and adhere to secure coding practices, particularly the consistent use of parameterized queries. By understanding the mechanics of this vulnerability, its potential impact, and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of successful exploitation and protect their applications and data. A proactive and security-conscious approach is essential when working with raw SQL in any application framework.
