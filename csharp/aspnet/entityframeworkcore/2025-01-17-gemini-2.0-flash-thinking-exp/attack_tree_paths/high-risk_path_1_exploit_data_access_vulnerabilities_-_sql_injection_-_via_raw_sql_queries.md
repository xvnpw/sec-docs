### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: SQL Injection via Raw SQL Queries

#### 4.1. Attack Vector Breakdown

* **Goal:** The attacker aims to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the underlying database. This allows them to bypass the application's intended logic and directly interact with the data.
* **Method:** The attacker exploits the use of raw SQL queries constructed by directly embedding user-supplied input into the query string. Specifically, methods like `context.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw()` and, critically, even `context.Database.ExecuteSqlInterpolated()` can be vulnerable if not used correctly. The vulnerability arises when developers concatenate user input directly into the SQL string instead of using parameterized queries.
* **Likelihood: High:** This is a well-known and frequently exploited vulnerability. The ease with which developers can fall into the trap of string concatenation, especially when dealing with dynamic query requirements, makes this a persistent threat. The availability of numerous tools and tutorials for exploiting SQL injection further increases the likelihood.
* **Impact: Critical:** Successful SQL injection can have devastating consequences:
    * **Data Breach:** Attackers can read sensitive data, including user credentials, financial information, and personal details.
    * **Data Modification/Deletion:** Attackers can alter or delete critical data, leading to data corruption, business disruption, and compliance violations.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers might be able to manipulate database structures or execute stored procedures with elevated privileges, potentially gaining control over the entire database server or even the underlying operating system.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers could execute resource-intensive queries to overload the database server, causing it to become unresponsive.
* **Effort: Low:** Exploiting basic SQL injection vulnerabilities requires relatively little effort. Numerous automated tools can scan for and exploit these weaknesses. Even manual exploitation is straightforward for individuals with a basic understanding of SQL syntax.
* **Skill Level: Intermediate:** While advanced SQL injection techniques can be complex, exploiting basic vulnerabilities through direct string concatenation requires only an intermediate understanding of SQL and web application vulnerabilities. Many readily available resources guide attackers through the process.
* **Detection Difficulty: Medium:** While basic SQL injection attempts might be detectable through simple input validation or web application firewalls (WAFs), more sophisticated techniques, such as obfuscated payloads or second-order SQL injection, can bypass these defenses. Effective detection requires comprehensive logging, robust input validation, and potentially the use of specialized security tools.

#### 4.2. Technical Deep Dive: Vulnerable EF Core Methods

The core of this vulnerability lies in the misuse of EF Core methods designed for executing raw SQL queries:

* **`context.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw(string sql, params object[] parameters)`:** This method executes a non-query SQL command directly against the database. The crucial point is that if the `sql` string is constructed by directly concatenating user input, it becomes highly vulnerable to SQL injection.

   **Vulnerable Code Example:**

   ```csharp
   string userInput = GetUserInput(); // Assume this gets input from the user
   string sql = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '" + userInput + "'";
   context.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw(sql);
   ```

   In this example, if `userInput` contains malicious SQL code (e.g., `' OR '1'='1`), the resulting SQL query will be manipulated, potentially returning all users or allowing further malicious actions.

* **`context.Database.ExecuteSqlInterpolated($"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '{userInput}'")`:** While seemingly safer due to the use of string interpolation, this method is **still vulnerable** if the interpolated value is not properly handled. If `userInput` contains malicious SQL characters, they will be directly embedded into the SQL string.

   **Still Vulnerable Code Example:**

   ```csharp
   string userInput = GetUserInput();
   var sql = $"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '{userInput}'";
   context.Database.ExecuteSqlInterpolated($"{sql}");
   ```

   Even though it uses interpolation, it's essentially the same as string concatenation from a security perspective.

**The Key Difference and the Correct Approach:**

The intended and secure way to use these methods is with **parameterization**. Parameterization treats user input as data, not as executable SQL code.

* **`context.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw(string sql, params object[] parameters)` with Parameters:**

   ```csharp
   string userInput = GetUserInput();
   string sql = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = @p0";
   context.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw(sql, userInput);
   ```

   Here, `@p0` is a placeholder for the parameter. EF Core will handle the proper escaping and quoting of the `userInput` value, preventing it from being interpreted as SQL code.

* **`context.Database.ExecuteSqlInterpolated($"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = {userInput}")` (Correct Usage):**

   ```csharp
   string userInput = GetUserInput();
   var sql = $"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = {userInput}";
   var users = context.Users.FromSqlInterpolated(sql).ToList(); // Example with FromSqlInterpolated
   ```

   When used with methods like `FromSqlInterpolated`, EF Core correctly parameterizes the interpolated values. **However, it's crucial to understand that if the entire SQL string itself is dynamically generated based on user input and then passed to `ExecuteSqlInterpolated`, it remains vulnerable.**

#### 4.3. Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate the risk of SQL injection via raw SQL queries, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Prioritize Parameterized Queries:**  The most effective defense is to **always use parameterized queries** when dealing with user-supplied input in raw SQL. This ensures that user input is treated as data, not executable code. Utilize the parameterization features of `ExecuteSqlRaw` and `FromSqlInterpolated` correctly.
* **Avoid Dynamic SQL Construction with User Input:**  Refrain from building SQL queries by directly concatenating user input. If dynamic query construction is necessary, explore alternative approaches like using EF Core's LINQ capabilities or building the query structure programmatically without direct string manipulation of user input.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  While not a primary defense against SQL injection, validating and sanitizing user input can help reduce the attack surface. Validate the data type, length, and format of user input. Sanitize input by escaping or removing potentially harmful characters. **However, relying solely on input validation is insufficient to prevent SQL injection.**
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant database users only the necessary permissions required for their tasks. This limits the potential damage an attacker can inflict even if they successfully execute SQL injection.
* **Code Reviews:**  Implement thorough code review processes to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities before they reach production. Educate developers on secure coding practices related to database interactions.
* **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) Tools:**  Utilize SAST tools that can automatically scan the codebase for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. These tools can identify risky code patterns and help developers proactively address them.
* **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):**  Deploy a WAF to filter out malicious requests, including those containing potential SQL injection payloads. WAFs can provide an additional layer of defense, but they should not be considered a replacement for secure coding practices.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities in the application, including SQL injection flaws. Engage security experts to perform thorough assessments.
* **Escaping Output (Context Dependent):** While primarily for preventing cross-site scripting (XSS), understanding output encoding can be relevant in certain scenarios where data retrieved from the database is later displayed. However, this is not a direct mitigation for SQL injection itself.

#### 4.4. Specific Considerations for Entity Framework Core

* **Leverage LINQ:**  Whenever possible, utilize EF Core's LINQ capabilities to construct database queries. LINQ provides a type-safe and parameterized way to interact with the database, significantly reducing the risk of SQL injection.
* **`FromSqlRaw` and `FromSqlInterpolated` for Queries:** When executing raw SQL queries for data retrieval, use `context.Database.SqlQueryRaw<T>` or `context.Database.SqlQueryInterpolated<T>` (or their DbSet equivalents like `context.Users.FromSqlRaw` and `context.Users.FromSqlInterpolated`). Ensure proper parameterization.
* **Be Cautious with Dynamic Queries:** If dynamic query construction is unavoidable, carefully consider the security implications and implement robust safeguards, prioritizing parameterized approaches.
* **Stay Updated:** Keep EF Core and related database drivers up-to-date with the latest security patches.
