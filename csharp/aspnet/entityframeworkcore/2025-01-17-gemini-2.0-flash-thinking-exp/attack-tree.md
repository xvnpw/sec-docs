## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploit Data Access Vulnerabilities -> SQL Injection -> Via Raw SQL Queries](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploit_data_access_vulnerabilities_-_sql_injection_-_via_raw_sql_queries.md)

* Attack Vector:
    * Goal: Execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database.
    * Method: An attacker injects malicious SQL code into string parameters that are used to construct raw SQL queries executed via methods like `context.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw()` or `context.Database.ExecuteSqlInterpolated()`.
    * Likelihood: High - This is a common vulnerability, especially when developers directly concatenate user input into SQL queries.
    * Impact: Critical - Successful exploitation can lead to full database compromise, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete any data, including sensitive information. They could also potentially execute stored procedures or other database commands leading to further system compromise.
    * Effort: Low - Numerous tools and readily available techniques exist for exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    * Skill Level: Intermediate - Requires a basic understanding of SQL and web application vulnerabilities.
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium - While detectable with proper logging and input validation, sophisticated injection techniques can bypass basic detection mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities -> Sensitive Information in Connection Strings](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities_-_sensitive_information_in_connection_strings.md)

* Attack Vector:
    * Goal: Obtain database credentials (username and password).
    * Method: An attacker gains access to configuration files (e.g., `appsettings.json`), environment variables, source code, or other locations where connection strings are stored. If these connection strings contain database credentials in plain text or easily decryptable formats, the attacker can retrieve them.
    * Likelihood: Medium - Depends heavily on the security practices of the development and deployment process. If secure configuration management is not implemented, the likelihood is high.
    * Impact: Critical - Obtaining database credentials provides the attacker with direct access to the database, bypassing application-level security measures. This allows them to perform any action on the database, similar to a successful SQL injection attack, but with potentially broader access depending on the database user's permissions.
    * Effort: Low - Accessing configuration files or environment variables can often be done with basic system access or by exploiting other vulnerabilities that expose these files.
    * Skill Level: Beginner - Requires minimal technical skill to read configuration files or environment variables.
    * Detection Difficulty: Low - Static analysis tools can easily detect hardcoded credentials or insecurely stored connection strings. However, detecting access to configuration files at runtime requires robust monitoring.
