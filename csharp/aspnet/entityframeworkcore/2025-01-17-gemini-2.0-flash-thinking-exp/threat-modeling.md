# Threat Model Analysis for aspnet/entityframeworkcore

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Raw SQL or Interpolated Strings](./threats/sql_injection_via_raw_sql_or_interpolated_strings.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code through user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized when constructing database queries using `DbContext.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw()` or string interpolation within LINQ queries. This could involve manipulating `WHERE` clauses to bypass authentication, using `UNION` statements to retrieve unauthorized data, or executing stored procedures to gain control of the database.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized data access, data modification, data deletion, potential command execution on the database server, leading to complete compromise of the application's data and potentially the underlying system.
*   **Affected Component:** `DbContext.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw()`, LINQ query translation (when using string interpolation).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always use parameterized queries with `DbContext.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw()`:** This ensures that user input is treated as data, not executable code.
    *   **Prefer LINQ to Entities with parameterized queries:**  LINQ to Entities generally handles parameterization automatically.
    *   **Avoid string interpolation when constructing LINQ queries with user input:** Use method syntax with parameters instead.
    *   **Implement strong input validation:** While parameterization is the primary defense, validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and constraints.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate HTTP request parameters to modify entity properties that should not be directly accessible or modifiable. This occurs when EF Core's model binding automatically maps request data to entity properties without proper restrictions. An attacker might change sensitive fields like user roles, prices, or administrative flags.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of sensitive data, data corruption, privilege escalation, and potential business logic bypass.
*   **Affected Component:** Model Binding, Change Tracking.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) or View Models:** Define specific classes for receiving and sending data, explicitly mapping only the allowed properties to the entity.
    *   **Use the `[Bind]` attribute or Fluent API configuration:** Restrict which properties can be bound during model binding.
    *   **Explicitly update only necessary properties:** Instead of relying on automatic binding, manually update the required properties in your code.
    *   **Implement authorization checks before saving changes:** Verify that the current user has the necessary permissions to modify the affected properties.

## Threat: [Exposed Connection Strings](./threats/exposed_connection_strings.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker who gains access to the application's configuration files or source code could retrieve the database connection string. This connection string often contains sensitive credentials that can be used to directly access and manipulate the database, bypassing application security measures.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the database, including unauthorized data access, modification, and deletion.
*   **Affected Component:** `DbContext` configuration, Database Provider.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Store connection strings securely:** Use environment variables, Azure Key Vault, or other secure configuration management solutions.
    *   **Avoid hardcoding connection strings:** Never embed connection strings directly in your source code.
    *   **Encrypt connection strings in configuration files:** Use appropriate encryption mechanisms provided by the hosting environment.
    *   **Restrict access to configuration files:** Ensure that only authorized personnel can access deployment configuration files.
