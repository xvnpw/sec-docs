## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector focuses on injecting malicious SQL code into database queries through improperly handled user input or other external data sources. EF Core is designed to prevent this through parameterized queries, but vulnerabilities can arise when developers bypass these safeguards.

*   **Sub-Nodes (Attack Methods):**

    *   **Raw SQL (HIGH-RISK):**
        *   **Description:** Directly executing SQL commands using `FromSqlRaw` or `ExecuteSqlRaw` without proper parameterization. This is the most direct and dangerous form of SQL injection within EF Core.
        *   **Likelihood:** High. Developers might use raw SQL for perceived performance gains or when dealing with complex queries that are difficult to express with LINQ.
        *   **Impact:** Very High. Complete database compromise, data theft, data modification, and potential server compromise.
        *   **Effort:** Low. Basic SQL injection techniques are widely known and easily implemented.
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate. Basic attacks are simple, but advanced exploitation might require more knowledge.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Can be detected through careful code review, static analysis, and monitoring of SQL queries, but sophisticated attacks can be obfuscated.

    *   **Dynamic LINQ (HIGH-RISK):**
        *   **Description:** Constructing LINQ queries dynamically based on user input. If the input is not properly sanitized and validated, it can be manipulated to inject malicious SQL fragments.
        *   **Likelihood:** High. Dynamic LINQ is often used to build flexible queries based on user selections or filters, making it a common target.
        *   **Impact:** Very High. Similar to raw SQL injection, it can lead to complete database compromise.
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium. Requires understanding of LINQ and how it translates to SQL, but readily available tools and techniques can be used.
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate. Requires a good understanding of LINQ and SQL injection principles.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard. More difficult to detect than raw SQL injection because the malicious code is often embedded within seemingly legitimate LINQ expressions.

**Mitigation Summary (for High-Risk and Critical Nodes):**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Always use parameterized queries (FromSqlInterpolated or LINQ expressions with parameters).**
    *   **Implement strict input validation and sanitization.**
    *   **Follow the principle of least privilege for database user accounts.**
    *   **Regularly review code for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.**
    *   **Use static analysis tools.**
    *   **Use a well-vetted Dynamic LINQ library and avoid building queries directly from user input.**

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Inefficient Queries / Resource Exhaustion (CRITICAL)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_inefficient_queries__resource_exhaustion__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector focuses on causing a denial-of-service (DoS) by overwhelming the database server with inefficient queries. While not a direct data breach, it can render the application unusable.

*   **Sub-Nodes (Attack Methods):**

    *   **N+1 Problem (CRITICAL):**
        *   **Description:** This occurs when EF Core executes a separate database query for each related entity, rather than fetching all related data in a single query. This is extremely common when developers are not careful about how they load related data.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium. Very common in applications that don't explicitly use eager loading or projections. Developers often overlook this issue.
        *   **Impact:** High. Can lead to severe performance degradation and even complete application downtime, especially under heavy load.
        *   **Effort:** Low. Can occur unintentionally due to inefficient coding practices.  Intentionally triggering it is also relatively easy.
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate.  Understanding the problem requires some knowledge of EF Core's loading mechanisms, but the underlying cause is often simple to create.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Requires performance monitoring and analysis of database query logs to identify the excessive number of queries.

**Mitigation Summary (for High-Risk and Critical Nodes):**
    *   **Inefficient Queries/Resource Exhaustion:**
        *   **Use eager loading (`Include`) or projections to avoid the N+1 problem.**
        *   **Implement pagination for large result sets.**
        *   **Ensure proper database indexing.**
        *   **Profile and optimize database queries.**
        *   **Use asynchronous methods to avoid blocking threads.**
        *   **Monitor application performance and database load.**
