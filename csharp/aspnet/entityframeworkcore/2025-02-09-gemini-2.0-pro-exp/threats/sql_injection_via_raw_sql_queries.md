Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "SQL Injection via Raw SQL Queries" threat, tailored for an application using Entity Framework Core:

# Deep Analysis: SQL Injection via Raw SQL Queries in Entity Framework Core

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the mechanics of SQL injection attacks exploiting raw SQL queries within Entity Framework Core.
*   Identify specific code patterns and practices that introduce this vulnerability.
*   Evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies.
*   Provide actionable recommendations for developers to prevent this vulnerability.
*   Establish clear guidelines for secure usage of `FromSqlRaw`, `ExecuteSqlRaw`, and related methods.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on SQL injection vulnerabilities arising from the misuse of raw SQL query execution methods provided by Entity Framework Core, specifically:

*   `FromSqlRaw`
*   `ExecuteSqlRaw`
*   `ExecuteSqlRawAsync`
*   Any custom methods built upon these that directly interact with EF Core's database connection.

The analysis *does not* cover:

*   SQL injection vulnerabilities in other parts of the application that do not use EF Core.
*   Other types of injection attacks (e.g., command injection, LDAP injection).
*   Vulnerabilities in the underlying database system itself.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review:** Examination of hypothetical and real-world code examples to identify vulnerable patterns.
*   **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Breaking down the attack vector step-by-step, explaining how an attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation Analysis:**  Evaluating the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies, including their limitations.
*   **Best Practices Definition:**  Formulating clear, concise, and actionable best practices for developers.
*   **Tooling Assessment:**  Briefly discussing static analysis tools that can aid in detection.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1 Attack Vector Breakdown

The core of this vulnerability lies in the direct concatenation of user-supplied input into a raw SQL query string.  Let's illustrate with a vulnerable example:

```csharp
// VULNERABLE CODE - DO NOT USE
public List<Product> GetProductsByName(string productName)
{
    using (var context = new MyDbContext())
    {
        // DANGER: Direct string concatenation allows SQL injection
        string query = "SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name = '" + productName + "'";
        return context.Products.FromSqlRaw(query).ToList();
    }
}
```

An attacker can exploit this by providing a crafted `productName` value.  For example:

*   **Input:**  `'; DROP TABLE Products; --`

This input results in the following SQL query being executed:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name = ''; DROP TABLE Products; --'
```

This query will:

1.  Select all products where the name is an empty string (likely no products).
2.  **Drop the entire `Products` table.**
3.  Comment out the rest of the original query.

This is a classic example of SQL injection.  The attacker has injected malicious SQL code (`DROP TABLE Products;`) by manipulating the input.  The single quotes and semicolon are crucial SQL syntax elements that allow the attacker to terminate the intended query and insert their own commands.

Other attack variations include:

*   **Data Extraction:**  `' OR 1=1; --` (retrieves all products).
*   **Union-Based Attacks:**  `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM Users; --` (attempts to extract data from another table).
*   **Time-Based Blind SQL Injection:**  Using `WAITFOR DELAY` or similar database-specific functions to infer information based on response times.
*   **Error-Based SQL Injection:**  Triggering database errors to reveal information about the database structure.

### 2.2 Vulnerable Code Patterns

The primary vulnerable pattern is **string concatenation or interpolation to build SQL queries with user input.**  This includes:

*   Directly using the `+` operator to concatenate strings.
*   Using string interpolation (`$"{variable}"`) with user input directly within the SQL string.
*   Any custom string building logic that incorporates user input without proper sanitization or parameterization.

### 2.3 Mitigation Strategy Analysis

Let's analyze the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies:

*   **Parameterized Queries (Highly Effective):**

    ```csharp
    // SECURE CODE - Using Parameterized Queries
    public List<Product> GetProductsByName(string productName)
    {
        using (var context = new MyDbContext())
        {
            return context.Products.FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name = {0}", productName).ToList();
            // OR, using SqlParameter:
            // var param = new SqlParameter("@productName", productName);
            // return context.Products.FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name = @productName", param).ToList();

        }
    }
    ```

    This is the **most effective** mitigation.  EF Core and the underlying database provider handle the proper escaping and quoting of the parameter value, preventing SQL injection.  The database treats the parameter as *data*, not as part of the SQL command itself.  The `{0}` placeholder (or `@productName` with `SqlParameter`) is replaced with the *value* of `productName`, properly escaped.

*   **Input Validation (Defense in Depth):**

    While parameterized queries are the primary defense, input validation adds an extra layer of security.  It helps prevent unexpected data from reaching the database, even if parameterization is somehow bypassed (which is highly unlikely).  Examples include:

    *   **Type Checking:** Ensure the input is of the expected data type (e.g., string, integer).
    *   **Length Restrictions:** Limit the maximum length of the input.
    *   **Whitelist Validation:**  Only allow specific characters or patterns (e.g., alphanumeric characters for a product name).
    *   **Regular Expressions:** Use regular expressions to enforce specific input formats.

    ```csharp
    // SECURE CODE - Input Validation + Parameterized Queries
    public List<Product> GetProductsByName(string productName)
    {
        // Input Validation (example - adjust as needed)
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(productName) || productName.Length > 100)
        {
            throw new ArgumentException("Invalid product name.");
        }
        //check for invalid characters
        if (!Regex.IsMatch(productName, @"^[a-zA-Z0-9\s]+$"))
        {
            throw new ArgumentException("Invalid product name.");
        }

        using (var context = new MyDbContext())
        {
            return context.Products.FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name = {0}", productName).ToList();
        }
    }
    ```

*   **Least Privilege (Essential):**

    The database user account used by the application should have only the necessary permissions.  For example, if the application only needs to read product data, the account should *not* have `DROP TABLE` privileges.  This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause, even if they successfully inject SQL code.  This is a database configuration issue, not directly related to EF Core code, but crucial for overall security.

*   **Static Analysis (Proactive Detection):**

    Static analysis tools can scan the codebase for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.  These tools look for patterns like string concatenation in database queries.  Examples include:

    *   **.NET Analyzers (Roslyn Analyzers):**  Microsoft provides built-in analyzers that can detect some security issues.
    *   **SonarQube:**  A popular static analysis platform that supports C# and can identify SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Veracode:**  A commercial static analysis tool with strong security analysis capabilities.
    *   **Resharper/Rider:** IDE extensions that can provide warnings.

    Static analysis is a valuable tool for *proactively* identifying vulnerabilities before they reach production.  It's not a replacement for secure coding practices, but a helpful addition.

### 2.4 Best Practices

Based on the analysis, here are the best practices for developers:

1.  **Always use parameterized queries with `FromSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlRaw`.**  Never concatenate user input directly into the SQL string.
2.  **Implement input validation as a defense-in-depth measure.**  Validate the type, length, and content of user input before passing it to any database-related function.
3.  **Ensure the database user account has the least privilege necessary.**  Avoid using accounts with administrative rights.
4.  **Use static analysis tools to detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.**
5.  **Regularly review and update your code to address any identified vulnerabilities.**
6.  **Stay informed about the latest security threats and best practices.**
7.  **Consider using an ORM like EF Core's LINQ-to-Entities whenever possible, as it inherently avoids raw SQL and thus this specific vulnerability.**  Reserve `FromSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlRaw` for situations where LINQ-to-Entities is truly insufficient.
8.  **Log and monitor database queries:** Implement robust logging to track all database interactions, including raw SQL queries. This can help detect suspicious activity and aid in incident response.
9. **Educate developers:** Provide regular security training to developers, emphasizing the risks of SQL injection and the importance of secure coding practices.

## 3. Conclusion

SQL injection via raw SQL queries in Entity Framework Core is a critical vulnerability that can have severe consequences.  By understanding the attack vector, adopting parameterized queries, implementing input validation, adhering to the principle of least privilege, and utilizing static analysis tools, developers can effectively mitigate this risk and build secure applications.  The key takeaway is to **never trust user input** and to always treat it as potentially malicious.  Parameterized queries are the cornerstone of preventing SQL injection, and other mitigations serve as valuable layers of defense.
