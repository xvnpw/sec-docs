Okay, let's create a deep analysis of the "Parameterized Queries and Safe SQL Generation" mitigation strategy for an application using Entity Framework Core.

## Deep Analysis: Parameterized Queries and Safe SQL Generation in Entity Framework Core

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of the "Parameterized Queries and Safe SQL Generation" mitigation strategy in preventing SQL injection and related data exposure vulnerabilities within an application utilizing Entity Framework Core.  This includes assessing the completeness of implementation, identifying potential gaps, and recommending improvements to ensure robust protection against these critical threats.  We will focus specifically on how this strategy is applied *within the context of EF Core's API*.

**Scope:**

This analysis will cover all code within the application that interacts with the database using Entity Framework Core.  This includes, but is not limited to:

*   All uses of `FromSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlRaw`.
*   All uses of `FromSqlInterpolated` and `ExecuteSqlInterpolated`.
*   Any code that constructs SQL queries dynamically, even if using LINQ.
*   Data access layer components (repositories, services, etc.) that utilize EF Core.
*   Relevant code review processes and static analysis tool configurations (if applicable).
*   Legacy code sections that may not yet be fully compliant with the mitigation strategy.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review:** Manual inspection of the codebase to identify all instances of raw SQL usage, string interpolation, and dynamic query construction within the context of EF Core.  This will be the primary method.
2.  **Static Analysis (if available):**  Leveraging static analysis tools to automatically detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities and violations of coding standards related to parameterization.  This will supplement the code review.
3.  **Dynamic Analysis (if feasible):**  Potentially performing penetration testing or fuzzing to attempt to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities.  This is a lower priority but can provide valuable real-world validation.
4.  **Documentation Review:** Examining existing documentation, coding guidelines, and code review checklists to assess the consistency and clarity of the mitigation strategy's implementation.
5.  **Interviews (if necessary):**  Discussing the implementation with developers to clarify any ambiguities or gather additional context.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Mitigation Strategy

**2.1. Identify all Raw SQL (`FromSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlRaw`):**

*   **Action:**  Perform a global search in the codebase for `FromSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlRaw`.  Document each instance, including the file name, line number, and the surrounding code context.  Create a table to track these instances.
