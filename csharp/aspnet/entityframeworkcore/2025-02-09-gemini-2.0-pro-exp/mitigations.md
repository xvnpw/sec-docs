# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for aspnet/entityframeworkcore

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Queries and Safe SQL Generation](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_queries_and_safe_sql_generation.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Identify all Raw SQL:**  Search the codebase for all instances of `FromSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlRaw`.  These are the primary areas of concern within EF Core.
2.  **Replace with Interpolated Versions:**  Replace `FromSqlRaw` with `FromSqlInterpolated` and `ExecuteSqlRaw` with `ExecuteSqlInterpolated` wherever possible.  This allows using string interpolation in a safe, parameterized manner *within EF Core's API*.
3.  **Use SqlParameter Objects (If Interpolation Isn't Feasible):** If string interpolation is not suitable (e.g., complex dynamic queries), use `SqlParameter` objects to explicitly define parameters.  Pass these parameters to `FromSqlRaw` or `ExecuteSqlRaw` *using EF Core's methods*.
4.  **Review LINQ Queries:** Examine LINQ queries for any manual string concatenation or building of query strings.  Refactor these to use standard LINQ operators, letting EF Core's LINQ provider handle the SQL generation.
5.  **Code Reviews:**  Mandate code reviews that specifically check for proper parameterization and safe SQL generation practices *within the context of EF Core usage*.
6. **Automated Scanning (Optional):** Consider using static analysis tools that can detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities, including those related to EF Core.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** (Severity: **Critical**)  Directly injecting malicious SQL code into the database *through EF Core's methods*.
    *   **Data Exposure:** (Severity: **High**)  Revealing sensitive data through error messages or unintended query results due to manipulated SQL *executed via EF Core*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Risk reduction: **Very High**.  Parameterized queries *using EF Core's mechanisms* are the primary defense.
    *   **Data Exposure:** Risk reduction: **High**.  Preventing SQL injection through EF Core prevents associated data exposure.

*   **Currently Implemented:**  [ *Placeholder:  e.g., "Implemented in all API controllers.  Verified through code reviews that `FromSqlInterpolated` is used consistently."* ]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Not yet implemented in the legacy reporting module (`ReportingService.cs`).  Needs refactoring to use `FromSqlInterpolated`."* ]

## Mitigation Strategy: [View Models / DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)](./mitigation_strategies/view_models__dtos__data_transfer_objects_.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Identify Entity Exposure:**  Locate all instances where EF Core *entities* are directly used in views (for MVC/Razor Pages) or returned from API controllers. This is about preventing direct interaction with the *objects managed by EF Core*.
2.  **Create View Models/DTOs:**  For each exposed *EF Core entity*, create a corresponding View Model or DTO.  These classes should contain *only* the properties needed, and *not* expose the full entity managed by the context.
3.  **Mapping:** Implement mapping logic between *EF Core entities* and View Models/DTOs.
4.  **Update Controllers/Views:** Modify controllers and views to use the View Models/DTOs instead of the *EF Core entities*. This prevents direct binding to tracked objects.
5. **Input Validation:** Ensure View Models/DTOs have appropriate data annotations or validation logic.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Over-Posting / Mass Assignment:** (Severity: **High**)  Attackers modifying properties they shouldn't have access to by submitting data that binds directly to *EF Core's tracked entities*.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** (Severity: **Medium**)  Unintentionally exposing sensitive data from *EF Core entities* in views or API responses.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Over-Posting / Mass Assignment:** Risk reduction: **Very High**. Prevents direct modification of *EF Core-managed objects*.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduction: **High**. Limits exposure of *entity* properties.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Implemented for all new API endpoints."* ]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Legacy MVC views still use entities directly."* ]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Error Handling (EF Core Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_error_handling__ef_core_configuration_.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Disable Detailed Errors in Production (EF Core Setting):**  In your production configuration, ensure that `EnableSensitiveDataLogging` is set to `false` for your `DbContext` options *within the EF Core configuration*. This is a direct setting within EF Core.
    ```csharp
    // In Startup.cs or Program.cs
    services.AddDbContext<MyDbContext>(options =>
    {
        options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("MyConnectionString"));
        #if !DEBUG
            options.EnableSensitiveDataLogging(false); // Disable in production - EF Core specific setting
        #endif
    });
    ```
2.  **Global Exception Handler:** Implement a global exception handler.
3.  **Catch Specific EF Core Exceptions:** Within the handler, catch EF Core exceptions like `DbUpdateException`.
4.  **Log Details Securely:** Log the full exception details (securely).
5.  **User-Friendly Error Messages:**  Return generic error messages to the client.
6.  **Correlation IDs:** Include a correlation ID.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure in Error Messages (EF Core-Generated):** (Severity: **High**)  Revealing database schema details, SQL queries, or other sensitive information *generated by EF Core* in error messages.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** (Severity: **Medium**) Providing attackers with clues through *EF Core's error output*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure in Error Messages (EF Core-Generated):** Risk reduction: **Very High**. The `EnableSensitiveDataLogging(false)` setting directly controls this.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduction: **High**.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [ *Placeholder: e.g., "`EnableSensitiveDataLogging` is set to `false` in `appsettings.Production.json`."* ]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Need to review all `catch` blocks to ensure they are not exposing sensitive information."* ]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Optimized Queries and Pagination (LINQ and EF Core Methods)](./mitigation_strategies/optimized_queries_and_pagination__linq_and_ef_core_methods_.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Identify Potential N+1 Problems (Using EF Core Profiling):** Use EF Core's built-in logging or profiling tools to identify inefficient queries.
2.  **Use Eager Loading (EF Core Methods):**  Use `.Include()` and `.ThenInclude()` *within your EF Core LINQ queries* to eagerly load related data.
3.  **Projection (EF Core LINQ):**  Use `.Select()` *in your LINQ queries* to project only the necessary columns.
4.  **Avoid Client-Side Evaluation (LINQ Best Practices):**  Ensure that your LINQ queries can be fully translated to SQL by EF Core.  Avoid premature use of `AsEnumerable()` or `ToList()`.
5.  **Pagination (EF Core Methods):**  Use `Skip()` and `Take()` *within your EF Core queries* to implement pagination.
6.  **Query Timeouts (EF Core Configuration):** Configure database query timeouts on the `DbContext` options *using EF Core's configuration API*.
7.  **Code Reviews:** Include query performance and efficiency (specifically within LINQ to Entities) as part of code reviews.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Inefficient Queries:** (Severity: **Medium**)  Attackers crafting requests that trigger slow queries *handled by EF Core*.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** (Severity: **Low to Medium**)  Slow queries *generated by EF Core* impacting responsiveness.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Inefficient Queries:** Risk reduction: **Medium to High**. Optimized *EF Core queries* and pagination reduce the risk.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Risk reduction: **High**. Optimized *LINQ to Entities queries* improve performance.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Pagination implemented using `Skip()` and `Take()`."* ]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Need to profile and optimize queries. Suspect N+1 problem."* ]

## Mitigation Strategy: [AsNoTracking() for Read-Only Operations (EF Core Method)](./mitigation_strategies/asnotracking___for_read-only_operations__ef_core_method_.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Identify Read-Only Queries:** Locate all queries where data is retrieved but *not* modified.
2.  **Apply AsNoTracking() (EF Core Method):** Add `.AsNoTracking()` *to these EF Core queries*. This is a direct method call on the `DbSet` or `IQueryable`.
    ```csharp
    var users = context.Users.AsNoTracking().Where(u => u.IsActive).ToList(); // EF Core method
    ```
3.  **Code Reviews:** Enforce the use of `AsNoTracking()` during code reviews.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Memory Exhaustion:** (Severity: **Low**) Excessive memory usage due to *EF Core tracking* unnecessary entities.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** (Severity: **Low**) Unnecessary *EF Core tracking* overhead.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Memory Exhaustion:** Risk reduction: **Low**. `AsNoTracking()` reduces *EF Core's memory footprint*.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Risk reduction: **Low to Medium**. `AsNoTracking()` improves performance by avoiding *EF Core's change tracking*.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Implemented in most read-only API endpoints."* ]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Need to review and update queries to use `AsNoTracking()`."* ]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Second-Level Caching (If Using EF Core-Compatible Provider)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_second-level_caching__if_using_ef_core-compatible_provider_.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Assess Necessity:** Determine if second-level caching is truly required.
2.  **Choose Secure Provider:** If using it, select a reputable caching provider *that integrates with EF Core* and has built-in security features.
3.  **Data Validation:** Implement mechanisms to validate the integrity of cached data (this might involve interaction with the EF Core caching provider).
4.  **Short Expiration:** Use short cache expiration times.
5.  **Cache Invalidation:** Implement robust cache invalidation strategies *integrated with EF Core's change tracking* (if supported by the provider).
6.  **Configuration Review:** Regularly review the caching provider's configuration (as it relates to EF Core integration).
7.  **Monitoring:** Monitor cache access.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cache Poisoning:** (Severity: **Medium to High**) Attackers manipulating data *cached by EF Core's second-level cache*.
    *   **Data Tampering:** (Severity: **Medium**) Unauthorized modification of data *in EF Core's cache*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cache Poisoning:** Risk reduction: **High** (if properly secured and integrated with EF Core).
    *   **Data Tampering:** Risk reduction: **Medium to High** (if properly secured).

*   **Currently Implemented:** [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Second-level caching is not currently used."* OR *e.g., "Using a distributed cache provider with EF Core integration."* ]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [ *Placeholder: e.g., "Need to implement data validation for cached entities."* ]
