## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: "Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities"

### 4.1. Raw SQL (HIGH-RISK)

*   **Description:**  This is the most direct path to SQL injection in EF Core.  Developers bypass the ORM's protective mechanisms by directly executing raw SQL commands using `FromSqlRaw` or `ExecuteSqlRaw` without proper parameterization.

*   **Detailed Breakdown:**

    *   **`FromSqlRaw`:** Used for querying data.  If user input is directly concatenated into the SQL string, it's vulnerable.
    *   **`ExecuteSqlRaw`:** Used for executing non-query commands (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).  Similar vulnerability if user input is unsafely incorporated.

*   **Likelihood:** High.  Developers might resort to raw SQL for:
    *   **Perceived Performance:**  A misconception that raw SQL is always faster than LINQ.
    *   **Complex Queries:**  Difficulty expressing complex logic or using database-specific features with LINQ.
    *   **Legacy Code:**  Integrating with existing SQL-based code.
    *   **Lack of Awareness:**  Unfamiliarity with EF Core's parameterized query options.

*   **Impact:** Very High.  Successful exploitation can lead to:
    *   **Data Breach:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    *   **Data Modification:**  Alteration or deletion of data.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:**  Stealing data from the database.
    *   **Denial of Service:**  Disrupting database availability.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:**  Gaining higher-level database or system access.
    *   **Complete System Compromise:**  In some cases, attackers can leverage SQL injection to execute operating system commands.

*   **Effort:** Low.  Basic SQL injection techniques are widely documented and readily available.  Tools like `sqlmap` can automate the exploitation process.

*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.  Basic attacks require minimal SQL knowledge.  Advanced exploitation (e.g., blind SQL injection, second-order SQL injection) requires more expertise.

*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.  Vulnerabilities can be identified through:
    *   **Code Review:**  Manually inspecting code for instances of `FromSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlRaw` and checking for proper parameterization.
    *   **Static Analysis:**  Using tools that automatically scan code for potential SQL injection patterns.
    *   **Dynamic Analysis:**  Testing the application with malicious input to observe its behavior.
    *   **Database Monitoring:**  Tracking SQL queries executed against the database for suspicious patterns.  However, sophisticated attackers can obfuscate their attacks.

*   **Example (Vulnerable Code):**

    ```csharp
    // Vulnerable code: User input directly concatenated into the SQL string
    public List<Product> GetProductsByName(string productName)
    {
        using var context = new MyDbContext();
        string query = "SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name = '" + productName + "'";
        return context.Products.FromSqlRaw(query).ToList();
    }
    ```
    **Explanation:** If `productName` is set to something like `' OR 1=1 --`, the resulting query would be `SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name = '' OR 1=1 --'`, which would return all products, bypassing the intended filter.

*   **Example (Secure Code):**

    ```csharp
    // Secure code: Using FromSqlInterpolated for parameterized query
    public List<Product> GetProductsByName(string productName)
    {
        using var context = new MyDbContext();
        return context.Products.FromSqlInterpolated($"SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name = {productName}").ToList();
    }
    ```
    **Explanation:** `FromSqlInterpolated` uses string interpolation, but EF Core treats the interpolated values as parameters, preventing SQL injection.  The generated SQL will use a parameter (e.g., `@p0`) instead of directly embedding the value.

    ```csharp
    // Secure code: Using LINQ
    public List<Product> GetProductsByName(string productName)
    {
        using var context = new MyDbContext();
        return context.Products.Where(p => p.Name == productName).ToList();
    }
    ```
     **Explanation:** Using LINQ is the safest way.

### 4.2. Dynamic LINQ (HIGH-RISK)

*   **Description:**  This involves constructing LINQ queries dynamically based on user input.  While LINQ itself is generally safe, improper handling of user input when building the query can lead to injection.

*   **Detailed Breakdown:**
    *   **Dynamic Query Construction:**  Often used for features like advanced search forms, filtering, and sorting, where the query structure changes based on user selections.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  If user input is used to directly construct parts of the LINQ expression (e.g., property names, filter conditions), it can be manipulated to inject malicious code.

*   **Likelihood:** High.  Dynamic LINQ is a common pattern for building flexible and user-driven applications.

*   **Impact:** Very High.  Similar to raw SQL injection, successful exploitation can lead to complete database compromise.

*   **Effort:** Low to Medium.  Requires understanding of how LINQ translates to SQL and how to manipulate the expression tree.  However, readily available tools and techniques can simplify the attack.

*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.  Requires a good understanding of LINQ, expression trees, and SQL injection principles.

*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard.  More challenging to detect than raw SQL injection because the malicious code is often embedded within seemingly legitimate LINQ expressions.  Static analysis tools may have difficulty identifying all potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Example (Vulnerable Code):**

    ```csharp
    // Vulnerable code: User input used to construct the property name
    public List<Product> GetProductsByProperty(string propertyName, string value)
    {
        using var context = new MyDbContext();
        var parameter = Expression.Parameter(typeof(Product), "p");
        var property = Expression.Property(parameter, propertyName); // Vulnerable!
        var constant = Expression.Constant(value);
        var body = Expression.Equal(property, constant);
        var lambda = Expression.Lambda<Func<Product, bool>>(body, parameter);

        return context.Products.Where(lambda).ToList();
    }
    ```
    **Explanation:** If `propertyName` is manipulated (e.g., set to `Name); DROP TABLE Products; --`), it could lead to disastrous consequences.  EF Core might not be able to fully protect against this because it's receiving a dynamically constructed expression.

*   **Example (Secure Code):**

    ```csharp
    // Secure code: Using a switch statement or a whitelist to validate the property name
    public List<Product> GetProductsByProperty(string propertyName, string value)
    {
        using var context = new MyDbContext();

        return propertyName switch
        {
            "Name" => context.Products.Where(p => p.Name == value).ToList(),
            "Price" => context.Products.Where(p => p.Price == decimal.Parse(value)).ToList(),
            "Category" => context.Products.Where(p => p.Category == value).ToList(),
            _ => throw new ArgumentException("Invalid property name")
        };
    }
    ```
    **Explanation:** This approach uses a `switch` statement to explicitly handle valid property names.  Any invalid property name will result in an exception, preventing the dynamic construction of a potentially malicious expression.  A whitelist approach would similarly restrict the allowed property names.  Input validation (e.g., ensuring `value` is a valid decimal for the "Price" case) is also crucial.

    Another secure approach is to use a well-vetted Dynamic LINQ library like `System.Linq.Dynamic.Core`.  These libraries provide safe ways to construct dynamic queries from strings, but *still require careful validation of user input*.

## 5. Mitigation Summary (Reinforced)

*   **Parameterized Queries are Paramount:**  Always use `FromSqlInterpolated` or standard LINQ expressions with parameters.  Avoid `FromSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlRaw` unless absolutely necessary, and even then, use extreme caution and parameterization.
*   **Input Validation is Essential:**  Implement strict input validation and sanitization for *all* user-provided data, regardless of whether it's directly used in a query.  This includes:
    *   **Type Checking:**  Ensure data is of the expected type (e.g., integer, string, date).
    *   **Length Restrictions:**  Limit the length of input strings.
    *   **Whitelist Validation:**  Restrict input to a predefined set of allowed values (especially for things like property names or sort orders).
    *   **Encoding:**  Consider output encoding to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities that might arise from displaying data retrieved from the database.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  The database user account used by the application should have the minimum necessary permissions.  It should *not* have permissions to create or drop tables, modify database schema, or execute operating system commands.
*   **Regular Code Reviews:**  Conduct thorough code reviews, focusing on database interactions and the use of EF Core.
*   **Static Analysis Tools:**  Integrate static analysis tools into the development pipeline to automatically detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. Examples include:
    *   .NET Analyzers (Roslyn-based)
    *   SonarQube
    *   Veracode
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Penetration Testing):**  Perform regular penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by static analysis.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Use a WAF to filter out malicious requests that attempt to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Database Activity Monitoring (DAM):**  Implement DAM to monitor database activity and detect suspicious queries.
*   **Safe Dynamic LINQ Libraries:** If dynamic LINQ is required, use a well-vetted and actively maintained library like `System.Linq.Dynamic.Core`.  *Never* build dynamic LINQ expressions directly from raw user input.
* **Education and Training:** Ensure that all developers are aware of SQL injection vulnerabilities and best practices for secure coding with EF Core.

## 6. Conclusion

SQL injection remains a significant threat, even with the use of ORMs like EF Core.  While EF Core provides strong protections, developers can inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities by bypassing these safeguards or misusing dynamic query construction.  By adhering to the principles of parameterized queries, strict input validation, least privilege, and regular security testing, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection and build more secure applications.  Continuous vigilance and a proactive security mindset are crucial for protecting sensitive data and maintaining application integrity.
