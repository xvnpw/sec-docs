# Threat Model Analysis for gui-cs/terminal.gui

## Threat: [Malicious Input Injection via Text Fields and Input Controls](./threats/malicious_input_injection_via_text_fields_and_input_controls.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker enters specially crafted strings containing terminal escape sequences or control characters into `terminal.gui` input controls (like `TextField`, `TextView`, etc.). `terminal.gui` processes this input, and the terminal emulator interprets these sequences. The attacker aims to manipulate the terminal's behavior, potentially clearing the screen, changing colors, moving the cursor in unexpected ways, or, critically, attempting to execute commands if the application naively passes this input to shell commands.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **High:** Terminal manipulation leading to confusion, denial of service (e.g., repeatedly clearing the screen), or misleading the user.
        *   **Critical:** Command injection, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system with the application's privileges if the input is mishandled and passed to a shell.
    *   **Affected Component:** `terminal.gui.View` (base class for UI elements), specifically input handling within classes like `TextField`, `TextView`, `Entry`. The event handling system that processes key presses and input within `terminal.gui`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (potential for command injection), High (terminal manipulation).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization within the application logic *after* receiving input from `terminal.gui` controls. Remove or escape potentially harmful terminal escape sequences and control characters before further processing or displaying.
        *   **Avoid Direct Shell Execution with User Input:**  Never directly pass unsanitized input received from `terminal.gui` to shell commands. Use parameterized commands or safe APIs to prevent command injection.

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Input Handling](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_input_handling.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides an excessively long string as input to a `terminal.gui` input control, exceeding the allocated buffer size within `terminal.gui`'s internal handling mechanisms. This could potentially overwrite adjacent memory locations within the application's process.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Critical:** Potential for memory corruption that could be exploited for arbitrary code execution, allowing the attacker to gain complete control of the application and potentially the system.
        *   **High:** Application crash leading to denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Internal input handling mechanisms within `terminal.gui`, potentially low-level buffer management if not entirely handled by the .NET framework's string classes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (potential for code execution), High (application crash).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rely on Framework Safety:** Trust the .NET framework's built-in string handling and memory management, which significantly reduces the likelihood of buffer overflows in managed code.
        *   **Monitor for `terminal.gui` Vulnerabilities:** Stay updated with `terminal.gui` releases and security advisories, as any buffer overflow vulnerabilities within the library itself would need to be patched by the developers.
        *   **Fuzzing `terminal.gui` Usage:** Developers using `terminal.gui` can employ fuzzing techniques specifically targeting the input handling of `terminal.gui` components to identify potential buffer overflow issues.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Focus and Input Events](./threats/manipulation_of_focus_and_input_events.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker finds ways to programmatically or through unexpected interactions manipulate the focus of input elements or trigger input events in an unintended order *within the `terminal.gui` framework*. This could potentially bypass intended application logic that relies on a specific sequence of user interactions within the terminal UI.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **High:** Circumvention of application logic, potentially leading to unauthorized actions being performed or security checks being bypassed.
    *   **Affected Component:** `terminal.gui.View`'s focus management system, event handling mechanisms (e.g., `KeyPress`, `MouseClick`) within `terminal.gui`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potential for bypassing security controls).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Robust State Management:** Design the application's state management so that it's resilient to unexpected event sequences. Avoid relying solely on the order of input events for critical security decisions within the `terminal.gui` UI flow.
        *   **Input Validation on Action:** Validate the application's state and user permissions before performing any sensitive actions, regardless of how the action was triggered within the `terminal.gui` interface.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion via Rendering](./threats/denial_of_service_through_resource_exhaustion_via_rendering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker interacts with the application in a way that forces `terminal.gui`'s rendering engine to process an extremely large or complex UI, potentially consuming excessive CPU or memory resources *within the `terminal.gui` rendering process*. This could be achieved by providing input that leads to the creation of a large number of `terminal.gui` UI elements or by triggering complex rendering operations within the library.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **High:** Application slowdown, unresponsiveness, or complete crash due to resource exhaustion within the `terminal.gui` rendering process, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **Affected Component:** `terminal.gui.View`'s rendering pipeline, layout management within `terminal.gui`, and potentially specific `terminal.gui` UI elements that are resource-intensive to render (e.g., very large `TextView` with complex content).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Limits on `terminal.gui` UI Complexity:** Set reasonable limits on the number of `terminal.gui` UI elements that can be created or rendered at once based on user input or data.
        *   **Efficient `terminal.gui` Rendering Practices:** Utilize `terminal.gui`'s features for efficient rendering and avoid unnecessary redraws of `terminal.gui` components.

## Threat: [Terminal Escape Sequence Injection via Displayed Data](./threats/terminal_escape_sequence_injection_via_displayed_data.md)

*   **Description:** If the application displays data retrieved from external sources (e.g., files, databases, network) without proper sanitization, this data could contain malicious terminal escape sequences. When `terminal.gui` renders this data using components like `Label` or `TextView`, the escape sequences will be interpreted by the terminal emulator, potentially manipulating the user's terminal display in unexpected or misleading ways.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **High:** Terminal manipulation, potentially leading to the user being tricked into performing actions they wouldn't otherwise do (e.g., misrepresenting information, hiding parts of the screen, creating fake prompts).
    *   **Affected Component:** `terminal.gui.Label`, `TextView`, and any other `terminal.gui` components used to display data retrieved from external sources. The `terminal.gui` rendering pipeline that processes the text content.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Output Sanitization Before `terminal.gui` Rendering:** Sanitize all data *before* passing it to `terminal.gui` for display, especially data from untrusted sources. Remove or escape potentially harmful terminal escape sequences.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `terminal.gui` Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__terminal_gui__library_itself.md)

*   **Description:** The `terminal.gui` library itself might contain undiscovered vulnerabilities (e.g., code injection flaws within the library, denial-of-service vulnerabilities in its core components, logic errors in its state management). Exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow attackers to compromise the application.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Critical:** Remote code execution if a vulnerability allows arbitrary code to be injected and executed within the application's process via `terminal.gui`.
        *   **High:** Denial of service by exploiting vulnerabilities that crash the application or consume excessive resources within `terminal.gui`. Information disclosure if vulnerabilities allow access to sensitive data managed by `terminal.gui`.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any part of the `terminal.gui` library code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Stay Updated with `terminal.gui` Releases:** Keep `terminal.gui` updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes released by the library maintainers.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to `terminal.gui` to be aware of any reported security issues.
        *   **Contribute to Security Audits:** If possible, contribute to or support security audits of the `terminal.gui` library to help identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
