# Attack Surface Analysis for gui-cs/terminal.gui

## Attack Surface: [Unsanitized Input Leading to Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/unsanitized_input_leading_to_command_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the system by providing malicious input that is not properly sanitized before being used in system calls or shell commands.

**How terminal.gui Contributes:** If an application uses `terminal.gui`'s input elements (like `TextField` or prompts) to gather user input and then uses this input to construct system commands without proper sanitization, it becomes vulnerable due to the library providing the initial input vector.

**Example:** An application uses a `TextField` provided by `terminal.gui` to get a filename from the user and then executes `cat <filename>`. If the user enters `; rm -rf /`, the application might execute this dangerous command due to the unsanitized input from the `terminal.gui` component.

**Impact:** Full system compromise, data loss, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Input Sanitization:** Always sanitize user input obtained through `terminal.gui` components before using it in system commands. Use allow-lists for acceptable characters or patterns.
* **Avoid Direct System Calls:** Whenever possible, use safer alternatives to directly executing shell commands when processing input from `terminal.gui`.
* **Parameterization:** If system calls are unavoidable, use parameterized commands or functions that prevent command injection when dealing with input from `terminal.gui`.

## Attack Surface: [Buffer Overflows in Input Fields](./attack_surfaces/buffer_overflows_in_input_fields.md)

**Description:** Providing excessively long input to a text field or other input component can overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.

**How terminal.gui Contributes:** If `terminal.gui` doesn't enforce strict limits on the size of input accepted by its components (like `TextField`), or if the application doesn't handle potentially oversized input received from `terminal.gui` correctly, buffer overflows can occur within the application's memory space.

**Example:** A `TextField` in an application using `terminal.gui` might not have a sufficient buffer size configured. A user pasting a very long string into this `TextField` could overwrite memory allocated for other parts of the application.

**Impact:** Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Input Length Validation:** Always validate the length of user input received from `terminal.gui` components before processing it. Set maximum lengths for input fields in `terminal.gui`.
* **Use Safe String Handling Functions:** Employ functions that prevent buffer overflows when copying or manipulating strings obtained from `terminal.gui` input.
* **Regularly Update `terminal.gui`:** Ensure you are using the latest version of the library, as vulnerabilities related to buffer handling are often patched.
