# Attack Surface Analysis for gui-cs/terminal.gui

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated Keyboard Input leading to Command Injection (Indirect)](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_keyboard_input_leading_to_command_injection__indirect_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious commands by providing crafted keyboard input through `terminal.gui` UI elements. If the application using `terminal.gui` fails to validate this input *after* it's received from `terminal.gui` components, it can lead to the execution of unintended system commands. `terminal.gui` provides the input mechanism, but the vulnerability lies in the application's handling of this input.
*   **How terminal.gui contributes:** `terminal.gui` provides UI elements like `TextField` and `CommandLine` that are designed to capture user keyboard input and make it readily available to the application for processing. This input becomes a potential source of malicious commands if not handled securely by the application.
*   **Example:** An application uses a `terminal.gui` `TextField` to get a user-provided path. This path is then directly used in `System.Diagnostics.Process.Start()` to execute a command. An attacker could input a path like `"; rm -rf /"`. If the application doesn't sanitize the input from the `TextField` before passing it to `Process.Start()`, it could execute the `rm -rf /` command.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data loss, unauthorized access, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation (Application-Side):**  The application *must* implement rigorous input validation on all keyboard input obtained from `terminal.gui` components *before* using it in any system commands or sensitive operations. This validation should occur *after* `terminal.gui` has processed the input.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Command Construction:**  Minimize or eliminate the need to dynamically construct system commands based on user input from `terminal.gui`. Prefer using APIs or libraries that avoid direct command execution where possible.
    *   **Parameterization (Application-Side):** If system commands are necessary, use parameterized command execution methods to separate commands from data, preventing injection. Ensure the application correctly utilizes parameterization with input from `terminal.gui`.

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Event Handlers leading to Logic Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_event_handlers_leading_to_logic_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities can be introduced within the application's event handlers that are attached to `terminal.gui` UI elements. If these handlers, which are application code responding to `terminal.gui` events, are not implemented securely, they can become points of exploitation. While not a flaw in `terminal.gui` itself, the library's event-driven nature makes secure handler implementation crucial.
*   **How terminal.gui contributes:** `terminal.gui`'s architecture is heavily event-driven. Applications using `terminal.gui` *must* define event handlers to react to user interactions with UI elements.  Insecurely written handlers, triggered by user actions within `terminal.gui`, can introduce vulnerabilities into the application's logic.
*   **Example:** A `Button` in a `terminal.gui` application has a `Clicked` event handler. This handler retrieves text from a `TextField` (also in `terminal.gui`) and uses it to make a database query *without sanitization*.  A SQL injection vulnerability could be introduced in this event handler, triggered by a user clicking the button after entering malicious SQL in the `TextField`.
*   **Impact:**  Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access, denial of service, depending on the vulnerability introduced in the event handler.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the handler and the sensitivity of the affected application logic).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Event Handler Development (Application-Side):** Developers must follow secure coding practices when writing event handlers for `terminal.gui` elements. This includes input validation, output sanitization, proper error handling, and avoiding hardcoding sensitive information within handlers.
    *   **Code Reviews for Event Handlers:**  Specifically focus code reviews on event handlers attached to `terminal.gui` elements, as these are direct interaction points with user input and application logic.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Handler Context - Application-Side):** Ensure event handlers operate with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid granting excessive permissions to the code executed within `terminal.gui` event handlers.
    *   **Security Testing of Event Flows:**  Perform security testing that specifically targets the event flows within the `terminal.gui` application, focusing on how user interactions with UI elements trigger event handlers and application logic.
