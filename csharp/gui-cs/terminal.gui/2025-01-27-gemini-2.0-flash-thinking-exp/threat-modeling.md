# Threat Model Analysis for gui-cs/terminal.gui

## Threat: [Command Injection via User Input](./threats/command_injection_via_user_input.md)

Description: An attacker could inject malicious shell commands by providing crafted input through `terminal.gui` UI elements (like `TextField`, `TextView`, `ComboBox`) if the application uses this input to construct and execute system commands. For example, if user input from a `TextField` is directly used in `System.Diagnostics.Process.Start`, an attacker could input commands like `; rm -rf /` to execute arbitrary commands. `terminal.gui` facilitates the input, making this threat relevant in its context.
Impact: Critical. Full system compromise, data breaches, denial of service, and unauthorized access to resources on the machine running the application.
Affected terminal.gui component: Input handling components (`TextField`, `TextView`, `ComboBox`, `Dialog` input, etc.) in conjunction with application logic that processes user input.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Input Validation and Sanitization:  Strictly validate and sanitize all user input received from `terminal.gui` components before using it in any system commands or potentially dangerous operations. Use whitelisting and escape special characters.
    * Parameterized Commands:  Avoid constructing system commands by directly concatenating user input. Use parameterized commands or safer APIs that prevent command injection.
    * Least Privilege: Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of successful command injection.
    * Code Review: Regularly review code that handles user input and system command execution to identify and fix potential injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Unintentional Display of Sensitive Data in Terminal UI](./threats/unintentional_display_of_sensitive_data_in_terminal_ui.md)

Description:  Due to programming errors or oversight, sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys, internal system details, database connection strings) could be inadvertently displayed in the terminal UI through `terminal.gui` components (`Label`, `TextView`, `MessageBox`, etc.). This could happen if developers accidentally log sensitive data to the UI or display it for debugging purposes and forget to remove it in production. `terminal.gui` is the display mechanism, making it directly involved in this information disclosure threat.
Impact: High. Exposure of sensitive data to users who have access to the terminal output, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, and privilege escalation.
Affected terminal.gui component: All components that display text (`Label`, `TextView`, `MessageBox`, `Dialog` messages, etc.) when used to display sensitive data unintentionally.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Secure Coding Practices:  Carefully review application code to ensure sensitive data is never displayed in the UI unless explicitly intended and properly secured. Avoid hardcoding sensitive data in the application.
    * Data Handling Review:  Implement processes to review data handling and display logic to prevent accidental information leaks.
    * Masking/Redaction:  Use masking or redaction techniques for sensitive data displayed in the UI if absolutely necessary. For example, display asterisks instead of passwords.
    * Principle of Least Privilege (UI Display): Only display necessary information in the UI and avoid showing internal details or sensitive data unless required for the user's role and task.

## Threat: [Logging of Sensitive Terminal UI Interactions](./threats/logging_of_sensitive_terminal_ui_interactions.md)

Description: If the application logs terminal UI interactions (e.g., user input, displayed output, menu selections) for debugging, auditing, or other purposes, and these logs are not properly secured, sensitive information contained within these interactions could be exposed if the logs are compromised. For example, user passwords entered in a `TextField` might be logged if logging is not carefully configured. While logging is an application concern, `terminal.gui` components are the source of the logged interactions, making it relevant.
Impact: High. Exposure of sensitive data stored in application logs, potentially leading to data breaches and unauthorized access if logs are compromised.
Affected terminal.gui component: Logging mechanisms within the application that capture UI interactions, indirectly related to all `terminal.gui` components involved in user interaction.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Minimize Logging of Sensitive Data: Avoid logging sensitive information from terminal UI interactions if possible. Log only necessary information for debugging or auditing.
    * Secure Logging Practices: If logging is necessary, implement secure logging practices, including encryption of log files, access control to log files (restrict access to authorized personnel only), and secure storage for log files.
    * Log Rotation and Retention: Implement log rotation and retention policies to limit the lifespan of logs and reduce the window of opportunity for attackers to access them.
    * Data Minimization (Logging): Log only the minimum necessary data and avoid logging sensitive information like passwords or API keys in plain text.
