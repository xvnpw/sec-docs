# Attack Surface Analysis for gui-cs/terminal.gui

## Attack Surface: [Terminal Escape Sequence Injection](./attack_surfaces/terminal_escape_sequence_injection.md)

* **Attack Surface: Terminal Escape Sequence Injection**
    * **Description:** Malicious actors inject specially crafted terminal escape sequences into the application through user input or other data streams processed by `terminal.gui`.
    * **How terminal.gui Contributes:** `terminal.gui` renders text, including potentially harmful escape sequences, directly to the terminal. It might not inherently sanitize or escape these sequences.
    * **Example:** A user enters text like `\x1b[2J` (escape sequence to clear the screen) into an input field, causing the application to unexpectedly clear the terminal. More sophisticated sequences could attempt to manipulate the cursor, change colors, or even attempt to exploit terminal vulnerabilities.
    * **Impact:** Terminal disruption, potential for information masking or manipulation within the terminal, and in some cases, could be a stepping stone for further attacks if the application interacts with external systems based on terminal state.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:** Implement robust input sanitization to remove or escape potentially dangerous terminal escape sequences before passing data to `terminal.gui` for rendering.
        * **Developer:** Consider using libraries or functions that provide safe rendering of text, automatically handling or stripping potentially harmful escape sequences.
        * **User:** Be cautious about copying and pasting text from untrusted sources into the application.

## Attack Surface: [Unhandled Input Combinations/Sequences](./attack_surfaces/unhandled_input_combinationssequences.md)

* **Attack Surface: Unhandled Input Combinations/Sequences**
    * **Description:** Specific or unusual combinations of keyboard or mouse inputs, potentially including control characters or special sequences, can trigger unexpected behavior, crashes, or denial-of-service within `terminal.gui`'s event handling or rendering logic.
    * **How terminal.gui Contributes:** `terminal.gui` handles a wide range of terminal input events. If certain combinations are not properly handled or validated, they could lead to errors.
    * **Example:**  Pressing a specific sequence of control keys while interacting with a particular UI element might cause the application to freeze or crash due to an unhandled exception within `terminal.gui`.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, application instability, potential for unexpected state changes.
    * **Risk Severity:** Medium  **(Note: While previously 'Medium', the potential for crashes makes this borderline High. Consider this a High risk depending on the specific impact)**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:** Implement comprehensive input validation and error handling within the application's event handlers that interact with `terminal.gui`.
        * **Developer:** Conduct thorough testing with various input combinations, including edge cases and potentially malicious sequences.
        * **Developer:** Consider using `terminal.gui`'s features for input filtering or masking if appropriate.
