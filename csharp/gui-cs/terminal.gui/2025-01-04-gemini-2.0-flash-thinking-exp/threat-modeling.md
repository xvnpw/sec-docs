# Threat Model Analysis for gui-cs/terminal.gui

## Threat: [Malicious Terminal Escape Sequence Injection](./threats/malicious_terminal_escape_sequence_injection.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Terminal Escape Sequence Injection

* **Description:** An attacker crafts input containing special terminal escape sequences (e.g., ANSI escape codes) and injects it into the application through input fields or other data entry points. The `terminal.gui` library, if not properly sanitizing these sequences, passes them directly to the terminal. This allows the attacker to manipulate the terminal's behavior.
* **Impact:**
    * Arbitrary command execution: By injecting escape sequences that manipulate the terminal to execute commands when specific characters are printed.
    * Terminal disruption: Clearing the screen, changing the terminal title, altering text colors permanently, or even causing the terminal to become unresponsive.
    * Information spoofing: Displaying misleading information or fake prompts to trick the user.
* **Affected Component:**
    * `TextView` and `TextEntry` components when displaying user input.
    * Potentially the underlying terminal driver interaction within `terminal.gui`.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Input sanitization:** Implement strict input sanitization to remove or escape potentially dangerous terminal escape sequences before displaying or processing user input.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP) for terminals (if applicable):** Explore if there are terminal-level configurations or libraries that can enforce a stricter policy regarding escape sequences.
    * **Regularly review and update `terminal.gui`:** Ensure you are using a version of the library with known vulnerabilities addressed.

## Threat: [Exploiting Buffer Overflow in `terminal.gui` Rendering Logic](./threats/exploiting_buffer_overflow_in__terminal_gui__rendering_logic.md)

**Threat:** Exploiting Buffer Overflow in `terminal.gui` Rendering Logic

* **Description:** An attacker provides excessively long or specially crafted input that exceeds the buffer size allocated for rendering text or UI elements within `terminal.gui`. This can overwrite adjacent memory locations.
* **Impact:**
    * Application crash: The buffer overflow can lead to memory corruption, causing the application to crash unexpectedly.
    * Potential arbitrary code execution: In severe cases, an attacker might be able to overwrite critical memory regions with malicious code, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the user's system.
* **Affected Component:**
    * Rendering functions within `terminal.gui` responsible for drawing text and UI elements (e.g., within `View`, `Label`, `TextView` rendering logic).
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Memory safety:** Utilize memory-safe programming practices within `terminal.gui` development.
    * **Input validation and size limits:** Implement strict validation and size limits on all user-provided input that is used in rendering operations.
    * **Regular security audits of `terminal.gui`:** Conduct thorough code reviews and security testing to identify and fix potential buffer overflows.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `terminal.gui` Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in__terminal_gui__dependencies.md)

**Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `terminal.gui` Dependencies

* **Description:** `terminal.gui` relies on other libraries. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit them to compromise the application.
* **Impact:**
    * Similar impacts to vulnerabilities within `terminal.gui` itself, including DoS, information disclosure, and potentially arbitrary code execution.
* **Affected Component:**
    * The vulnerable dependency library used by `terminal.gui`.
* **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Dependency management:** Use a dependency management tool to track and update `terminal.gui`'s dependencies.
    * **Regularly audit dependencies:** Check for known vulnerabilities in the dependencies using security scanning tools.
    * **Keep dependencies up-to-date:** Update dependencies to the latest versions that include security patches.
