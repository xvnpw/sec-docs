# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for gui-cs/terminal.gui

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Whitelisting and Length Limits (Direct `terminal.gui` Interaction)](./mitigation_strategies/input_whitelisting_and_length_limits__direct__terminal_gui__interaction_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify `terminal.gui` Input Fields:** Identify all instances of `terminal.gui` input controls like `TextField`, `TextView`, `Dialog`'s input fields, and any custom controls built upon `terminal.gui` that accept user input.
    2.  **Define Allowed Input (Per Field):** For *each* identified input field, determine the precise set of allowed characters and patterns.  Be as restrictive as possible.  Consider data type (numeric, alphanumeric, specific symbols), expected format, and any business logic constraints.
    3.  **Implement Whitelist Validation (Using `terminal.gui` Events):**  Attach event handlers to the relevant `terminal.gui` events:
        *   `KeyPress`:  Use this to intercept *each* key press *before* it's processed by the control.  Check if the pressed key is allowed based on your whitelist.  If not, set `keyEvent.Handled = true;` to prevent the key from being added to the input.
        *   `TextChanged`: Use this to validate the *entire* input after it has changed.  This is useful for more complex validation rules that depend on the entire input string (e.g., checking for a valid email format).  If the input is invalid, you can either:
            *   Revert the text to the previous valid state.
            *   Display an error message and disable any associated actions (e.g., a "Submit" button).
            *   Clear the input field.
        *   Consider using both `KeyPress` (for immediate feedback) and `TextChanged` (for comprehensive validation).
    4.  **Set `MaxLength` Property:**  Utilize the `MaxLength` property (or an equivalent if you've created custom controls) of each `terminal.gui` input field.  Set this to a reasonable maximum length based on the expected input and to prevent excessively long inputs.
    5.  **Provide User Feedback (Within `terminal.gui`):**  If input is rejected (either by `KeyPress` or `TextChanged`), provide immediate and clear feedback to the user *within the `terminal.gui` interface*.  This could involve:
        *   Displaying an error message in a `Label` near the input field.
        *   Changing the background color of the input field to indicate an error.
        *   Using a `MessageBox` to display a more detailed error message.
        *   Disabling the "Submit" button (or equivalent) until the input is valid.
    6. **Example (C#, `KeyPress` and `TextChanged`):**
        ```csharp
        myTextField.KeyPress += (keyEvent) => {
            if (!IsValidChar(keyEvent.KeyEvent.Key)) {
                keyEvent.Handled = true;
                DisplayValidationError("Only alphanumeric characters allowed."); // Show error
            }
        };

        myTextField.TextChanged += () => {
            if (!IsValidInput(myTextField.Text)) {
                // Revert to previous valid text, or clear the field
                myTextField.Text = previousValidText;
                DisplayValidationError("Invalid input format."); // Show error
            } else {
                previousValidText = myTextField.Text; // Store valid text
                ClearValidationError(); // Clear any previous error
            }
        };

        myTextField.MaxLength = 50;

        // ... (Implement IsValidChar, IsValidInput, DisplayValidationError, ClearValidationError)
        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Command Injection:** (Severity: Critical) - Limits characters, reducing the attack surface if input *is* (incorrectly) used in commands.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** (Severity: High) - `MaxLength` prevents excessively large inputs.
    *   **Buffer Overflow:** (Severity: High) - `MaxLength` provides a defense-in-depth layer.
    *   **XSS (Theoretical):** (Severity: Medium) - Limits injection of control characters.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Command Injection:** Reduces risk, but doesn't eliminate it without proper command parameterization.
    *   **DoS/Buffer Overflow:** Substantial protection due to `MaxLength`.
    *   **XSS:** Reduces likelihood.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   [Example: "Implemented for `username` and `password` fields in `LoginDialog` using `KeyPress` and `MaxLength`."]
    *   [Example: "`TextChanged` validation is used for email format in the `RegistrationDialog`."]

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   [Example: "Missing for the 'search query' field (`TextField`) in `MainView`."]
    *   [Example: "No whitelisting on the `TextView` used for multi-line input in `NoteEditor`."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure UI Practices for Sensitive Data (Direct `terminal.gui` Handling)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_ui_practices_for_sensitive_data__direct__terminal_gui__handling_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data Display:**  Locate all `terminal.gui` controls that *display* or *handle* sensitive data (passwords, API keys, tokens, personal information). This includes `TextField`, `TextView`, `Label`, `ListView` (if displaying sensitive columns), and any custom controls.
    2.  **Use `terminal.gui` Password Handling (If Available, Or Create Custom):**
        *   If `terminal.gui` provides a dedicated "password field" control (check the documentation and latest version), use it.  This control should automatically mask input.
        *   If no built-in password field exists, create a *custom* `terminal.gui` control that inherits from `TextField` (or a suitable base class) and overrides the drawing and input handling methods to:
            *   Replace displayed characters with asterisks (`*`) or another masking character.
            *   Store the actual password securely (e.g., in a `SecureString` in C#).
            *   Prevent the password from being copied to the clipboard.
    3.  **Minimize Display (Control-Specific Logic):**  Avoid displaying sensitive data directly in `Label`, `TextView`, or other controls intended for general text display.  If display *is* necessary:
        *   **`Label`:**  Consider a "Show/Hide" button (using a `Button` and toggling the `Text` property of the `Label`).
        *   **`TextView`:**  Avoid displaying sensitive data in `TextView` altogether. If unavoidable, implement a custom drawing routine that only reveals the data when explicitly requested by the user (e.g., via a mouse click or key press) and hides it again immediately after.
        *   **Partial Display:**  If appropriate, display only a *portion* of the sensitive data (e.g., "Last 4 digits: XXXX").
    4.  **Clear Data After Use (Control Lifecycle):**  Ensure sensitive data is cleared from `terminal.gui` controls when it's no longer needed.  This is *critical* and involves:
        *   **`Dispose` Method:**  If you create custom controls, override the `Dispose` method to explicitly clear any internal buffers or variables holding sensitive data.
        *   **`VisibleChanged` Event:**  Use the `VisibleChanged` event of controls to clear their contents when they become hidden (e.g., when switching views).
        *   **Explicit Clearing:**  Before hiding, closing, or disposing of a control that has held sensitive data, explicitly set its `Text` property (or equivalent) to an empty string or a safe default value.  For custom controls, clear any internal data structures.
    5.  **Review Redraws (Custom Drawing):** If you implement custom drawing for controls that handle sensitive data (e.g., to implement masking), be *extremely* careful to ensure that the sensitive data is *never* briefly visible during redraw operations.  Use double buffering or other techniques to prevent flickering or temporary exposure.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** (Severity: High) - Prevents shoulder surfing, screen recording, and unauthorized access to sensitive data displayed in the UI.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Significantly reduces the risk of exposure.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   [Example: "Password fields in `LoginDialog` use a custom control (`PasswordField`) that masks input and clears the buffer on `Dispose`."]
    *   [Example: "API keys are never displayed directly; a 'Copy to Clipboard' button is provided instead."]

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   [Example: "Session tokens are displayed in a `Label` in the debug view; this needs to be removed or hidden behind a toggle."]
    *   [Example: "The `TextView` used for displaying configuration files might contain sensitive data; we need to implement a mechanism to redact or hide this information."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Untrusted Input for Display (Within `terminal.gui` Context)](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_untrusted_input_for_display__within__terminal_gui__context_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Untrusted Input Display:** Identify all `terminal.gui` controls that display data from *untrusted* sources.  This is most likely to involve `TextView`, `Label`, `ListView` (if displaying data from external sources), and potentially custom controls.  Untrusted sources include:
        *   User-provided input (even after validation, it might contain control characters).
        *   Data loaded from external files (especially if the files could be modified by other users or processes).
        *   Data received from network requests (e.g., from a web service).
    2.  **Implement Sanitization (Before Setting `Text`):**  Before setting the `Text` property (or equivalent) of a `terminal.gui` control with untrusted data, *always* sanitize the input.  This sanitization is *specifically* for the `terminal.gui` context:
        *   **Remove Control Characters:** Remove or replace characters that could be interpreted as control characters or escape sequences by the terminal.  This is crucial to prevent unexpected behavior or potential (though unlikely) injection attacks.  Use a robust method; a simple `char.IsControl` check might not be sufficient.
        *   **Context-Aware Encoding:** If you *need* to display characters that have special meaning in the terminal (e.g., you're building a terminal emulator), use appropriate encoding to ensure they are displayed *literally* and not interpreted.  This is a complex task and should ideally be handled by a dedicated library, if available.  *Do not* attempt to write your own encoding/decoding routines unless you have a deep understanding of terminal emulators and escape sequences.
        * **Example (C#, Simplified Sanitization - Before setting `myTextView.Text`):**
            ```csharp
            string sanitizedText = SanitizeForTerminalDisplay(untrustedText);
            myTextView.Text = sanitizedText;

            // ...

            string SanitizeForTerminalDisplay(string input) {
                // 1. Remove/Replace Control Characters (More Robust Example)
                StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
                foreach (char c in input) {
                    if (char.IsControl(c)) {
                        // Replace with a space or a specific replacement character
                        sb.Append(' ');
                    } else {
                        sb.Append(c);
                    }
                }
                string result = sb.ToString();

                // 2. Basic Escape Sequence Removal (VERY SIMPLIFIED - Use a library if possible)
                result = result.Replace("\x1b", ""); // Remove ESC character

                return result;
            }
            ```
    3.  **Prefer "Plain Text" Controls:** When possible, use `terminal.gui` controls that are designed for displaying plain text and are *less likely* to interpret special characters.  If `terminal.gui` offers a control specifically for plain text, use it.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - (Theoretical):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents injection of malicious control sequences.
    *   **Unexpected UI Behavior:** (Severity: Low) - Prevents formatting issues and unexpected behavior.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Reduces the (low) risk.
    *   **Unexpected UI Behavior:** Improves UI stability.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   [Example: "No sanitization is currently performed on data loaded from external configuration files before displaying in a `TextView`."]
    *   [Example: "User comments are sanitized (using a basic control character removal) before display in the `ActivityLog` view (`ListView`)."]

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   [Example: "Need to implement sanitization for data received from the remote API before displaying it in the `ServerStatus` view (`TextView`)."]
    *   [Example: "The `HelpText` view (`TextView`) loads content from Markdown files; this content needs to be sanitized before display."]
