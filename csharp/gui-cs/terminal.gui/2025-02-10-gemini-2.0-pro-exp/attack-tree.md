## Attack Tree Path: [1. Input Validation Bypass [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__input_validation_bypass__high_risk_.md)

*   **1a. Oversized Input (Crash/DoS) [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker sends excessively large input strings to input fields (e.g., `TextField`, `TextView`) within the `terminal.gui` application.
    *   **Mechanism:** Exploits potential lack of input length validation in the application or `terminal.gui` itself.  May trigger buffer overflows, excessive memory allocation, or other resource exhaustion issues.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (DoS) by crashing the application or making it unresponsive.  In rare cases, a crash *might* lead to further exploitation, but this is less likely directly.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement strict input length limits on all input fields.
        *   Use input validation functions that check for maximum length.
        *   Test with extremely large inputs (fuzz testing).

*   **1b. Special Characters (Command Injection) [HIGH RISK] (Critical Node)**
    *   **Description:** The attacker injects special characters (e.g., `;`, `|`, `&&`, `$()`) into input fields, aiming to execute arbitrary commands on the system.
    *   **Mechanism:** Exploits the application's failure to properly sanitize user input *before* using it to construct commands (e.g., shell commands, database queries).  This is a critical developer error.
    *   **Impact:** Very High.  Complete system compromise is possible if the application runs with sufficient privileges.  The attacker could read, modify, or delete data, install malware, or pivot to other systems.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Never** directly construct commands using unsanitized user input.
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions.
        *   Use safe APIs that handle escaping and quoting automatically.
        *   If shell commands are absolutely necessary, use a well-vetted library that handles escaping correctly, and avoid direct string concatenation.
        *   Whitelist allowed characters; reject input containing anything else.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Dependency-Related Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/3__dependency-related_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **3a. Vulnerable Curses/Terminal Library [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The application uses an underlying curses or terminal library (e.g., ncurses, PDCurses) that has known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Mechanism:** The attacker exploits a known vulnerability in the library.  This might involve crafting specific input sequences or exploiting weaknesses in how the library handles terminal escape sequences.
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High.  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability, but could range from DoS to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Keep the curses/terminal library up-to-date.
        *   Use a dependency management system to track and update dependencies.
        *   Monitor for security advisories related to the library.

*   **3c. Outdated Version of Curses/Terminal [HIGH RISK] (Critical Node)**
    *   **Description:** Similar to 3a, but specifically highlights the risk of using an outdated, unpatched version of the curses/terminal library.
    *   **Mechanism:** Exploitation of publicly known vulnerabilities in older versions.
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High, same as 3a.
    *   **Mitigation:** Same as 3a: keep the library updated.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Misconfiguration/Improper Usage [HIGH RISK] (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/4__misconfigurationimproper_usage__high_risk___critical_node_.md)

*   **4a. Insufficient Input Sanitization [HIGH RISK] (Critical Node)**
    *   **Description:** This is the overarching category encompassing failures to properly validate and sanitize user input *before* using it in any sensitive context.  It's the root cause of many vulnerabilities, including command injection (1b).
    *   **Mechanism:**  The application treats user input as trusted and uses it directly in operations that require safe data (e.g., constructing commands, building file paths, displaying data).
    *   **Impact:**  Ranges from Medium to Very High, depending on the specific context.  Can lead to command injection, cross-site scripting (XSS) in terminal applications (if output is not properly handled), data corruption, and other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization for *all* user input.
        *   Use a whitelist approach: define what is allowed, and reject everything else.
        *   Use appropriate escaping or encoding techniques when displaying user-supplied data.
        *   Use parameterized queries or safe APIs for database interactions and other sensitive operations.
        *   Regularly review code for potential input validation bypasses.
        *   Perform penetration testing to identify and exploit input validation weaknesses.
