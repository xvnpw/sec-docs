# Attack Surface Analysis for gui-cs/terminal.gui

## Attack Surface: [1. Terminal Escape Sequence Injection (If Bypassed)](./attack_surfaces/1__terminal_escape_sequence_injection__if_bypassed_.md)

**Description:**  If an application developer *bypasses* `terminal.gui`'s rendering mechanisms and directly prints user-supplied input to the terminal, an attacker could inject terminal escape sequences.  This highlights a critical vulnerability *if* `terminal.gui`'s protections are circumvented.

**How `terminal.gui` Contributes:**  The vulnerability exists because `terminal.gui`'s *intended* safe handling of escape sequences is *not* being used.  This is a direct consequence of misusing the library.

**Example:**  The application uses `Console.WriteLine(userInput)` instead of a `terminal.gui` control to display user-provided text.  An attacker provides input containing escape sequences that, depending on the terminal, could execute commands.

**Impact:**  Potentially arbitrary command execution (depending on the terminal emulator), display manipulation, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:**  High (if command execution is possible) - This is downgraded from "Critical" because it requires developer error to be exploitable, but the potential impact remains high.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  *Strictly adhere* to using `terminal.gui`'s rendering mechanisms (e.g., `Label`, `TextView`) for *all* output to the terminal.  *Never* directly print user-supplied input using functions like `Console.Write` or `Console.WriteLine` without going through `terminal.gui`.  If absolutely necessary to handle raw output, implement extremely rigorous sanitization to remove or escape *all* control characters, especially escape characters (`\x1b`).
    *   **Users:**  Use a modern, secure terminal emulator that is hardened against escape sequence injection attacks. Keep the terminal emulator updated.

## Attack Surface: [2. Command Injection (via Unvalidated Input)](./attack_surfaces/2__command_injection__via_unvalidated_input_.md)

**Description:** User input from terminal.gui controls is used to construct shell commands or system calls without proper escaping.

**How `terminal.gui` Contributes:** Provides the input mechanisms (controls) that receive the potentially malicious input. It does *not* automatically validate or sanitize this input.

**Example:** A `TextField` allows the user to enter a search term. The application uses this term directly in a `grep` command: `system("grep " + userInput + " file.txt");`. An attacker enters `term; rm -rf /`. 

**Impact:** Arbitrary command execution, system compromise, data loss, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** *Avoid* using user input directly in shell commands. If absolutely necessary, use language-specific functions for safe command construction and argument escaping (e.g., `shlex.quote` in Python, parameterized queries for databases). Prefer using language APIs for system interaction instead of shell commands.
    *   **Users:** Similar to unvalidated input, be cautious about the input provided.

## Attack Surface: [3. Unvalidated User Input (Leading to Critical Issues)](./attack_surfaces/3__unvalidated_user_input__leading_to_critical_issues_.md)

**Description:** User-provided data entered through `terminal.gui` controls is used without proper validation or sanitization, leading to critical vulnerabilities like arbitrary file access or code execution.

**How `terminal.gui` Contributes:** Provides the input mechanisms (controls) that receive the potentially malicious input. It does *not* automatically validate or sanitize this input.

**Example:** A `TextField` allows the user to enter a filename. The application uses this filename directly in a file system operation without checking for path traversal characters (`../`). An attacker enters `../../etc/passwd`.

**Impact:** Arbitrary file access (read, write, delete), code execution (if the file is executable), information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if leading to code execution or sensitive data access) or High (if leading to unauthorized file access).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict input validation for *all* `terminal.gui` controls. Use whitelisting (allowing only known-good characters) rather than blacklisting. Validate length, character set, and format based on the expected input type. Use context-specific validation (e.g., path traversal checks for filenames). Sanitize input by escaping or removing potentially dangerous characters.
    *   **Users:** Be cautious about the input provided to applications. Avoid entering unusual characters or strings that might be interpreted as commands or special sequences.
