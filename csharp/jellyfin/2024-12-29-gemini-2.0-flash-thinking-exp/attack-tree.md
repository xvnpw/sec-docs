Threat Model: Compromising Application Using Jellyfin - High-Risk Sub-Tree

Attacker's Goal: Gain unauthorized access to the application's resources, data, or functionality by leveraging vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the integrated Jellyfin instance.

High-Risk Sub-Tree:

Compromise Application Using Jellyfin [CRITICAL NODE]
└── AND: Exploit Jellyfin Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]
    └── OR: Exploit Known Jellyfin CVEs [CRITICAL NODE]
    └── OR: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Jellyfin's Transcoding Process [HIGH RISK PATH]
        └── AND: Supply Malicious Media File
        └── AND: Trigger Transcoding
└── AND: Exploit Jellyfin's Data Storage [CRITICAL NODE]
    └── OR: Direct Access to Jellyfin's Database [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]
        └── AND: Exploit Database Vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection in Jellyfin)
        └── AND: Exploit Weak Database Credentials
└── AND: Intercept Communication Between Application and Jellyfin [HIGH RISK PATH]
    └── OR: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on API Communication
        └── AND: Lack of Encryption or Weak Encryption
        └── AND: Certificate Pinning Not Implemented
    └── OR: API Key or Secret Leakage [HIGH RISK PATH]
        └── AND: API Key Stored Insecurely in Application Code
        └── AND: API Key Exposed Through Application Vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS)

Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

Critical Nodes:

* Compromise Application Using Jellyfin:
    * This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved unauthorized access or control over the application.

* Exploit Jellyfin Vulnerabilities:
    * This category encompasses exploiting flaws in Jellyfin's code. Success here allows attackers to bypass normal security controls and potentially gain significant access.

* Exploit Known Jellyfin CVEs:
    * This involves leveraging publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Jellyfin. Attackers can use readily available exploit code to compromise unpatched instances.

* Exploit Jellyfin's Data Storage:
    * This category focuses on gaining unauthorized access to where Jellyfin stores its data, either the database or the file system. Success here can lead to data breaches, modification, or deletion.

* Direct Access to Jellyfin's Database:
    * This is a specific method of exploiting Jellyfin's data storage by directly accessing the database.

High-Risk Paths:

* Exploit Vulnerabilities in Jellyfin's Transcoding Process:
    * Attack Vector: Supply Malicious Media File AND Trigger Transcoding
        * An attacker crafts a malicious media file designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Jellyfin's transcoding engine.
        * The attacker then triggers the transcoding process, either through legitimate means (uploading the file) or by manipulating the application.
        * Successful exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server hosting Jellyfin.

* Direct Access to Jellyfin's Database:
    * Attack Vector: Exploit Database Vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection in Jellyfin)
        * An attacker injects malicious SQL code into input fields or parameters that are processed by Jellyfin's database queries.
        * Successful exploitation allows the attacker to bypass authentication, read sensitive data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
    * Attack Vector: Exploit Weak Database Credentials
        * An attacker obtains valid credentials for the Jellyfin database through various means (e.g., guessing, brute-forcing, phishing, or finding them in insecure locations).
        * With valid credentials, the attacker can directly access and manipulate the database.

* Intercept Communication Between Application and Jellyfin:
    * Attack Vector: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on API Communication
        * Lack of Encryption or Weak Encryption: Communication between the application and Jellyfin is not properly encrypted (or uses weak encryption), allowing an attacker to intercept and read the data being transmitted.
        * Certificate Pinning Not Implemented: The application does not validate the authenticity of the Jellyfin server's SSL certificate, allowing an attacker to intercept communication by presenting a fraudulent certificate.
        * Successful MITM attacks can allow attackers to steal sensitive information (like API keys or user data) or even modify requests and responses.
    * Attack Vector: API Key or Secret Leakage
        * API Key Stored Insecurely in Application Code: The API key used by the application to authenticate with Jellyfin is stored directly in the application's source code, making it easily accessible to attackers.
        * API Key Exposed Through Application Vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS): An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the application (like Cross-Site Scripting) to steal the API key from the application's memory or by intercepting network requests.
        * With a leaked API key, an attacker can impersonate the application and make unauthorized requests to the Jellyfin API.
