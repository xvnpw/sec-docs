# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for jellyfin/jellyfin

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict User Permissions and Roles (Jellyfin-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_user_permissions_and_roles__jellyfin-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access Jellyfin's Administration Dashboard:** Log in to Jellyfin with an administrator account.
    2.  **Navigate to Users:** Find the "Users" section in the dashboard.
    3.  **Review Existing Users:** Examine each user account.  Disable or delete any that are no longer needed.
    4.  **Edit User Permissions:** For each remaining user:
        *   Click on the user to edit their settings.
        *   **General Access:** Ensure "Enable this user" is only checked if the user is active.
        *   **Roles:** Assign the *least privileged* role. Avoid "Administrator" unless absolutely necessary. Use "User" or custom roles.
        *   **Library Access:** *Crucially*, go to "Library Access." Uncheck "Enable access to all libraries." Individually select *only* the libraries and folders this user *needs*. Be very specific.
        *   **Device Access:** If desired, restrict access to specific devices or IP addresses using "Enable access from these devices only."
        *   **Parental Control:** If applicable, configure parental controls to restrict content based on ratings or tags.
    5.  **Create Custom Roles (If Needed):** Create custom roles with specific permissions if the built-in roles are insufficient.
    6.  **Regular Audits:** Schedule regular (e.g., monthly/quarterly) manual reviews of user accounts and permissions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Media Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized access to media.
    *   **Accidental Data Deletion/Modification (Medium Severity):** Limits non-admin users' ability to modify data.
    *   **Malicious Insider Threat (High Severity):** Contains the damage a malicious insider can cause.
    *   **Account Takeover (High Severity):** Limits the impact of a compromised account.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Media Access:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Accidental Data Deletion/Modification:** Risk significantly reduced for non-admins.
    *   **Malicious Insider Threat:** Impact contained to assigned permissions.
    *   **Account Takeover:** Damage limited.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Yes, partially.** Jellyfin has built-in user management, roles, and library access controls in the administration dashboard.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Granularity within Libraries:** Limited fine-grained control *within* a library (e.g., folder/file-level restrictions based on metadata).
    *   **Automated Permission Reviews:** No built-in automated reminders or tools for permission reviews.
    *   **Audit Logging of Permission Changes:**  Limited audit logs of *who* changed *what* permissions and *when*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Plugin Vetting and Management (Jellyfin-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/plugin_vetting_and_management__jellyfin-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Before Installation (within Jellyfin):**
        *   **Source:** Prioritize plugins from the official Jellyfin plugin repository accessed through the Jellyfin dashboard.
        *   **Reputation:** Research the plugin (even if from the official repo) using external resources (forums, etc.).
        *   **Permissions:** Examine the plugin's requested permissions within the Jellyfin interface (if displayed).
    2.  **During Installation:** Use Jellyfin's built-in plugin manager.
    3.  **After Installation:**
        *   **Updates:** Enable automatic updates *within Jellyfin* if you trust the plugin source.  Manually update if preferred, using Jellyfin's interface.
        *   **Regular Review:** Periodically review installed plugins *within Jellyfin*. Remove unneeded or unmaintained plugins.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Plugin Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of installing malicious or vulnerable plugins.
    *   **Data Breaches (High Severity):** Reduces risk if the plugin handles sensitive data.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** A vulnerable plugin could be used for privilege escalation.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Plugin Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced by vetting and updates.
    *   **Data Breaches:** Impact depends on the plugin and data.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced, but not eliminated.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially.** Jellyfin has a built-in plugin manager and an official repository, providing *some* vetting.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Formal Plugin Security Audits:** No formal security audits of plugins in the official repository.
    *   **Plugin Sandboxing:** Jellyfin lacks robust plugin sandboxing.
    *   **Automated Vulnerability Scanning:** No built-in vulnerability scanning for plugins.
    *   **Clear Display of Plugin Permissions:**  Jellyfin could improve the display of requested permissions *before* installation.
    *   **User Reporting Mechanism:** A more structured mechanism for reporting security vulnerabilities in plugins.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep FFmpeg Updated (via Jellyfin Updates)](./mitigation_strategies/keep_ffmpeg_updated__via_jellyfin_updates_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Jellyfin Releases:** Regularly check for new Jellyfin releases (blog, forum, GitHub).
    2.  **Review Release Notes:** Check release notes for FFmpeg updates or security fixes.
    3.  **Update Jellyfin:** Update Jellyfin to the latest stable release using Jellyfin's built-in update mechanism (or official instructions). This updates the bundled FFmpeg.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **FFmpeg Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Reduces risk of exploits targeting FFmpeg vulnerabilities.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (High Severity):** Mitigates RCE via FFmpeg exploits.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **FFmpeg Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **RCE:** Directly mitigates RCE risk from FFmpeg.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially.** Jellyfin bundles FFmpeg and updates it with new releases.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **More Frequent FFmpeg Updates:** Jellyfin might not always have the *absolute latest* FFmpeg immediately.
    *   **User-Configurable FFmpeg Path (with Warnings):**  Allowing a custom path *could* be beneficial (with strong warnings).
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning of Bundled FFmpeg:**  Jellyfin could integrate vulnerability scanning for the bundled FFmpeg.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unnecessary Features and Plugins](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unnecessary_features_and_plugins.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Access Jellyfin's Administration Dashboard:** Log in to Jellyfin with an administrator account.
    2. **Navigate to Plugins:** Find "Plugins" section. Review installed plugins. Disable or uninstall any that are not absolutely necessary.
    3. **Navigate to Dashboard -> General:** Review settings. Disable any features that are not used, such as DLNA, if not required.
    4. **Navigate to Dashboard -> Networking:** Review settings. Disable "Allow remote connections to this server" if remote access is not needed.
    5. **Regularly review:** Periodically review enabled features and plugins, disabling any that have become unnecessary.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Vulnerabilities in Unused Features (Variable Severity):** Reduces the attack surface by disabling unused code.
    * **Plugin Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Reduces the risk from vulnerable plugins by removing them.
    * **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Disabling features can free up resources.

* **Impact:**
    * **Vulnerabilities in Unused Features:** Risk reduced proportionally to the number of features disabled.
    * **Plugin Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced by removing unnecessary plugins.
    * **Resource Exhaustion:** Can improve performance and stability.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * **Yes.** Jellyfin allows disabling features and plugins through its administration dashboard.

* **Missing Implementation:**
     * **Dependency Analysis:** Jellyfin could provide better information about dependencies between features and plugins, to help users understand the impact of disabling something.
     * **"Minimal Install" Option:** A "minimal install" option during setup, enabling only essential features, would be beneficial.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Resource Limits for Transcoding (Jellyfin-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/configure_resource_limits_for_transcoding__jellyfin-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access Jellyfin's Administration Dashboard:** Log in with an administrator account.
    2.  **Navigate to Transcoding Settings:** Find the "Transcoding" section (usually under "Playback" or a similar category).
    3.  **Limit Concurrent Streams:** Set a maximum number of simultaneous transcoding streams.  This prevents a single user or a malicious actor from overwhelming the server with transcoding requests.
    4.  **Adjust Transcoding Quality:**  If possible, lower the default transcoding quality settings.  Higher quality transcoding consumes more resources.
    5.  **Throttle Transcoding:** Explore options for throttling or prioritizing transcoding tasks.
    6. **Disable Transcoding (If Possible):** If all your client devices can directly play your media files, consider disabling transcoding entirely. This eliminates the attack surface associated with FFmpeg.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Transcoding (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from overwhelming the server with transcoding requests.
    *   **FFmpeg Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** *If transcoding is disabled*, this eliminates the risk of exploits targeting FFmpeg.  Limiting transcoding reduces the *exposure* to these vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS via Transcoding:** Risk significantly reduced by limiting concurrent streams and throttling.
    *   **FFmpeg Vulnerabilities:** Risk eliminated if transcoding is disabled; otherwise, exposure is reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially.** Jellyfin *does* have settings to control transcoding, including limiting concurrent streams and adjusting quality.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **More Granular Resource Limits:**  Finer-grained control over CPU and memory usage *per transcoding stream* would be beneficial.
    *   **Dynamic Resource Allocation:**  Ideally, Jellyfin could dynamically adjust transcoding resources based on overall server load.
    *   **Clearer Guidance on Safe Settings:**  The dashboard could provide more guidance on how to configure transcoding settings safely and efficiently.
