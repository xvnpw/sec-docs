# Threat Model Analysis for jellyfin/jellyfin

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Execution](./threats/malicious_plugin_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Plugin Execution

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious Jellyfin plugin and distributes it through unofficial channels. A user installs the plugin. The plugin executes arbitrary code on the Jellyfin server, potentially leading to complete server compromise. This leverages Jellyfin's plugin architecture directly.
    *   **Impact:** Complete server compromise, data breach, data loss, system instability, use of the server for illegal activities.
    *   **Jellyfin Component Affected:** Plugin System (specifically, the plugin loading and execution mechanism: `PluginManager`, related API endpoints for plugin installation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement a robust plugin verification system (code signing, centralized repository with mandatory code review). Implement plugin sandboxing (e.g., using containers or restricted user accounts). Provide clear API documentation and security guidelines for plugin developers.
        *   **User:** Only install plugins from the official Jellyfin plugin repository (once available) or from highly trusted sources. Carefully review plugin permissions (if displayed) before installation. Keep plugins updated.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Media Library Modification (via Jellyfin Vulnerability)](./threats/unauthorized_media_library_modification__via_jellyfin_vulnerability_.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Media Library Modification (via Jellyfin Vulnerability)

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *within Jellyfin's code* (e.g., a file handling vulnerability, an injection flaw in the library management API) to gain unauthorized access to modify the media library. This is distinct from an attacker gaining access through compromised credentials. The attacker could delete, add, or modify files.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, data corruption, potential malware infection of client devices (if malicious files are added).
    *   **Jellyfin Component Affected:** Media Library Management (`MediaService`, `LibraryManager`, file system access functions, API endpoints related to library management).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization in all code that handles file paths and user input related to the media library. Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing. Enforce the principle of least privilege.
        *   **User:** Keep Jellyfin updated to the latest version.

## Threat: [Transcoding Resource Exhaustion (DoS) - Exploiting a Vulnerability](./threats/transcoding_resource_exhaustion__dos__-_exploiting_a_vulnerability.md)

*   **Threat:** Transcoding Resource Exhaustion (DoS) - Exploiting a Vulnerability

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Jellyfin's transcoding engine (e.g., a buffer overflow or a logic error) to cause excessive resource consumption with a *minimal* number of requests. This is distinct from a general DoS attack; it's a specific vulnerability in Jellyfin's code that amplifies the impact of a DoS attempt.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, server unresponsiveness, potential server crash.
    *   **Jellyfin Component Affected:** Transcoding Engine (`TranscodingService`, `FFmpegWrapper`, related API endpoints for streaming and transcoding).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Thoroughly review and test the transcoding engine for vulnerabilities (e.g., using fuzzing techniques). Implement robust error handling and resource limits. Sanitize all inputs to the transcoding engine.
        *   **User:** Keep Jellyfin updated to the latest version.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass via API (Jellyfin Vulnerability)](./threats/authentication_bypass_via_api__jellyfin_vulnerability_.md)

*   **Threat:** Authentication Bypass via API (Jellyfin Vulnerability)

    *   **Description:** A vulnerability in Jellyfin's API allows an attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms and access protected resources or perform administrative actions *without* valid credentials. This is due to a flaw in Jellyfin's API code, not user error.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data and functionality, potential server compromise.
    *   **Jellyfin Component Affected:** API Endpoints (all API endpoints, particularly those related to authentication, authorization, and user management).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Thoroughly review and test all API endpoints for authentication and authorization vulnerabilities. Implement robust input validation and sanitization. Use secure session management techniques. Follow secure coding practices. Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks (though this is primarily a mitigation for credential-based attacks, not a direct fix for a bypass).
        *   **User:** Keep Jellyfin updated to the latest version.

## Threat: [Configuration File Tampering (via Jellyfin Vulnerability)](./threats/configuration_file_tampering__via_jellyfin_vulnerability_.md)

*   **Threat:** Configuration File Tampering (via Jellyfin Vulnerability)

    *   **Description:**  An attacker exploits a vulnerability *within Jellyfin* (e.g., a path traversal vulnerability) to gain write access to the configuration files, even without direct file system access.  They modify settings to weaken security or expose data. This is distinct from an attacker gaining access through compromised credentials or direct file system access.
    *   **Impact:** Server compromise, data breach, data loss, service disruption.
    *   **Jellyfin Component Affected:** Configuration System (functions related to reading and writing configuration files, API endpoints for modifying configuration).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**  Implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent path traversal and other vulnerabilities that could allow unauthorized access to configuration files.  Ensure Jellyfin runs with the least privileges necessary.
        *   **User:** Keep Jellyfin updated.
