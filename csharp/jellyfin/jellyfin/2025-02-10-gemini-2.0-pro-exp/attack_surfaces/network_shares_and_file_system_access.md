    *   **SMBv1:**  An outdated and insecure version of SMB that should be disabled.

*   **NFS Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Misconfigured Exports:**  NFS exports can be configured to allow access from any IP address, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access.
    *   **No Authentication:**  NFS can be configured without authentication, relying solely on IP address restrictions, which can be spoofed.
    *   **Root Squashing Issues:**  Improperly configured root squashing can allow attackers to gain root access to the server.
    *   **NFSv2/v3:** Older versions of NFS have known security weaknesses.

*   **File System Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure Permissions:**  Files and directories with overly permissive permissions (e.g., world-writable) can be modified or deleted by unauthorized users.
    *   **Symbolic Link Attacks:**  Attackers could create symbolic links to access files outside the intended directory.
    *   **Race Conditions:**  Vulnerabilities that occur when multiple processes attempt to access or modify the same file simultaneously.

* **Jellyfin-Specific Vulnerabilities (Potential):**
    *   **Path Traversal:** If Jellyfin doesn't properly sanitize user-provided input (e.g., file paths), an attacker might be able to access files outside the designated media library.  This is a *critical* area for code review.
    *   **Improper Permission Handling:**  Jellyfin might not correctly enforce access controls based on user roles or permissions, especially when interacting with network shares.
    *   **Vulnerable Dependencies:**  Jellyfin might rely on libraries with known vulnerabilities related to file system access.
    * **Lack of Input Validation:** If a user can specify a network share path without proper validation, an attacker could potentially inject malicious paths or commands.

#### 2.3 Impact Assessment

*   **Data Exfiltration (High):**  Unauthorized access to personal media files can lead to privacy breaches, identity theft, and potential blackmail.
*   **Data Tampering (Medium):**  Attackers could modify or delete media files, causing data loss and potential disruption.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium):**  Deleting files or making the share inaccessible could prevent legitimate users from accessing their media.
*   **System Compromise (High):**  In severe cases, vulnerabilities in SMB/NFS or the file system could lead to full system compromise, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Reputational Damage (Medium):**  A successful attack could damage the reputation of the user and potentially Jellyfin itself.
