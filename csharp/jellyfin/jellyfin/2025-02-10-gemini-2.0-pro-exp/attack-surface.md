# Attack Surface Analysis for jellyfin/jellyfin

## Attack Surface: [Media File Parsing and Processing](./attack_surfaces/media_file_parsing_and_processing.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in media codecs and libraries (primarily FFmpeg) used by Jellyfin to process media files.
    *   **How Jellyfin Contributes:** Jellyfin relies heavily on FFmpeg for transcoding and media handling. It's the integration point and orchestrator of these potentially vulnerable components.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted .mkv video file containing a malicious payload that exploits a known buffer overflow vulnerability in FFmpeg's H.264 decoder. When Jellyfin attempts to transcode or generate thumbnails for this file, the exploit triggers, granting the attacker remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), potential data exfiltration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is achievable), High (for DoS).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Regularly update FFmpeg and other dependent libraries to the latest versions. Implement robust error handling and input sanitization around media processing. Consider sandboxing the transcoding process (e.g., using seccomp, AppArmor, or containers). Perform fuzz testing on media parsing components.
        *   **Users:** Keep Jellyfin updated. Disable transcoding if not absolutely necessary. Run Jellyfin within a container (like Docker) with limited privileges. Be cautious about adding media from untrusted sources. Consider a dedicated, isolated network segment for Jellyfin.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin System](./attack_surfaces/plugin_system.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious or vulnerable third-party plugins that extend Jellyfin's functionality.
    *   **How Jellyfin Contributes:** Jellyfin's plugin architecture provides a mechanism for third-party code to run with significant privileges within the Jellyfin environment.
    *   **Example:** A user installs a seemingly harmless plugin from a non-official source that claims to enhance subtitle management. This plugin, however, contains malicious code that steals user credentials and sends them to an attacker-controlled server.
    *   **Impact:** RCE, Privilege Escalation, Data Exfiltration, DoS, complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if the plugin has broad permissions), High (if limited to specific data).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement a robust plugin vetting process for the official repository. Consider code signing for plugins. Provide clear documentation on plugin permissions and security best practices. Implement sandboxing or privilege separation for plugins.
        *   **Users:** *Only* install plugins from the official Jellyfin repository. If installing from a third-party source, *thoroughly* review the source code (if available) and the plugin's reputation. Disable any unnecessary plugins. Run Jellyfin with the least necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [API Endpoints (REST API)](./attack_surfaces/api_endpoints__rest_api_.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access or exploitation of vulnerabilities in Jellyfin's REST API.
    *   **How Jellyfin Contributes:** Jellyfin exposes a comprehensive API for managing the server and accessing media. This API is a direct entry point for interacting with Jellyfin's core functionality.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers a vulnerability in an API endpoint that allows them to bypass authentication and retrieve a list of all users and their hashed passwords. They then use this information to launch a brute-force or credential stuffing attack.
    *   **Impact:** Authentication Bypass, Authorization Bypass, Information Disclosure, DoS, potential RCE (if combined with other vulnerabilities).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (for authentication/authorization bypass).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API endpoints. Use API keys with granular permissions. Regularly audit API code for vulnerabilities. Implement rate limiting and input validation. Follow secure coding practices (e.g., OWASP API Security Top 10).
        *   **Users:** Use strong, unique passwords. Enable multi-factor authentication if available (via plugins or a reverse proxy). Monitor API logs for suspicious activity. Consider using a reverse proxy with authentication and authorization capabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Metadata Fetching (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/metadata_fetching__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities arising from Jellyfin fetching metadata from external services.
    *   **How Jellyfin Contributes:** Jellyfin initiates connections to external services (TheMovieDB, TVDB, etc.) to retrieve metadata. This outbound connection process can be manipulated.
    *   **Example:** An attacker adds a media item with a specially crafted title or description that, when processed by Jellyfin, causes it to make a request to an internal server (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/admin`) that is normally inaccessible from the outside. This could expose sensitive internal services or data.
    *   **Impact:** SSRF, Information Disclosure, potential RCE (if the internal service is vulnerable).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if it allows access to internal services).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict URL validation and sanitization before making requests to external services. Use a whitelist of allowed domains. Avoid making requests to internal IP addresses or hostnames. Use a dedicated network proxy for outbound requests. Implement timeouts and error handling.
        *   **Users:** Keep Jellyfin updated. There's limited user-side mitigation for this beyond general network security best practices.

## Attack Surface: [Network Shares and File System Access](./attack_surfaces/network_shares_and_file_system_access.md)

* **Description:** Unauthorized access to media files stored on network shares (SMB, NFS) due to misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.
    * **How Jellyfin Contributes:** Jellyfin requires read (and sometimes write) access to the location where media files are stored, which often involves network shares.
    * **Example:** Jellyfin is configured to access a media library on an SMB share with weak or default credentials. An attacker on the network scans for open SMB shares, discovers the Jellyfin share, and gains access to the entire media library, potentially including sensitive personal videos.
    * **Impact:** Data Exfiltration, Data Tampering, DoS (by deleting files).
    * **Risk Severity:** High (for data exfiltration).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Provide clear documentation on securely configuring network shares for use with Jellyfin. Encourage the use of strong authentication and encryption.
        * **Users:** Use strong, unique passwords for network shares. Enable encryption (e.g., SMB encryption). Restrict access to the share to only the necessary users and IP addresses. Regularly audit share permissions. Use a dedicated user account for Jellyfin with the minimum required permissions.
