## Jellyfin Security Analysis - Deep Dive

**1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology**

**Objective:**  This deep analysis aims to thoroughly examine the security posture of the Jellyfin media system (version as of the latest commit on the main branch at the time of this analysis, assuming no specific version is provided).  The analysis will identify potential vulnerabilities, assess their impact, and propose concrete mitigation strategies.  The focus is on key components identified in the provided security design review and inferred from the Jellyfin codebase and documentation.  We will pay particular attention to areas where Jellyfin's architecture and design choices intersect with common attack vectors.

**Scope:**

*   **Core Jellyfin Server:**  The .NET-based server application, including API endpoints, authentication, authorization, media management, and transcoding.
*   **Web Client:**  The JavaScript-based web interface.
*   **Database Interactions:**  How Jellyfin interacts with its database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.).
*   **Plugin System:**  The security implications of the plugin architecture.
*   **Networking and Communication:**  HTTPS configuration, network interactions, and potential exposure points.
*   **File System Interactions:**  How Jellyfin accesses and manages media files.
*   **Build Process:** Security considerations within the GitHub Actions-based build pipeline.
*   **Deployment (Docker Focus):**  Security best practices for Docker-based deployments, as this is the chosen deployment method for detailed analysis.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Architecture and Component Inference:**  Based on the provided C4 diagrams, documentation, and (hypothetically) examining the Jellyfin GitHub repository, we'll infer the system's architecture, data flows, and component interactions.  This includes identifying critical data assets and trust boundaries.
2.  **Threat Modeling:**  For each key component and interaction, we'll apply threat modeling techniques (e.g., STRIDE) to identify potential threats.  We'll consider the business and security posture outlined in the review.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  We'll analyze potential vulnerabilities based on identified threats, common web application vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10), and specific risks associated with media servers.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Recommendation:**  For each identified vulnerability, we'll propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies tailored to Jellyfin's architecture and technology stack.  These will go beyond generic recommendations and provide concrete implementation guidance.
5.  **Prioritization:**  We'll prioritize vulnerabilities and mitigations based on their potential impact and likelihood of exploitation.

**2. Security Implications of Key Components**

Let's break down the security implications of each key component, applying threat modeling and vulnerability analysis:

**2.1 Jellyfin Server (.NET)**

*   **Authentication:**
    *   **Threats:** Brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, session hijacking, weak password policies, insecure password storage.
    *   **Vulnerabilities:**  Insufficient rate limiting on login attempts, lack of account lockout mechanisms, use of weak hashing algorithms (if not bcrypt/Argon2), improper session management (e.g., predictable session IDs, lack of proper expiration), storing passwords in plain text or with weak encryption.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Enforce strong password policies:** Minimum length, complexity requirements, and disallow common passwords.  Provide feedback to the user on password strength.
        *   **Implement robust rate limiting and account lockout:**  Limit login attempts per IP address and per user, with increasing delays and eventual lockout.  Use a secure, time-based mechanism (e.g., exponential backoff).
        *   **Use bcrypt or Argon2 for password hashing:**  Ensure a sufficiently high work factor (cost) is used.  Salt each password with a unique, randomly generated salt.
        *   **Secure session management:**  Use HttpOnly and Secure flags for cookies.  Generate cryptographically strong session IDs.  Implement proper session expiration and invalidation (both server-side and client-side).  Consider using a well-vetted session management library.
        *   **Protect against CSRF:** Implement anti-CSRF tokens for all state-changing requests (e.g., login, password change).
        *   **Audit Authentication Events:** Log all successful and failed login attempts, password changes, and other authentication-related events.

*   **Authorization:**
    *   **Threats:**  Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to media or administrative functions.
    *   **Vulnerabilities:**  Inconsistent or missing authorization checks, improper role-based access control (RBAC) implementation, insecure direct object references (IDOR).
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Consistent Authorization Checks:**  Verify user permissions *before* granting access to *any* resource or functionality.  This should be enforced server-side, not just in the UI.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Users should only have the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
        *   **Robust RBAC:**  Implement a well-defined RBAC system with clearly defined roles and permissions.  Avoid hardcoding roles; use a database or configuration file.
        *   **Prevent IDOR:**  Do *not* directly expose internal object identifiers (e.g., database IDs) in URLs or API responses.  Use indirect references (e.g., UUIDs) or access control checks based on user ownership.  Map user-accessible identifiers to internal identifiers on the server.
        *   **Audit Authorization Events:** Log all access attempts, both successful and denied, including the user, resource, and action.

*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   **Threats:**  Injection attacks (SQL, command, XSS), denial-of-service (DoS), data leakage, unauthorized access.
    *   **Vulnerabilities:**  Lack of input validation, improper output encoding, exposure of sensitive information in error messages, lack of rate limiting, vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:**  Validate *all* user-supplied data on the server-side, using a whitelist approach (define what's allowed, reject everything else).  Use appropriate validation techniques for different data types (e.g., regular expressions for strings, type checking for numbers).  Consider using a validation library.
        *   **Output Encoding:**  Encode all data returned in API responses to prevent XSS.  Use context-specific encoding (e.g., HTML encoding for HTML content, JSON encoding for JSON data).
        *   **Parameterized Queries:**  Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) to prevent SQL injection.  *Never* concatenate user input directly into SQL queries.
        *   **Secure Error Handling:**  Do *not* expose sensitive information (e.g., stack traces, database details) in error messages returned to the client.  Log detailed error information server-side for debugging.
        *   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints to prevent DoS attacks and abuse.  Consider different rate limits for different endpoints and user roles.
        *   **API Gateway/Firewall (Optional):** Consider using an API gateway or web application firewall (WAF) to provide an additional layer of security and manage API traffic.
        *   **Regular Dependency Updates:** Keep all dependencies (NuGet packages) up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities. Use tools like Dependabot to automate this process.

*   **Media Management & Transcoding:**
    *   **Threats:**  Path traversal, command injection (via transcoding libraries), resource exhaustion (DoS).
    *   **Vulnerabilities:**  Insecure file handling, vulnerabilities in transcoding libraries (e.g., FFmpeg), lack of resource limits.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Secure File Handling:**  Validate file paths to prevent path traversal attacks.  Do *not* allow users to specify arbitrary file paths.  Use a whitelist of allowed directories and file extensions.  Sanitize filenames.
        *   **Sandboxed Transcoding:**  Run transcoding processes in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges and resource access.  Consider using containers or virtual machines.
        *   **Transcoding Library Updates:**  Keep transcoding libraries (e.g., FFmpeg) up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.  Monitor security advisories for these libraries.
        *   **Resource Limits:**  Implement resource limits (CPU, memory, disk space) for transcoding processes to prevent DoS attacks.
        *   **Input Validation for Transcoding Parameters:** Validate all user-supplied transcoding parameters (e.g., resolution, bitrate) to prevent command injection attacks through the transcoding library.

**2.2 Web Client (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)**

*   **Threats:**  Cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), clickjacking.
    *   **Vulnerabilities:**  Improper output encoding, lack of anti-CSRF tokens, lack of frame-busting techniques.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strict CSP to control the resources the browser is allowed to load, mitigating XSS attacks.  This is a *critical* mitigation.
        *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):**  Use SRI to ensure that fetched JavaScript and CSS files haven't been tampered with.
        *   **Output Encoding:**  Encode all data displayed in the UI to prevent XSS.  Use context-specific encoding (e.g., HTML encoding, JavaScript encoding).  Modern JavaScript frameworks often handle this automatically, but it's crucial to verify.
        *   **Anti-CSRF Tokens:**  Include anti-CSRF tokens in all forms and AJAX requests that modify server-side state.  Verify these tokens on the server.
        *   **X-Frame-Options Header:**  Set the `X-Frame-Options` header to `DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN` to prevent clickjacking attacks.
        *   **HttpOnly and Secure Flags:** Ensure cookies are set with the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags.

**2.3 Database Interactions**

*   **Threats:**  SQL injection, data breaches, unauthorized access.
    *   **Vulnerabilities:**  Lack of parameterized queries, weak database user permissions, insecure database configuration.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  *Always* use parameterized queries to interact with the database.  This is the primary defense against SQL injection.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  The database user account used by Jellyfin should have the minimum necessary permissions.  Do *not* use the database root account.
        *   **Secure Database Configuration:**  Follow database-specific security best practices.  This includes:
            *   Changing default passwords.
            *   Disabling remote access if not needed.
            *   Enabling logging and auditing.
            *   Regularly patching the database software.
            *   Using strong passwords for database user accounts.
            *   Consider encrypting the database at rest, especially if storing sensitive user data.
        *   **Connection Security:** Use secure connections (e.g., TLS/SSL) between the Jellyfin server and the database, especially if they are on separate machines.

**2.4 Plugin System**

*   **Threats:**  Malicious plugins, privilege escalation, code execution.
    *   **Vulnerabilities:**  Lack of plugin sandboxing, insufficient validation of plugin code, lack of a plugin signing mechanism.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Plugin Sandboxing:**  Run plugins in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges and resource access.  This could involve:
            *   Running plugins in separate processes.
            *   Using a restricted user account.
            *   Limiting access to the file system and network.
            *   Using .NET's Code Access Security (CAS) or similar mechanisms to restrict plugin permissions (though CAS is deprecated in newer .NET versions, alternatives exist).
        *   **Plugin Validation:**  Implement a system for validating plugins before they are installed or run.  This could include:
            *   Checking for known malicious plugins.
            *   Scanning plugins for potentially dangerous code patterns.
            *   Requiring plugins to be digitally signed by trusted developers.
        *   **Plugin Permissions:**  Define a clear set of permissions that plugins can request.  Users should be informed about the permissions a plugin requires before installing it.
        *   **Plugin Repository:**  Consider maintaining an official plugin repository with vetted plugins.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit the plugin API and existing plugins for security vulnerabilities.
        *   **User Warnings:** Clearly warn users about the potential risks of installing third-party plugins.

**2.5 Networking and Communication**

*   **Threats:**  Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, eavesdropping, unauthorized access.
    *   **Vulnerabilities:**  Lack of HTTPS, weak TLS configuration, exposure of unnecessary ports.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **HTTPS Only:**  *Require* HTTPS for all communication between clients and the server.  Redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS.  Use HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) to enforce HTTPS.
        *   **Strong TLS Configuration:**  Use a strong TLS configuration, disabling weak ciphers and protocols (e.g., SSLv3, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1).  Use a tool like SSL Labs' SSL Server Test to assess the TLS configuration.
        *   **Certificate Management:**  Obtain and manage TLS certificates from a trusted certificate authority (CA).  Automate certificate renewal.  Consider using Let's Encrypt.
        *   **Firewall:**  Use a firewall to restrict access to the Jellyfin server to only necessary ports (e.g., 443 for HTTPS).
        *   **Network Segmentation:**  If possible, place the Jellyfin server in a separate network segment (e.g., a DMZ) to limit the impact of a potential compromise.

**2.6 File System Interactions**

*   **Threats:**  Path traversal, unauthorized file access, deletion, or modification.
    *   **Vulnerabilities:**  Insecure file handling, lack of proper file permissions.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  The user account under which Jellyfin runs should have the minimum necessary permissions to access media files and configuration directories.
        *   **File System Permissions:**  Set appropriate file system permissions on media directories and configuration files.  Restrict access to only the Jellyfin user.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Validate all file paths provided by users or plugins to prevent path traversal attacks.  Do *not* allow users to specify arbitrary file paths.
        *   **Regular Backups:** Regularly back up media files and configuration data to protect against data loss.

**2.7 Build Process (GitHub Actions)**

*   **Threats:**  Compromised build environment, malicious dependencies, insertion of malicious code during the build.
    *   **Vulnerabilities:**  Vulnerable build tools, compromised GitHub Actions workflows, insecure dependency management.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Secure Build Environment:**  Use official, up-to-date build images for GitHub Actions.
        *   **Workflow Security:**  Regularly review and audit GitHub Actions workflows for security vulnerabilities.  Use specific commit SHAs for actions, rather than tags or branches, to prevent unexpected changes.
        *   **Dependency Management:**  Use a dependency management system (e.g., NuGet) to manage external libraries.  Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.  Use tools like Dependabot to automate this process.
        *   **Static Analysis:**  Integrate static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube, .NET analyzers) into the build process to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
        *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use SCA tools to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
        *   **Code Signing:**  Digitally sign released installers to ensure their authenticity and integrity. This helps prevent tampering after the build process.

**2.8 Deployment (Docker)**

*   **Threats:**  Container breakout, image vulnerabilities, insecure container configuration.
    *   **Vulnerabilities:**  Running containers as root, using outdated base images, exposing unnecessary ports, lack of resource limits.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Non-Root User:**  Run the Jellyfin container as a non-root user.  Create a dedicated user within the Dockerfile.
        *   **Up-to-Date Base Image:**  Use an up-to-date and minimal base image (e.g., a slim or alpine variant).  Regularly update the base image.
        *   **Image Scanning:**  Use container image scanning tools (e.g., Trivy, Clair) to identify vulnerabilities in the Jellyfin Docker image and its dependencies.
        *   **Least Privilege:**  Only expose necessary ports.  Use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Traefik) to handle HTTPS termination and forward traffic to the Jellyfin container.
        *   **Resource Limits:**  Set resource limits (CPU, memory) for the Jellyfin container to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.
        *   **Read-Only Root Filesystem:**  Consider mounting the container's root filesystem as read-only to prevent attackers from modifying system files.
        *   **Security Context:**  Use Docker's security context features (e.g., capabilities, seccomp profiles) to restrict the container's privileges.
        *   **Network Isolation:** Use Docker networks to isolate the Jellyfin container from other containers and services.
        *   **Secrets Management:** Do *not* store sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) directly in the Dockerfile or environment variables. Use a secrets management solution (e.g., Docker secrets, HashiCorp Vault).
        *   **Regular Updates:** Regularly update the Jellyfin Docker image and the Docker Engine itself to patch security vulnerabilities.

**3. Prioritization**

The following prioritizes vulnerabilities and mitigations based on impact and likelihood:

**High Priority:**

*   **Authentication:** Strong password policies, rate limiting, account lockout, bcrypt/Argon2, secure session management, anti-CSRF.
*   **Authorization:** Consistent authorization checks, principle of least privilege, robust RBAC, prevent IDOR.
*   **API Endpoints:** Strict input validation, parameterized queries, output encoding, secure error handling, rate limiting, dependency updates.
*   **Web Client:** CSP, SRI, output encoding, anti-CSRF tokens, X-Frame-Options.
*   **Database Interactions:** Parameterized queries, principle of least privilege, secure database configuration.
*   **Networking:** HTTPS only, strong TLS configuration, firewall.
*   **Deployment (Docker):** Non-root user, up-to-date base image, image scanning, least privilege, resource limits.

**Medium Priority:**

*   **Media Management & Transcoding:** Secure file handling, sandboxed transcoding, transcoding library updates, resource limits, input validation for transcoding parameters.
*   **Plugin System:** Plugin sandboxing, plugin validation, plugin permissions.
*   **File System Interactions:** Principle of least privilege, file system permissions, input validation.
*   **Build Process:** Workflow security, dependency management, static analysis, SCA, code signing.

**Low Priority:**

*   **Plugin System:** Plugin repository, regular audits.
*   **Deployment (Docker):** Read-only root filesystem, security context, network isolation, secrets management. (These are still important, but may be more complex to implement.)

**4. Addressing Questions and Assumptions**

*   **Specific static analysis tools:** The security review should explicitly list the static analysis tools used. Examples include SonarQube, .NET analyzers (Roslyn analyzers), and specialized security-focused tools. This analysis *strongly recommends* integrating these if they are not already in use.
*   **Code signing:** The review should confirm whether code signing is used. If not, it should be implemented.
*   **Input validation mechanisms:** The review should detail the specific techniques used (e.g., whitelist validation, regular expressions, validation libraries). This analysis emphasizes the importance of server-side, whitelist-based validation.
*   **Database security configurations:** The review should specify the database security configurations used in production. This analysis provides detailed recommendations.
*   **Formal security audits/penetration testing:** The review should state whether these are planned. This analysis *strongly recommends* periodic formal security audits and penetration testing.
*   **Vulnerability reporting process:** The review should describe the process. This analysis recommends establishing a clear, publicly accessible vulnerability reporting process (e.g., a security.txt file, a dedicated email address).
*   **Supply chain attack protection:** The review should detail the measures in place. This analysis recommends using tools like Dependabot and SCA tools, and pinning GitHub Actions to specific commit SHAs.
*   **Intrusion detection/prevention:** The review should state whether these are planned. While not strictly required for a basic media server, they are recommended for enhanced security, especially in exposed environments.
*   **Plugin system security:** The review should detail the mechanisms. This analysis provides extensive recommendations for sandboxing, validation, and permissions.
*   **Security-focused code reviews:** The review should state the frequency. This analysis recommends regular security-focused code reviews, ideally as part of the pull request process.

The assumptions made in the original security review are generally reasonable. However, this deep analysis highlights the critical need for *specific* implementations of the recommended security controls, going beyond general best practices. The reliance on community support is a valid point, but it should be supplemented with proactive security measures by the core development team.
