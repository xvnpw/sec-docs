# BUSINESS POSTURE

Jellyfin is an open-source media system that allows users to collect, manage, and stream their media. It's a free alternative to proprietary solutions like Plex and Emby. Given its nature, the business posture can be inferred as follows:

Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a stable, reliable, and feature-rich media server solution.
*   Maintain user privacy and control over their media data.
*   Foster a strong community around the project, encouraging contributions and user support.
*   Offer a viable, free alternative to commercial media server software.
*   Ensure broad platform compatibility (various operating systems, devices).
*   Continuous improvement and feature development based on community feedback.

Business Risks:

*   Reputational damage due to security vulnerabilities or data breaches.
*   Loss of user trust if the system proves unreliable or difficult to use.
*   Legal challenges related to copyright infringement if the software is misused.
*   Project stagnation due to lack of contributions or developer burnout.
*   Competition from established commercial players with more resources.
*   Difficulty in maintaining compatibility across a wide range of platforms and devices.
*   Inability to monetize the project, leading to sustainability issues (though this is less of a direct "business" risk for an open-source project and more of a project sustainability risk).

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls (based on common open-source practices and the nature of the project):

*   security control: Authentication: User authentication mechanisms (username/password, potentially multi-factor authentication via plugins). Implemented in Jellyfin server and client applications.
*   security control: Authorization: Access control to media libraries and server features based on user roles. Implemented in Jellyfin server.
*   security control: HTTPS Support: Ability to configure HTTPS for secure communication. Described in Jellyfin documentation.
*   security control: Regular Updates: Frequent releases to address bugs and security vulnerabilities. Managed through the GitHub repository and release process.
*   security control: Community Security Audits: Open-source nature allows for community scrutiny of the codebase. Implicit in the open-source model.
*   security control: Plugin System Security: A plugin system that, while offering extensibility, likely has some security considerations to prevent malicious plugins. Implemented in Jellyfin server.
*   security control: Input Validation: Some level of input validation to prevent common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection). Implemented in Jellyfin server and client applications.
*   security control: Rate Limiting: Measures to prevent brute-force attacks on login attempts. Implemented in Jellyfin server.
*   security control: Secure Configuration Defaults: While not always guaranteed, there's likely an effort to provide secure defaults for initial setup. Described in Jellyfin documentation.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on Community Support: Security heavily relies on community contributions and vigilance.
*   accepted risk: Plugin Vulnerabilities: Third-party plugins may introduce security risks.
*   accepted risk: User Misconfiguration: Users may misconfigure security settings, exposing their server.
*   accepted risk: Limited Formal Security Audits: Unlike commercial software, there may be fewer formal, professional security audits.
*   accepted risk: Dependence on External Libraries: Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Jellyfin can impact the system's security.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks.
*   Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) to ensure that fetched resources haven't been tampered with.
*   Provide clear security guidelines and best practices for users setting up and maintaining their Jellyfin servers.
*   Establish a clear vulnerability reporting process.
*   Consider integrating with security scanning tools for automated vulnerability detection.
*   Implement robust logging and auditing features to track user activity and potential security incidents.

Security Requirements:

    *   Strong password policies (length, complexity).
    *   Protection against brute-force attacks.
    *   Optional multi-factor authentication (likely through plugins).
    *   Secure session management (e.g., using HttpOnly and Secure cookies).
*   Authorization:
    *   Granular access control to media libraries and server features.
    *   Role-based access control (admin, user, guest, etc.).
    *   Ability to restrict access based on IP address or network.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Strict validation of all user inputs to prevent XSS, SQL injection, and other injection attacks.
    *   Encoding of output to prevent XSS.

    GitHubActions -- "Uses" --> BuildServer
    BuildServer -- "Builds & Tests" --> Artifacts
    Artifacts -- "Published to" --> DockerHub
    Artifacts -- "Published to" --> GitHubReleases

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers push code changes to the Jellyfin GitHub repository.
2.  This triggers GitHub Actions workflows defined in the repository.
3.  GitHub Actions spins up build servers (likely using various platforms to support different operating systems and architectures).
4.  The build server checks out the code from the repository.
5.  The build process compiles the code, runs unit tests, and potentially performs other checks (e.g., code style analysis, static analysis).
6.  If the build and tests are successful, build artifacts are created. These artifacts include:
    *   Installers for various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
    *   Docker images.
7.  The Docker images are pushed to Docker Hub, a container registry.
8.  The installers are published as GitHub Releases.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   Automated Build: GitHub Actions provides a consistent and automated build process, reducing the risk of manual errors.
*   Version Control: All code changes are tracked in the Git repository, providing an audit trail.
*   Dependency Management: The project likely uses a dependency management system (e.g., NuGet for .NET) to manage external libraries.
*   Testing: Automated unit tests help ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   Static Analysis (Potentially): The build process may include static analysis tools to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
*   Code Signing (Potentially): Installers may be digitally signed to ensure their authenticity and integrity.
*   Supply Chain Security: While not explicitly mentioned, there's an implicit need to be aware of supply chain security risks related to dependencies. Tools like Dependabot (for GitHub) can help identify vulnerable dependencies.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Media Streaming: The core functionality of Jellyfin is to provide seamless and reliable media streaming to users. Any disruption to this service would significantly impact user experience.
*   Media Management: Users rely on Jellyfin to organize and manage their media libraries. Loss or corruption of this data would be a major issue.
*   User Account Management: Securely managing user accounts and access controls is crucial to protect user privacy and prevent unauthorized access to media.

Data Sensitivity:

*   Media Files: The sensitivity of media files varies greatly depending on the user. Some users may store personal photos and videos, while others may have legally obtained copyrighted content.
*   User Metadata: Jellyfin stores metadata about media files, including titles, descriptions, and potentially user-added information. This metadata could be considered sensitive.
*   User Account Information: Usernames, hashed passwords, and potentially email addresses are stored by Jellyfin. This information is highly sensitive and must be protected.
*   Usage Data: Jellyfin may collect usage data (e.g., viewing history), which could be considered sensitive by some users.
*   Configuration Data: Server configuration data, including network settings and potentially API keys, is highly sensitive and must be protected.
