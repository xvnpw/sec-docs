Okay, let's dive into a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path for a Jellyfin application.

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Admin Control via Weak Credentials (Brute-Force)

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the vulnerabilities, risks, and potential mitigation strategies associated with an attacker gaining administrative control of a Jellyfin instance through a brute-force attack on weak credentials.  We aim to identify specific weaknesses in the Jellyfin application and its deployment environment that could facilitate this attack, and to propose concrete, actionable recommendations to reduce the likelihood and impact of such an attack.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the following attack path:

*   **Attacker's Goal:** Gain complete control over the Jellyfin server and its data.
*   **Sub-Goal 3:** Obtain administrative access to the Jellyfin web interface.
*   **3A:** Exploit weak or default administrator credentials.
*   **3A1:**  Employ a brute-force attack to guess the administrator password.

The scope includes:

*   Jellyfin's authentication mechanisms (as implemented in the specified GitHub repository).
*   Common password management practices (or lack thereof) by users and administrators.
*   Network-level and application-level defenses that could prevent or mitigate brute-force attacks.
*   The impact of successful administrative compromise.

The scope *excludes*:

*   Other attack vectors (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, exploiting vulnerabilities in underlying libraries).  We are *only* looking at brute-force against weak credentials.
*   Physical security of the server hosting Jellyfin.
*   Social engineering attacks to obtain credentials.

**Methodology:**

We will employ a combination of the following methods:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will examine the Jellyfin source code (from the provided GitHub repository) to understand how authentication is handled, including:
    *   Password storage mechanisms (hashing, salting).
    *   Account lockout policies (if any).
    *   Rate limiting mechanisms (if any).
    *   Session management.
    *   Any relevant security configurations.

2.  **Vulnerability Research:** We will search for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) and publicly disclosed exploits related to Jellyfin's authentication system and brute-force attacks.  This includes checking the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), Exploit-DB, and security advisories.

3.  **Threat Modeling:** We will consider various attacker profiles (e.g., script kiddie, motivated attacker) and their capabilities.  We will assess the likelihood of an attacker choosing this specific attack path.

4.  **Best Practice Analysis:** We will compare Jellyfin's authentication implementation and recommended configurations against industry best practices for secure authentication and brute-force protection.

5.  **Impact Analysis:** We will analyze the potential consequences of a successful brute-force attack, including data breaches, system compromise, and reputational damage.

6.  **Mitigation Recommendation:** Based on the findings, we will propose specific, actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified risks.  These recommendations will be prioritized based on their effectiveness and feasibility.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

Now, let's analyze the specific attack path in detail.

**Attacker's Goal: Gain complete control over the Jellyfin server and its data.**

This is the ultimate objective of the attacker.  Successful compromise of the administrator account provides full access to:

*   All media files stored on the server.
*   User accounts and their associated data (viewing history, preferences).
*   Server configuration settings (including network settings, transcoding options).
*   Potentially, the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server (depending on the server's configuration and the attacker's skill).

**Sub-Goal 3: Obtain administrative access to the Jellyfin web interface.**

This is a necessary step towards achieving the attacker's goal.  The Jellyfin web interface is the primary control panel for managing the server.

**3A: Exploit weak or default administrator credentials.**

This is the specific vulnerability the attacker is targeting.  "Weak" credentials can include:

*   **Default Passwords:**  If the administrator did not change the default password after installation, the attacker can easily gain access.  This is a surprisingly common issue.
*   **Short Passwords:**  Passwords that are too short (e.g., less than 8 characters) are vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
*   **Common Passwords:**  Passwords like "password," "123456," "admin," or easily guessable words are highly vulnerable.
*   **Dictionary Words:**  Passwords based on single dictionary words, even with some modifications, are susceptible to dictionary attacks.
*   **Personal Information:**  Passwords based on the user's name, birthday, or other easily obtainable information are weak.

**3A1: Employ a brute-force attack to guess the administrator password.**

This is the specific attack method.  A brute-force attack involves systematically trying all possible combinations of characters until the correct password is found.  This can be automated using tools like:

*   **Hydra:** A popular network login cracker.
*   **Medusa:** Another network login cracker.
*   **Burp Suite:** A web application security testing tool with intruder capabilities.
*   **Custom Scripts:** Attackers can write their own scripts to automate the process.

The success of a brute-force attack depends on:

*   **Password Complexity:**  Longer, more complex passwords take exponentially longer to crack.
*   **Account Lockout Policies:**  If Jellyfin locks the account after a certain number of failed login attempts, this significantly hinders brute-force attacks.
*   **Rate Limiting:**  If Jellyfin limits the number of login attempts allowed per unit of time (e.g., per IP address), this slows down the attack.
*   **Network Speed and Attacker Resources:**  A faster network connection and more powerful computing resources allow the attacker to try more passwords per second.

**Code Review Findings (Hypothetical - Requires Actual Code Analysis):**

Let's assume, for the sake of this example, that our code review reveals the following:

*   **Password Storage:** Jellyfin uses a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) with a unique salt for each password. This is good practice.
*   **Account Lockout:** Jellyfin *does not* implement an account lockout policy by default. This is a significant vulnerability.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Jellyfin has *basic* rate limiting, but it's easily bypassed by distributing the attack across multiple IP addresses (e.g., using a botnet).
*   **Session Management:** Jellyfin uses secure, HTTP-only cookies for session management. This is good practice.

**Vulnerability Research Findings (Hypothetical):**

Let's assume our research reveals:

*   **No specific CVEs** related to brute-force attacks against Jellyfin's authentication system.
*   **General discussions** on security forums about the importance of strong passwords and account lockout policies for Jellyfin.

**Threat Modeling:**

*   **Script Kiddie:** A script kiddie might try default credentials or use a basic brute-force tool with a small wordlist.  They are unlikely to bypass rate limiting or use a botnet.
*   **Motivated Attacker:** A motivated attacker with more resources could use a large wordlist, distribute the attack across multiple IP addresses, and potentially exploit any weaknesses in the rate limiting implementation.

**Impact Analysis:**

A successful brute-force attack could lead to:

*   **Data Breach:**  The attacker could download all media files, potentially including personal or sensitive content.
*   **System Compromise:**  The attacker could modify server settings, install malware, or use the server for malicious purposes (e.g., as part of a botnet).
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A public data breach could damage the reputation of the Jellyfin user and potentially expose them to legal liability.
*   **Privacy Violation:** User data, including viewing history, could be exposed.

### 3. Mitigation Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following mitigation strategies, prioritized by effectiveness and feasibility:

1.  **Enforce Strong Password Policies (High Priority, High Feasibility):**
    *   **Minimum Password Length:**  Require a minimum password length of at least 12 characters (preferably 16+).
    *   **Password Complexity:**  Require a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
    *   **Password Blacklist:**  Prevent the use of common passwords and dictionary words.
    *   **Password Expiration:**  Consider enforcing periodic password changes (e.g., every 90 days), although this should be balanced against user convenience.
    *   **User Education:**  Provide clear guidance to users on creating strong passwords.

2.  **Implement Account Lockout (High Priority, High Feasibility):**
    *   **Lockout Threshold:**  Lock the account after a small number of failed login attempts (e.g., 5 attempts).
    *   **Lockout Duration:**  Lock the account for a reasonable period (e.g., 30 minutes, increasing with subsequent failed attempts).
    *   **Administrator Notification:**  Notify the administrator via email when an account is locked.
    *   **CAPTCHA:** Implement CAPTCHA after a few failed login attempts to differentiate between human users and automated bots.

3.  **Enhance Rate Limiting (Medium Priority, Medium Feasibility):**
    *   **IP-Based Rate Limiting:**  Limit the number of login attempts per IP address per unit of time.
    *   **Global Rate Limiting:**  Limit the total number of login attempts across all IP addresses.
    *   **Dynamic Rate Limiting:**  Adjust the rate limits based on suspicious activity.
    *   **Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can provide more sophisticated rate limiting and bot detection capabilities.

4.  **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) (High Priority, Medium Feasibility):**
    *   Implement 2FA using TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) or other secure methods.  This adds an extra layer of security, even if the password is compromised.

5.  **Regular Security Audits (Medium Priority, High Feasibility):**
    *   Conduct regular security audits of the Jellyfin installation and its configuration.
    *   Review logs for suspicious activity.
    *   Keep Jellyfin and its dependencies up to date to patch any security vulnerabilities.

6.  **Monitor for Default Credentials (High Priority, High Feasibility):**
    *   Implement a check during installation or upgrade to ensure the default administrator password has been changed.
    *   Provide a prominent warning if the default password is still in use.

7. **Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS) (Low Priority, Low Feasibility):**
    * Consider deploying an IDS/IPS to detect and potentially block brute-force attacks at the network level. This is a more complex and potentially costly solution.

By implementing these recommendations, the risk of a successful brute-force attack against the Jellyfin administrator account can be significantly reduced. The most crucial steps are enforcing strong password policies, implementing account lockout, and considering two-factor authentication. These measures provide a strong defense against this specific attack vector.
