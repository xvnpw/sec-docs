## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_bypass_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Attackers exploit flaws in Jellyfin's authentication mechanisms to gain access without valid credentials.
* **Impact:** Full access to the Jellyfin instance and potentially the underlying application.
* **Mitigation:** Regularly update Jellyfin, implement robust authentication, and consider multi-factor authentication.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities in API Requests (e.g., command injection, path traversal)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_validation_vulnerabilities_in_api_requests__e_g___command_injection__path_traversal_.md)

* **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code or commands through API requests due to insufficient input validation by Jellyfin.
* **Impact:** Remote Code Execution on the server hosting Jellyfin, allowing full system compromise and data access.
* **Mitigation:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all API endpoints. Use parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Underlying Transcoding Libraries (e.g., ffmpeg)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_transcoding_libraries__e_g___ffmpeg_.md)

* **Description:** Attackers leverage known vulnerabilities in the libraries Jellyfin uses for transcoding media files.
* **Impact:** Remote Code Execution or Denial of Service on the server.
* **Mitigation:** Keep Jellyfin and its dependencies updated. Monitor security advisories for transcoding libraries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Media Files (e.g., denial of service)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_resource_exhaustion_via_malicious_media_files__e_g___denial_of_service_.md)

* **Description:** Attackers upload specially crafted media files that consume excessive server resources during transcoding, leading to a denial of service.
* **Impact:** Service disruption, making Jellyfin and the application unavailable.
* **Mitigation:** Implement resource limits for transcoding processes. Sanitize and validate uploaded media files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via User-Generated Content (e.g., media descriptions, user profiles)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_stored_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_user-generated_content__e_g___media_descriptions__user_d47a08b5.md)

* **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into user-generated content within Jellyfin, which are then executed in other users' browsers.
* **Impact:** Account takeover, information theft, and potential redirection to malicious sites.
* **Mitigation:** Implement robust output encoding and sanitization for all user-generated content displayed in Jellyfin's interface. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in Jellyfin's Code](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities_in_jellyfin's_code.md)

* **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries performed by Jellyfin, gaining unauthorized access to the database.
* **Impact:** Data breach, allowing access to sensitive user information, media metadata, and potentially application secrets.
* **Mitigation:** Review Jellyfin's codebase for potential SQL injection points. Use parameterized queries or ORM frameworks securely.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Jellyfin with Default Administrator Credentials (if not changed)](./attack_tree_paths/access_jellyfin_with_default_administrator_credentials__if_not_changed_.md)

* **Description:** Attackers use the default administrator credentials (if not changed after installation) to gain full access.
* **Impact:** Complete control over the Jellyfin instance and potentially the underlying application.
* **Mitigation:** Force users to change default administrator credentials upon installation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Brute-Force Weak User Passwords](./attack_tree_paths/brute-force_weak_user_passwords.md)

* **Description:** Attackers attempt to guess user passwords through repeated login attempts.
* **Impact:** Account takeover, allowing access to user data and potentially administrative functions.
* **Mitigation:** Enforce strong password policies and implement account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed login attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious or Poorly Coded Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_or_poorly_coded_plugins.md)

* **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities or intentionally malicious code within third-party Jellyfin plugins.
* **Impact:** Wide-ranging access depending on the plugin's permissions, potentially leading to system compromise or data breaches.
* **Mitigation:** Implement a mechanism to review and approve plugins before installation. Educate users about the risks of installing untrusted plugins.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Popular Third-Party Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_popular_third-party_plugins.md)

* **Description:** Attackers target publicly known vulnerabilities in widely used third-party Jellyfin plugins.
* **Impact:** Significant to critical impact depending on the vulnerability and plugin's functionality.
* **Mitigation:** Track vulnerabilities in installed third-party plugins and update them promptly.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Plugin Update Mechanism](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_plugin_update_mechanism.md)

* **Description:** Attackers intercept or manipulate the plugin update process to install malicious plugin versions.
* **Impact:** Installation of malicious plugins, potentially affecting all users of the Jellyfin instance.
* **Mitigation:** Ensure plugin updates are downloaded over secure channels (HTTPS) and verify signatures if available.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Libraries Used by Jellyfin](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_libraries_used_by_jellyfin.md)

* **Description:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in the underlying frameworks or libraries that Jellyfin depends on.
* **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, or other critical impacts depending on the specific vulnerability.
* **Mitigation:** Keep Jellyfin's underlying framework and libraries updated. Monitor security advisories. Implement a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and regularly scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
