## Deep Analysis: Brute-Force Weak User Passwords in Jellyfin

This analysis delves into the "Brute-Force Weak User Passwords" attack path within the context of the Jellyfin media server application. We will examine the technical aspects, potential exploitation methods, and provide specific recommendations for the development team.

**Attack Tree Path:** Brute-Force Weak User Passwords

* **Description:** Attackers attempt to guess user passwords through repeated login attempts.
* **Impact:** Account takeover, allowing access to user data and potentially administrative functions.
* **Mitigation:** Enforce strong password policies and implement account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed login attempts.

**Deep Dive Analysis:**

**1. Attack Vector & Methodology:**

* **Target:** The primary target is the user authentication mechanism within Jellyfin. This typically involves the login form accessible through the web interface or potentially through API endpoints used by Jellyfin clients (desktop, mobile, etc.).
* **Method:** Attackers employ various techniques to automate password guessing:
    * **Dictionary Attacks:** Using a pre-compiled list of common passwords and variations.
    * **Brute-Force Attacks (Exhaustive):** Trying every possible combination of characters within a defined length and character set. This is computationally intensive but can be effective against very short or simple passwords.
    * **Hybrid Attacks:** Combining dictionary words with numbers, symbols, and common patterns.
    * **Credential Stuffing:** Using lists of username/password combinations leaked from other breaches, hoping users reuse credentials across multiple services.
* **Entry Points:**
    * **Web Interface Login Form:** The most obvious entry point, accessible via the Jellyfin server's web address. Attackers can automate requests to this form.
    * **API Endpoints:** Jellyfin exposes API endpoints for authentication, which clients utilize. Attackers might target these endpoints directly, potentially bypassing some web interface protections if not implemented consistently. Specific endpoints to consider include:
        * `/Users/AuthenticateByName` (for username/password authentication)
        * Potentially other authentication-related endpoints depending on future authentication methods.
    * **Mobile/Desktop Application APIs:** If the mobile or desktop applications have their own authentication mechanisms or rely on specific API calls, these could also be targeted.

**2. Jellyfin Specific Considerations:**

* **Default Configuration:**  The default Jellyfin installation might not have strict password policies or account lockout enabled. This makes it immediately vulnerable.
* **User Roles and Permissions:**  Successful brute-force could grant access to regular user accounts or, more critically, administrative accounts. Administrative access allows for significant control over the Jellyfin server, including:
    * Modifying server settings.
    * Adding or removing users.
    * Accessing all media content.
    * Potentially gaining access to the underlying operating system if vulnerabilities exist or if the Jellyfin process has elevated privileges.
* **API Rate Limiting:**  The presence and effectiveness of rate limiting on authentication API endpoints are crucial. Without it, attackers can make a large number of requests quickly.
* **CAPTCHA Implementation:**  The web interface login form might or might not have CAPTCHA implemented. Its absence makes automated brute-force significantly easier.
* **Logging and Monitoring:**  The level of detail in Jellyfin's authentication logs is important for detecting brute-force attempts. Are failed login attempts logged with sufficient information (IP address, timestamp, username)?
* **Password Hashing Algorithm:** While not directly related to brute-forcing weak passwords, the strength of the hashing algorithm used to store passwords is crucial if the password database is ever compromised. A weak hash could make offline brute-force attacks against the database feasible.

**3. Impact Analysis (Beyond the Basic Description):**

* **Loss of Confidentiality:** Attackers gain access to user's media libraries, potentially including personal videos, photos, and other sensitive content.
* **Loss of Integrity:** Attackers could potentially modify user data, library metadata, or even the server configuration.
* **Loss of Availability:**  If administrative accounts are compromised, attackers could disrupt the service, delete media, or even take the server offline.
* **Reputational Damage:** If a user's Jellyfin account is compromised and used for malicious purposes (e.g., sharing copyrighted content), it could damage the user's reputation and potentially the reputation of the Jellyfin project.
* **Resource Consumption:**  While not the primary impact, sustained brute-force attempts can consume server resources, potentially impacting performance for legitimate users.

**4. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed and Jellyfin Specific):**

* **Strong Password Policies:**
    * **Minimum Length:** Enforce a minimum password length (e.g., 12 characters or more).
    * **Complexity Requirements:**  Require a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
    * **Password History:**  Prevent users from reusing recently used passwords.
    * **Consider integrating with password strength estimators** during password creation to provide real-time feedback to users.
    * **Implementation:** This needs to be configurable within Jellyfin's settings and enforced during user registration and password changes.
* **Account Lockout Mechanisms:**
    * **Threshold:**  Define a maximum number of failed login attempts within a specific time window (e.g., 5 failed attempts in 5 minutes).
    * **Lockout Duration:**  Implement a temporary lockout period (e.g., 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or an increasing backoff).
    * **Notification:** Consider notifying the user via email about the lockout.
    * **Implementation:** This logic needs to be implemented at the authentication layer, tracking failed attempts per user and IP address.
* **Rate Limiting:**
    * **Apply rate limiting to authentication endpoints:** Limit the number of login requests from a single IP address within a short timeframe.
    * **Consider different rate limits for authenticated and unauthenticated requests.**
    * **Implementation:** This can be implemented at the web server level (e.g., using Nginx or Apache modules) or within the Jellyfin application code itself.
* **CAPTCHA/reCAPTCHA:**
    * **Implement CAPTCHA on the login form:** This helps distinguish between human users and automated bots.
    * **Consider using reCAPTCHA v3 for a more seamless user experience.**
    * **Implementation:** This requires integrating a CAPTCHA library into the web interface.
* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
    * **Implement and encourage the use of 2FA:** This adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password.
    * **Support various 2FA methods:** Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) via authenticator apps are a common choice.
    * **Implementation:** This requires changes to the authentication flow and potentially integration with a 2FA library.
* **Security Headers:**
    * **Implement security headers like `X-Frame-Options`, `Content-Security-Policy`, and `Strict-Transport-Security`:** While not directly preventing brute-force, they can mitigate other attack vectors.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Conduct regular security assessments to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the authentication process.**
    * **Simulate brute-force attacks to test the effectiveness of implemented mitigations.**
* **Logging and Monitoring:**
    * **Ensure comprehensive logging of authentication attempts, including failed attempts with timestamps and IP addresses.**
    * **Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious activity, such as a high number of failed login attempts from a single IP address.**
    * **Integrate with security information and event management (SIEM) systems for centralized logging and analysis.**
* **Educate Users:**
    * **Provide guidance to users on creating strong, unique passwords.**
    * **Encourage the use of password managers.**
    * **Inform users about the importance of enabling 2FA.**

**5. Development Team Considerations:**

* **Prioritize security during development:**  Incorporate security best practices into the software development lifecycle.
* **Thoroughly test authentication mechanisms:**  Include security testing as part of the regular testing process.
* **Keep dependencies up to date:**  Ensure that all libraries and frameworks used by Jellyfin are up to date with the latest security patches.
* **Follow secure coding practices:**  Avoid common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), which could be exploited after an account takeover.
* **Provide clear documentation on security features:**  Make it easy for administrators to configure security settings like password policies and account lockout.

**Conclusion:**

The "Brute-Force Weak User Passwords" attack path poses a significant threat to Jellyfin users. By understanding the attack vectors, potential impact, and implementing robust mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly enhance the security of the application. Focusing on strong password policies, account lockout, rate limiting, and encouraging 2FA are crucial steps in protecting user accounts from this common attack. Continuous monitoring and security assessments are also essential to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of these security measures.
