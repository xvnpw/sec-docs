# Attack Surface Analysis for jellyfin/jellyfin

## Attack Surface: [Media Codec Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/media_codec_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Media Codec Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Exploiting weaknesses in the software libraries (codecs) used by Jellyfin to decode and process media files.
    *   **How Jellyfin Contributes:** Jellyfin utilizes various codecs (both built-in and potentially third-party) to handle a wide range of media formats. Vulnerabilities in these codecs can be triggered when Jellyfin attempts to process a maliciously crafted media file.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted video file that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in a codec used by Jellyfin, leading to remote code execution on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Regularly update to the latest stable versions of codec libraries. Implement input validation and sanitization on media files before processing. Consider sandboxing the transcoding process.
        *   **Users:** Keep your Jellyfin server updated to benefit from codec updates and security patches. Be cautious about the source of media files added to your library.

## Attack Surface: [Metadata Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/metadata_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Metadata Parsing Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Exploiting flaws in how Jellyfin parses metadata associated with media files (e.g., from embedded tags or external metadata providers).
    *   **How Jellyfin Contributes:** Jellyfin automatically fetches and processes metadata to enhance the user experience. Vulnerabilities in the parsing logic can be exploited by injecting malicious data into metadata fields.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a media file with malicious code embedded in an ID3 tag. When Jellyfin parses this tag, it executes the embedded code.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Information Disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all metadata fields. Use secure parsing libraries and avoid manual parsing where possible. Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS.
        *   **Users:** Be mindful of the sources from which Jellyfin retrieves metadata. Consider disabling automatic metadata fetching from untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin/Extension Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/pluginextension_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Plugin/Extension Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Security flaws present in third-party plugins or extensions installed on the Jellyfin server.
    *   **How Jellyfin Contributes:** Jellyfin's plugin system allows for extending its functionality, but this introduces the risk of vulnerabilities in community-developed code.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable plugin allows an attacker to bypass authentication or gain access to sensitive server files.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Privilege Escalation, Data Breach.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement a secure plugin API with proper access controls and sandboxing. Provide guidelines and security checks for plugin developers.
        *   **Users:** Only install plugins from trusted sources. Regularly review installed plugins and remove any that are no longer needed or maintained. Keep plugins updated to the latest versions.

## Attack Surface: [API Endpoint Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/api_endpoint_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** API Endpoint Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Security weaknesses in Jellyfin's Application Programming Interface (API) endpoints that allow external applications or users to interact with the server.
    *   **How Jellyfin Contributes:** Jellyfin exposes various API endpoints for managing media, users, and server settings. Vulnerabilities in these endpoints can be exploited for unauthorized access or actions.
    *   **Example:** An API endpoint lacks proper authentication, allowing an attacker to create new administrator accounts. Another endpoint might be vulnerable to input validation flaws, leading to data manipulation.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized Access, Data Manipulation, Privilege Escalation, Denial of Service (DoS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API endpoints. Enforce strict input validation and sanitization. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse. Avoid exposing sensitive data in API responses unnecessarily.
        *   **Users:** Ensure that access to the Jellyfin API is properly secured, especially if exposed to the internet. Use strong and unique API keys if applicable.
