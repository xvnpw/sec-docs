# Threat Model Analysis for jellyfin/jellyfin

## Threat: [Bypassing Jellyfin Authentication](./threats/bypassing_jellyfin_authentication.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Jellyfin's authentication mechanisms directly. This allows them to gain unauthorized access to Jellyfin resources (media, settings, user data) without providing valid credentials. This could involve exploiting flaws in Jellyfin's login process, session management, or authentication token handling.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive media content, modification or deletion of media libraries, potential access to other Jellyfin user accounts, and the ability to perform actions as a legitimate user within Jellyfin.

**Affected Component:** Jellyfin Authentication Service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Ensure Jellyfin is updated to the latest version with security patches.
- Enforce strong password policies for Jellyfin users.
- Enable and enforce multi-factor authentication for Jellyfin accounts.
- Regularly review Jellyfin's security logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Improper Input Validation on API Calls Leading to Jellyfin Exploitation](./threats/improper_input_validation_on_api_calls_leading_to_jellyfin_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends malformed or malicious input to Jellyfin's API endpoints, exploiting vulnerabilities in how Jellyfin handles and validates this data. This can lead to unintended behavior, errors, or even the execution of arbitrary code on the Jellyfin server.

**Impact:** Potential for remote code execution on the Jellyfin server, denial of service against the Jellyfin instance, data corruption within Jellyfin's database, or information disclosure from Jellyfin.

**Affected Component:** Various Jellyfin API Endpoints.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Ensure Jellyfin is updated to the latest version with security patches.
- Review Jellyfin's API documentation and changelogs for reported vulnerabilities.
- Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious requests before they reach Jellyfin.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Known Jellyfin Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_known_jellyfin_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker directly exploits publicly known security vulnerabilities present in the running version of Jellyfin. This could involve leveraging documented exploits or using vulnerability scanners to identify and exploit weaknesses.

**Impact:** Depends on the specific Jellyfin vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure and denial of service to remote code execution on the Jellyfin server.

**Affected Component:** Various Jellyfin components depending on the exploited vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is possible), High (for other significant vulnerabilities)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Keep the Jellyfin instance updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
- Subscribe to Jellyfin's security advisories and monitor for new vulnerabilities.
- Implement a vulnerability management program to regularly scan the Jellyfin instance for known weaknesses.

## Threat: [Plugin Vulnerabilities Affecting Jellyfin](./threats/plugin_vulnerabilities_affecting_jellyfin.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits security vulnerabilities within Jellyfin plugins. These vulnerabilities could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code, access sensitive data, or disrupt the functionality of Jellyfin.

**Impact:** Depends on the plugin's functionality and the nature of the vulnerability, but could lead to data breaches, denial of service, or even remote code execution within the Jellyfin environment.

**Affected Component:** Jellyfin Plugin System, specific Jellyfin plugins.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Only use trusted and well-maintained Jellyfin plugins.
- Keep plugins updated to their latest versions.
- Review plugin permissions and disable unnecessary plugins.
- Monitor plugin activity and logs for suspicious behavior.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Jellyfin](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__in_jellyfin.md)

**Description:** An attacker leverages a vulnerability in Jellyfin that allows them to make Jellyfin initiate requests to arbitrary internal or external servers. This can be used to scan internal networks, access internal services, or potentially compromise other systems.

**Impact:** Access to internal network resources, potential for further attacks on internal systems, disclosure of internal information, or abuse of external services.

**Affected Component:** Jellyfin's media fetching or downloading functionalities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Ensure Jellyfin is updated to the latest version with security patches.
- Configure Jellyfin to restrict outbound network access where possible.
- Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of a successful SSRF attack.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) by Abusing Jellyfin's Transcoding or Media Processing](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__by_abusing_jellyfin's_transcoding_or_media_processing.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends requests that cause Jellyfin to perform resource-intensive operations, such as transcoding large files or processing corrupted media, without proper authorization or limits. This can overwhelm the Jellyfin server, making it unavailable to legitimate users.

**Impact:**  Jellyfin becomes unavailable, disrupting media streaming and other functionalities.

**Affected Component:** Jellyfin Transcoding Service, Jellyfin Media Processing Engine.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement rate limiting on requests to Jellyfin.
- Monitor Jellyfin's resource usage and performance.
- Configure Jellyfin's transcoding settings to limit resource consumption and concurrent tasks.
- Implement input validation to prevent requests for excessively large or malformed media.
