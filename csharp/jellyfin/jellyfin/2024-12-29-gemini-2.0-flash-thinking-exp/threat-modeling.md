### High and Critical Jellyfin Threats

*   **Threat:** Jellyfin API Authentication Bypass
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Jellyfin's API authentication mechanism. They might craft malicious API requests or leverage known vulnerabilities to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the Jellyfin server.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to media libraries, user accounts, and server settings. Attackers could modify or delete media, create or delete users, or even take control of the Jellyfin server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Jellyfin.Server.dll (Authentication modules, API endpoint handlers)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Jellyfin server updated to the latest version to patch known authentication vulnerabilities.
        *   Enforce strong password policies for all Jellyfin user accounts.
        *   Implement and enforce the use of API keys for application access to the Jellyfin API.
        *   Regularly review and audit API access logs for suspicious activity.
        *   Consider implementing two-factor authentication for Jellyfin user accounts.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Jellyfin Plugin Installation
    *   **Description:** An attacker, either with administrative access or by social engineering a user with such access, installs a malicious third-party plugin. The plugin could contain code designed to steal data, compromise the server, or perform other malicious actions.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (sensitive media information, user credentials), server compromise (remote code execution, denial of service), and potential lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Affected Component:** Jellyfin.Server.dll (Plugin management modules, plugin execution environment)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only install plugins from trusted sources.
        *   Thoroughly vet the code of any third-party plugin before installation.
        *   Implement a process for reviewing and approving plugin installations.
        *   Regularly audit installed plugins and remove any that are no longer needed or are deemed risky.
        *   Run Jellyfin server processes with the least necessary privileges.

*   **Threat:** Media Processing Remote Code Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted media file that exploits a vulnerability in Jellyfin's media processing libraries (e.g., FFmpeg). This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Jellyfin server.
    *   **Impact:** Full server compromise, allowing the attacker to control the server, access sensitive data, or use it as a launchpad for further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Jellyfin.Server.dll (Media transcoding modules, external libraries like FFmpeg)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Jellyfin server and its dependencies (including FFmpeg) updated to the latest versions.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization for uploaded media files.
        *   Consider running media processing tasks in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.
        *   Regularly scan the media library for potentially malicious files using antivirus or malware detection tools.

*   **Threat:** Jellyfin API Authorization Flaws
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits weaknesses in Jellyfin's API authorization checks. They might craft API requests that bypass intended access controls, allowing them to access or modify resources they shouldn't have access to.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to media, user data, or server settings. Attackers could view private media, modify user profiles, or alter server configurations.
    *   **Affected Component:** Jellyfin.Server.dll (Authorization modules, API endpoint handlers)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement fine-grained access control policies within Jellyfin.
        *   Thoroughly test API endpoints to ensure authorization checks are correctly implemented.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions to API keys or user roles.
        *   Regularly review and audit API access permissions.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Default Jellyfin Configuration
    *   **Description:** The default configuration of Jellyfin might have insecure settings that expose the server to vulnerabilities. For example, default administrative credentials or an exposed administrative interface.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Jellyfin server, potentially leading to full compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Jellyfin.Server.dll (Configuration management), Jellyfin.Web.dll (Administrative interface)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Change default administrative credentials immediately after installation.
        *   Secure the Jellyfin administrative interface by restricting access to specific IP addresses or networks.
        *   Review and harden other default configuration settings according to security best practices.
        *   Disable any unnecessary features or services.

*   **Threat:** Compromised Jellyfin Update Server
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the official Jellyfin update server and injects malicious code into software updates. Users who update their Jellyfin server will unknowingly install the compromised version.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread compromise of Jellyfin servers, potentially leading to data breaches, remote code execution, and other malicious activities.
    *   **Affected Component:** Jellyfin.Installer (Update mechanism), Jellyfin.Server.dll (All components potentially affected by a malicious update)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Verify the integrity of downloaded updates using cryptographic signatures.
        *   Monitor Jellyfin's communication with the update server for anomalies.
        *   Consider using a staged update process where updates are tested on non-production environments first.
        *   Implement robust security measures on the update server infrastructure.

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal through Media Paths
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates file paths when interacting with Jellyfin's media handling features to access files outside of the intended media directories.
    *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive files on the server's file system, potentially including configuration files, user data, or system files.
    *   **Affected Component:** Jellyfin.Server.dll (Media serving components, file access logic)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all file paths.
        *   Ensure that Jellyfin processes operate with the least necessary file system permissions.
        *   Avoid constructing file paths dynamically based on user input without proper validation.
