*   **Attack Surface:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Malicious Plugins
    *   **Description:** Attackers can upload or install malicious plugins that contain code designed to execute arbitrary commands on the Jellyfin server.
    *   **How Jellyfin Contributes:** Jellyfin's plugin architecture inherently allows for extending its functionality with third-party code, creating a direct pathway for introducing malicious components. The lack of mandatory code review or sandboxing for plugins increases this risk.
    *   **Example:** An attacker creates a plugin disguised as a useful utility but contains code that opens a reverse shell to their server when installed on the Jellyfin instance.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Jellyfin server, including access to the underlying operating system, data stored on the server, and potentially the network it resides on.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement a secure plugin installation process with mandatory code signing and verification. Establish a robust plugin review process with security audits. Consider sandboxing plugins to limit their access to system resources. Provide clear and enforced security guidelines for plugin developers.
        *   **Users:** Only install plugins from highly trusted and reputable sources. Carefully review the permissions requested by plugins before installation. Keep plugins updated promptly. Consider disabling plugins that are not actively used.

*   **Attack Surface:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Media Metadata
    *   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code is injected into media metadata fields (e.g., title, description, summary) and stored in the Jellyfin database. This script is then executed in the browsers of other users who view the affected media item.
    *   **How Jellyfin Contributes:** Jellyfin's feature allowing users to edit and store rich metadata for their media libraries, without sufficient input sanitization, directly creates this vulnerability. The persistence of the data in the database makes it a stored XSS issue.
    *   **Example:** An attacker edits the description of a movie within Jellyfin to include `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When another user views this movie's details through the Jellyfin web interface, the alert box pops up, demonstrating the execution of arbitrary JavaScript within their browser.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise (session hijacking, credential theft), redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the Jellyfin interface for other users, potentially leading to further attacks against other users of the same Jellyfin instance.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement comprehensive input sanitization and output encoding for all user-provided metadata fields before storing them in the database and rendering them in the UI. Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about granting metadata editing permissions to untrusted users. Regularly review and sanitize metadata if concerns arise.

*   **Attack Surface:** Path Traversal via Artwork Upload
    *   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate the file paths during artwork uploads to write files to arbitrary locations on the server's file system.
    *   **How Jellyfin Contributes:** Jellyfin's functionality for users to upload custom artwork for their media libraries, if not implemented with proper path validation, allows for this type of attack. The direct handling of user-provided filenames or paths without sufficient checks is the key contribution.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads an artwork file through the Jellyfin interface with a filename crafted as `../../../var/www/jellyfin/themes/my_malicious_theme.css`, potentially overwriting legitimate theme files with malicious content or placing executable scripts in accessible web directories.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary file write on the server, potentially leading to remote code execution by overwriting critical files or placing malicious scripts in web-accessible locations. This can also lead to data corruption or service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict validation and sanitization of uploaded file paths. Store uploaded files in a dedicated, isolated directory with restricted execution permissions. Avoid directly using user-provided filenames; instead, generate unique and sanitized filenames.
        *   **Users:** Be extremely cautious about who has permission to upload artwork to the server. Regularly review file system permissions for the artwork upload directory.
