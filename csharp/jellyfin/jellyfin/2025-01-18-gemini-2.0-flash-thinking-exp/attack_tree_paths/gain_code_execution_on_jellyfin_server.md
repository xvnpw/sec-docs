### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Gain Code Execution on Jellyfin Server

Achieving code execution on the Jellyfin server is a critical compromise, allowing an attacker to perform a wide range of malicious activities. Here's a breakdown of potential attack vectors:

**4.1 Vulnerabilities in Jellyfin Code:**

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Description:**  Direct vulnerabilities in the Jellyfin codebase that allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely. These are often critical severity issues.
    * **Examples:**
        * **Unsafe Deserialization:** If Jellyfin deserializes untrusted data without proper validation, an attacker could craft malicious serialized objects that execute code upon deserialization.
        * **Input Validation Failures leading to Command Injection:**  If user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being used in system commands (e.g., using `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`), an attacker could inject malicious commands.
        * **Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities:**  Bugs like buffer overflows or use-after-free could be exploited to overwrite memory and gain control of execution flow.
    * **Impact:** Complete control over the server, data breaches, malware installation, pivoting to other systems.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Secure Coding Practices:** Implement robust input validation, output encoding, and avoid unsafe functions.
        * **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
        * **Static and Dynamic Analysis:** Utilize tools to automatically detect potential code flaws.
        * **Dependency Updates:** Keep all dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.

* **Injection Attacks:**
    * **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities where user-supplied data is incorporated into queries or commands without proper sanitization.
    * **Examples:**
        * **SQL Injection:**  If Jellyfin interacts with a database and doesn't properly sanitize user input used in SQL queries, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code to execute arbitrary commands on the database server, potentially leading to code execution on the Jellyfin server if the database server allows it (e.g., using `xp_cmdshell` in SQL Server).
        * **Template Injection:** If Jellyfin uses a templating engine and doesn't properly sanitize user input used in templates, an attacker could inject malicious template code that executes arbitrary code on the server.
        * **Operating System (OS) Command Injection:** As mentioned above, improper handling of user input in system commands.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, potential for code execution depending on the context and permissions.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:**  Use parameterized queries for database interactions to prevent SQL injection.
        * **Secure Templating Practices:**  Use auto-escaping features of templating engines and avoid allowing user-controlled template code.
        * **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-supplied input.

* **File Upload Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the file upload functionality of Jellyfin.
    * **Examples:**
        * **Unrestricted File Upload:** Allowing users to upload arbitrary file types without proper validation. An attacker could upload a malicious executable (e.g., a web shell like PHP or JSP) and then access it through the web server to execute code.
        * **Path Traversal:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities to upload files to arbitrary locations on the server, potentially overwriting critical system files or placing malicious executables in accessible directories.
    * **Impact:** Code execution, data breaches, server compromise.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Restrict File Types:**  Only allow necessary file types for upload.
        * **Input Validation:**  Validate file names and content.
        * **Secure File Storage:**  Store uploaded files outside the webroot or in locations with restricted execution permissions.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement CSP to restrict the sources from which the server can load resources.

**4.2 Exploiting Dependencies:**

* **Description:**  Leveraging known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies used by Jellyfin.
* **Examples:**
    * **Vulnerable Libraries:**  If Jellyfin uses a library with a known RCE vulnerability, an attacker could exploit that vulnerability through Jellyfin's usage of the library.
    * **Outdated Dependencies:**  Failing to update dependencies can leave Jellyfin vulnerable to publicly known exploits.
* **Impact:**  Code execution, depending on the severity and nature of the vulnerability in the dependency.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):**  Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    * **Dependency Management:**  Use dependency management tools to track and update dependencies.
    * **Automated Vulnerability Scanning:**  Integrate vulnerability scanning into the CI/CD pipeline.

**4.3 Configuration Issues:**

* **Description:**  Exploiting misconfigurations in the Jellyfin server setup.
* **Examples:**
    * **Insecure Permissions:**  If the Jellyfin server process runs with excessive privileges, a successful exploit could grant the attacker broader access to the system.
    * **Exposed Internal Services:**  If internal services or debugging endpoints are exposed without proper authentication, they could be exploited to gain code execution.
    * **Default Credentials:**  Using default credentials for administrative accounts or database connections.
    * **Insecure Plugin Management:** If plugins are not properly sandboxed or validated, a malicious plugin could be installed to execute code.
* **Impact:**  Code execution, privilege escalation, server compromise.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run the Jellyfin server process with the minimum necessary privileges.
    * **Secure Configuration Management:**  Implement secure configuration practices and regularly review settings.
    * **Strong Authentication and Authorization:**  Enforce strong passwords and multi-factor authentication.
    * **Plugin Security:**  Implement robust plugin validation and sandboxing mechanisms.

**4.4 Network-Based Attacks:**

* **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in network protocols or services used by Jellyfin.
* **Examples:**
    * **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Underlying Web Server:** If Jellyfin relies on a web server (e.g., Kestrel) with known vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit those vulnerabilities to gain code execution.
    * **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Less Direct):** While not directly leading to code execution on the server, a successful MitM attack could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious code or manipulate requests to trigger vulnerabilities that lead to code execution.
* **Impact:**  Code execution, data interception, server compromise.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Keep Underlying Infrastructure Updated:**  Ensure the web server and other network components are up-to-date with security patches.
    * **Enforce HTTPS:**  Use HTTPS to encrypt communication and prevent MitM attacks.
    * **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the Jellyfin server within a secure network segment.

**4.5 Exploiting Authentication/Authorization Flaws:**

* **Description:**  Circumventing authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access and potentially leverage other vulnerabilities for code execution.
* **Examples:**
    * **Authentication Bypass:**  Exploiting flaws in the authentication process to gain access without valid credentials.
    * **Authorization Bypass:**  Exploiting flaws to access functionalities or resources that should be restricted.
    * **Session Hijacking:**  Stealing or hijacking valid user sessions to perform actions with their privileges.
* **Impact:**  Unauthorized access, data breaches, potential for further exploitation leading to code execution.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Secure Authentication Mechanisms:**  Implement robust authentication methods and avoid common vulnerabilities like credential stuffing.
    * **Proper Authorization Checks:**  Enforce strict authorization checks before granting access to sensitive functionalities.
    * **Secure Session Management:**  Implement secure session handling practices to prevent session hijacking.
