    * Modifying library paths to point to attacker-controlled network shares containing malware.

**Stage 2: Install Malicious Plugins**

* **Description:**  Leveraging the plugin functionality of Jellyfin, the attacker installs plugins containing malicious code. This is a powerful method for gaining persistent control and extending their reach.
* **Technical Details:**
    * **Plugin Installation Methods:**
        * **Direct Upload:**  Jellyfin might allow administrators to upload plugin files directly through the web interface.
        * **Plugin Repositories (if configurable):**  If Jellyfin supports custom plugin repositories, the attacker could add a malicious repository or compromise an existing one.
    * **Malicious Plugin Capabilities:**  Malicious plugins can have a wide range of capabilities, including:
        * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Executing arbitrary commands on the server hosting Jellyfin.
        * **Data Exfiltration:**  Stealing sensitive data stored within Jellyfin or on the underlying system.
        * **Backdoor Creation:**  Establishing persistent access mechanisms for future exploitation.
        * **Lateral Movement:**  Using the compromised Jellyfin instance as a pivot point to attack other systems on the network.
        * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Overloading the server resources or disrupting Jellyfin's functionality.
        * **Credential Harvesting:**  Stealing user credentials used to access Jellyfin or other connected services.
        * **Manipulation of Media Content:**  Modifying or replacing media files.
        * **Interception of User Activity:**  Monitoring user interactions with the Jellyfin application.
* **Impact:**
    * **Complete System Compromise:**  RCE vulnerabilities in malicious plugins can grant the attacker full control over the server.
    * **Data Breach:**  Sensitive user data, media content, or configuration information can be stolen.
    * **Loss of Availability:**  Malicious plugins can crash the Jellyfin service or consume excessive resources.
    * **Reputational Damage:**  If the compromised Jellyfin instance is publicly accessible, it can damage the reputation of the organization hosting it.
    * **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:**  Data breaches can lead to legal and regulatory penalties.
* **Example Scenarios:**
    * A plugin that installs a web shell, allowing the attacker to execute commands remotely.
    * A plugin that intercepts user login credentials and sends them to an attacker-controlled server.
    * A plugin that modifies media files to include malicious scripts that execute on client devices.

**Stage 3: etc. (Further Actions)**

The "etc." in the attack path signifies that the attacker's actions don't stop at installing malicious plugins. With a foothold established, they can perform various further malicious activities, including:

* **Data Exfiltration:**  Stealing media files, user data, and configuration information.
* **Lateral Movement:**  Using the compromised Jellyfin server as a stepping stone to attack other systems on the network.
* **Persistence Maintenance:**  Ensuring continued access even if the initial entry point is closed. This could involve creating new user accounts, installing backdoors, or modifying system configurations.
* **Covering Tracks:**  Deleting logs, modifying timestamps, or disabling security features to evade detection.
* **Launching Further Attacks:**  Using the compromised server to launch attacks against other targets, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.
* **Cryptojacking:**  Using the server's resources to mine cryptocurrency.

**Overall Implications:**

This attack path highlights the critical importance of securing administrative access to Jellyfin. Once an attacker gains this level of privilege, they have significant control over the application and the underlying system.
