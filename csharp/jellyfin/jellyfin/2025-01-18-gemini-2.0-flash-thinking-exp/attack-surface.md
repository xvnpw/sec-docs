# Attack Surface Analysis for jellyfin/jellyfin

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through User-Provided Metadata](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_user-provided_metadata.md)

**Description:**  Malicious scripts can be injected into metadata fields (like movie titles, descriptions, actor names) and executed in the browsers of other users viewing that content.

**How Jellyfin Contributes:** Jellyfin allows users to edit and contribute metadata, and if this input is not properly sanitized before being rendered in the web interface, it creates an opportunity for XSS.

**Example:** A user adds a movie with a title containing `<script>alert("XSS");</script>`. When another user views this movie, the script executes in their browser.

**Impact:**  Can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, and defacement of the Jellyfin interface for other users.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all user-provided data, especially metadata fields, before rendering it in the web interface. Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to further restrict the execution of scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Media Processing Vulnerabilities Leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_surfaces/media_processing_vulnerabilities_leading_to_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

**Description:**  Specially crafted media files can exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying media processing libraries (codecs, demuxers) used by Jellyfin, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**How Jellyfin Contributes:** Jellyfin relies on external libraries for decoding and processing various media formats. If these libraries have vulnerabilities, uploading and processing malicious media files can trigger them.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted MKV file that exploits a buffer overflow in a video codec used by Jellyfin, allowing them to execute commands on the server.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Jellyfin server, potentially leading to data breaches, system takeover, and further attacks on the network.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Regularly update all third-party media processing libraries to their latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. Implement sandboxing or containerization for media processing tasks to limit the impact of potential exploits. Perform fuzzing and security testing on media processing components.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Flaws](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_flaws.md)

**Description:** Weaknesses in how Jellyfin authenticates and authorizes access to its API endpoints can allow unauthorized users to access sensitive data or perform actions they shouldn't.

**How Jellyfin Contributes:** Jellyfin exposes a comprehensive API for managing media, users, and server settings. Flaws in the design or implementation of authentication and authorization mechanisms for these endpoints can be exploited.

**Example:** An API endpoint for deleting users lacks proper authorization checks, allowing any authenticated user to delete other users' accounts. Or, a weak API key generation process makes it easy to guess valid keys.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to user data, modification of server settings, denial of service, and potential privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement strong and secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0). Enforce the principle of least privilege for API access. Implement robust authorization checks for all API endpoints. Regularly audit API access controls. Avoid exposing sensitive information in API responses unnecessarily.
