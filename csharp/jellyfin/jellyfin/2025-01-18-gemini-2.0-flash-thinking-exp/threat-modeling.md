# Threat Model Analysis for jellyfin/jellyfin

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Media Files](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_media_files.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities within Jellyfin's authentication or authorization modules to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access to media files stored and managed by Jellyfin. This could involve exploiting flaws in session management, permission checks, or authentication mechanisms within Jellyfin's codebase.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive or proprietary content, potential copyright infringement.
*   **Affected Component:** Authentication module, Authorization module, File serving component.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Jellyfin to the latest version to patch known authentication and authorization vulnerabilities.
    *   Thoroughly review and test any custom authentication or authorization implementations within Jellyfin.
    *   Enforce strong password policies for Jellyfin user accounts.
    *   Consider enabling and enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) if supported by the Jellyfin deployment.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Jellyfin Plugins](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_jellyfin_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers target vulnerabilities present in third-party plugins developed for Jellyfin. These vulnerabilities can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the Jellyfin server, gain unauthorized access to data, or disrupt service. The risk stems directly from the plugin's code and its interaction with the Jellyfin core.
*   **Impact:** Server compromise, data breach, potential for further attacks on the underlying system.
*   **Affected Component:** Plugin system, individual plugins.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only install plugins from trusted and reputable sources.
    *   Keep all installed plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Regularly review the list of installed plugins and remove any that are no longer needed or actively maintained.
    *   Monitor plugin activity for suspicious behavior if logging is available.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) through Jellyfin Features](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__through_jellyfin_features.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in Jellyfin features that handle external requests, such as fetching metadata or artwork. By manipulating input parameters, they can force the Jellyfin server to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources, potentially exposing internal network information or interacting with unintended services. This vulnerability resides within Jellyfin's code responsible for handling these external requests.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of internal network information, potential for further attacks on internal systems.
*   **Affected Component:** Metadata fetching modules, Artwork downloading modules.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Jellyfin to patch known SSRF vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for URLs used in metadata fetching and artwork downloading within Jellyfin's codebase.
    *   Use a whitelist approach for allowed external domains if feasible within the Jellyfin configuration or code.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Maliciously Crafted Media Files](./threats/denial_of_service_through_maliciously_crafted_media_files.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers upload or introduce specially crafted media files that exploit vulnerabilities in Jellyfin's media processing or playback components. These malicious files can cause the Jellyfin server to crash, become unresponsive, or consume excessive resources due to flaws in Jellyfin's media handling logic.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, server instability.
*   **Affected Component:** Media processing modules, Playback engine.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Jellyfin to patch known vulnerabilities in media processing components.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for uploaded media files within Jellyfin.
    *   Use secure and well-tested media processing libraries within the Jellyfin project.
    *   Limit the size and type of media files that can be uploaded if applicable.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) through Jellyfin Vulnerabilities](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__through_jellyfin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit critical vulnerabilities within Jellyfin's codebase to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could be achieved through various attack vectors, such as exploiting flaws in input validation, deserialization, or memory management within Jellyfin's core components or plugins.
*   **Impact:** Complete server compromise, full control over the Jellyfin instance and potentially the underlying system, data breach, service disruption.
*   **Affected Component:** Various core components depending on the specific vulnerability (e.g., input handling, deserialization libraries, media processing).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Immediately apply security updates and patches released by the Jellyfin project.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization throughout the Jellyfin codebase.
    *   Follow secure coding practices to minimize the risk of introducing vulnerabilities.
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the Jellyfin codebase.
    *   Consider using security tools like static and dynamic analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities.
