### Security Implications of Key Components:

*   **Web Browser, Mobile App, Desktop App (Clients):**
    *   **Security Implication:** Vulnerability to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if the server does not properly sanitize data displayed in the clients. Malicious scripts could steal user credentials or perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Security Implication:** Insecure storage of authentication tokens or session data on the client device could lead to unauthorized access if the device is compromised.
    *   **Security Implication:**  Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks if communication between the client and server is not properly secured with HTTPS.
    *   **Security Implication:**  Vulnerabilities in the client applications themselves could be exploited to gain access to the device or the Jellyfin server.

*   **Reverse Proxy (nginx/Caddy):**
    *   **Security Implication:** Misconfiguration of the reverse proxy could expose the internal Kestrel web server directly to the internet, bypassing security measures.
    *   **Security Implication:** Vulnerabilities in the reverse proxy software itself could be exploited.
    *   **Security Implication:** Improper handling of HTTP headers could lead to security vulnerabilities like HTTP Response Splitting.
    *   **Security Implication:** Lack of proper rate limiting at the reverse proxy level could allow for Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.

*   **Kestrel Web Server:**
    *   **Security Implication:** While Kestrel is designed to be secure, vulnerabilities in its implementation could be exploited. It's crucial to keep it updated.
    *   **Security Implication:**  Without a reverse proxy, Kestrel is directly exposed to the internet, increasing the attack surface.

*   **API Endpoints (.NET Core):**
    *   **Security Implication:**  Vulnerability to injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection) if user input is not properly validated and sanitized before being used in database queries or system commands.
    *   **Security Implication:**  Insufficient authorization checks in API endpoints could allow users to access or modify resources they are not permitted to.
    *   **Security Implication:**  Exposure of sensitive information through API responses if not carefully designed.
    *   **Security Implication:**  Vulnerability to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks if proper anti-CSRF tokens are not implemented.

*   **Authentication & Authorization Service:**
    *   **Security Implication:** Weak password hashing algorithms could make user credentials vulnerable to cracking.
    *   **Security Implication:**  Lack of account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts could allow for brute-force attacks.
    *   **Security Implication:**  Insecure session management could lead to session hijacking.
    *   **Security Implication:**  Insufficient role-based access control could lead to privilege escalation.

*   **Media Library Manager Service:**
    *   **Security Implication:**  Path traversal vulnerabilities if user-provided paths are not properly validated, potentially allowing access to arbitrary files on the server.
    *   **Security Implication:**  Exposure of sensitive file system information through API responses.
    *   **Security Implication:**  Potential for DoS attacks if the media library scanning process is resource-intensive and can be triggered by unauthenticated users.

*   **Transcoding Engine (ffmpeg wrapper):**
    *   **Security Implication:**  Vulnerabilities in the underlying `ffmpeg` library could be exploited by processing specially crafted media files.
    *   **Security Implication:**  Resource exhaustion if transcoding processes are not properly managed, potentially leading to DoS.
    *   **Security Implication:**  Command injection vulnerabilities if user-provided data is used to construct `ffmpeg` commands without proper sanitization.

*   **Database (SQLite/PostgreSQL/MySQL):**
    *   **Security Implication:**  SQL injection vulnerabilities if parameterized queries or ORM features are not used correctly in the API endpoints.
    *   **Security Implication:**  Exposure of sensitive data if the database is not properly secured (e.g., strong passwords, restricted access).
    *   **Security Implication:**  Data breaches if the database is compromised due to vulnerabilities in the database software itself.

*   **Plugin Subsystem & Isolated Plugin Processes:**
    *   **Security Implication:**  Malicious plugins could be installed and compromise the server if there is no proper vetting or sandboxing.
    *   **Security Implication:**  Vulnerabilities in plugins could be exploited to gain access to the server or user data.
    *   **Security Implication:**  Plugins might request excessive permissions, potentially leading to security risks.
    *   **Security Implication:**  Communication channels between the core server and plugins need to be secure to prevent tampering.

*   **Metadata Providers (Scrapers):**
    *   **Security Implication:**  Metadata providers could be compromised and inject malicious data into the Jellyfin database.
    *   **Security Implication:**  Fetching metadata over insecure connections (HTTP) could lead to MITM attacks and data manipulation.

*   **Cache (Memory/Redis):**
    *   **Security Implication:**  If the cache stores sensitive data (e.g., session tokens), it needs to be properly secured to prevent unauthorized access.
    *   **Security Implication:**  Vulnerabilities in the caching software itself could be exploited.

*   **Media Storage (Local File System/Network Share):**
    *   **Security Implication:**  Incorrect file system permissions could allow unauthorized users or processes to access media files.
    *   **Security Implication:**  Network shares might have their own security vulnerabilities if not properly configured.

### Actionable and Tailored Mitigation Strategies:

Based on the identified threats, here are specific mitigation strategies for the Jellyfin project:

*   **Client-Side Security:**
    *   Implement robust output encoding on the server-side to prevent XSS attacks. Utilize context-aware encoding based on where the data is being displayed.
    *   Recommend secure storage practices for authentication tokens in client applications (e.g., using platform-specific secure storage mechanisms).
    *   Enforce HTTPS for all communication between clients and the server. Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers on the server to instruct browsers to always use HTTPS.
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of client applications.

*   **Reverse Proxy Security:**
    *   Follow security hardening guidelines for the chosen reverse proxy (nginx or Caddy). Regularly update the software to the latest stable version.
    *   Configure the reverse proxy to only forward requests to the Kestrel server on specific, necessary ports.
    *   Implement rate limiting at the reverse proxy level to mitigate DoS attacks.
    *   Carefully configure HTTP header handling to prevent vulnerabilities like HTTP Response Splitting.

*   **API Endpoint Security:**
    *   Implement robust input validation on all API endpoints. Sanitize and validate all user-provided data before processing. Use allow-lists rather than deny-lists for input validation.
    *   Enforce proper authorization checks for all API endpoints based on user roles and permissions. Utilize a well-defined authorization framework.
    *   Avoid exposing sensitive information in API responses. Only return the necessary data.
    *   Implement anti-CSRF tokens for all state-changing API requests.

*   **Authentication and Authorization Security:**
    *   Use strong and well-vetted password hashing algorithms like Argon2id.
    *   Implement account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts. Consider using CAPTCHA to prevent automated brute-force attacks.
    *   Utilize secure session management techniques. Set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on session cookies. Implement session invalidation on logout and after a period of inactivity. Consider using short-lived session tokens.
    *   Implement a granular role-based access control (RBAC) system to manage user permissions effectively.

*   **Media Library Manager Security:**
    *   Implement strict validation of user-provided file paths to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities. Use canonicalization techniques to resolve relative paths.
    *   Avoid exposing raw file system paths in API responses.
    *   Implement rate limiting or authentication requirements for triggering media library scans to prevent DoS attacks.

*   **Transcoding Engine Security:**
    *   Keep the `ffmpeg` library updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement resource limits for transcoding processes to prevent resource exhaustion.
    *   Avoid constructing `ffmpeg` commands directly from user input. If necessary, use a safe command construction library and rigorously sanitize input. Consider running the transcoding process in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges.

*   **Database Security:**
    *   Always use parameterized queries or an ORM with proper escaping to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Secure the database server with strong passwords and restrict access to only authorized users and the Jellyfin server.
    *   Consider encrypting sensitive data at rest in the database.

*   **Plugin Subsystem Security:**
    *   Implement a secure plugin installation process. Consider requiring code signing for plugins.
    *   Develop a robust permission system for plugins, allowing users to control what resources and data plugins can access.
    *   Run plugins in isolated processes with limited privileges using techniques like sandboxing or containerization.
    *   Establish a mechanism for users to report potentially malicious or vulnerable plugins. Implement a process for reviewing and potentially disabling plugins.

*   **Metadata Provider Security:**
    *   Prefer metadata providers that use HTTPS.
    *   Implement checks to validate the integrity of metadata received from external providers.
    *   Consider allowing users to select trusted metadata providers.

*   **Cache Security:**
    *   If the cache stores sensitive data, ensure it is properly secured. For Redis, this might involve setting a strong password and restricting network access.
    *   Keep the caching software updated to the latest stable version.

*   **Media Storage Security:**
    *   Configure file system permissions on the media storage to restrict access to only the Jellyfin server process.
    *   For network shares, ensure they are properly secured with strong authentication and access controls. Consider using encrypted network protocols.
