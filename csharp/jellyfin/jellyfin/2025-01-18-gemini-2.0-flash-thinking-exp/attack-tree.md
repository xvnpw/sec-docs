## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Media Processing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_media_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Upload Malicious Media File:** An attacker crafts or modifies a media file (video, audio, image) to contain malicious data that exploits vulnerabilities in Jellyfin's media parsing and decoding libraries.
    *   This can trigger buffer overflows, memory corruption, or other errors leading to arbitrary code execution on the Jellyfin server.
*   **Exploit Transcoding Vulnerabilities:** An attacker provides specific media files designed to trigger vulnerabilities during the transcoding process.
    *   This can exploit weaknesses in transcoding libraries (like FFmpeg) leading to buffer overflows, resource exhaustion, or arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit API Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Inject Malicious Payloads (e.g., Command Injection, Server-Side Request Forgery):** An attacker exploits insufficient input validation in the Jellyfin API.
    *   By injecting malicious commands or URLs into API requests, they can trick the Jellyfin server into executing arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system or making requests to unintended internal or external resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Plugin/Extension Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_pluginextension_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Install Malicious Plugin:** An attacker, potentially through social engineering or by compromising an administrator account, installs a malicious plugin into Jellyfin.
    *   This plugin contains malicious code designed to execute within the Jellyfin context, granting the attacker control over the server and access to data.
*   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Existing Plugins:** An attacker identifies and exploits known or zero-day vulnerabilities within already installed Jellyfin plugins.
    *   These vulnerabilities can allow for arbitrary code execution, data access, or other malicious actions within the scope of the vulnerable plugin.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Database Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_database_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in Jellyfin Database Queries:** An attacker leverages insufficient input sanitization when constructing SQL queries within Jellyfin's codebase.
    *   By injecting malicious SQL code into input fields, they can manipulate the database queries to bypass security checks, gain unauthorized access to data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server (depending on database permissions).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default/Weak Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_defaultweak_credentials.md)

*   **Access Jellyfin Admin Panel with Default Credentials:** An attacker attempts to log in to the Jellyfin administrative interface using default or easily guessable credentials that have not been changed by the administrator.
    *   Successful login grants full administrative control over the Jellyfin server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Jellyfin Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_jellyfin_vulnerabilities.md)

This represents the overarching goal of targeting weaknesses within the Jellyfin software itself, encompassing all the specific vulnerability types listed below.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Vulnerability in Media Parser/Decoder](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_vulnerability_in_media_parserdecoder.md)

This is the point where a malicious media file is processed by Jellyfin, and a flaw in the parsing or decoding logic is triggered, leading to an exploitable condition.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Code Execution on Jellyfin Server](./attack_tree_paths/gain_code_execution_on_jellyfin_server.md)

This is a critical milestone where the attacker successfully executes arbitrary code on the Jellyfin server. This grants them significant control over the system and allows for further malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Vulnerability during Transcoding Process](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_vulnerability_during_transcoding_process.md)

This is the point where a specific media file or transcoding request triggers a flaw in the transcoding engine, leading to an exploitable condition.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities in Jellyfin API](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_validation_vulnerabilities_in_jellyfin_api.md)

This highlights the critical importance of properly validating and sanitizing all input received by the Jellyfin API to prevent various injection attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Malicious Code within Jellyfin Context](./attack_tree_paths/execute_malicious_code_within_jellyfin_context.md)

This signifies the successful execution of malicious code injected through a plugin, granting the attacker control within the Jellyfin environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Plugin Weakness for Code Execution or Data Access](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_plugin_weakness_for_code_execution_or_data_access.md)

This emphasizes the risk associated with vulnerabilities in plugins, which can be exploited to gain control or access sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Settings, Install Malicious Plugins, etc.](./attack_tree_paths/modify_settings__install_malicious_plugins__etc.md)

This represents the actions an attacker can take after gaining administrative access to Jellyfin, allowing them to further compromise the system and the application it supports.
