## Deep Analysis: Unauthenticated API Endpoints in Jellyfin

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Unauthenticated API Endpoints" attack surface in Jellyfin, a free software media system. It outlines the objective, scope, and methodology of this analysis, followed by a detailed examination of the attack surface itself, potential vulnerabilities, and recommended mitigation strategies.

### 1. Define Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   **Thoroughly investigate the risk** posed by unauthenticated API endpoints within Jellyfin.
*   **Identify potential vulnerabilities** arising from insufficient or missing authentication on API endpoints.
*   **Understand the potential impact** of successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities.
*   **Provide actionable recommendations** for both Jellyfin developers and users to mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the security posture of the application.
*   **Raise awareness** within the Jellyfin community about the importance of API security and proper authentication practices.

Ultimately, this analysis aims to contribute to a more secure Jellyfin ecosystem by highlighting and addressing a critical attack surface.

### 2. Scope

This analysis is specifically scoped to focus on:

*   **Jellyfin Server API Endpoints:** We will examine the API endpoints exposed by the Jellyfin server application. This includes endpoints used for web UI communication, mobile applications, plugin interactions, and potentially internal server functionalities.
*   **Authentication Mechanisms (or Lack Thereof):** The core focus is on identifying API endpoints that are intended to be protected by authentication but are either:
    *   **Unintentionally unauthenticated:** Due to developer oversight, misconfiguration, or incomplete implementation.
    *   **Intentionally unauthenticated but expose sensitive information or actions:**  Endpoints designed for public access that might inadvertently reveal sensitive data or allow unauthorized operations.
*   **Local and Remote Network Access:** We will consider the implications of unauthenticated endpoints for both local network users and remote users accessing the Jellyfin server over the internet.
*   **Impact Assessment:**  The analysis will assess the potential impact of exploiting unauthenticated endpoints, ranging from information disclosure to complete server compromise.

**Out of Scope:**

*   **Authenticated API Endpoints:**  Vulnerabilities within authenticated API endpoints (e.g., authorization flaws, injection attacks within authenticated calls) are outside the scope of this specific analysis.
*   **Web UI Vulnerabilities:**  Cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and other web UI specific vulnerabilities are not the primary focus here, unless they directly relate to unauthenticated API calls.
*   **Operating System or Network Level Security:**  While network segmentation is mentioned as a mitigation, the analysis will not deeply delve into OS hardening or network security configurations beyond their direct relevance to API access control.
*   **Specific Plugin Vulnerabilities:**  This analysis focuses on core Jellyfin API endpoints. Plugin-specific API vulnerabilities are not explicitly covered unless they highlight general API security principles relevant to the core application.

### 3. Methodology

To conduct this deep analysis, we will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Documentation Review:**
    *   **Public API Documentation (if available):**  Examine any publicly available Jellyfin API documentation to understand the intended purpose of different endpoints and their expected authentication requirements.
    *   **Jellyfin Source Code Analysis (Limited):** While full source code review might be extensive, we will perform a limited review of relevant code sections (e.g., API routing, authentication middleware) on the [Jellyfin GitHub repository](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin) to understand the authentication implementation. We will focus on areas related to API endpoint definitions and authentication checks.
    *   **Community Forums and Issue Trackers:** Review Jellyfin community forums, issue trackers, and security advisories to identify any previously reported issues or discussions related to unauthenticated API access.

2.  **Threat Modeling:**
    *   **Identify API Endpoints:**  Based on documentation, code review, and understanding of Jellyfin's functionality, create a list of potential API endpoints.
    *   **Categorize Endpoints by Sensitivity:** Classify endpoints based on the sensitivity of the data they handle or the actions they perform (e.g., low, medium, high sensitivity).
    *   **Identify Potential Unauthenticated Access Points:**  Analyze the API endpoint list and identify endpoints that *should* be authenticated but might be vulnerable to unauthenticated access due to design flaws or implementation errors.
    *   **Develop Attack Scenarios:**  For each identified potential unauthenticated endpoint, develop realistic attack scenarios outlining how an attacker could exploit it and the potential consequences.

3.  **Simulated Penetration Testing (Conceptual):**
    *   **Endpoint Discovery Techniques:**  Consider methods an attacker might use to discover API endpoints (e.g., web crawling, API fuzzing, reverse engineering client applications).
    *   **Authentication Bypass Attempts:**  Hypothesize and document potential authentication bypass techniques that could be attempted on identified endpoints (e.g., missing authentication headers, predictable endpoint structures, insecure default configurations).
    *   **Impact Assessment for Each Scenario:**  For each successful simulated exploit, detail the potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Jellyfin server and user data.

4.  **Best Practices Comparison:**
    *   **OWASP API Security Top 10:**  Compare Jellyfin's API security practices against the OWASP API Security Top 10 list to identify potential areas of weakness.
    *   **General Secure API Design Principles:**  Evaluate Jellyfin's API design against established secure API design principles, such as least privilege, input validation, and secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.

5.  **Mitigation Strategy Formulation:**
    *   **Developer-Focused Mitigations:**  Based on the analysis, refine and expand upon the developer-focused mitigation strategies provided in the initial attack surface description.
    *   **User-Focused Mitigations:**  Elaborate on user-side mitigation strategies to empower users to enhance the security of their Jellyfin installations.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Unauthenticated API Endpoints

Based on the methodology outlined above, we can delve into a deeper analysis of the "Unauthenticated API Endpoints" attack surface in Jellyfin.

#### 4.1. Potential Unauthenticated API Endpoint Categories and Risks

We can categorize potential unauthenticated API endpoints in Jellyfin based on their functionality and associated risks:

*   **Server Status and Information Endpoints:**
    *   **Description:** Endpoints that provide information about the Jellyfin server itself, such as version, system resources, installed plugins, network configuration, and potentially user statistics.
    *   **Potential Risk (Low to Medium):** While seemingly innocuous, exposing server information without authentication can aid attackers in reconnaissance. Version information can reveal known vulnerabilities in specific Jellyfin versions. System resource data might leak information about the server environment. User statistics, even anonymized, could be sensitive in certain contexts.
    *   **Example Endpoints (Hypothetical):** `/System/Info`, `/Server/Status`, `/Plugins/List`, `/Network/Configuration`

*   **Library Management Endpoints (Read-Only):**
    *   **Description:** Endpoints that allow retrieval of library metadata, such as lists of movies, TV shows, music, and their associated details (titles, descriptions, artwork, etc.).
    *   **Potential Risk (Medium):**  Exposing library metadata without authentication can reveal a user's media collection, which might be considered private information. In some cases, metadata might contain sensitive details or preferences.
    *   **Example Endpoints (Hypothetical):** `/Library/Movies`, `/Library/TVShows`, `/Library/Music`, `/Items/Latest`

*   **User Management Endpoints (Read-Only or Limited Actions):**
    *   **Description:** Endpoints that might allow listing users, retrieving user profiles (potentially limited information), or performing actions like password reset requests (if poorly implemented).
    *   **Potential Risk (Medium to High):**  Listing usernames can be a starting point for brute-force attacks.  Retrieving user profiles, even with limited information, can aid in social engineering or targeted attacks.  Insecure password reset mechanisms could be abused.
    *   **Example Endpoints (Hypothetical):** `/Users/List`, `/Users/{UserID}/Profile`, `/Users/ForgotPassword`

*   **Configuration and Settings Endpoints (Read-Only or Write-Enabled):**
    *   **Description:** Endpoints that expose server configuration settings or allow modification of these settings.
    *   **Potential Risk (High to Critical):**  **This is the most critical category.** Read-only access to configuration settings can reveal sensitive information like database connection strings, API keys (if any are stored in configuration), or internal network details. **Write-enabled unauthenticated access to configuration endpoints is catastrophic**, allowing attackers to:
        *   Modify server behavior.
        *   Disable security features.
        *   Add administrative users.
        *   Change access control policies.
        *   Potentially gain remote code execution depending on the configuration options.
    *   **Example Endpoints (Hypothetical):** `/Configuration/Get`, `/Configuration/Update`, `/Security/Settings`, `/Users/Admin/Create`

*   **Playback Control Endpoints (Potentially Unintended):**
    *   **Description:** Endpoints intended for controlling media playback, which might inadvertently be accessible without authentication.
    *   **Potential Risk (Low to Medium):**  While less critical than configuration changes, unauthenticated playback control could be used for denial-of-service (disrupting media streaming) or potentially for unauthorized access to media content if the endpoint also leaks media URLs.
    *   **Example Endpoints (Hypothetical):** `/Playback/Start`, `/Playback/Stop`, `/Playback/Stream`

#### 4.2. Exploitation Scenarios

Let's illustrate potential exploitation scenarios for some of the high-risk categories:

*   **Scenario 1: Unauthenticated Configuration Update Endpoint (`/Configuration/Update`)**
    1.  **Discovery:** An attacker scans for open ports on a Jellyfin server and identifies the web server port. They then use web crawling or API fuzzing techniques to discover the `/Configuration/Update` endpoint.
    2.  **Exploitation:** The attacker sends a POST request to `/Configuration/Update` with a crafted JSON payload to:
        *   Create a new administrative user with a known password.
        *   Disable authentication requirements entirely.
        *   Modify the server's base URL to redirect users to a phishing site.
    3.  **Impact:** The attacker gains full administrative control of the Jellyfin server. They can access all media, user data, and potentially pivot to other systems on the network if the Jellyfin server is compromised further.

*   **Scenario 2: Unauthenticated Admin User Creation Endpoint (`/Users/Admin/Create`)**
    1.  **Discovery:** Similar to Scenario 1, the attacker discovers the `/Users/Admin/Create` endpoint.
    2.  **Exploitation:** The attacker sends a POST request to `/Users/Admin/Create` with parameters to create a new administrative user account (username, password, email).
    3.  **Impact:** The attacker creates a backdoor administrative account, allowing them to log in to the Jellyfin web UI or use the API with administrative privileges, leading to the same consequences as Scenario 1.

*   **Scenario 3: Unauthenticated Server Information Endpoint (`/System/Info`)**
    1.  **Discovery:** The attacker discovers the `/System/Info` endpoint.
    2.  **Exploitation:** The attacker accesses `/System/Info` and retrieves the Jellyfin server version. They then search for known vulnerabilities associated with that specific version.
    3.  **Impact:**  The attacker gains valuable reconnaissance information, potentially leading to the discovery of other vulnerabilities that can be exploited to compromise the server.

#### 4.3. Root Causes of Unauthenticated API Endpoints

The presence of unauthenticated API endpoints can stem from several root causes:

*   **Developer Oversight:**  Forgetting to implement authentication checks on specific endpoints, especially during rapid development or when adding new features.
*   **Inconsistent Authentication Implementation:**  Authentication might be implemented in some parts of the API but not consistently applied across all endpoints.
*   **Incorrect Authentication Middleware Configuration:**  Misconfiguration of authentication middleware or filters might lead to certain endpoints being inadvertently bypassed.
*   **Design Flaws:**  Poor API design where sensitive functionalities are exposed through endpoints that are not intended to be authenticated, or where the authentication model is not well-defined.
*   **Legacy Endpoints:**  Older API endpoints might have been designed without proper authentication in mind and were not retroactively secured.
*   **Internal Communication Endpoints Exposed Externally:** Endpoints intended for internal server communication might be unintentionally exposed to external networks without authentication.
*   **Default Configurations:** Insecure default configurations that might disable authentication on certain endpoints or functionalities.

### 5. Mitigation Strategies (Developers and Users)

As outlined in the initial attack surface description, effective mitigation requires a combined effort from both Jellyfin developers and users.

#### 5.1. Developer-Focused Mitigation Strategies

*   **Mandatory Authentication (Deny by Default):**
    *   **Action:** Implement a robust authentication and authorization framework that is applied to *all* API endpoints by default. Adopt a "deny by default" approach, requiring explicit whitelisting of truly public endpoints (if any are necessary).
    *   **Technical Implementation:** Utilize a centralized authentication middleware or filter that intercepts all API requests and verifies valid authentication credentials before allowing access to endpoint handlers.
    *   **Focus:** Ensure that authentication is not an afterthought but a core design principle of the API.

*   **API Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   **Action:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting API endpoints. This should include automated and manual testing to identify authentication bypass vulnerabilities, authorization flaws, and other API security weaknesses.
    *   **Frequency:** Integrate API security testing into the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), ideally with each release or significant code change.
    *   **Tools:** Utilize API security testing tools and techniques, including fuzzing, static analysis, and dynamic analysis.

*   **Principle of Least Privilege (API Design):**
    *   **Action:** Design API endpoints with the principle of least privilege in mind. Ensure that even authenticated users only have access to the minimum necessary functionalities required for their role.
    *   **Authorization Checks:** Implement granular authorization checks within API endpoints to verify that the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to perform the requested action.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Consider implementing RBAC to manage user permissions and simplify authorization logic.

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Action:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization on *all* API endpoints to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, command injection, etc.) and other input-based vulnerabilities.
    *   **Data Type Validation:** Validate data types, formats, and ranges of all API request parameters.
    *   **Sanitization:** Sanitize user inputs to remove or escape potentially malicious characters before processing them.

*   **Secure API Documentation:**
    *   **Action:** Provide clear and comprehensive API documentation that explicitly outlines authentication requirements for each endpoint.
    *   **Clarity:** Ensure documentation is accurate and up-to-date, reflecting the actual authentication implementation.
    *   **Examples:** Include code examples demonstrating how to authenticate API requests correctly.

#### 5.2. User-Focused Mitigation Strategies

*   **Enable Authentication Settings:**
    *   **Action:**  **Crucially, ensure that "Require authentication for local network access" and "Require authentication for remote network access" are enabled in Jellyfin's server settings.** These settings are the primary user-configurable controls for enforcing authentication.
    *   **Verification:** Double-check these settings after installation and upgrades to ensure they remain enabled.

*   **Network Segmentation (Private Network):**
    *   **Action:**  Isolate the Jellyfin server on a private network segment if possible. This limits direct exposure to the public internet and reduces the attack surface.
    *   **Firewall:** Use a firewall to restrict access to the Jellyfin server from untrusted networks.

*   **Reverse Proxy Access Control:**
    *   **Action:** Utilize a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache, Caddy) in front of the Jellyfin server.
    *   **Authentication at Proxy Level:** Configure the reverse proxy to enforce authentication (e.g., basic authentication, OAuth) *before* requests are forwarded to the Jellyfin server. This adds an extra layer of security and can protect against vulnerabilities in Jellyfin's own authentication implementation.
    *   **Path-Based Access Control:**  Use the reverse proxy to restrict access to specific API paths, further limiting the attack surface exposed to the internet.

*   **Regular Updates and Security Monitoring:**
    *   **Action:** Keep the Jellyfin server updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
    *   **Security Advisories:** Subscribe to Jellyfin security advisories or community channels to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities and recommended updates.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor server logs for suspicious activity or unauthorized access attempts.

### 6. Conclusion

Unauthenticated API endpoints represent a significant attack surface in Jellyfin, potentially leading to severe consequences ranging from information disclosure to complete server compromise.  Addressing this attack surface requires a proactive and multi-faceted approach.

**For Jellyfin Developers:**  Prioritizing API security, implementing mandatory authentication, conducting regular security audits, and adhering to secure API design principles are crucial steps to mitigate this risk.

**For Jellyfin Users:**  Enabling authentication settings, utilizing network segmentation, and employing reverse proxies are essential user-side mitigations to protect their Jellyfin installations.

By working collaboratively and implementing these mitigation strategies, the Jellyfin community can significantly reduce the risk associated with unauthenticated API endpoints and build a more secure and robust media server platform.
