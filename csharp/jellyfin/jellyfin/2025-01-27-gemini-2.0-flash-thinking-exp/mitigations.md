# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for jellyfin/jellyfin

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation for Media Files (Jellyfin Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_for_media_files__jellyfin_specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Jellyfin Media File Input Validation
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Developers (Jellyfin Project):** Integrate a robust media validation library directly into Jellyfin's core media scanning and processing modules. This library should be used by Jellyfin to automatically parse and validate media files during library scans, file uploads, and any media processing stages.
    2.  **Developers (Jellyfin Project):**  Within Jellyfin's code, implement strict checks on file extensions and MIME types when media files are added. Jellyfin should maintain a whitelist of supported and safe media file types and reject files that do not conform.
    3.  **Developers (Jellyfin Project):**  Jellyfin should enforce configurable limits on media file sizes to prevent resource exhaustion attacks. These limits should be adjustable by administrators but have reasonable defaults.
    4.  **Developers (Jellyfin Project):**  Jellyfin's metadata extraction and processing components must sanitize metadata from media files before storing it in the database or using it in any part of the application. This should include escaping special characters and validating data types to prevent injection vulnerabilities within Jellyfin itself.
    5.  **Users (Jellyfin Administrators):**  Utilize Jellyfin's logging and reporting features to monitor for media files that fail validation checks. Regularly review these reports and investigate any suspicious files flagged by Jellyfin.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Media File Upload Exploiting Jellyfin (High Severity):** Attackers can upload crafted media files specifically designed to exploit vulnerabilities within Jellyfin's media processing code, potentially leading to remote code execution or denial of service *of the Jellyfin server*.
    *   **Jellyfin Denial of Service via Malformed Media Files (Medium Severity):** Processing malformed media files can cause Jellyfin's media processing components to crash, hang, or consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service *of the Jellyfin service*.
    *   **Metadata Injection Attacks within Jellyfin (Medium Severity):** Malicious metadata in media files could be used to inject code or commands into Jellyfin's backend systems if Jellyfin's metadata handling is not secure, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions *within Jellyfin*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Malicious Media File Upload Exploiting Jellyfin: High risk reduction. Directly prevents exploitation of Jellyfin's own media processing vulnerabilities through malicious files.
    *   Jellyfin Denial of Service via Malformed Media Files: Medium risk reduction. Reduces the likelihood of Jellyfin service disruptions caused by malformed files.
    *   Metadata Injection Attacks within Jellyfin: Medium risk reduction. Prevents exploitation of Jellyfin's metadata processing for malicious actions against the Jellyfin system itself.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented within Jellyfin. Jellyfin likely performs basic file type detection. Metadata extraction and usage are core features, but the robustness of validation and sanitization against security threats needs further assessment.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Deeper integration of dedicated media validation libraries *within Jellyfin's core*.
    *   More comprehensive metadata sanitization *in Jellyfin's metadata processing modules*.
    *   Automated reporting and logging *within Jellyfin* for media files failing validation.
    *   Clear configuration options *within Jellyfin settings* for administrators to control media validation strictness and file size limits.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Transcoding Practices (Jellyfin Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_transcoding_practices__jellyfin_specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Jellyfin Secure Transcoding Practices
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Developers (Jellyfin Project):**  By default, configure Jellyfin to execute the transcoding process with the lowest possible privileges. Jellyfin's installation and configuration should guide users to set up a dedicated, restricted user account specifically for transcoding.
    2.  **Developers (Jellyfin Project):**  Explore and implement sandboxing technologies *within Jellyfin's architecture* to isolate the transcoding process. Jellyfin could utilize containerization or sandboxing libraries to limit the transcoder's access to the host system.
    3.  **Developers (Jellyfin Project):**  Jellyfin's build and release process should ensure that transcoding libraries (primarily FFmpeg) are regularly updated to the latest versions. Jellyfin should include mechanisms for checking for and notifying users about available FFmpeg updates.
    4.  **Developers (Jellyfin Project):**  Jellyfin should implement built-in resource management for transcoding. This includes configurable limits on CPU, memory, and disk I/O usage for transcoding processes, directly managed within Jellyfin's settings.
    5.  **Developers (Jellyfin Project):**  Jellyfin's documentation and user interface should provide clear guidance on secure transcoding configurations, including recommendations for resource limits and privilege separation.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution via Jellyfin Transcoding Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Vulnerabilities in transcoding libraries used by Jellyfin (like FFmpeg) could be exploited through crafted media files processed by Jellyfin's transcoding feature, leading to remote code execution *on the Jellyfin server*.
    *   **Privilege Escalation via Jellyfin Transcoding Process (Medium Severity):** If Jellyfin's transcoding process runs with unnecessarily elevated privileges, a vulnerability in the transcoder could be exploited to gain higher privileges *within the Jellyfin server environment*.
    *   **Jellyfin Denial of Service via Transcoding Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Attackers could trigger excessive transcoding operations through Jellyfin, consuming server resources and leading to denial of service *of the Jellyfin service* for legitimate users.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution via Jellyfin Transcoding Vulnerabilities: High risk reduction. Reduces the attack surface of Jellyfin's transcoding functionality and limits the impact of vulnerabilities in transcoding libraries *on the Jellyfin system*.
    *   Privilege Escalation via Jellyfin Transcoding Process: Medium risk reduction. Prevents privilege escalation if the transcoder is compromised *within the Jellyfin context*.
    *   Jellyfin Denial of Service via Transcoding Resource Exhaustion: Medium risk reduction. Limits the impact of resource exhaustion attacks specifically targeting Jellyfin's transcoding feature.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented within Jellyfin. Jellyfin uses FFmpeg for transcoding and runs it as a separate process. Privilege separation and sandboxing are likely not enforced by default and might require manual user configuration. Dependency updates are managed externally.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Mandatory sandboxing of the transcoding process *as a default Jellyfin feature*.
    *   Automated vulnerability scanning and update notifications for transcoding dependencies *within Jellyfin*.
    *   Default resource limits for transcoding processes *configured within Jellyfin settings*.
    *   In-application guidance and warnings *within Jellyfin's UI* about secure transcoding configurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Plugin Vetting and Auditing (Jellyfin Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/plugin_vetting_and_auditing__jellyfin_specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Jellyfin Plugin Security Vetting
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Jellyfin Project (Core Team):**  Establish and enforce a formal, documented security vetting and auditing process for all plugins intended for the official Jellyfin plugin repository. This process should be a mandatory step before plugin inclusion and should include code reviews, static analysis, and potentially dynamic analysis performed by the Jellyfin team or designated security auditors.
    2.  **Jellyfin Project (Core Team):** Implement a robust plugin signing mechanism *within the Jellyfin plugin system*. All plugins in the official repository should be digitally signed by the Jellyfin project to guarantee authenticity and integrity. Jellyfin should verify these signatures before plugin installation and during runtime.
    3.  **Jellyfin Project (Core Team):** Develop and publish clear security guidelines and best practices specifically for Jellyfin plugin developers. These guidelines should cover common security pitfalls, secure coding practices for Jellyfin plugins, and requirements for plugin submissions to the official repository.
    4.  **Jellyfin Application (Feature):**  Within the Jellyfin server application, implement a plugin permission system. This system should allow users (administrators) to control the permissions granted to each plugin, limiting their access to Jellyfin resources, APIs, and the underlying system.
    5.  **Jellyfin Application (Feature):**  Jellyfin should provide users with clear information about the source and vetting status of plugins within the plugin management interface. Warn users about installing plugins from untrusted sources and highlight the security risks associated with unvetted plugins.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Plugin Installation in Jellyfin (High Severity):** Users installing malicious plugins *through Jellyfin's plugin system* could compromise the Jellyfin server and potentially user data managed by Jellyfin.
    *   **Vulnerable Plugin Exploitation within Jellyfin (High Severity):** Vulnerable plugins *installed in Jellyfin* can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to Jellyfin, execute arbitrary code within the Jellyfin context, or steal sensitive data managed by Jellyfin.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks via Jellyfin Plugins (Medium Severity):** Compromised or malicious plugins in the official Jellyfin repository or distributed through Jellyfin's plugin ecosystem can act as a supply chain attack vector, affecting a large number of Jellyfin users *who rely on the official plugin system*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Malicious Plugin Installation in Jellyfin: High risk reduction. Significantly reduces the risk of users installing and running malicious plugins *within their Jellyfin instances*, especially from the official repository.
    *   Vulnerable Plugin Exploitation within Jellyfin: High risk reduction. Minimizes the risk of vulnerabilities in plugins being exploited to compromise *Jellyfin servers*.
    *   Supply Chain Attacks via Jellyfin Plugins: Medium risk reduction. Makes it significantly harder for attackers to distribute malicious plugins through official Jellyfin channels and plugin distribution mechanisms.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented within Jellyfin. Jellyfin has an official plugin repository. However, the details of plugin vetting and auditing are not publicly documented. Plugin signing and permission systems are likely not fully implemented or enforced.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal, publicly documented plugin vetting and auditing process *for the official Jellyfin repository*.
    *   Mandatory plugin signing mechanism *for official Jellyfin plugins*.
    *   Clear security guidelines for plugin developers *published by the Jellyfin project*.
    *   Plugin permission system *integrated into the Jellyfin server application*.
    *   In-application warnings and information *within Jellyfin's plugin manager* about plugin security risks and vetting status.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce HTTPS and Strong TLS Configuration (Jellyfin Context)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_https_and_strong_tls_configuration__jellyfin_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Jellyfin HTTPS and Strong TLS Enforcement
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Jellyfin Application (Default Configuration):** Jellyfin's default configuration should strongly encourage or even enforce HTTPS for all web traffic. The setup process should guide users to configure HTTPS and obtain SSL/TLS certificates.
    2.  **Jellyfin Application (Automated Certificate Management):** Integrate automated certificate management, such as Let's Encrypt integration, directly into Jellyfin. This would simplify the process for users to obtain and renew valid SSL/TLS certificates for their Jellyfin server *through the Jellyfin UI*.
    3.  **Developers (Jellyfin Project):** Configure Jellyfin's built-in web server (or provide clear guidance for reverse proxy configurations) to use strong TLS configurations by default. This includes disabling outdated protocols and weak cipher suites, and enabling HSTS *as a recommended Jellyfin configuration*.
    4.  **Jellyfin Application (Security Checks):** Jellyfin could include built-in security checks that periodically assess the SSL/TLS configuration of the server and warn administrators if weak or insecure settings are detected *within the Jellyfin admin interface*.
    5.  **Jellyfin Documentation:**  Jellyfin's official documentation should prominently emphasize the importance of HTTPS and strong TLS for securing Jellyfin and provide step-by-step guides for configuring it correctly *specifically for Jellyfin*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Jellyfin (High Severity):** Without HTTPS on Jellyfin, communication between users and the Jellyfin server is vulnerable to eavesdropping and manipulation, potentially allowing attackers to intercept credentials or media streams *intended for Jellyfin*.
    *   **Credential Theft for Jellyfin Accounts (High Severity):** Insecure communication to Jellyfin allows attackers to intercept login credentials transmitted over the network, leading to unauthorized access to *Jellyfin user accounts*.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping of Jellyfin Media Streams (Medium Severity):** Without encryption, attackers can monitor media streaming and other data transmitted between the Jellyfin server and clients, potentially exposing sensitive viewing habits and media content *accessed through Jellyfin*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Jellyfin: High risk reduction. Encrypts communication to Jellyfin, making MitM attacks significantly harder.
    *   Credential Theft for Jellyfin Accounts: High risk reduction. Protects Jellyfin login credentials from network interception.
    *   Data Eavesdropping of Jellyfin Media Streams: Medium risk reduction. Protects the privacy of media streams and user activity *within Jellyfin*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented within Jellyfin. Jellyfin supports HTTPS configuration, but it's not enforced by default. Certificate management and strong TLS configuration are left to the user.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   HTTPS enforcement or strong encouragement *as a default Jellyfin setting*.
    *   Automated Let's Encrypt integration *within Jellyfin*.
    *   Stronger default TLS configurations *pre-configured in Jellyfin*.
    *   Built-in SSL/TLS configuration checks and warnings *within Jellyfin's admin UI*.
    *   More prominent and user-friendly documentation *specifically for securing Jellyfin with HTTPS*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Dependency Updates and Vulnerability Scanning (Jellyfin Project)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_dependency_updates_and_vulnerability_scanning__jellyfin_project_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Jellyfin Dependency Security Management
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Developers (Jellyfin Project):**  Establish a dedicated process for continuous dependency management within the Jellyfin project. This includes actively tracking all Jellyfin dependencies, their versions, and known vulnerabilities.
    2.  **Developers (Jellyfin Project):** Integrate automated vulnerability scanning tools into Jellyfin's development and CI/CD pipelines. These tools should automatically scan Jellyfin's dependencies for known vulnerabilities during builds and pull requests.
    3.  **Developers (Jellyfin Project):**  Implement a system for monitoring security advisories and vulnerability databases specifically for Jellyfin's dependencies. Subscribe to relevant security mailing lists and use vulnerability tracking tools to proactively identify new vulnerabilities affecting Jellyfin's dependencies.
    4.  **Developers (Jellyfin Project):**  Develop a clear and efficient process for patching vulnerabilities in Jellyfin's dependencies. This includes prioritizing security updates, testing patches thoroughly, and releasing Jellyfin updates that incorporate patched dependencies in a timely manner.
    5.  **Jellyfin Application (Update Notifications):** Jellyfin should include a built-in update notification system that informs users when new versions of Jellyfin are available, especially security updates that address dependency vulnerabilities.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Jellyfin Dependencies (High Severity):** Jellyfin's reliance on third-party libraries means that vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be directly exploited to compromise Jellyfin servers if not patched.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks via Compromised Jellyfin Dependencies (Medium Severity):** If dependencies used by Jellyfin are compromised, Jellyfin could inherit these vulnerabilities and become a vector for supply chain attacks, affecting all Jellyfin users.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Jellyfin Dependencies: High risk reduction. Proactively reduces the attack surface of Jellyfin by addressing known vulnerabilities in its dependencies.
    *   Supply Chain Attacks via Compromised Jellyfin Dependencies: Medium risk reduction. Mitigates the risk of widespread impact from compromised dependencies by ensuring timely updates and vulnerability monitoring *within the Jellyfin project*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented within the Jellyfin project. Jellyfin likely uses dependency management tools. Updates are released, which include dependency updates. However, the level of automated vulnerability scanning and proactive monitoring might need improvement.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Publicly documented process for Jellyfin's dependency vulnerability scanning and patching.
    *   More proactive and detailed communication to users about security updates and dependency patching *from the Jellyfin project*.
    *   Potentially, public vulnerability reports or dashboards related to Jellyfin's dependencies *maintained by the Jellyfin project*.
    *   Enhanced in-application update notifications *within Jellyfin* that specifically highlight security updates and dependency patches.
