# Attack Surface Analysis for jellyfin/jellyfin

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** API endpoints within Jellyfin that are accessible without requiring user authentication, potentially allowing unauthorized actions or information access.
*   **Jellyfin Contribution:** Jellyfin's API design includes various endpoints for core functionalities. If authentication is not consistently and correctly enforced across all sensitive endpoints, it creates a direct attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers an unauthenticated API endpoint, such as a poorly secured endpoint intended for internal communication, that allows them to modify server settings, add administrative users, or access sensitive user data without any login credentials.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, server configuration manipulation, privilege escalation, potential for complete server takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Mandatory Authentication:** Implement and enforce robust authentication and authorization checks for *all* API endpoints, especially those handling sensitive data or actions. Adopt a "deny by default" approach.
        *   **API Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting API endpoints to identify and remediate any authentication bypass vulnerabilities.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design API endpoints with the principle of least privilege in mind. Ensure that even authenticated users only have access to the minimum necessary functionalities.
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all API endpoints to prevent injection attacks and other input-based vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Enable Authentication:** Ensure that "Require authentication for local network access" and "Require authentication for remote network access" are enabled in Jellyfin's server settings.
        *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the Jellyfin server on a private network segment if possible, limiting direct exposure to the public internet.
        *   **Reverse Proxy Access Control:** Utilize a reverse proxy to further restrict access to specific API paths and enforce authentication at the proxy level for an additional layer of security.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities present within Jellyfin plugins, particularly those developed by third-party contributors, which can be exploited to compromise the Jellyfin server or user data.
*   **Jellyfin Contribution:** Jellyfin's plugin architecture, while extending functionality, inherently introduces risk if plugins are not developed and vetted securely. Jellyfin's plugin API and permission model directly influence the potential impact of plugin vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A malicious or poorly coded plugin contains a remote code execution vulnerability. When installed on a Jellyfin server, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server, gaining full control.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data theft, cross-site scripting (XSS), privilege escalation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability and plugin permissions)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Secure Plugin API Design:** Design the plugin API to be secure by default, limiting plugin access to sensitive resources and functionalities unless explicitly granted through a robust permission model.
        *   **Plugin Security Review Process:** Implement a mandatory security review process for all plugins in the official repository, including static and dynamic analysis, and potentially penetration testing.
        *   **Plugin Sandboxing:** Explore and implement plugin sandboxing or containerization to isolate plugins from the core Jellyfin system and limit the impact of potential plugin vulnerabilities.
        *   **Clear Plugin Security Guidelines:** Provide comprehensive and clear security guidelines and best practices for plugin developers to encourage secure plugin development.
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Install Plugins from Trusted Sources Only:**  Primarily install plugins from the official Jellyfin plugin repository or highly reputable and trusted sources. Avoid installing plugins from unknown or unverified sources.
        *   **Review Plugin Permissions:** Carefully review plugin permissions before installation to understand what access the plugin requests. Be wary of plugins requesting excessive or unnecessary permissions.
        *   **Keep Plugins Updated:** Regularly update installed plugins to the latest versions, as updates often include security patches.
        *   **Disable Unnecessary Plugins:** Disable or uninstall plugins that are no longer needed or actively used to reduce the attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Update Mechanism](./attack_surfaces/insecure_update_mechanism.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Jellyfin's software update process that could allow attackers to inject malicious updates, leading to server compromise.
*   **Jellyfin Contribution:** Jellyfin's automatic or manual update mechanism is a critical component. If not implemented with robust security measures, it becomes a direct pathway for attackers to compromise the entire system.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises the Jellyfin update server or performs a man-in-the-middle attack during an update check. They inject a malicious update package that, when installed by the Jellyfin server, replaces legitimate files with malware, granting the attacker persistent access and control.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise, malware installation, persistent backdoor access.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **HTTPS for Updates:** Ensure all update communication and downloads are strictly performed over HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
        *   **Cryptographic Signature Verification:** Implement robust cryptographic signature verification for all update packages. Jellyfin servers should verify the digital signature of update packages before installation to ensure authenticity and integrity.
        *   **Secure Update Server Infrastructure:** Harden and secure the infrastructure hosting the Jellyfin update server to prevent compromise and malicious update injection at the source.
        *   **Rollback Mechanism:** Implement a reliable rollback mechanism to allow users to easily revert to a previous version in case of a failed or malicious update.
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Verify Update Source:** Ensure Jellyfin is configured to check for updates from the official Jellyfin update server.
        *   **Monitor Update Process:** Monitor the update process for any unusual behavior or warnings.
        *   **Manual Updates (for High Security Environments):** In highly sensitive environments, consider disabling automatic updates and performing manual updates after verifying the integrity and authenticity of the update package through official channels.
