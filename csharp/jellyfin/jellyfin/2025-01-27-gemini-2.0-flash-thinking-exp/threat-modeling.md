# Threat Model Analysis for jellyfin/jellyfin

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Malicious Media Files](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__via_malicious_media_files.md)

*   **Threat:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Malicious Media Files
*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted media file to the Jellyfin server. This file exploits a vulnerability in a media processing library (like FFmpeg) during transcoding or metadata extraction *within Jellyfin's processing pipeline*. Upon processing, the attacker executes arbitrary code on the server with Jellyfin process privileges, leading to full server compromise.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Complete compromise of the Jellyfin server, including data breach, data manipulation, service disruption, and potential lateral movement.
*   **Affected Jellyfin Component:** Media Transcoding Module, Media Processing Libraries (FFmpeg, etc.), Upload Functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Jellyfin and FFmpeg (and other media libraries) updated.
    *   Implement robust input validation on uploaded media files (though complex for media formats).
    *   Run Jellyfin in a sandboxed environment or container.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege to the Jellyfin process.
    *   Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability scanning.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion
*   **Description:** An attacker uploads or provides a link to a maliciously crafted media file designed to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) during transcoding or processing *by Jellyfin*. This overloads the Jellyfin server, making it unresponsive to legitimate users and causing a denial of service.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Service disruption, unavailability of Jellyfin for legitimate users, potential server instability, and resource exhaustion impacting other services.
*   **Affected Jellyfin Component:** Media Transcoding Module, Media Processing Libraries (FFmpeg, etc.), Streaming Functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement resource limits and quotas for transcoding processes.
    *   Implement rate limiting on media uploads and transcoding requests.
    *   Implement basic input validation for file size and format.
    *   Monitor server resource usage and set up alerts for unusual spikes.
    *   Utilize a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to offload media streaming.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugins](./threats/malicious_plugins.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Plugins
*   **Description:** An administrator with plugin installation privileges installs a malicious plugin from an untrusted source *into Jellyfin*. This plugin could contain backdoors, malware, or vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized server access, data theft, or service disruption *within the Jellyfin environment*.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Potential server compromise, data breach, data manipulation, service disruption, and introduction of persistent malware.
*   **Affected Jellyfin Component:** Plugin System, Plugin API, Administrative Interface.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only install plugins from trusted and reputable sources (official Jellyfin repository or verified developers).
    *   Review plugin source code before installation if possible.
    *   Restrict plugin installation privileges to necessary administrators only.
    *   Advocate for plugin sandboxing features in Jellyfin.
    *   Regularly audit and remove unnecessary or untrusted plugins.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass](./threats/authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Threat:** Authentication Bypass
*   **Description:** A vulnerability in Jellyfin's authentication mechanism allows an attacker to bypass the login process and gain unauthorized access to user accounts or the administrative panel *of Jellyfin* without valid credentials. This could stem from flaws in password handling, session management, or authentication logic *within Jellyfin's code*.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Unauthorized access to user accounts and data within Jellyfin, potential administrative access leading to full server compromise, data breach, and service disruption.
*   **Affected Jellyfin Component:** Authentication Module, User Management, Session Management.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Jellyfin updated to patch authentication vulnerabilities.
    *   Enforce strong password policies for Jellyfin user accounts.
    *   Implement and encourage Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Jellyfin users, especially administrators.
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing focusing on Jellyfin's authentication.
    *   Ensure secure configuration of Jellyfin's authentication settings.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Jellyfin-Specific Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_jellyfin-specific_dependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Jellyfin-Specific Dependencies
*   **Description:** Jellyfin relies on third-party libraries beyond general web frameworks, specifically for media server functionalities. Vulnerabilities in these *Jellyfin-specific* dependencies (e.g., media parsing libraries, database connectors used by Jellyfin) could be exploited to compromise the server *running Jellyfin*.
*   **Impact:** **High to Critical** (depending on the vulnerability). Potential for RCE, DoS, data breach, or privilege escalation, depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency.
*   **Affected Jellyfin Component:** Various modules depending on the vulnerable dependency, including Media Processing, Database Interaction, Networking *within Jellyfin*.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High to Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Actively monitor Jellyfin's dependencies for known vulnerabilities and update promptly.
    *   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerable dependencies in Jellyfin.
    *   Keep Jellyfin updated, as updates often include dependency updates.
    *   Include dependency security reviews in in-depth security audits.
