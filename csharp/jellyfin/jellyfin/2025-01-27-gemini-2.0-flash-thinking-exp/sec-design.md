*   **'Database (SQLite/PostgreSQL/MySQL)' (G):**
    *   **Technology:** SQLite (file-based, default), PostgreSQL, MySQL (relational databases).
    *   **Responsibilities:** Persistent storage for metadata (media info, user profiles, settings, playback progress), application state.
    *   **Security Relevance:** Stores sensitive data (user credentials, metadata). Vulnerable to SQL injection (though mitigated by ORM usage), data breaches if database access is compromised. Proper access control and data encryption (at rest if possible) are important.
*   **'Transcoding Engine (ffmpeg)' (H):**
    *   **Technology:**  External binary (ffmpeg, written in C).
    *   **Responsibilities:**  Media transcoding (format conversion, resolution adjustment, codec changes) based on client requests and server settings.
    *   **Security Relevance:**  Processes potentially untrusted media files. Vulnerable to vulnerabilities in ffmpeg itself and input validation issues when handling media files. Sandboxing and resource limits are important.
*   **'Media Library Scanner' (I):**
    *   **Technology:** .NET Core (C#).
    *   **Responsibilities:**  Discovers media files in configured library paths, extracts metadata (using metadata providers), organizes media into libraries, monitors for file changes.
    *   **Security Relevance:**  Interacts with file system, processes file metadata. Vulnerable to path traversal attacks, processing malicious metadata, and potential denial-of-service if scanning large libraries inefficiently.
*   **'Plugin System' (J):**
    *   **Technology:** .NET Core (C#), plugin isolation using separate AppDomains (in .NET Framework, less strict in .NET Core).
    *   **Responsibilities:**  Loads, manages, and executes plugins, allowing extension of Jellyfin functionality.
    *   **Security Relevance:**  Plugins are third-party code and can introduce vulnerabilities. Plugin isolation, permission management, and a secure plugin API are crucial.

    *   **Scenario:** Jellyfin server and clients are all within a trusted home network, behind a firewall/router.
    *   **Threat Landscape:** Lower risk compared to internet-exposed deployments. Primary threats are from internal network compromises, malware on client devices, and vulnerabilities in the home network itself.
    *   **Focus Areas:** Internal network security, client device security, strong passwords, basic server hardening.

*   **Home Network with Remote Access (Port Forwarding/Reverse Proxy):**
    *   **Scenario:** Jellyfin server is accessible from the internet via port forwarding or a reverse proxy.
    *   **Threat Landscape:** Increased risk due to internet exposure. Threats include internet-based attacks, web application vulnerabilities, and potential for server compromise from external sources.
    *   **Focus Areas:** Web server security hardening, HTTPS enforcement, strong authentication, rate limiting, regular security updates, reverse proxy security (if used), firewall configuration.

*   **Cloud Deployment (VPS/Cloud Provider):**
    *   **Scenario:** Jellyfin server hosted on a VPS or cloud provider infrastructure.
    *   **Threat Landscape:** Similar to internet-exposed home network, but also includes cloud-specific risks (cloud provider security, shared infrastructure risks).
    *   **Focus Areas:** All aspects of internet-exposed deployment, plus cloud provider security best practices, instance hardening, network segmentation within the cloud environment, and potentially cloud-specific security services.

## 8. Threat Modeling Methodology Recommendation

It is recommended to use the **STRIDE methodology** in conjunction with this design document for a comprehensive threat modeling exercise.  For each component and data flow identified, apply the STRIDE categories (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) to systematically identify potential threats. This document provides the necessary context and detail about the Jellyfin system to facilitate effective STRIDE analysis.

## 9. Conclusion

This improved design document provides a more detailed and security-focused overview of the Jellyfin project. It expands on component descriptions, clarifies data flows with sensitivity classifications, enhances trust boundary analysis with specific mitigations, and categorizes key security considerations using STRIDE. This document serves as a valuable resource for conducting thorough threat modeling of Jellyfin, enabling the identification of potential vulnerabilities and the development of robust security measures to protect user media and data across various deployment scenarios. Further steps should involve conducting detailed STRIDE analysis workshops using this document as a guide, followed by vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to validate security controls and identify any remaining weaknesses.
