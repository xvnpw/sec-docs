## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Known Jellyfin Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_known_jellyfin_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   **Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities (CVEs):** Exploiting known vulnerabilities with published CVEs in specific Jellyfin versions.
        *   **How:** Attackers identify the Jellyfin version, search for corresponding CVEs and available exploits (publicly or privately). They then use these exploits to target the application.
        *   **Impact:** Can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), SQL Injection, or other critical vulnerabilities, resulting in full system compromise, data breaches, or service disruption.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Maintain up-to-date Jellyfin installations, implement vulnerability scanning, and have a patch management process.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting previously unknown vulnerabilities in Jellyfin.
        *   **How:** Attackers conduct in-depth vulnerability research (code review, fuzzing, reverse engineering) to discover new vulnerabilities. They develop custom exploits and use them before patches are available.
        *   **Impact:** Similar to CVE exploitation, can lead to RCE, SQL Injection, and other critical impacts, potentially with higher success rate initially due to lack of immediate defenses.
        *   **Mitigation:** Proactive security measures like secure coding practices, penetration testing, and robust incident response are crucial. While preventing zero-days is hard, rapid detection and response are key.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3. Execute Exploit [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3__execute_exploit__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors (Sub-Nodes):**
    *   **1.1.3.1. Remote Code Execution (RCE) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Gaining the ability to execute arbitrary code on the Jellyfin server.
        *   **How:** Exploiting vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, insecure deserialization, or command injection to inject and execute malicious code on the server.
        *   **Impact:** Full control over the Jellyfin server and potentially the underlying system. Attackers can steal data, install malware, pivot to other systems, or cause complete service disruption.
        *   **Mitigation:** Secure coding practices, input validation, memory safety measures, and regular security audits are essential to prevent RCE vulnerabilities.
    *   **1.1.3.2. SQL Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Injecting malicious SQL code into database queries to manipulate the database.
        *   **How:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in database query construction where user-controlled input is not properly sanitized. Attackers inject SQL commands to bypass authentication, extract sensitive data, modify data, or in some cases, achieve RCE depending on database permissions.
        *   **Impact:** Data breaches (sensitive user data, media metadata), data integrity compromise, potential RCE if database user has sufficient privileges.
        *   **Mitigation:** Parameterized queries or prepared statements should be used for all database interactions. Input validation and output encoding are also important defense layers.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Abuse Jellyfin Features/Functionality in Malicious Ways [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__abuse_jellyfin_featuresfunctionality_in_malicious_ways__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **2.1. Media File Exploitation [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Using malicious media files to exploit vulnerabilities during media processing.
        *   **How:** Crafting media files (images, videos, audio) with malicious payloads designed to trigger vulnerabilities in media processing libraries (like FFmpeg) used by Jellyfin during transcoding, thumbnail generation, or metadata extraction.
        *   **Impact:** Can lead to RCE if buffer overflows or other memory corruption vulnerabilities are exploited during media processing. Can also lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if metadata extraction is abused. Denial of Service (DoS) is also possible by uploading resource-intensive files.
        *   **Mitigation:** Robust input validation and sanitization for media files, keeping media processing libraries up-to-date, implementing resource limits for media processing, and potentially sandboxing media processing tasks.
    *   **2.2. Plugin Exploitation (If Plugins are Enabled/Used) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Jellyfin plugins.
        *   **How:** Plugins, especially third-party ones, might have security vulnerabilities due to less rigorous development or lack of security audits. Attackers can identify and exploit these vulnerabilities.
        *   **Impact:** Plugin vulnerabilities can lead to RCE within the Jellyfin server context, data manipulation within the plugin's scope, or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks targeting users interacting with the plugin.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Carefully audit and select plugins from trusted sources. Keep plugins updated. Implement the principle of least privilege for plugins. Consider disabling unnecessary plugins.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.2.1. Plugin RCE [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_2_1__plugin_rce__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Plugin-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities specific to the code and functionality of a particular Jellyfin plugin.
        *   **How:** Similar to general RCE, plugin vulnerabilities could be buffer overflows, command injection, insecure deserialization, or other flaws within the plugin's code.
        *   **Impact:** RCE within the context of the Jellyfin server, potentially leading to full system compromise, depending on plugin permissions and server configuration.
        *   **Mitigation:** Secure plugin development practices, plugin security audits, and careful plugin selection are crucial.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.2.1. Authentication/Authorization Bypass via API [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_2_1__authenticationauthorization_bypass_via_api__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **API Logic Flaws:** Exploiting flaws in the API's authentication or authorization logic.
        *   **How:** Attackers analyze the API endpoints and parameters to identify logic flaws that allow them to bypass authentication checks or access resources they are not authorized to access. This could involve parameter manipulation, race conditions, or flaws in role-based access control implementation.
        *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Jellyfin API functionality and data. Attackers can potentially access sensitive media metadata, user information, or control server functions without proper credentials.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Thorough API security testing, secure API design principles, robust authentication and authorization mechanisms (like OAuth 2.0, API keys with proper scopes), and regular security audits of the API.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Configuration Weaknesses & Misconfigurations [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3__configuration_weaknesses_&_misconfigurations__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **3.1. Insecure Default Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Using Jellyfin with insecure default settings.
        *   **How:** Failing to change default settings that are inherently insecure.
        *   **Impact:**  Increased attack surface and easier exploitation due to predictable configurations.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Change default credentials immediately upon installation. Review and harden default configurations based on security best practices.
    *   **3.1.1. Weak Default Credentials [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Using default usernames and passwords for Jellyfin administrator accounts.
        *   **How:** Attackers attempt to log in using well-known default credentials (e.g., "admin/password").
        *   **Impact:** Full administrative access to the Jellyfin server, allowing attackers to control all aspects of the server, access all media and user data, and potentially compromise the underlying system.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Force strong password creation during initial setup and enforce strong password policies.
    *   **3.2. Weak Access Controls [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Implementing insufficient or poorly configured access controls.
        *   **How:**  Using weak authentication mechanisms (like basic authentication without HTTPS), not enforcing strong passwords, or having overly permissive authorization policies.
        *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Jellyfin resources and data. Can lead to data breaches, account takeovers, and unauthorized modifications.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms (HTTPS, strong password policies, multi-factor authentication if possible), enforce least privilege authorization, and regularly review and audit access control configurations.
    *   **3.2.1. Insufficient Authentication Mechanisms [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Using weak or inadequate methods for verifying user identity.
        *   **How:** Relying on easily bypassed authentication methods like basic authentication over unencrypted HTTP, or using weak password policies that allow easily guessable passwords.
        *   **Impact:**  Easy account compromise, unauthorized access to user accounts and data.
        *   **Mitigation:** Enforce HTTPS for all communication, use strong password policies, consider multi-factor authentication, and avoid basic authentication without HTTPS.
    *   **3.3. Exposed Sensitive Information [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Unintentionally exposing sensitive information about the Jellyfin server or application.
        *   **How:** Misconfigurations leading to publicly accessible configuration files, backups, or overly verbose error messages that reveal sensitive details.
        *   **Impact:** Information disclosure can aid attackers in further attacks. Exposed credentials or API keys can lead to direct compromise.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Ensure configuration files and backups are not publicly accessible. Configure error handling to avoid revealing sensitive information in error messages. Regularly audit for exposed sensitive data.
    *   **3.3.2. Exposed Configuration Files/Backups [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Making configuration files or backups publicly accessible.
        *   **How:** Misconfiguring web server or file permissions to allow public access to Jellyfin configuration files (e.g., `system.xml`, database files) or backups.
        *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data including credentials, API keys, database connection strings, and server configuration details. This can lead to complete compromise of the Jellyfin server and potentially the application and underlying system.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Strictly control access to configuration files and backups. Store them in secure locations with appropriate file permissions. Regularly audit access controls and file permissions.
