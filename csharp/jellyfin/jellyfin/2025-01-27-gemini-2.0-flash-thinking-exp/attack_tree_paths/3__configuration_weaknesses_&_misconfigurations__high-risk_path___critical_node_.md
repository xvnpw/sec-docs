#### 3.1. Insecure Default Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]

**Description:**  This node focuses on the risks associated with using Jellyfin with its default settings without proper hardening. Default configurations are often designed for ease of initial setup and may not prioritize security.

**How:**  Administrators fail to change default settings after installation, leaving the system in a potentially vulnerable state. This can include default credentials, open ports, and permissive access controls.

**Impact:**  Increased attack surface due to predictable configurations. Attackers are familiar with default settings and can easily exploit them. This can lead to easier exploitation of other vulnerabilities or direct compromise through default credentials.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Change Default Credentials Immediately:** This is the most critical first step.
*   **Review Default Configurations:**  Thoroughly examine all default settings in Jellyfin's admin dashboard and configuration files.
*   **Harden Configurations Based on Security Best Practices:** Consult Jellyfin documentation and security hardening guides to identify and modify insecure default settings. This may include:
    *   Disabling unnecessary features or services.
    *   Restricting network access to only necessary ports and IP ranges.
    *   Enabling security features like HTTPS and rate limiting.
    *   Reviewing default file permissions.

#### 3.1.1. Weak Default Credentials [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]

**Description:** This is a specific and critical instance of insecure default configuration, focusing on the use of default usernames and passwords for Jellyfin administrator accounts.

**How:** Attackers attempt to log in to the Jellyfin administrative interface using well-known default credentials. Common examples include "admin/admin", "administrator/password", or similar combinations. Automated tools and scripts are readily available to perform brute-force attacks using lists of default credentials.

**Technical Details:** Jellyfin, like many web applications, requires an administrative account for initial setup and management. If the administrator fails to change the default credentials set during installation, the system becomes highly vulnerable. The login interface is typically accessible via a web browser.

**Impact:**

*   **Full Administrative Access:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker complete administrative control over the Jellyfin server.
*   **Data Breach:** Access to all media files, user data, and server configuration.
*   **System Compromise:**  Attackers can potentially use administrative access to execute arbitrary code on the server, compromise the underlying operating system, and pivot to other systems on the network.
*   **Malware Deployment:**  The server can be used to host and distribute malware.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Attackers can disrupt Jellyfin services or take the server offline.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Force Strong Password Creation During Initial Setup:** Jellyfin installation process should *mandatorily* require the user to create a strong, unique password for the administrator account during the initial setup wizard. Default credentials should *not* be pre-configured.
*   **Enforce Strong Password Policies:** Implement and enforce strong password policies for all user accounts, including administrators. This includes:
    *   Minimum password length.
    *   Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
    *   Password expiration and rotation policies.
    *   Password history to prevent reuse.
*   **Account Lockout Policies:** Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks. After a certain number of failed login attempts, the account should be temporarily locked.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically audit user accounts and password policies to ensure compliance and identify any weak passwords.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Consider implementing 2FA for administrator accounts for an added layer of security, although Jellyfin's current feature set might require plugins or external solutions for this.

#### 3.2.1. Insufficient Authentication Mechanisms [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]

**Description:** This node is a specific instance of weak access controls, focusing on the use of weak or inadequate methods for verifying user identity (authentication).

**How:** Relying on authentication methods that are easily bypassed or compromised.

*   **Basic Authentication over Unencrypted HTTP:** Transmitting credentials in base64 encoding over HTTP is highly insecure and easily intercepted.
*   **Weak Password Policies:** Allowing short, simple, or easily guessable passwords.
*   **Lack of Account Lockout Policies:**  Failing to implement account lockout mechanisms, allowing brute-force password attacks.
*   **Session Management Issues:**  Weak session management can lead to session hijacking or replay attacks.

**Impact:**

*   **Easy Account Compromise:** Attackers can easily guess or intercept credentials, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Unauthorized Access to User Accounts and Data:**  Compromised accounts grant attackers access to user-specific data and functionalities within Jellyfin.
*   **Account Takeovers:** Attackers can take over legitimate user accounts and impersonate them.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Enforce HTTPS for All Communication (Critical):**  As emphasized before, HTTPS is *essential* for securing authentication and all communication with Jellyfin.
*   **Use Strong Password Policies (Critical):** Implement and enforce robust password policies as detailed in 3.1.1 and 3.2.
*   **Consider Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Implement MFA for an extra layer of security, especially for administrator accounts and potentially for all users.
*   **Avoid Basic Authentication without HTTPS (Critical):**  Never use basic authentication over unencrypted HTTP. If basic authentication is used, it *must* be over HTTPS.
*   **Implement Account Lockout Policies:**  Protect against brute-force attacks by implementing account lockout policies.
*   **Secure Session Management:** Ensure secure session management practices are in place, including:
    *   Using strong session IDs.
    *   Setting appropriate session timeouts.
    *   Protecting session IDs from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
    *   Regenerating session IDs after authentication.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Vulnerability Scanning:**  Periodically audit authentication mechanisms and perform vulnerability scans to identify and address any weaknesses.

#### 3.3.2. Exposed Configuration Files/Backups [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]

**Description:** This is a specific and highly critical instance of exposed sensitive information, focusing on making Jellyfin configuration files (e.g., `system.xml`, database files) or backups publicly accessible.

**How:** Misconfiguring the web server or file permissions to allow public access.

*   **Web Server Misconfiguration:** Incorrectly configured virtual hosts or access rules in web servers like Nginx or Apache, allowing direct access to configuration directories.
*   **File Permission Errors:**  Setting overly permissive file permissions on configuration files and backup directories, making them readable by the web server user or even publicly readable.
*   **Accidental Placement in Public Directories:**  Storing configuration files or backups within the web server's document root or other publicly accessible directories.

**Technical Details:** Jellyfin stores sensitive configuration information in files like `system.xml` (containing server settings, database connection details, potentially API keys) and database files (containing user data, media library metadata, and potentially hashed passwords). Backups may contain snapshots of these files.

**Impact:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data:**  Direct exposure of highly sensitive data including:
    *   **Credentials:**  Database passwords, API keys, administrator credentials (if stored in plaintext or easily reversible format - though Jellyfin should hash passwords, configuration files might contain other secrets).
    *   **API Keys:**  Keys used for accessing external services or APIs.
    *   **Database Connection Strings:**  Credentials and connection details for the Jellyfin database.
    *   **Server Configuration Details:**  Internal server settings and configurations that can aid attackers in understanding the system and identifying further vulnerabilities.
*   **Complete Compromise of Jellyfin Server:**  Exposure of credentials and API keys can lead to immediate and complete compromise of the Jellyfin server.
*   **Potential Compromise of Underlying System:**  Depending on the exposed credentials and server configuration, attackers might be able to pivot and compromise the underlying operating system or other systems on the network.
*   **Data Breach and Data Loss:**  Attackers can access and exfiltrate sensitive data, potentially leading to data breaches and data loss.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Strictly Control Access to Configuration Files and Backups (Critical):**
    *   **Secure Storage Location:** Store configuration files and backups *outside* the web server's document root and in a secure location with restricted access.
    *   **Appropriate File Permissions (Critical):**  Set file permissions to restrict access to configuration files and backups to only the Jellyfin server process user and authorized administrators. Use the principle of least privilege. For example, permissions should typically be set to `600` or `640` for configuration files and backups, ensuring only the owner (Jellyfin process user) or owner and group have read access.
    *   **Web Server Configuration (Critical):**  Configure the web server to explicitly deny access to configuration directories and backup locations. Use directives like `deny all` in Nginx or `<Directory>` restrictions in Apache.
*   **Regularly Audit Access Controls and File Permissions (Critical):**  Periodically audit file permissions and web server configurations to ensure they are correctly configured and prevent unauthorized access.
*   **Automated Security Scans:**  Use automated security scanning tools to regularly check for publicly accessible configuration files and backups.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Apply the principle of least privilege to all aspects of system configuration, ensuring only necessary permissions are granted.
*   **Backup Security:**  Encrypt backups and store them in secure, offsite locations to protect against both unauthorized access and data loss.

By diligently implementing these mitigation strategies, developers, system administrators, and users can significantly reduce the risk of configuration weaknesses and misconfigurations being exploited in their Jellyfin deployments, ensuring a more secure and robust media server environment.
