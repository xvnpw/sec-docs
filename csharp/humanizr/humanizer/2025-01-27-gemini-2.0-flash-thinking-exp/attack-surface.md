# Attack Surface Analysis for humanizr/humanizer

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via String Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_string_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious scripts into web pages through user-controlled input that is processed by `humanizer` and subsequently displayed without proper output encoding.  While `humanizer` itself is not inherently vulnerable to XSS, its string manipulation functions, when used to process user-provided data and the output is directly rendered in a web page, create a pathway for XSS if output encoding is neglected. The vulnerability arises from the *application's* failure to handle `humanizer`'s output securely, specifically when displaying user-influenced strings.

*   **Humanizer Contribution:** `Humanizer`'s string manipulation capabilities (like truncation, case conversion, formatting) can process user-provided strings. If the *application* then directly embeds this processed output into web pages without proper escaping, it becomes vulnerable. `Humanizer` is a component in the attack chain, as it processes the potentially malicious input, but the root cause is the lack of secure output handling in the application.

*   **Example:** An application uses `humanizer` to truncate user-submitted blog post titles for display on a homepage. If a user submits a title containing malicious HTML like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, and the truncated title (processed by `humanizer`) is inserted into the HTML of the homepage *without HTML encoding*, the script will execute in visitors' browsers when they view the homepage.

*   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, malware distribution, website defacement, session hijacking, full control over the user's browser within the vulnerable website's context.

*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Output Encoding:**  **Always** HTML-encode the output of *any* `humanizer` function that processes user-provided data *before* displaying it in HTML contexts (web pages, emails, etc.). Use context-appropriate encoding functions provided by your framework or language (e.g., HTML escaping for web pages). This is the **primary and most crucial mitigation**.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege in Output Handling:** Treat all output from `humanizer` that is derived from user input as potentially unsafe.  Apply output encoding defensively, even if you believe the `humanizer` function itself is safe.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy to further mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities, even if output encoding is missed in some instances. CSP can restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and other browser behaviors, limiting the damage an attacker can cause.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews, specifically focusing on areas where `humanizer` is used to process and display user input. Ensure that output encoding is consistently applied.
