# Threat Model Analysis for humanizr/humanizer

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

Description: An attacker exploits a known security vulnerability present in one of the libraries that `humanizer` depends on. This could be achieved by crafting specific inputs or requests to the application that trigger the vulnerable code path within the dependency. Successful exploitation can lead to serious consequences like remote code execution, unauthorized data access, or complete denial of service.
Impact:
* Remote Code Execution (potentially allowing full control of the server)
* Critical Information Disclosure (exposing sensitive data)
* Denial of Service (making the application unavailable)
Humanizer Component Affected: Indirectly affects the entire application through vulnerable dependencies.
Risk Severity: Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency)
Mitigation Strategies:
* Proactive Dependency Management: Regularly update the `humanizer` library to the latest version. Newer versions often include updates to dependencies that patch known vulnerabilities.
* Dependency Scanning: Implement automated dependency scanning tools in the development pipeline. These tools can identify known vulnerabilities in `humanizer`'s dependencies before they are deployed.
* Security Monitoring: Subscribe to security advisories related to the programming language ecosystem and libraries used by `humanizer`. This allows for timely awareness of newly discovered vulnerabilities.
* Patching and Updates:  Establish a process for promptly applying security patches and updating dependencies when vulnerabilities are identified and fixes are released.
