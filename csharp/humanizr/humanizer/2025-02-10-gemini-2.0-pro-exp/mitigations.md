# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for humanizr/humanizer

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation (Pre-Humanization)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation__pre-humanization_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Input Points:** Determine all points in your application where data is passed *directly* to Humanizer methods.
    2.  **Define Expected Input:** For each input point, clearly define the expected data type, range, format, and any other relevant constraints *that are relevant to the specific Humanizer method being called*.
    3.  **Implement Validation Logic:** *Before* calling the Humanizer method, implement validation checks based on the defined expectations.
    4.  **Handle Invalid Input:** If the input fails validation, *do not* pass it to Humanizer. Handle the invalid input appropriately (error message, logging, default value, or exception).
    5.  **Example (C#):**
        ```csharp
        string userInput = GetUserInput();

        if (int.TryParse(userInput, out int number) && number >= 0 && number <= 1000)
        {
            // Input is valid for .ToWords() within a reasonable range
            string humanized = number.ToWords();
            // ... use humanized ...
        }
        else
        {
            // Handle invalid input
        }
        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unexpected Input Crashes (Severity: Medium):** Prevents Humanizer from crashing or throwing exceptions due to unexpected input types or values *for the specific method being called*.
    *   **ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) (Severity: Low):** Adds a layer of defense against crafted inputs that *might* trigger ReDoS within Humanizer's internal regexes (though this is unlikely).
    *   **Logic Errors (Severity: Low to Medium):** Prevents unexpected application behavior caused by Humanizer processing data outside its intended range or format *for the specific method*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unexpected Input Crashes:** Risk reduced to near zero.
    *   **ReDoS:** Risk remains extremely low, but this adds a small additional layer of protection.
    *   **Logic Errors:** Risk significantly reduced, depending on the thoroughness of the validation.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example - Needs to be filled in based on your project)
    *   Partially implemented in `UserController` for `UpdateUserAge`. Input is checked to be a number, but range is not validated *specifically for Humanizer*.
    *   Implemented in `ReportGenerator` for date inputs, relevant to `DateTime.Humanize()`.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example - Needs to be filled in based on your project)
    *   Missing in `ProductController` where product quantities are handled. Input validation should be tailored to the expected input of the specific Humanizer method used.
    *   Missing in `AdminPanel` for numerical settings.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Locale Awareness and Control (Humanizer-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/locale_awareness_and_control__humanizer-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Locale-Sensitive Methods:** Determine all places where Humanizer methods that are locale-aware are used (e.g., `ToWords`, `ToOrdinalWords`, `DateTime.Humanize`, `TimeSpan.Humanize`).
    2.  **Choose a Strategy:** Decide on a strategy: User-specific locale, application-wide default, or explicitly set locale *for each Humanizer call*.
    3.  **Implement the Strategy:** Use the overloads of Humanizer methods that accept a `CultureInfo` object *consistently*.
    4.  **Example (C#):**
        ```csharp
        // User-specific (assuming GetUserCulture() is available)
        CultureInfo userCulture = GetUserCulture();
        string humanizedDate = DateTime.Now.Humanize(culture: userCulture);

        // Explicit locale
        string humanizedNumber = 1234.ToWords(CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("fr-FR")); // French
        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unexpected Output (Severity: Low):** Prevents unexpected variations in output due to different cultural formatting rules.
    *   **Misinterpretation (Severity: Low):** Avoids misinterpretations of Humanized strings due to cultural differences.
    *   **Logic Errors (Severity: Low):** Prevents logic errors from incorrect assumptions about the format of Humanizer's output.

*   **Impact:**
    *   All listed threats: Risk significantly reduced by ensuring consistent and predictable locale handling *within Humanizer*.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example - Needs to be filled in based on your project)
    *   The application uses the system's default locale, which is not ideal.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example - Needs to be filled in based on your project)
    *   Need to implement a strategy for explicitly setting the locale in *every* call to a locale-aware Humanizer method.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Ordinal Numbers Handling (Humanizer-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/ordinal_numbers_handling__humanizer-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Usage:** Find all instances where `ToOrdinalWords` or similar ordinal methods are used.
    2.  **Validate Input:** *Before* calling the method, ensure the input is a valid integer using `int.TryParse` or similar.
    3.  **Handle Invalid Input:** If invalid, handle the error appropriately (don't call Humanizer).
    4.  **Specify Culture:** *Always* explicitly specify the culture using the `CultureInfo` overload to ensure consistent results.
    5. **Example:**
        ```csharp
        string input = GetInput();
        if (int.TryParse(input, out int number))
        {
            string ordinal = number.ToOrdinalWords(CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("en-US")); // Explicit culture
            // Use the ordinal string
        }
        else
        {
            // Handle invalid input
        }
        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unexpected Output (Severity: Low):** Prevents unexpected output if the input is not a valid number.
    *   **Logic Errors (Severity: Low):** Prevents logic errors from incorrect assumptions about the format.
    * **Locale-Specific Issues (Severity: Low):** Avoids unexpected behavior due to different cultural rules for ordinal numbers.

*   **Impact:**
    *   All listed threats: Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example - Needs to be filled in based on your project)
    *   Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example - Needs to be filled in based on your project)
    *   Need to add input validation and *explicit culture specification* to *all* uses of ordinal methods.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Unit and Integration Testing (Humanizer-Specific Calls)](./mitigation_strategies/unit_and_integration_testing__humanizer-specific_calls_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create Test Cases:** Write unit tests specifically for *how your code calls* Humanizer methods.
    2.  **Cover Edge Cases:** Include test cases for valid inputs, boundary values, invalid inputs, *and different locales*, focusing on the *specific Humanizer methods you use*.
    3.  **Integration Tests:** Write integration tests to verify Humanizer works correctly with other parts of your application, *paying attention to the data flow into and out of Humanizer*.
    4.  **Automate Tests:** Integrate the tests into your build process.
    5. **Example:**
        ```csharp
        [TestMethod]
        public void TestToWords_ValidInput_SpecificCulture() // Test specific culture
        {
            Assert.AreEqual("one hundred twenty-three", 123.ToWords(CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("en-US")));
        }

        [TestMethod]
        public void TestToWords_NegativeInput_SpecificCulture()
        {
            Assert.AreEqual("minus einhundertdreiundzwanzig", (-123).ToWords(CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("de-DE"))); // German
        }

        [TestMethod]
        [ExpectedException(typeof(ArgumentOutOfRangeException))] // Or handle in the test
        public void TestToWords_OutOfRangeInput() // Test input validation *before* Humanizer
        {
            // Assuming you have a validation check; this tests that it works
            long.MaxValue.ToWords(CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("en-US"));
        }
        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unexpected Output (Severity: Low to Medium):** Catches unexpected behavior due to various inputs and locales *in your specific usage*.
    *   **Logic Errors (Severity: Low to Medium):** Identifies logic errors caused by incorrect assumptions about Humanizer's output *in your code*.
    *   **Regressions (Severity: Low to Medium):** Prevents regressions when Humanizer or your code is updated.

*   **Impact:**
    *   All listed threats: Risk significantly reduced by catching errors early.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example - Needs to be filled in based on your project)
    *   Basic unit tests exist, but coverage is incomplete, especially for different locales and edge cases *related to how Humanizer is called*.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example - Needs to be filled in based on your project)
    *   Expand test coverage to include edge cases, different locales, and integration tests, *specifically focusing on the interaction between your code and Humanizer*.
