# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2.1 - Unvetted Regex in Humanizer Functions

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the potential for a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack exploiting unvetted regular expressions within the Humanizer library, as identified in attack tree path 1.2.1.  This includes:

*   **Confirming Vulnerability Existence:**  Determine if the Humanizer library *actually* contains regular expressions susceptible to catastrophic backtracking.  The attack tree *assumes* this, but we need to verify it.
*   **Identifying Vulnerable Functions:** Pinpoint the specific Humanizer functions that utilize these vulnerable regular expressions.
*   **Crafting Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Exploits:** Develop sample inputs that demonstrably trigger the ReDoS vulnerability, proving its exploitability.
*   **Assessing Real-World Impact:** Evaluate the practical consequences of a successful ReDoS attack on an application using Humanizer.
*   **Refining Mitigation Strategies:** Provide concrete, actionable recommendations for mitigating the identified vulnerability, going beyond the general suggestions in the attack tree.

## 2. Scope

This analysis is strictly limited to the ReDoS vulnerability within the Humanizer library itself (version used by the application).  It does *not* cover:

*   ReDoS vulnerabilities in *other* libraries used by the application.
*   Other types of attacks against the application (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).
*   Vulnerabilities introduced by the application's *own* use of regular expressions *outside* of its interaction with Humanizer.
*   Vulnerabilities in the infrastructure the application runs on.

The focus is solely on how an attacker could leverage a flaw *within Humanizer* to cause a denial of service.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Static Code Analysis (Manual Review):**
    *   We will examine the Humanizer source code (obtained from the provided GitHub repository: [https://github.com/humanizr/humanizer](https://github.com/humanizr/humanizer)) to identify all instances where regular expressions are used.
    *   We will manually analyze these regular expressions for patterns known to be susceptible to ReDoS, such as:
        *   Nested quantifiers (e.g., `(a+)+$`)
        *   Overlapping alternations within quantifiers (e.g., `(a|a)+$`)
        *   Repetitions of complex groups containing alternations.
    *   We will prioritize analysis of functions that are likely to be used with user-provided input.

2.  **Static Code Analysis (Automated Tools):**
    *   We will utilize static analysis tools specifically designed for ReDoS detection.  Examples include:
        *   **rxxr2:**  A command-line tool for analyzing regular expressions for ReDoS vulnerabilities.
        *   **SDV (Software Development Verification) tools:** Some SDV tools include ReDoS checkers.
        *   **SonarQube/SonarLint:**  These tools can often flag potential ReDoS issues as part of their broader code quality analysis.
    *   These tools will help automate the identification of potentially vulnerable regexes, especially in a large codebase.

3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzz Testing):**
    *   We will develop a fuzz testing harness that specifically targets Humanizer functions that use regular expressions.
    *   The fuzzer will generate a large number of inputs, including:
        *   Random strings.
        *   Strings designed to test edge cases of the identified regular expressions.
        *   Strings based on known ReDoS attack patterns.
    *   We will monitor the application's CPU usage and response time while fuzzing.  Significant spikes in CPU usage or unresponsiveness will indicate a potential ReDoS vulnerability.

4.  **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Development:**
    *   For any identified potential vulnerabilities, we will attempt to craft specific inputs that reliably trigger the ReDoS behavior.
    *   These PoCs will serve as concrete evidence of the vulnerability and its exploitability.
    *   We will measure the time taken for the regex engine to process these malicious inputs, demonstrating the severity of the DoS.

5.  **Mitigation Verification:**
    *   After implementing proposed mitigations (see section 5), we will re-run the fuzz tests and PoCs to ensure that the vulnerability has been effectively addressed.

This section will be populated with the findings from our investigation.  It will be structured as follows:

### 4.1.  Identified Regular Expressions

This subsection will list all regular expressions found in the Humanizer codebase, along with their location (file and function) and a preliminary assessment of their ReDoS risk.

**Example (Hypothetical - This needs to be filled with real data from Humanizer):**

| Regular Expression                               | File               | Function             | Preliminary Risk | Notes
