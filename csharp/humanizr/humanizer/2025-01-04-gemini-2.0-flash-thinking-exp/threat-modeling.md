# Threat Model Analysis for humanizr/humanizer

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Large Values](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_large_values.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides exceptionally large numerical values or time differences to `humanizer` functions. If `humanizer`'s internal processing of these values is not optimized or lacks safeguards, it could lead to excessive CPU or memory consumption, potentially causing a denial-of-service condition. The attacker might repeatedly trigger these operations to overwhelm the server.

**Impact:** Application slowdown, increased server load leading to instability, potential denial of service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.

**Affected Humanizer Component:** Numerical processing logic within modules handling numbers and time differences (e.g., `timespan`, `number` humanizers).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Validation with Range Limits:** Implement strict validation on numerical inputs *before* they reach `humanizer`, enforcing reasonable upper and lower bounds based on the application's requirements.
*   **Timeouts and Resource Limits within Application:**  Implement timeouts for operations involving `humanizer`, especially when processing potentially large values. The application should also have overall resource limits to prevent a single component from consuming excessive resources.
*   **Consider Asynchronous Processing:** For operations that might involve processing large values, consider using asynchronous processing to prevent blocking the main application thread.

## Threat: [Potential for Algorithmic Complexity Exploitation in String Processing](./threats/potential_for_algorithmic_complexity_exploitation_in_string_processing.md)

**Description:** If `humanizer`'s internal string processing or parsing logic (e.g., for handling custom formats or complex pluralization rules, if applicable) has inefficient algorithms, an attacker might provide carefully crafted input strings that trigger worst-case performance scenarios. This could lead to significant CPU consumption and potential denial of service.

**Impact:** Application slowdown, increased server load, potential denial of service.

**Affected Humanizer Component:** String processing and parsing logic within various modules, potentially including custom format handling or pluralization logic (if complex).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Review Humanizer's Code (If Possible):** If feasible, review the relevant parts of `humanizer`'s code to understand its algorithmic complexity for string processing.
*   **Input Sanitization and Complexity Limits:** Sanitize input strings to remove potentially problematic characters or patterns. If custom formats are allowed, impose limits on their complexity.
*   **Performance Testing with Malicious Payloads:** Conduct performance testing with inputs designed to trigger worst-case scenarios in string processing to identify potential bottlenecks.
