# Attack Surface Analysis for humanizr/humanizer

## Attack Surface: [Indirect Format String Vulnerability](./attack_surfaces/indirect_format_string_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** While `humanizer` itself likely doesn't have direct format string vulnerabilities, the *output* it generates might be used in contexts where format string vulnerabilities exist (e.g., logging functions).
*   **How Humanizer Contributes:** `humanizer` produces strings that are then used elsewhere. If this output is used in a vulnerable way, `humanizer` becomes a contributing factor.
*   **Example:** The application logs a message containing the output of `humanize.naturaltime()`. An attacker crafts input that, when humanized, includes format string specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%x`), potentially leading to information disclosure or code execution if the logging function is vulnerable.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential code execution depending on the vulnerability in the downstream component.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure that the output of `humanizer` is properly sanitized or parameterized before being used in contexts where format string vulnerabilities are possible (e.g., logging, system calls).
    *   Use secure logging practices that avoid direct string formatting of user-influenced data.

## Attack Surface: [Reliance on Locale-Specific Output for Security Decisions](./attack_surfaces/reliance_on_locale-specific_output_for_security_decisions.md)

*   **Description:** The application makes security-related decisions based on the human-readable output generated by `humanizer`, which can vary depending on the locale.
*   **How Humanizer Contributes:** `humanizer`'s output is locale-dependent. An attacker might manipulate the locale to influence the output and bypass security checks.
*   **Example:** The application checks if a file size, humanized by `humanizer`, is "less than a megabyte" to allow upload. An attacker, by manipulating the locale, could potentially make a larger file appear as "less than a megabyte" in a specific locale's output, bypassing the check.
*   **Impact:** Security bypasses, incorrect authorization, potential for malicious actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid making security decisions based solely on the human-readable output of `humanizer`.
    *   Base security checks on the original, unhumanized data.
    *   If humanized output is used for display purposes, ensure it doesn't influence security logic.
