# Attack Tree Analysis for humanizr/humanizer

Objective: To execute arbitrary code or gain unauthorized access to the application's data or resources by leveraging vulnerabilities within the `humanizer` library.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
* Exploit Input Handling (Critical Node)
    * Overflow/DoS via Extremely Large Numbers (High-Risk Path)
    * Trigger Excessive Resource Consumption with Large Collections (High-Risk Path)
* Exploit Output Handling (Critical Node)
    * Leverage Unsanitized Humanized Output for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High-Risk Path)
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling__critical_node_.md)

This node represents a critical control point where the application receives data that is then processed by the `humanizer` library.
Vulnerabilities at this stage allow attackers to inject malicious or oversized data that can disrupt the application's functionality or consume excessive resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overflow/DoS via Extremely Large Numbers (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/overflowdos_via_extremely_large_numbers__high-risk_path_.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker provides an extremely large numerical value as input to a `humanizer` function like `ToWords()`.
* Mechanism: The `humanizer` library attempts to convert this very large number into its word representation, potentially leading to excessive memory allocation, CPU usage, and ultimately a denial-of-service condition.
* Likelihood: Medium
* Impact: Medium (Application slowdown or crash)
* Effort: Low
* Skill Level: Low
* Mitigation: Implement input validation to restrict the range of acceptable numerical inputs. Monitor resource usage for anomalies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Excessive Resource Consumption with Large Collections (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_excessive_resource_consumption_with_large_collections__high-risk_path_.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker provides a very large collection (e.g., a list or array with thousands of elements) as input to a `humanizer` function that processes collections.
* Mechanism: The `humanizer` library attempts to process each item in the large collection, potentially leading to excessive memory allocation, CPU usage, and a denial-of-service condition.
* Likelihood: Medium
* Impact: Medium (Application slowdown or crash)
* Effort: Low
* Skill Level: Low
* Mitigation: Implement input validation to limit the size of collections accepted by the application. Implement pagination or lazy loading if displaying humanized collections. Monitor resource usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Output Handling (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_output_handling__critical_node_.md)

This node represents a critical control point where the application handles the output generated by the `humanizer` library.
If the application doesn't properly sanitize or encode this output, it can be exploited to inject malicious content into the user's browser or other downstream systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Unsanitized Humanized Output for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_unsanitized_humanized_output_for_cross-site_scripting__xss___high-risk_path_.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker provides malicious input (e.g., a string containing JavaScript code) that is processed by `humanizer` and then directly rendered in a web page without proper sanitization or encoding.
* Mechanism: The malicious JavaScript code is embedded within the humanized output and executed by the user's browser, allowing the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting the user, or defacing the website.
* Likelihood: Medium (dependent on application's output handling)
* Impact: High (Account compromise, data theft, malicious actions on behalf of the user)
* Effort: Low
* Skill Level: Low
* Mitigation: Always sanitize or encode the output of `humanizer` before rendering it in a web page. Use context-aware output encoding techniques. Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP).
