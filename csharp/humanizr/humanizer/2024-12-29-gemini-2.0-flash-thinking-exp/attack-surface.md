Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces with high and critical severity that directly involve Humanizer:

* **Attack Surface:** Locale Data Injection
    * **Description:** A malicious actor could potentially inject crafted locale data that could lead to unexpected behavior or even code execution if the library doesn't sanitize this data properly.
    * **How Humanizer Contributes:** Humanizer relies on locale-specific data for formatting numbers, dates, times, and other values. If the application allows users to influence the locale settings used by Humanizer, this becomes an attack vector directly related to how Humanizer processes and utilizes locale information.
    * **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious locale file that, when loaded by Humanizer, causes a number formatting function to output a string that is then interpreted as a command by the underlying system.
    * **Impact:** Potentially arbitrary code execution, data corruption, or denial of service depending on the nature of the injected data and how it's processed by Humanizer.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Control Locale Settings:**  Do not allow user-controlled or externally influenced locale settings for security-sensitive operations when using Humanizer. Use a predefined and trusted set of locales.
        * **Input Validation for Locale:** If locale selection is necessary, strictly validate the input against an allowed list of safe locales before passing it to Humanizer.
        * **Sandboxing (Advanced):** In highly sensitive environments, consider running Humanizer in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities related to locale handling.

* **Attack Surface:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Output
    * **Description:** If the application directly renders the output of Humanizer in a web page without proper sanitization, malicious input processed by Humanizer could result in the generation of output containing malicious scripts.
    * **How Humanizer Contributes:** Certain humanization functions, especially those dealing with strings or allowing for custom formatting, might inadvertently pass through or generate output containing HTML or JavaScript if the input is crafted maliciously. This directly relates to how Humanizer transforms input into output.
    * **Example:** A user provides a string like `<script>alert("XSS")</script>` which is then humanized by Humanizer and displayed on a webpage without encoding, causing the script to execute in the user's browser.
    * **Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, data theft, website defacement, and redirection to malicious sites.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Output Encoding/Escaping:** Always encode or escape the output of Humanizer before rendering it in HTML contexts. Use context-aware encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding) on the output generated by Humanizer.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks by controlling the resources the browser is allowed to load, even if malicious output from Humanizer is present.

* **Attack Surface:** Resource Exhaustion through Large or Complex Input
    * **Description:** Certain humanization functions, especially those dealing with large numbers, time differences, or collections, might be vulnerable to resource exhaustion if provided with extremely large or specially crafted input.
    * **How Humanizer Contributes:** The internal algorithms of some humanization functions within Humanizer might have a higher time or space complexity for certain types of input, leading to excessive CPU or memory usage when processing such input.
    * **Example:** Providing an extremely large number to a function within Humanizer that humanizes numbers, causing it to consume excessive CPU cycles and potentially leading to a denial of service.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service (DoS), impacting the availability of the application.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Validation (Size and Complexity):**  Validate the size and complexity of the input before passing it to Humanizer functions. Set reasonable limits on the size of numbers, the range of dates, or the number of items in collections that are processed by Humanizer.
        * **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for operations involving Humanizer to prevent indefinite processing of potentially malicious or overly complex input.
        * **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on functionalities that utilize Humanizer to prevent abuse through repeated requests with large or complex input.
