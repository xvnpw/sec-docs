### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Humanizer Library

Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve the `Humanizer` library:

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion via Large Number Formatting
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides extremely large numerical inputs to functions like `ToWords()` or `FormatNumber()`. Humanizer attempts to process and format these massive numbers, potentially consuming excessive CPU and memory resources on the server. This is a direct consequence of how Humanizer handles large numbers.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) or significant performance degradation, making the application unresponsive or slow for legitimate users.
    *   **Affected Component:** `NumberToWords`, `IntegerToWords`, `Ordinalize`, `FormatNumber` modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement input validation to restrict the maximum size of numerical inputs *before* they are passed to Humanizer functions.
        *   Set timeouts for processing Humanizer functions to prevent indefinite resource consumption.
        *   Monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory) and implement alerts for unusual spikes.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in the Humanizer Library Itself
    *   **Description:** The Humanizer library, like any software, might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, injection flaws within its own code). An attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities if they exist in the version being used by the application. This is a direct risk stemming from the library's codebase.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, information disclosure, denial of service, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Affected Component:** Entire Humanizer library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Humanizer library updated to the latest stable version. Regularly check for security advisories and patch releases.
        *   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Follow secure coding practices in the application to minimize the impact of potential library vulnerabilities.
