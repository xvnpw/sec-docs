# Attack Tree Analysis for humanizr/humanizer

Objective: To compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the `humanizer` library, leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling in Humanizer](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_in_humanizer.md)

*   Attack Vector: Format String Vulnerability
    *   Critical Node: Format String Vulnerability
    *   Description: If the `humanizer` library uses string formatting functions (like `printf` in C or similar) and directly incorporates user-provided data into the format string without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject format specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%x`, `%n`).
    *   Mechanism: The attacker provides a specially crafted input string containing format specifiers. When `humanizer` processes this string, the format specifiers are interpreted, potentially leading to:
        *   Information Disclosure: Reading arbitrary memory locations, revealing sensitive data.
        *   Arbitrary Code Execution: Overwriting memory locations to execute malicious code (depending on the underlying language and implementation).
    *   Likelihood: Medium (Depends on Humanizer's internal implementation and language)
    *   Impact: High (Information leakage, potential arbitrary code execution)
    *   Effort: Medium to High (Requires understanding of format string vulnerabilities and potentially library internals)
    *   Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (Can be detected by monitoring for unusual format specifiers in logs or through static analysis)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Output Generation by Humanizer](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_output_generation_by_humanizer.md)

*   Attack Vector: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Humanized Output
    *   Critical Node: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Humanized Output
    *   Description: If the application directly renders the output generated by `humanizer` in a web page, and `humanizer` doesn't properly escape HTML characters in the input data, malicious scripts can be injected into the output.
    *   Mechanism:
        *   The attacker provides input data containing characters that are not properly escaped by `humanizer`.
        *   `Humanizer` generates output that includes these unescaped characters, forming malicious HTML tags or JavaScript code.
        *   When the application renders this output in a user's web browser, the malicious script executes.
    *   Potential Impacts:
        *   Account Compromise: Stealing session cookies or login credentials.
        *   Data Theft: Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page.
        *   Malicious Actions: Performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent (e.g., making purchases, changing settings).
        *   Redirection: Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    *   Likelihood: Medium to High (Common vulnerability if output is directly rendered)
    *   Impact: High (Account compromise, data theft, malicious actions on behalf of the user)
    *   Effort: Low to Medium (Relatively easy to test with common XSS payloads)
    *   Skill Level: Basic to Intermediate
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (Can be detected by WAFs or by observing unusual script execution in the browser)
