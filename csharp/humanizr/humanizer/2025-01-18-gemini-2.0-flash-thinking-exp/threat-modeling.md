# Threat Model Analysis for humanizr/humanizer

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Input Values](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_large_input_values.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might provide extremely large or complex numerical or date/time values as input to `humanizer` functions. This could cause the library to consume excessive CPU time or memory while attempting to process and format these values, potentially leading to a denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Application becomes slow or unresponsive, potentially crashing the server or making it unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Affected Component:** Input Parsing and Processing (within various `humanizer` modules like `NumberToWordsConverter`, `DateHumanize`, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on data *before* passing it to `humanizer` functions. Set reasonable limits on the range and complexity of accepted input values.
    *   Implement timeouts for `humanizer` function calls to prevent indefinite processing.
    *   Monitor application resource usage (CPU, memory) and set up alerts for unusual spikes that might indicate a DoS attempt.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Input in Humanized Output](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_input_in_humanized_output.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might inject malicious script fragments into data that is subsequently processed by `humanizer`. If the application then directly embeds the *unencoded* output from `humanizer` into HTML, this malicious script could be executed in another user's browser. For example, if a user-provided string is part of a "humanized" output.
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, account takeover, or defacement.
*   **Affected Component:** Output Generation (across various `humanizer` modules that produce string outputs).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Crucially, always perform output encoding (HTML escaping) on any data, including that generated by `humanizer`, before rendering it in HTML.** This prevents the browser from interpreting the output as executable code.
    *   Utilize templating engines with built-in auto-escaping features.
    *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to further restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.
