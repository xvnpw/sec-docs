* **Attack Surface:** Malicious Tile Definitions
    * **Description:**  The application allows users or external sources to define the tiles, their properties, and adjacency rules used by the WaveFunctionCollapse algorithm.
    * **How WaveFunctionCollapse Contributes:** WFC relies on these definitions to generate the output. Maliciously crafted definitions can exploit the algorithm's logic.
    * **Example:** An attacker provides tile definitions with circular or overly complex adjacency rules that cause the WFC algorithm to enter an infinite loop trying to resolve constraints.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) - the application becomes unresponsive due to excessive computation. Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict Input Validation:** Implement robust checks on tile definitions, including limits on the number of tiles, complexity of adjacency rules, and prevention of circular dependencies.
        * **Schema Validation:** Define a strict schema for tile definitions and validate all input against it.
        * **Resource Limits:** Set timeouts for the WFC algorithm execution to prevent indefinite loops. Implement memory usage limits.

* **Attack Surface:** Large Input Grid Dimensions
    * **Description:**  The application allows users to specify the dimensions of the output grid to be generated by the WaveFunctionCollapse algorithm.
    * **How WaveFunctionCollapse Contributes:**  The computational complexity of WFC generally increases with the size of the output grid.
    * **Example:** An attacker provides extremely large grid dimensions, causing the WFC algorithm to consume excessive memory and processing power, potentially leading to application crashes or a DoS.
    * **Impact:** Memory exhaustion, Denial of Service, application crashes.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Validation:**  Set reasonable maximum limits for the dimensions of the output grid.
        * **Resource Limits:** Implement memory limits for the WFC process.
        * **Progressive Generation (If Applicable):** If the application design allows, consider generating the output in smaller chunks or progressively to manage resource usage.

* **Attack Surface:**  Unvalidated Input Formats for Tile Data
    * **Description:** The application accepts tile data in a specific format (e.g., JSON, XML). If this input format is not properly validated, it can be exploited.
    * **How WaveFunctionCollapse Contributes:** WFC needs to parse and interpret this tile data. Vulnerabilities in the parsing process can be exploited.
    * **Example:** An attacker provides malformed JSON or XML data for tile definitions, potentially triggering vulnerabilities in the parsing library used by the application, leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution (depending on the severity of the parsing vulnerability).
    * **Impact:** Application crashes, potential for arbitrary code execution (if a vulnerable parsing library is used).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate the format and content of the tile data against a defined schema.
        * **Secure Parsing Libraries:** Use well-vetted and up-to-date parsing libraries to minimize the risk of parsing vulnerabilities.
        * **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage invalid input formats and prevent application crashes.
