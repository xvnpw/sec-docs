## Threat Model: Compromising Application Using WaveFunctionCollapse - High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Objective:** Compromise application that uses the WaveFunctionCollapse (WFC) algorithm by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the WFC integration.

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized control or cause harm to the application by leveraging vulnerabilities specific to the WaveFunctionCollapse implementation.

        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Lack of Resource Management
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Trigger Excessive Memory or CPU Usage

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **Exploit Input Manipulation [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   This is the foundational step for many attacks. If an attacker can control or influence the input to the WFC algorithm (tile sets, constraints, etc.), they can potentially manipulate its behavior and output.

*   **Malicious Tile Set Injection [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attackers attempt to upload or provide crafted tile sets that contain malicious content or are designed to cause harm. This is a primary vector for exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application processes and uses tile data.

*   **Inject Tile Set with Malicious Content [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   This involves embedding malicious payloads directly within the tile data. The specific type of payload depends on how the WFC output is used.
        *   **Embed XSS Payloads in Tile Data (If Output is Rendered) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   Attackers embed JavaScript code within the tile data (e.g., in image metadata, tile names, or custom properties). If the application renders the WFC output in a web browser without proper sanitization or escaping, this malicious script will execute in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
        *   **Embed Code for Deserialization Exploits (If Tile Data is Deserialized) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   If the application deserializes tile data (e.g., for custom tile properties or complex tile definitions), attackers can embed serialized malicious objects. When these objects are deserialized, they can trigger arbitrary code execution on the server.

*   **Inject Tile Set Causing Resource Exhaustion:**
    *   Attackers craft tile sets that consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) when processed by the WFC algorithm, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).
        *   **Create Large or Complex Tile Sets:**
            *   Attackers provide tile sets with a very large number of tiles or complex arrangements that require significant computational resources to process. This can overwhelm the server and make the application unavailable.

*   **Provide Invalid or Unexpected Input Formats:**
    *   Attackers submit input for tile sets or constraints that does not conform to the expected format or contains unexpected values. This can expose vulnerabilities in the input parsing logic, potentially leading to errors, crashes, or even exploitable conditions.

*   **Buffer Overflows in WFC Library (Less Likely, but Possible) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   While less common in well-maintained libraries, vulnerabilities might exist in the underlying WFC library code that could be exploited by providing specially crafted input that overflows a buffer, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

*   **Exploit Lack of Resource Management:**
    *   The application fails to properly manage the resources consumed by the WFC process.
        *   **Trigger Excessive Memory or CPU Usage:**
            *   Attackers can trigger scenarios (e.g., through specific input or repeated requests) that cause the WFC process to consume excessive memory or CPU resources, leading to a Denial of Service. This can happen even without intentionally malicious tile sets if the application doesn't have proper safeguards.
