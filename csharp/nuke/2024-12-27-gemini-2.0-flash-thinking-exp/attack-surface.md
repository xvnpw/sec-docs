Here's the updated key attack surface list, focusing only on elements directly involving Nuke and with high or critical severity:

* **Build Script Code Injection:**
    * **Description:** Malicious code is injected into the build scripts (e.g., `build.ps1`, `build.sh`) and executed during the build process.
    * **How Nuke Contributes:** Nuke relies on these scripts to define and execute the build process. If these scripts are compromised, the entire build pipeline is vulnerable. Nuke's flexibility in executing arbitrary code within these scripts increases the potential for exploitation.
    * **Example:** An attacker compromises a developer's machine and modifies the `build.ps1` script to download and execute a malicious payload after the legitimate build steps.
    * **Impact:** Full compromise of the build environment, injection of malware into build artifacts, exfiltration of sensitive data, supply chain attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict access controls on build scripts and related files.
        * Utilize version control for build scripts and implement code review processes.
        * Employ static analysis tools to scan build scripts for potential vulnerabilities.
        * Secure developer workstations and infrastructure to prevent unauthorized modifications.
        * Regularly audit build scripts for suspicious or unexpected commands.

* **Dependency Confusion Attacks:**
    * **Description:** Attackers upload malicious packages to public repositories with the same name as internal dependencies, hoping the build system will mistakenly download the malicious version.
    * **How Nuke Contributes:** Nuke uses package managers like NuGet (for .NET) which are susceptible to dependency confusion if not configured correctly. Nuke's reliance on external dependencies makes it a potential target.
    * **Example:** An internal project uses a package named `internal-auth-lib`. An attacker uploads a malicious package with the same name to NuGet.org. If the NuGet configuration isn't properly scoped, the Nuke build might download the attacker's package.
    * **Impact:** Introduction of malicious code into the application, potential data breaches, compromised functionality.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Utilize private package repositories for internal dependencies.
        * Configure package managers to prioritize private feeds or restrict access to public feeds.
        * Implement dependency scanning tools to detect and flag suspicious packages.
        * Use checksum verification for dependencies where possible.
        * Regularly review and audit project dependencies.

* **Use of Vulnerable Dependencies:**
    * **Description:** The build process pulls in external dependencies with known security vulnerabilities.
    * **How Nuke Contributes:** Nuke orchestrates the dependency resolution process through package managers. If the build definition doesn't specify dependency versions or if outdated versions are used, vulnerable packages can be included.
    * **Example:** The `build.ps1` file references an older version of a logging library with a known remote code execution vulnerability. Nuke downloads and includes this vulnerable library in the final application.
    * **Impact:** The application becomes vulnerable to the exploits associated with the vulnerable dependencies.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement dependency scanning tools that identify known vulnerabilities.
        * Regularly update dependencies to their latest secure versions.
        * Utilize dependency management features to lock down dependency versions.
        * Monitor security advisories for vulnerabilities in used dependencies.

* **Exposure of Secrets in Build Configuration:**
    * **Description:** Sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or certificates are stored directly within build scripts or configuration files used by Nuke.
    * **How Nuke Contributes:** Nuke reads and executes build scripts and configuration files. If these files contain secrets, they become accessible to anyone with access to the build process or the repository.
    * **Example:** An API key required for deployment is hardcoded in the `build.ps1` file. This key is then exposed to anyone who can view the repository or access the build logs.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources, potential data breaches, service disruption.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault).
        * Avoid hardcoding secrets in build scripts or configuration files.
        * Use environment variables or dedicated secret management features provided by CI/CD platforms.
        * Implement proper access controls to restrict who can view or modify build configurations.

* **Malicious Custom Tasks or Extensions:**
    * **Description:**  Custom Nuke tasks or extensions developed internally or obtained from untrusted sources contain malicious code.
    * **How Nuke Contributes:** Nuke allows for the creation and use of custom tasks to extend its functionality. If these tasks are not properly vetted, they can introduce vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** A developer creates a custom Nuke task to automate a deployment step. This task contains a vulnerability that allows for remote code execution.
    * **Impact:**  Compromise of the build environment, injection of malware, data theft.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement code review processes for all custom Nuke tasks and extensions.
        * Scan custom tasks for potential vulnerabilities.
        * Restrict the use of custom tasks from untrusted sources.
        * Follow secure coding practices when developing custom tasks.
