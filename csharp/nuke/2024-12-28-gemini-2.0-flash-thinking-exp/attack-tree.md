**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Exploit Known Nuke Vulnerabilities (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify the specific version of Nuke being used by the application. They then search for publicly known vulnerabilities, particularly Remote Code Execution (RCE) flaws, associated with that version. If a suitable vulnerability is found, they attempt to exploit it.
* **Steps:**
    * **Discover Nuke Version:**  Gather information from logs, build scripts, error messages, or by probing the build server.
    * **Find Known RCE Vulnerability:** Utilize public vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE), security advisories, and exploit databases.
    * **Exploit RCE Vulnerability:** Employ existing exploits or develop custom ones to leverage the identified vulnerability.
    * **Execute Malicious Code on the Build Server:** Once RCE is achieved, execute arbitrary commands on the build server.
    * **Gain Access to Application Resources/Secrets:** Leverage the compromised build server to access sensitive files, environment variables, or other resources containing API keys, database credentials, etc.
* **Why High-Risk/Critical:** RCE vulnerabilities offer immediate and significant control over the build server, a critical component in the application deployment pipeline. Successful exploitation bypasses many other security controls and directly leads to application compromise.

**2. Manipulate the Build Process (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to inject malicious code or components into the application's build process, ensuring that the final deployed application is compromised.
* **Sub-Vectors:**
    * **Inject Malicious Code into Build Scripts (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
        * **Steps:** Gain unauthorized access to build scripts (e.g., by exploiting VCS vulnerabilities or compromising developer accounts). Modify the scripts to include malicious commands that download and execute malware, exfiltrate data, or backdoor the application during the build.
        * **Why High-Risk/Critical:** Build scripts are powerful and executed with high privileges. Injecting malicious code here guarantees its execution during the build process, making detection difficult.
    * **Introduce Malicious Dependencies (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
        * **Steps:** Exploit the dependency management system used by Nuke. This can be done through:
            * **Dependency Confusion Attack:** Uploading a malicious package with the same name as an internal dependency to a public repository, tricking the build process into fetching the malicious version.
            * **Compromise Existing Dependencies:** Identifying vulnerable versions of legitimate dependencies and relying on the build process to fetch those vulnerable versions, which are then exploited during the build.
        * **Why High-Risk/Critical:** This is a subtle attack that can be difficult to detect. Malicious code is introduced as a seemingly legitimate dependency, gaining execution within the build environment.
    * **Tamper with Build Artifacts (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
        * **Steps:** Gain unauthorized access to the build output directory (where the compiled application and related files are stored). Replace legitimate build artifacts with malicious ones before they are deployed.
        * **Why High-Risk/Critical:** This directly leads to the deployment of a compromised application. If artifact verification is weak, this attack can go unnoticed until the application is running in production.

**3. Exploit Configuration Weaknesses in Nuke (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers target weaknesses in how Nuke's configuration is stored and managed to either extract sensitive information or manipulate the build process.
* **Sub-Vectors:**
    * **Expose Sensitive Information in Nuke Configuration (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
        * **Steps:** Identify where Nuke stores configuration data (e.g., environment variables, configuration files). Gain unauthorized access to these locations to retrieve sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, etc.
        * **Why High-Risk/Critical:** Exposed credentials can lead to direct compromise of the application's backend systems and data.
    * **Modify Nuke Configuration to Execute Malicious Actions (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
        * **Steps:** Gain write access to Nuke's configuration files. Modify the configuration to execute arbitrary commands during the build process, achieving similar outcomes as injecting malicious code into build scripts.
        * **Why High-Risk/Critical:** Modifying the build configuration allows for persistent and potentially stealthy control over the build process.

**4. Abuse Nuke's Extensibility Features (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers target the extensibility features of Nuke, such as custom tasks or plugins, to introduce malicious code.
* **Sub-Vectors:**
    * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Nuke Tasks/Plugins (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
        * **Steps:** Identify custom tasks or plugins used in the application's Nuke build. Analyze their code for vulnerabilities and exploit them to execute malicious code during the build.
        * **Why High-Risk/Critical:** Custom code is often less scrutinized than core framework code, making it a potential source of vulnerabilities.
    * **Introduce Malicious Nuke Tasks/Plugins (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
        * **Steps:** Gain unauthorized access to the location where Nuke tasks/plugins are stored. Upload malicious tasks or plugins that execute malicious code when the build process utilizes them.
        * **Why High-Risk/Critical:** This allows for the introduction of persistent malicious functionality into the build process.

This focused sub-tree and detailed breakdown provide a clear picture of the most critical threats associated with using the Nuke build system, enabling the development team to prioritize security measures and mitigation strategies effectively.
