*   **Unsanitized User Input leading to Control Character Injection:**
    *   **Description:** The application fails to properly sanitize or escape user-provided input before displaying it in the terminal. This allows attackers to inject terminal control sequences (ANSI escape codes).
    *   **How Terminal.Gui Contributes:** Terminal.Gui provides components like `TextField`, `TextView`, and `Label` that display user input. If the application doesn't sanitize the input before setting the `Text` property of these components, it's vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A user enters `"\x1b[31mALERT!\x1b[0m"` into a `TextField`. If the application directly displays this, it will render "ALERT!" in red. Malicious sequences could clear the screen, move the cursor, or even attempt to exploit terminal vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Misleading information displayed to the user, potential denial-of-service by overwhelming the terminal, or in rare cases, exploitation of terminal emulator vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Sanitize user input before displaying it using methods to escape or strip ANSI escape codes. Terminal.Gui doesn't provide built-in sanitization; this must be implemented in the application logic.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about entering data from untrusted sources.

*   **Resource Exhaustion through Excessive Rendering:**
    *   **Description:** An attacker could potentially cause a denial-of-service by forcing the application to render an extremely large or complex user interface, consuming excessive CPU and memory.
    *   **How Terminal.Gui Contributes:** Terminal.Gui allows for dynamic creation and manipulation of UI elements. If the application logic doesn't limit the number or complexity of these elements based on user input or external data, it's vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An application dynamically creates `Label` elements based on data from a file. A malicious user could provide a file with an extremely large number of entries, causing the application to create thousands of labels, potentially freezing or crashing the application.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, application unresponsiveness, potential system instability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement limits on the number of UI elements created dynamically. Use techniques like pagination or virtualization for displaying large datasets. Avoid creating unnecessary UI elements.
        *   **Users:** If an application becomes unresponsive after a specific action, avoid repeating that action.
