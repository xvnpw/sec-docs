**Attack Surface 1: Unsafe Deserialization via `TypeNameHandling`**

*   **Description:** When `TypeNameHandling` is enabled (especially `Auto` or `All`), the JSON payload can specify the .NET type to be instantiated during deserialization. This allows attackers to instantiate arbitrary classes, potentially leading to remote code execution or other malicious activities.
*   **How Newtonsoft.Json Contributes:** The `TypeNameHandling` setting in `JsonSerializerSettings` instructs Newtonsoft.Json to read and interpret the `"$type"` metadata within the JSON, directly influencing object instantiation.
*   **Example:**
    ```json
    {
      "$type": "System.Windows.Forms.AxHost.AboutBox, System.Windows.Forms, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089",
      "textBox1": {
        "Text": "calc"
      },
      "button1": {
        "DialogResult": 1
      }
    }
    ```
    This crafted JSON could potentially trigger the execution of the calculator application if deserialized with vulnerable settings.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing attackers to gain full control of the application server.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid `TypeNameHandling.Auto` and `TypeNameHandling.All`.
    *   Use more restrictive `TypeNameHandling` settings (e.g., `Objects`, `Arrays`) with extreme caution and only for explicitly trusted types.
    *   Prefer schema-based deserialization using specific DTOs.
    *   Implement strong input validation, although this is difficult to fully mitigate `TypeNameHandling` risks.

**Attack Surface 2: Deserialization of Untrusted Data leading to Denial of Service (DoS)**

*   **Description:** Deserializing maliciously crafted JSON data from untrusted sources can lead to Denial of Service by consuming excessive resources. This can occur through deeply nested objects or extremely large strings/arrays.
*   **How Newtonsoft.Json Contributes:** Newtonsoft.Json's deserialization process parses and attempts to construct .NET objects based on the provided JSON. It will attempt to process even very large or deeply nested structures if not configured otherwise.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Deeply Nested Objects:**
        ```json
        {"a": {"a": {"a": {"a": ... }}}} // Hundreds or thousands of nested objects
        ```
    *   **Large String:**
        ```json
        {"data": "A very very very long string..."} // Extremely long string
        ```
    These examples can cause excessive memory consumption or CPU usage during deserialization.
*   **Impact:** High. Application becomes unresponsive or crashes, impacting availability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Set `MaxDepth` in `JsonSerializerSettings`:** Limit the maximum depth of nested objects allowed during deserialization.
    *   **Set `MaxStringContentLength` in `JsonSerializerSettings`:** Limit the maximum length of strings allowed during deserialization.
    *   **Implement timeouts for deserialization operations:** Prevent indefinite resource consumption.
    *   **Consider using streaming deserialization for very large payloads:** This can reduce memory footprint.
    *   **Implement resource monitoring and throttling:** Detect and mitigate excessive resource usage.
