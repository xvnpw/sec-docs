## High and Critical Newtonsoft.Json Threats

| Threat | Description | Impact | Affected Newtonsoft.Json Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Type Confusion/Polymorphic Deserialization** | An attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload that, when deserialized, instantiates an unexpected type of object. This can be achieved by manipulating the `$type` metadata (if enabled) or exploiting vulnerabilities in type resolution. The attacker might then leverage methods or properties of the unexpected type to execute arbitrary code or perform other malicious actions. | **Critical:** Arbitrary code execution on the server, leading to complete system compromise, data breach, or denial of service. | **JsonSerializer, JsonConverter, TypeNameHandling settings** | Critical | **Disable `$type` handling globally if not strictly necessary.** If needed, use `TypeNameHandling.Auto` or `TypeNameHandling.Objects` with extreme caution and implement strict allow-listing of expected types. **Validate the type of deserialized objects** before using them. **Avoid deserializing untrusted JSON directly into complex object hierarchies.** Consider using Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for deserialization and then mapping to internal domain objects. |
| **Deserialization of Untrusted Data Leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)** | An attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload that, when deserialized, triggers a vulnerability within a specific .NET type. This could involve exploiting constructors, methods, or properties of certain classes that perform dangerous operations when specific values are provided during deserialization. | **Critical:** Remote code execution on the server, leading to complete system compromise, data breach, or denial of service. | **JsonSerializer, JsonConverter** | Critical | **Avoid deserializing untrusted JSON directly into potentially vulnerable types.** Research known deserialization vulnerabilities in .NET and avoid using those types for deserialization of external data. **Implement input validation and sanitization** even after deserialization. **Run the application with the least necessary privileges.** Consider using a sandbox environment for deserialization of untrusted data. |
| **Denial of Service (DoS) through Large or Deeply Nested JSON Payloads** | An attacker sends extremely large or deeply nested JSON payloads to the application. When Newtonsoft.Json attempts to parse and deserialize these payloads, it can consume excessive CPU and memory resources, leading to a denial of service. | **High:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes, impacting availability for legitimate users. | **JsonTextReader, JsonSerializer** | High | **Implement limits on the size of incoming JSON payloads.** Configure `JsonSerializerSettings` with appropriate limits (e.g., `MaxDepth`). **Use asynchronous deserialization** to prevent blocking the main thread. **Consider using streaming deserialization** for very large payloads. Implement timeouts for deserialization operations. |
| **Billion Laughs Attack (XML Entity Expansion via JSON.NET's XML support)** | If the application uses Newtonsoft.Json's XML support (e.g., `JsonConvert.DeserializeXmlNode`), an attacker can craft a malicious XML payload embedded within the JSON that exploits XML entity expansion to consume excessive memory and potentially cause a denial of service. | **High:** Denial of service due to excessive memory consumption. | **JsonConvert (specifically methods related to XML conversion)** | High | **Avoid using Newtonsoft.Json's XML support for processing untrusted data if possible.** If necessary, configure XML parsing settings to limit entity expansion and recursion depth. **Sanitize or validate XML input before processing it with Newtonsoft.Json.** |
