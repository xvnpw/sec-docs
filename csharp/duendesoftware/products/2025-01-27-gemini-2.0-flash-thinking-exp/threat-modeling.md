# Threat Model Analysis for duendesoftware/products

## Threat: [Misconfigured Signing Keys](./threats/misconfigured_signing_keys.md)

Description: Attacker gains access to weak or default signing keys used by IdentityServer. They can forge valid tokens, impersonate users, and gain unauthorized access. This happens if default keys are used in production, keys are stored insecurely, or weak algorithms are chosen.
Impact: Critical - Full authentication bypass, complete system compromise, data breaches, unauthorized access to all resources.
Affected Component: IdentityServer - Token Service, Key Management
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies: 
        Generate strong, unique signing keys using cryptographically secure methods.
        Rotate signing keys regularly.
        Store signing keys securely using HSMs or secure key vaults.
        Avoid default or example keys in production.
        Use strong cryptographic algorithms (e.g., RS256, ES256).
        Regularly audit key management practices.

## Threat: [Insecure Token Lifetimes](./threats/insecure_token_lifetimes.md)

Description: Tokens (access tokens, refresh tokens, ID tokens) are configured with excessively long lifetimes. If a token is stolen, it can be used for a prolonged period to access resources without re-authentication, even after session expiry or credential changes.
Impact: High - Extended window for unauthorized access after token compromise, increased risk of data breaches and account takeover.
Affected Component: IdentityServer - Token Service, Configuration
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies: 
        Configure short-lived access tokens.
        Implement refresh tokens with appropriate expiration and rotation.
        Consider sliding session expiration.
        Implement token revocation mechanisms.

## Threat: [Permissive CORS Policies](./threats/permissive_cors_policies.md)

Description: CORS policies are misconfigured to allow requests from any origin (`*`) or untrusted origins. Attackers can host malicious JavaScript on a different domain to interact with IdentityServer API, potentially stealing tokens or acting on behalf of users.
Impact: High - Token theft via client-side attacks, potential for account takeover and data breaches.
Affected Component: IdentityServer - Web Server, Configuration
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies: 
        Configure CORS policies to allow requests only from explicitly trusted origins (client application domains).
        Avoid wildcard (`*`) for `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` in production.
        Regularly review and update CORS policies.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

Description: Sensitive information like database connection strings, client secrets, API keys, or signing keys are exposed in configuration files, logs, or error messages. Attackers gaining access can compromise the system, access databases, impersonate clients, or forge tokens.
Impact: Critical - Full system compromise, data breaches, authentication and authorization bypass, potential infrastructure takeover.
Affected Component: IdentityServer - Configuration, Logging, Error Handling
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies: 
        Store sensitive data securely using environment variables, secure configuration providers (e.g., Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault), or encrypted files.
        Avoid hardcoding secrets.
        Prevent logging of sensitive data.
        Configure error handling to avoid revealing sensitive information.
        Regularly review logs and configuration files for accidental exposure.

## Threat: [Default or Weak Administrative Credentials](./threats/default_or_weak_administrative_credentials.md)

Description: Default administrative credentials for IdentityServer's admin interfaces are not changed, or weak passwords are used. Attackers can brute-force or guess credentials to gain admin access, reconfigure IdentityServer, create backdoors, or access sensitive data.
Impact: High - Administrative access compromise, potential full control over IdentityServer, manipulation of configurations, clients, users, and tokens.
Affected Component: IdentityServer - Administrative UI (if enabled), User Management
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies: 
        Change default admin credentials immediately.
        Enforce strong password policies for admin accounts.
        Implement MFA for admin access.
        Restrict access to admin interfaces to authorized personnel and networks.
        Regularly audit admin accounts and access logs.

## Threat: [Insecure Redirect URIs](./threats/insecure_redirect_uris.md)

Description: OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect clients are configured with insecure or broad redirect URIs. Attackers can craft malicious authorization requests with attacker-controlled redirect URIs, leading to authorization code interception and token theft.
Impact: High - Authorization code interception, token theft, account takeover, open redirect vulnerabilities.
Affected Component: IdentityServer - Authorization Endpoint, Client Configuration
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies: 
        Strictly validate and whitelist redirect URIs for each client.
        Avoid wildcards or broad patterns in redirect URI configurations.
        Implement case-sensitive and exact redirect URI matching.
        Regularly review and update redirect URI configurations.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: Duende products rely on third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise IdentityServer.
Impact: High to Critical - Depending on the vulnerability, impacts can range from denial of service to remote code execution and data breaches.
Affected Component: Duende Products - Core Libraries, Dependencies
Risk Severity: High to Critical
Mitigation Strategies: 
        Maintain up-to-date versions of Duende products and all dependencies.
        Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools.
        Implement a patch management process for security updates.
