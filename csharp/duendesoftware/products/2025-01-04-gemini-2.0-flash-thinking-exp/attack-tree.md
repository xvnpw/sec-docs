## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Duende IdentityServer Products (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_duende_identityserver_products__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the highest level of risk. Success means the application and its resources are compromised.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This category represents a significant risk because misconfigurations are common and often easily exploitable. Attackers can leverage these weaknesses without requiring deep technical expertise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Client Configuration (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_client_configuration__critical_node_.md)

Clients are the applications relying on the IdentityServer. Weaknesses here directly impact the security of those applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak Client Secrets (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/weak_client_secrets__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to guess or brute-force client secrets if they are weak or default.
**Impact:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to impersonate legitimate clients, potentially gaining access to resources they shouldn't.
**Why High-Risk:** High likelihood due to common use of default or weak secrets, and medium impact as it can lead to unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Default or Easily Guessable Secrets (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/default_or_easily_guessable_secrets__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Using known default credentials or attempting common passwords.
**Impact:** Immediate compromise of the client.
**Why High-Risk:** Very high likelihood if defaults are not changed, leading to potential unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Server Configuration (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_server_configuration__critical_node_.md)

Weaknesses in the IdentityServer's own configuration can have widespread and severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak Signing Keys (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/weak_signing_keys__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If signing keys are weak or predictable, attackers can forge their own JWTs, bypassing authentication and authorization.
**Impact:**  Complete compromise of the authentication and authorization mechanism, allowing attackers to impersonate any user or client.
**Why High-Risk:** Critical impact due to the ability to forge tokens, though the likelihood might be lower due to the technical skill required.

## Attack Tree Path: [Predictable or Short Key Lengths (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/predictable_or_short_key_lengths__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Using cryptanalysis techniques to break weak keys.
**Impact:** Ability to forge tokens.
**Why High-Risk:** Critical impact, though likelihood depends on the specific key strength.

## Attack Tree Path: [Key Material Exposure (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/key_material_exposure__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Accidental or intentional exposure of private keys through insecure storage, code leaks, or other means.
**Impact:** Ability to forge tokens.
**Why High-Risk:** Critical impact, likelihood depends on security practices around key management.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Implementation Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_implementation_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This category covers vulnerabilities within the code and logic of the IdentityServer itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Token Manipulation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/token_manipulation__critical_node_.md)

Exploiting weaknesses in how tokens are created, validated, or handled.

## Attack Tree Path: [JWT Cracking/Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/jwt_crackingexploitation__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in JWT implementation or configuration.
**Impact:** Ability to forge or manipulate tokens to gain unauthorized access.
**Why High-Risk:** Critical impact, though the likelihood can vary depending on the specific vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak or Missing Signature Verification (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/weak_or_missing_signature_verification__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Modifying the JWT payload without a valid signature or with a bypassed verification process.
**Impact:**  Ability to forge tokens.
**Why High-Risk:** Critical impact, though likelihood might be lower if proper verification is intended but flawed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Algorithm Confusion Attacks (e.g., switching to 'none') (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/algorithm_confusion_attacks__e_g___switching_to_'none'___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Tricking the system into using a 'none' algorithm for signature verification, effectively disabling it.
**Impact:** Ability to forge tokens.
**Why High-Risk:** Critical impact, though likelihood depends on whether the system is vulnerable to this specific attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Operational Weaknesses (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_operational_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

Focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the system is operated and managed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Administrator Credentials (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_administrator_credentials__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Gaining access to administrative accounts through various means.
**Impact:** Complete control over the IdentityServer, allowing for manipulation of configurations, user accounts, and potentially the entire infrastructure.
**Why High-Risk:** Critical impact due to the level of control gained. Likelihood can vary depending on security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Phishing Attacks targeting administrators (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/phishing_attacks_targeting_administrators__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Deceiving administrators into revealing their credentials.
**Impact:** Compromise of admin accounts.
**Why High-Risk:** Medium likelihood due to the prevalence of phishing attacks, critical impact due to admin access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting vulnerabilities in systems where admin credentials are stored (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_systems_where_admin_credentials_are_stored__critical_node__high-risk_p_e3962745.md)

**Attack Vector:** Targeting systems where administrator passwords or secrets are stored (e.g., password managers, configuration files).
**Impact:** Compromise of admin accounts.
**Why High-Risk:** Critical impact, likelihood depends on the security of the systems storing credentials.
