# Threat Model Analysis for duendesoftware/products

## Threat: [Client Credential Compromise](./threats/client_credential_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the application's client secret used to authenticate with IdentityServer. This could happen through insecure storage within the application's environment or a vulnerability in how the application retrieves the secret. The attacker might then use this secret to request access tokens directly from IdentityServer's Token Endpoint on behalf of the legitimate application.

**Impact:** The attacker can impersonate the application, potentially accessing resources intended only for that application, manipulating data managed by the application via APIs secured by IdentityServer, or performing actions as if they were the legitimate application. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, and reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** `Duende.IdentityServer.Stores.IClientStore` (where client secrets are managed and validated), Token Endpoint.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Securely store client secrets using strong encryption and access controls *outside* of the application's codebase (e.g., using environment variables, secrets management services).
*   Rotate client secrets regularly within IdentityServer.
*   Implement monitoring and alerting for unusual client authentication attempts at IdentityServer.
*   Consider using client authentication methods that don't rely solely on shared secrets, if supported by the client type and IdentityServer configuration (e.g., client certificates, signed JWT client authentication).

## Threat: [Authorization Code Interception](./threats/authorization_code_interception.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts the authorization code during the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow managed by IdentityServer. This often happens if the redirect URI configured in IdentityServer for the client is not properly validated or if the communication channel (the redirect back to the application) is not secure (e.g., using HTTP instead of HTTPS). The attacker can then present this code to IdentityServer's Token Endpoint to exchange it for an access token, gaining unauthorized access to the user's resources.

**Impact:** The attacker can impersonate the user and access their data or perform actions on their behalf within applications relying on IdentityServer for authentication and authorization. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized transactions, and account takeover.

**Affected Component:** Authorization Endpoint within IdentityServer, `Duende.IdentityServer.Validation.AuthorizeRequestValidator` (for redirect URI validation).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always use HTTPS for all communication involving IdentityServer, including redirects.
*   Strictly validate redirect URIs configured for each client within IdentityServer's client configuration.
*   Implement state parameters in the authorization request to prevent CSRF attacks during the authorization flow handled by IdentityServer.
*   Use Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for public clients (like single-page applications or mobile apps) to mitigate authorization code interception at the IdentityServer level.

## Threat: [Refresh Token Theft/Leakage](./threats/refresh_token_theftleakage.md)

**Description:** An attacker obtains a refresh token issued by IdentityServer. Refresh tokens are long-lived credentials managed by IdentityServer and used to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to re-enter their credentials. If stolen, an attacker can present this token to IdentityServer's Token Endpoint to obtain new access tokens, effectively maintaining persistent access.

**Impact:** The attacker can maintain persistent access to the user's resources protected by IdentityServer, even after the user's initial session has expired or their password has been changed. This significantly increases the window of opportunity for malicious activities.

**Affected Component:** Token Endpoint within IdentityServer (for refresh token issuance and exchange), `Duende.IdentityServer.Stores.IRefreshTokenStore` (for storing and managing refresh tokens within IdentityServer).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure refresh tokens are securely stored within IdentityServer's data store.
*   Encrypt refresh tokens at rest within the IdentityServer database.
*   Implement refresh token rotation within IdentityServer, invalidating the old refresh token when a new one is issued.
*   Tie refresh tokens to specific clients and user sessions within IdentityServer.
*   Implement mechanisms within IdentityServer to detect and revoke compromised refresh tokens (e.g., based on unusual usage patterns or user revocation).
*   Carefully consider the security implications of different refresh token grant types (e.g., offline access) configured within IdentityServer.

## Threat: [Weak Token Signing Keys](./threats/weak_token_signing_keys.md)

**Description:** IdentityServer uses weak or predictable cryptographic keys to sign JWT (JSON Web Token) access and ID tokens. If these keys, managed within IdentityServer, are compromised or easily guessed, an attacker can forge their own valid tokens.

**Impact:** An attacker can create arbitrary access tokens with any desired claims, allowing them to bypass authorization checks in applications relying on IdentityServer and gain full access to protected resources without legitimate authentication.

**Affected Component:** `Duende.IdentityServer.Services.ISigningCredentialStore` (for managing signing keys within IdentityServer), JWT Token creation process within IdentityServer.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use strong, cryptographically secure random keys for token signing within IdentityServer.
*   Rotate signing keys regularly within IdentityServer.
*   Securely store signing keys used by IdentityServer, preferably using hardware security modules (HSMs) or key vaults.
*   Implement mechanisms to detect and respond to potential key compromise within the IdentityServer infrastructure.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Redirect URIs](./threats/misconfigured_redirect_uris.md)

**Description:** The list of allowed redirect URIs for a client within IdentityServer is not properly configured or validated. An attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious authorization request directed at IdentityServer with a redirect URI they control. This can lead to the authorization code being sent by IdentityServer to the attacker's server.

**Impact:** The attacker can intercept the authorization code and exchange it with IdentityServer for an access token, gaining unauthorized access to the user's account and resources in applications relying on IdentityServer.

**Affected Component:** Client configuration within `Duende.IdentityServer.Stores.IClientStore`, Authorization Endpoint within IdentityServer, `Duende.IdentityServer.Validation.AuthorizeRequestValidator`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly define and validate redirect URIs for each client within IdentityServer's client configuration.
*   Avoid using wildcard characters in redirect URIs configured in IdentityServer.
*   Regularly review and audit client configurations within IdentityServer.

## Threat: [Exposure of Administrative Endpoints](./threats/exposure_of_administrative_endpoints.md)

**Description:** The administrative endpoints of IdentityServer are not properly secured and are accessible to unauthorized individuals. This could be due to misconfiguration of the web server hosting IdentityServer or network firewalls.

**Impact:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive configuration data within IdentityServer, manage clients and users within IdentityServer, and potentially compromise the entire IdentityServer instance, affecting all relying applications.

**Affected Component:** IdentityServer's administrative UI and API endpoints.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict access to IdentityServer's administrative endpoints to authorized personnel only.
*   Use strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing IdentityServer's administrative endpoints (e.g., multi-factor authentication).
*   Ensure that IdentityServer's administrative endpoints are not exposed to the public internet without proper protection (e.g., behind a VPN or using IP whitelisting).
*   Regularly audit access logs for administrative activities within IdentityServer.
