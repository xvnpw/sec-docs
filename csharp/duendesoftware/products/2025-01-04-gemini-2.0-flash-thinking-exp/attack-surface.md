# Attack Surface Analysis for duendesoftware/products

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configurations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configurations.md)

**Description:**  Duende IdentityServer ships with default settings that might not be secure for production environments.

**How Products Contributes:**  Provides default signing keys, administrative credentials, and CORS policies that are intended for development but can be exploited if left unchanged.

**Example:**  Using the default signing key in production allows attackers to forge tokens, impersonating legitimate users or services.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the IdentityServer instance, unauthorized access to protected resources, data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**  Change all default administrative credentials immediately upon deployment. Generate and securely store unique, strong signing keys. Configure restrictive CORS policies to only allow trusted origins. Review and disable any unnecessary default features or endpoints.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Client Redirect URIs](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_client_redirect_uris.md)

**Description:** Incorrectly configured redirect URIs for OAuth 2.0 clients can lead to authorization code interception.

**How Products Contributes:**  Manages and validates client configurations, including redirect URIs. Loose validation allows for manipulation.

**Example:** An attacker registers a malicious client with a redirect URI pointing to their server. A legitimate user initiates an authorization flow, and the authorization code is sent to the attacker's URI, allowing them to obtain an access token.

**Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and resources.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**  Strictly validate and sanitize redirect URIs during client registration and updates. Use exact matching for redirect URIs whenever possible. Avoid wildcard or overly permissive patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Client Credential Leakage](./attack_surfaces/client_credential_leakage.md)

**Description:** Client secrets, used for authenticating confidential clients, are exposed or stored insecurely.

**How Products Contributes:**  Requires the management and storage of client secrets for proper client authentication.

**Example:** Client secrets are hardcoded in the application's source code or configuration files, making them accessible to attackers who gain access to the codebase.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to resources protected by the compromised client, potential for further attacks using the client's privileges.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**  Never hardcode client secrets. Store them securely using environment variables, secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault), or secure configuration providers. Rotate client secrets regularly.

## Attack Surface: [Weak Token Signing Keys or Algorithms](./attack_surfaces/weak_token_signing_keys_or_algorithms.md)

**Description:** Using weak cryptographic keys or algorithms for signing JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) issued by Duende.

**How Products Contributes:**  Allows configuration of signing keys and algorithms used in the token issuance process.

**Example:** Using a short or easily guessable signing key or a deprecated algorithm like `HS256` with a weak secret allows attackers to forge valid tokens.

**Impact:** Token forgery, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users or services and bypass authentication and authorization.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**  Use strong, randomly generated signing keys with sufficient length. Prefer asymmetric algorithms like RSA or ECDSA over symmetric algorithms for production environments. Regularly rotate signing keys.
