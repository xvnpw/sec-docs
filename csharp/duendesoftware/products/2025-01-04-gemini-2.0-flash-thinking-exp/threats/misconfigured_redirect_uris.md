## Deep Threat Analysis: Misconfigured Redirect URIs in Duende IdentityServer

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Misconfigured Redirect URIs" threat within the context of an application utilizing Duende IdentityServer (specifically referencing the `duendesoftware/products` repository). This analysis is geared towards the development team to foster a better understanding of the vulnerability and guide effective mitigation strategies.

**1. Understanding the Vulnerability in Detail:**

The core of this vulnerability lies in the trust relationship between the Relying Party (RP, the application using IdentityServer for authentication) and the Authorization Server (AS, Duende IdentityServer). The RP registers with the AS, providing information about itself, including the allowed URLs where the AS can redirect the user after successful authentication. These are the **Redirect URIs**.

A misconfiguration occurs when these Redirect URIs are:

* **Too Broad:**  Using wildcards or overly permissive patterns (e.g., `https://*.example.com/callback`). This allows an attacker to register a malicious subdomain and receive the authorization code.
* **Incorrectly Specified:** Typos or omissions can prevent legitimate redirects, but more critically, unintended URLs could be exploitable.
* **Not Validated Properly:** The AS doesn't rigorously check the provided `redirect_uri` against the configured allowed list during the authorization request.

**How the Attack Works (Detailed Flow):**

1. **Attacker Crafts Malicious Request:** The attacker identifies a vulnerable client with a misconfigured Redirect URI. They craft a malicious authorization request targeting the IdentityServer's Authorization Endpoint. This request includes the client ID of the vulnerable application and a `redirect_uri` controlled by the attacker (e.g., `https://attacker.com/evil_callback`).

2. **User Interaction (Optional but Common):** The attacker might trick a user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a compromised website that initiates this authorization request.

3. **IdentityServer Processes Request:** The IdentityServer receives the authorization request. Due to the misconfiguration, the `AuthorizeRequestValidator` (or its underlying logic) fails to properly validate the attacker's `redirect_uri` against the allowed list for the targeted client.

4. **User Authenticates (If Necessary):** If the user is not already authenticated, they will be prompted to log in to IdentityServer.

5. **Authorization Code Issued (to Attacker's URI):** After successful authentication (and authorization, if applicable), IdentityServer generates an authorization code. Crucially, because the `redirect_uri` was not properly validated, this code is sent to the attacker's specified URI (`https://attacker.com/evil_callback`) instead of the legitimate application's callback URL.

6. **Attacker Intercepts the Code:** The attacker's server receives the authorization code in the redirect response.

7. **Attacker Exchanges Code for Access Token:** The attacker uses the intercepted authorization code and the client's credentials (which are typically public for OAuth 2.0 clients using the authorization code flow) to make a token request to IdentityServer's Token Endpoint. IdentityServer, believing it's communicating with the legitimate client (as the code is valid), issues an access token.

8. **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker now possesses a valid access token for the targeted user and client. They can use this token to access protected resources and APIs that the legitimate application has access to, effectively impersonating the user.

**2. Impact Breakdown:**

* **Account Takeover:** The most severe impact is the attacker gaining complete control over the user's account within the relying applications. They can access personal data, modify settings, and perform actions as the legitimate user.
* **Data Breach:** If the relying application handles sensitive data, the attacker can exfiltrate this information.
* **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the reputation of both the relying application and the organization responsible for it. Users may lose trust and abandon the platform.
* **Financial Loss:** Depending on the nature of the application, the attack could lead to financial losses for users or the organization.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Data breaches resulting from this vulnerability can lead to violations of privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and associated penalties.

**3. Affected Components in Detail:**

* **`Duende.IdentityServer.Stores.IClientStore`:** This interface and its implementations are responsible for storing and retrieving client configuration data, including the allowed Redirect URIs. A misconfiguration here directly leads to the vulnerability. If the data stored is incorrect or too permissive, the validation process will be flawed.
    * **Potential Issues:**
        * Manual configuration errors in the data store (e.g., database, in-memory store).
        * Insecure methods for updating client configurations.
        * Lack of proper input validation when adding or modifying client data.

* **Authorization Endpoint within IdentityServer:** This endpoint (`/connect/authorize`) is the entry point for authorization requests. It receives the `redirect_uri` parameter from the client.
    * **Potential Issues:**
        * Insufficient logging of the received `redirect_uri` for debugging and auditing.
        * Lack of rate limiting or other security measures to prevent attackers from repeatedly probing for vulnerable configurations.

* **`Duende.IdentityServer.Validation.AuthorizeRequestValidator`:** This component is crucial for validating incoming authorization requests, including the `redirect_uri`. It compares the provided URI against the configured allowed URIs for the requesting client.
    * **Potential Issues:**
        * **Loose Matching Logic:**  The validator might use overly simplistic string comparison or regex patterns that are susceptible to bypasses. For example, simply checking if the provided URI *contains* one of the allowed URIs is insufficient.
        * **Ignoring URI Components:** The validator might not properly consider all components of the URI (scheme, host, port, path, query parameters, fragment) during validation.
        * **Case Sensitivity Issues:**  Inconsistent handling of case sensitivity in URI comparison can lead to bypasses.
        * **Lack of Normalization:**  The validator might not normalize URIs before comparison (e.g., removing trailing slashes, decoding URL-encoded characters), leading to mismatches or bypasses.
        * **Vulnerabilities in External Libraries:** If the validator relies on external libraries for URI parsing or comparison, vulnerabilities in those libraries could be exploited.

**4. Elaborating on Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Strictly Define and Validate Redirect URIs:**
    * **Exact Matching:**  Prefer exact string matching for Redirect URIs. Avoid any form of pattern matching or wildcards unless absolutely necessary and carefully scrutinized.
    * **Scheme Enforcement:**  Enforce the `https://` scheme for Redirect URIs to prevent interception of the authorization code over insecure connections.
    * **Path Specificity:** Be as specific as possible with the path component of the URI. Avoid using the root path (`/`) as a redirect URI.
    * **No Query Parameters or Fragments:** Ideally, avoid including query parameters or fragments in the configured Redirect URIs. If necessary, validate them strictly.
    * **Regular Expressions (Use with Extreme Caution):** If wildcards or patterns are unavoidable, use carefully crafted and thoroughly tested regular expressions. Ensure they are anchored to prevent unexpected matches.

* **Avoid Using Wildcard Characters:**
    * **Security Risk:** Wildcards introduce significant risk as they allow redirects to any subdomain or path matching the pattern.
    * **Maintenance Overhead:** Managing and understanding the implications of wildcard patterns can become complex over time.
    * **Alternatives:**  If multiple subdomains require the same callback functionality, consider registering each subdomain explicitly or using a more robust approach like dynamic client registration (with strong validation).

* **Regularly Review and Audit Client Configurations:**
    * **Automated Audits:** Implement automated scripts or tools to periodically check client configurations for potential issues, including overly permissive Redirect URIs.
    * **Manual Reviews:** Conduct regular manual reviews of client configurations, especially after deployments or changes.
    * **Version Control:** Store client configurations in version control to track changes and facilitate rollbacks if necessary.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only grant the necessary permissions to modify client configurations.
    * **Documentation:** Maintain clear documentation of the purpose and justification for each configured Redirect URI.

**5. Additional Mitigation and Prevention Measures:**

* **Use the `state` Parameter:**  Always use the `state` parameter in authorization requests and validate it upon the redirect. This helps prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, which can be combined with misconfigured Redirect URIs to amplify the impact.
* **Consider `response_mode`:**  Using `response_mode=form_post` can provide an extra layer of security by sending the authorization code via a POST request instead of directly in the URL. This reduces the risk of the code being exposed in browser history or server logs.
* **Input Validation on Client Registration:**  Implement robust input validation when registering or updating clients through any administrative interface. This prevents administrators from accidentally introducing misconfigurations.
* **Secure Defaults:** Ensure that the default configuration for new clients in IdentityServer is secure, with a restrictive set of allowed Redirect URIs.
* **Security Testing:**  Include testing for misconfigured Redirect URIs as part of your regular security testing process (e.g., penetration testing, static analysis).
* **Educate Developers:** Train developers on the risks associated with misconfigured Redirect URIs and the importance of secure client configuration.
* **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:**  Implement monitoring and alerting for unusual patterns in authorization requests, such as requests with unexpected or unknown Redirect URIs.

**6. Detection and Monitoring:**

* **Log Analysis:** Analyze IdentityServer logs for authorization requests with unusual or suspicious `redirect_uri` parameters. Look for patterns of requests targeting the same client with different, potentially malicious, redirect URIs.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate IdentityServer logs with a SIEM system to correlate events and detect potential attacks.
* **Alerting:** Configure alerts for suspicious activity related to authorization requests, such as a sudden increase in failed redirect URI validations or successful authorizations to unusual URIs.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of the IdentityServer deployment and configuration.

**7. Developer Guidance:**

* **Understand the OAuth 2.0 Flow:** Ensure a solid understanding of the authorization code flow and the role of the `redirect_uri`.
* **Treat Redirect URIs as Security-Sensitive:** Recognize the critical importance of correctly configuring and validating Redirect URIs.
* **Follow Secure Coding Practices:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization when handling Redirect URIs in your applications.
* **Test Thoroughly:**  Thoroughly test the authorization flow with various valid and invalid Redirect URIs to identify potential vulnerabilities.
* **Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** If possible, manage IdentityServer client configurations using IaC tools to ensure consistency and facilitate auditing.

**Conclusion:**

Misconfigured Redirect URIs represent a significant security risk in applications utilizing Duende IdentityServer. By understanding the attack mechanisms, potential impact, and affected components, development teams can implement robust mitigation strategies. A layered approach, combining strict configuration, regular audits, and proactive monitoring, is crucial to protect against this vulnerability and ensure the security of user accounts and sensitive data. Prioritizing secure client configuration within Duende IdentityServer is a fundamental aspect of building a secure authentication and authorization system.
