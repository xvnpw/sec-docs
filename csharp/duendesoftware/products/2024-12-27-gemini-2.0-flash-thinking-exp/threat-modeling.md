## High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Duende Software Products

This table outlines high and critical threats that directly involve Duende Software products (IdentityServer, Duende.BFF, and Duende.Admin).

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Compromised Client Credentials** | An attacker obtains client secrets (e.g., through code leaks, insecure storage) and uses them to request tokens from IdentityServer, impersonating a legitimate client application. | Unauthorized access to resources protected by the client application, potential data breaches. | IdentityServer (Client Configuration, Token Endpoint) | Critical | Strong secret generation and rotation policies, secure storage of client secrets (e.g., Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault), consider using client authentication methods beyond secrets (e.g., client certificates). |
| **Token Replay Attack** | An attacker intercepts a valid access or refresh token and reuses it to gain unauthorized access to resources. This could happen through network sniffing or compromised client-side storage. | Unauthorized access to resources. | IdentityServer (Token Endpoint, Resource Server Validation) | High | Implement token revocation mechanisms, short token lifetimes, consider using one-time use tokens or nonce values, enforce TLS for all communication. |
| **Token Manipulation** | An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in token generation or validation to modify token claims (e.g., user ID, roles, scopes). This could involve exploiting weaknesses in signing key management or validation logic. | Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities. | IdentityServer (Token Generation, Token Validation) | Critical | Use strong signing keys and algorithms, robust token validation logic, avoid storing sensitive information directly in tokens (use references), implement audience restriction, regularly rotate signing keys. |
| **Configuration Tampering (IdentityServer)** | An attacker gains unauthorized access to IdentityServer's configuration data (e.g., connection strings, signing keys) and modifies it to their advantage. This could be through compromised servers or insecure storage. | Complete compromise of the authentication and authorization system, data breaches. | IdentityServer (Configuration Store) | Critical | Secure storage of configuration data (e.g., encrypted at rest), strong access controls for configuration files/databases, regular auditing of configuration changes, implement infrastructure as code for configuration management. |
| **Leaking of Configuration Data (IdentityServer)** | Configuration files or endpoints inadvertently expose sensitive information like connection strings, API keys, or client secrets. An attacker can discover these through misconfigured web servers or unprotected endpoints. | Compromise of the authentication and authorization system, potential access to backend resources. | IdentityServer (Configuration Endpoints, Deployment Configuration) | High | Secure storage of configuration data, restrict access to configuration endpoints, avoid storing sensitive information in easily accessible files, implement proper access controls on deployment configurations. |
| **Resource Exhaustion (IdentityServer)** | Attackers send a large number of requests to IdentityServer, overwhelming its resources and causing it to become unavailable. This can be done through botnets or distributed attacks. | Disruption of authentication and authorization services, impacting application availability. | IdentityServer (All Endpoints) | High | Implement rate limiting, request throttling, and proper resource provisioning, use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to mitigate malicious traffic. |
| **Vulnerabilities in Custom Extensions (IdentityServer)** | If custom code or plugins are used with IdentityServer, vulnerabilities in this code could allow attackers to gain elevated privileges within the system. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities through crafted requests or malicious input. | Complete compromise of the authentication and authorization system. | IdentityServer (Custom Extensions, Plugin Framework) | Critical | Thoroughly review and test custom extensions, follow secure coding practices, keep dependencies up-to-date, perform static and dynamic code analysis. |
| **Session Hijacking (Duende.BFF)** | Attackers gain access to a user's session cookie or other session identifiers managed by Duende.BFF. This could be through XSS attacks or network sniffing. | Unauthorized access to resources protected by the BFF. | Duende.BFF (Session Management) | High | Implement secure session management practices (e.g., HttpOnly and Secure flags on cookies, short session timeouts, regular session regeneration), leverage built-in BFF session protection features, mitigate XSS vulnerabilities in the frontend. |
| **Manipulation of Backend Requests (Duende.BFF)** | Attackers intercept and modify requests sent from the BFF to backend APIs, potentially altering data or triggering unintended actions. This could happen through man-in-the-middle attacks if communication is not secured. | Data corruption, unauthorized actions on backend systems. | Duende.BFF (Request Forwarding, API Communication) | High | Implement strong input validation and sanitization on the BFF, use secure communication channels (HTTPS) for backend communication, leverage BFF features for request signing or encryption. |
| **Resource Exhaustion (Duende.BFF)** | Attackers send a large number of requests to the BFF, overwhelming its resources and causing it to become unavailable. This can be done through botnets or distributed attacks. | Disruption of application functionality, impacting user experience. | Duende.BFF (All Endpoints) | High | Implement rate limiting, request throttling, and proper resource provisioning for the BFF, use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to mitigate malicious traffic. |
| **Insecure Routing or Aggregation Logic (Duende.BFF)** | Vulnerabilities in how the BFF routes requests to backend APIs or aggregates responses could allow attackers to bypass authorization checks or access unintended resources. This could be due to logical flaws in the routing or aggregation implementation. | Unauthorized access to backend resources, potential data breaches. | Duende.BFF (Routing, Aggregation Logic) | High | Thoroughly review and test routing and aggregation logic, ensure proper authorization checks are performed before forwarding requests to backend APIs, leverage BFF's built-in authorization features. |
| **CSRF Vulnerabilities (Duende.BFF)** | If the BFF handles state-changing requests without proper CSRF protection, attackers can trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions. This can be done by embedding malicious requests in websites or emails. | Unauthorized actions on behalf of legitimate users. | Duende.BFF (Request Handling) | High | Leverage BFF's built-in CSRF protection mechanisms (e.g., synchronizer tokens). |
| **Compromised Admin Credentials (Duende.Admin)** | Attackers gain access to administrator credentials for Duende.Admin. This could be through phishing, brute-force attacks, or compromised administrator machines. | Complete control over IdentityServer configuration, potential for widespread compromise. | Duende.Admin (Authentication) | Critical | Enforce strong password policies, implement multi-factor authentication, regular credential rotation, restrict access to the admin UI to authorized personnel only, monitor admin login attempts. |
| **Unauthorized Configuration Changes (Duende.Admin)** | Attackers with access to Duende.Admin modify critical IdentityServer settings, such as client configurations, identity provider settings, or signing keys. This can be done by malicious insiders or attackers who have compromised admin credentials. | Compromise of the authentication and authorization system, potential for unauthorized access and data breaches. | Duende.Admin (Configuration Management) | Critical | Implement strong access controls within Duende.Admin (role-based access control), audit all configuration changes, consider using a separate, hardened environment for managing IdentityServer configuration, implement approval workflows for critical changes. |
| **Vulnerabilities in Duende.Admin itself** | Security vulnerabilities within the Duende.Admin application could allow attackers to gain elevated privileges within the IdentityServer management interface. This could be due to coding errors or outdated dependencies. | Complete control over IdentityServer configuration. | Duende.Admin (All Components) | Critical | Keep Duende.Admin updated to the latest version, follow secure deployment practices, perform regular security audits and penetration testing. |
| **Insecure Communication between BFF and IdentityServer** | If the communication between Duende.BFF and IdentityServer is not properly secured (e.g., using HTTP instead of HTTPS, missing certificate validation), attackers could intercept and modify requests or responses. This can be done through man-in-the-middle attacks. | Token theft, manipulation of authentication flows, unauthorized access. | Duende.BFF (Communication with IdentityServer) | High | Enforce HTTPS for all communication between BFF and IdentityServer, implement proper certificate validation (e.g., using trusted CA certificates). |
