# Attack Surface Analysis for duendesoftware/products

## Attack Surface: [OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/oauth_2_0__openid_connect_misconfiguration.md)

*Description:* Incorrect implementation or configuration of the core OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols within IdentityServer, leading to authorization bypass or token leakage. This is the most likely and impactful area of concern.
*Product Contribution:* Duende IdentityServer *is* the implementation of these protocols.  Vulnerabilities arise from *incorrect usage* of the framework's features and configuration options.
*Example:* Misconfigured `redirect_uri` validation allows an attacker to redirect to a malicious site after authentication, stealing tokens.  Another example: enabling the Implicit Flow when it's not appropriate, leading to token exposure in the browser.  A third example: failing to validate the `nonce` in an ID token, allowing for replay attacks.
*Impact:* Complete account takeover, unauthorized access to protected resources, data breaches.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Strict Protocol Adherence:**  Meticulously follow OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect specifications. Use the *correct* flows (Authorization Code Flow with PKCE is generally recommended).
    *   **Comprehensive Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate *all* protocol parameters: `redirect_uri`, `client_id`, `scope`, `state`, `nonce`, etc. Use allow-lists, not block-lists.
    *   **Secure Client Authentication:**  Enforce strong client authentication (e.g., `client_secret`, private key JWT) for confidential clients.
    *   **Robust Token Validation:**  Rigorously validate the signature, issuer, audience, and expiry of *all* tokens (ID tokens, access tokens, refresh tokens) on the receiving end (both client and resource server).
    *   **Configuration Review & Audits:**  Regularly review the IdentityServer configuration and conduct security audits, specifically focusing on protocol settings.
    *   **Leverage Duende's Validation:**  Utilize the built-in validation features of Duende IdentityServer to enforce security policies.
    *   **Disable Unused Features:**  Turn off any grant types or features that are not actively required.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Store Implementation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/custom_store_implementation_vulnerabilities.md)

*Description:* Security flaws in *custom* implementations of IdentityServer's data stores (e.g., `IUserStore`, `IClientStore`, `IResourceStore`). This is a major risk if custom stores are used.
*Product Contribution:* Duende IdentityServer *allows* for custom store implementations. The vulnerability resides entirely within the *custom code* provided by the developer, not within IdentityServer itself.
*Example:* A custom `IUserStore` with a SQL injection vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication or extract user data.  Another example: a custom `IClientStore` fails to properly validate client data, enabling the registration of malicious clients.
*Impact:* Data breaches, unauthorized access, denial of service, potential for complete system compromise.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical** (if custom stores are used)
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Adhere to secure coding principles when developing custom stores.  Prioritize input validation, data sanitization, and preventing injection vulnerabilities (SQLi, NoSQLi, etc.).
    *   **Extensive Security Testing:**  Perform thorough security testing of custom store implementations, including penetration testing and code review, specifically targeting data access and manipulation.
    *   **Parameterized Queries/ORM:**  *Never* use direct, concatenated SQL queries.  Use parameterized queries or an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) to prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Input Validation (Again):**  Validate *all* data retrieved from the custom store *before* using it.  Do not trust data from the store implicitly.
    *   **Prefer Built-in Stores:**  If at all possible, use the built-in stores provided by Duende IdentityServer, as they have undergone more extensive security testing and are maintained by the Duende team.

## Attack Surface: [Weak Cryptographic Practices](./attack_surfaces/weak_cryptographic_practices.md)

*Description:* Using weak cryptographic algorithms, insecure key management, or failing to rotate keys *within the IdentityServer configuration*.
*Product Contribution:* Duende IdentityServer uses cryptography for token signing, encryption, and other security-critical operations.  The vulnerability stems from *misconfiguration* or *improper use* of cryptographic settings.
*Example:* Using a weak or easily guessable key for signing JWTs. Storing signing keys in plain text in a configuration file or (worse) source code.
*Impact:* Token forgery, data decryption, compromise of sensitive information.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Strong Algorithms:** Use recommended cryptographic algorithms (e.g., RS256 or ES256 for JWT signing). Avoid deprecated or weak algorithms.
    *   **Secure Key Management:** Store keys in a *secure* location (e.g., a Hardware Security Module (HSM), a key management service, or a properly secured configuration store). *Never* store keys in source code.
    *   **Key Rotation:** Implement regular rotation of signing keys to limit the impact of a potential key compromise.
    *   **Duende's Utilities:** Leverage the built-in cryptographic utilities provided by Duende IdentityServer; they are designed to follow best practices.
    *   **Avoid Custom Crypto:** Do *not* attempt to implement custom cryptographic algorithms or protocols.

## Attack Surface: [Admin UI Misuse/Compromise (If Used)](./attack_surfaces/admin_ui_misusecompromise__if_used_.md)

*Description:* An attacker gains access to the Duende Admin UI and uses it to maliciously reconfigure IdentityServer or extract sensitive information.
*Product Contribution:* The Admin UI is a *product* provided by Duende for managing IdentityServer. The vulnerability is unauthorized access to, or misuse of, this *specific product*.
*Example:* An attacker gains access to the Admin UI via a weak password and disables security features or extracts client secrets.
*Impact:* Complete compromise of IdentityServer, data breaches, unauthorized access.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for *all* Admin UI users.
    *   **Access Restriction:** Limit network access to the Admin UI to authorized users and networks *only*.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC within the Admin UI to restrict the actions that users can perform.
    *   **Audit Activity:** Regularly audit Admin UI activity logs to detect suspicious behavior.
    *   **Consider Alternatives:** For heightened security, consider *not* using the Admin UI in production environments. Manage IdentityServer configuration programmatically or through configuration files instead.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Grant Type Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/custom_grant_type_vulnerabilities.md)

*Description:* Security flaws in custom grant type implementations.
*Product Contribution:* Duende IdentityServer *allows* for custom grant types. The vulnerability is entirely within the *custom code* implementing the grant type.
*Example:* A custom grant type that fails to properly validate user input, leading to the issuance of tokens to unauthorized users.
*Impact:* Unauthorized access, token leakage, potential privilege escalation.
*Risk Severity:* **High** (if custom grant types are used)
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Rigorous Code Review & Testing:** Perform extensive security testing of custom grant type code, including penetration testing and code review, focusing on authentication and authorization logic.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding principles, with a strong emphasis on input validation and authorization checks.
    *   **Avoid if Possible:** Use standard, well-vetted grant types whenever feasible.
    *   **Security Documentation:** Thoroughly document the security considerations and assumptions of any custom grant types.
