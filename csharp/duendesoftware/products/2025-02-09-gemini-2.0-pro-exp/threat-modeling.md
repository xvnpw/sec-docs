# Threat Model Analysis for duendesoftware/products

## Threat: [Client Impersonation](./threats/client_impersonation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker obtains or forges credentials (e.g., client ID and secret, or a client assertion) for a legitimate client application. They then use these credentials to make requests to the IdentityServer token endpoint, masquerading as the legitimate client. This leverages the core client authentication mechanism of IdentityServer.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, data breaches, potential for further attacks (e.g., privilege escalation).
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   IdentityServer: `Token Endpoint` (specifically, the code handling client authentication).
    *   IdentityServer: `Client Configuration Store` (if secrets are stored insecurely within the IdentityServer's storage).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use strong client authentication methods: Prefer `private_key_jwt` or Mutual TLS (mTLS).
    *   Securely store client secrets: Use a dedicated secrets management solution integrated with IdentityServer. *Never* hardcode secrets.
    *   Rotate client secrets regularly: Implement automated rotation within IdentityServer's configuration.
    *   Enforce PKCE: Require PKCE for *all* client types via IdentityServer's configuration.
    *   Monitor client authentication attempts: Leverage IdentityServer's logging to detect failed attempts.
    *   Client Assertion Validation: Rigorously validate client assertions (signature, issuer, audience, expiration) within IdentityServer's token endpoint logic.

## Threat: [User Impersonation via Token Manipulation](./threats/user_impersonation_via_token_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts a token issued by IdentityServer and modifies its contents (e.g., changing the `sub` or `roles` claims).  The vulnerability lies in insufficient validation *of the token signature* by the resource server, but the token *origination* is from IdentityServer.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   IdentityServer: (Indirectly, as the issuer of the token, and if signing keys are compromised). The *primary* vulnerability is on the resource server, but IdentityServer's key management is crucial.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strong Signing Algorithms: Use strong algorithms (RS256, ES256) within IdentityServer's configuration.
    *   Key Management: Securely manage IdentityServer's signing keys using an HSM or key management service.
    *   Nonce Validation: For ID tokens, ensure IdentityServer enforces and validates the `nonce` claim (in the implicit/hybrid flows).
    *   Consider JWE: Use JWE in addition to signing if the token contains highly sensitive data, configured within IdentityServer.

## Threat: [Identity Provider (IdP) Spoofing (Federation)](./threats/identity_provider__idp__spoofing__federation_.md)

*   **Description:** In a federated setup, an attacker sets up a malicious IdP or compromises a legitimate one, then tricks IdentityServer into trusting tokens from this malicious IdP. This directly exploits IdentityServer's federation capabilities.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breaches, potential system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   IdentityServer: `External Authentication Handlers` (code handling interactions with external IdPs).
    *   IdentityServer: `Federation Gateway` (if used).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strict IdP Whitelisting: Configure IdentityServer to only trust a pre-approved list of IdPs.
    *   Issuer Validation: Rigorously validate the `iss` claim within IdentityServer's external authentication handlers.
    *   Signature Validation: Validate signatures using the IdP's *correct* public key within IdentityServer.
    *   Secure Backchannel Communication: Use HTTPS and certificate validation for all communication with external IdPs, configured within IdentityServer.
    *   Mutual TLS (mTLS): Use mTLS for communication with external IdPs, configured within IdentityServer.
    *   Metadata Validation: Regularly validate IdP metadata within IdentityServer.

## Threat: [Configuration Tampering](./threats/configuration_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to and modifies the IdentityServer configuration (database, files, etc.) to weaken security. This directly targets the configuration mechanisms of IdentityServer.
*   **Impact:** Wide-ranging, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   IdentityServer: `Configuration Store` (database, files, etc.).
    *   IdentityServer: `Startup/Configuration Code`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Access Control: Strictly limit access to the IdentityServer configuration.
    *   Secure Configuration Management: Use a secure system (environment variables, secrets management) integrated with IdentityServer.
    *   Change Control: Implement a formal change control process for IdentityServer configuration.
    *   Auditing: Enable auditing of all configuration changes within IdentityServer.
    *   Regular Backups: Regularly back up the IdentityServer configuration.
    *   Monitoring: Monitor for unauthorized configuration changes.

## Threat: [Token Leakage](./threats/token_leakage.md)

*  **Description:** Although tokens can be leaked in many ways, IdentityServer's configuration and choices directly impact the risk.  For example, using the implicit flow (which IdentityServer *can* be configured to allow or disallow) directly increases the risk of token leakage.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   IdentityServer: (As the issuer of tokens, its configuration choices influence leakage risk).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Short-Lived Access Tokens: Configure IdentityServer to issue short-lived access tokens.
    *   Secure Refresh Token Handling:
        *   Use refresh token rotation: Configure IdentityServer to issue new refresh tokens.
        *   Bind refresh tokens: Use sender-constrained tokens or refresh token binding within IdentityServer's configuration.
        *   Limit refresh token lifetime: Set limits within IdentityServer.
