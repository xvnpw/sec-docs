## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Client Configuration and Least Privilege (Duende IdentityServer)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_client_configuration_and_least_privilege__duende_identityserver_.md)

*   **Description (Step-by-Step):**
    1.  **Define Scopes (IdentityServer):** Within the IdentityServer configuration (typically in `Config.cs` or similar), create specific, granular scopes that represent the *smallest* unit of access needed by clients.  Avoid broad scopes.  Example: `orders.read`, `orders.create`, instead of just `orders`.
    2.  **Client Registration (IdentityServer):** When registering clients in IdentityServer (again, usually in `Config.cs` or through the admin UI):
        *   **`AllowedScopes`:**  Assign *only* the precisely defined, granular scopes to each client.
        *   **`RedirectUris`:**  Specify the *exact*, full redirect URIs (including protocol and port) that the client is allowed to use.  No wildcards or patterns unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
        *   **`PostLogoutRedirectUris`:**  Specify the *exact*, full post-logout redirect URIs.
        *   **`ClientSecrets`:** Generate and securely store strong client secrets (using a secret management solution, *not* in the IdentityServer configuration files).
        *   **`ClientAuthenticationMethod`:** Choose an appropriate method (e.g., `client_secret_post`, `private_key_jwt`) based on the client type.
    3.  **Regular Review (IdentityServer Admin UI/Config):** Regularly (e.g., every 3-6 months) review *all* client configurations within IdentityServer.  Ensure scopes, redirect URIs, and other settings are still appropriate. Remove unused clients.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents clients from accessing resources they shouldn't.
    *   **Open Redirect (Medium Severity):** Strict `RedirectUris` prevent misuse of the authorization endpoint.
    *   **Token Leakage (High Severity):** Limited scopes reduce the impact of a leaked token.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Clients are restricted to their defined permissions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Open Redirect:** Risk virtually eliminated.
    *   **Token Leakage:** Impact minimized.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic client registration is implemented in `Startup.cs` (using `AddInMemoryClients`). Scopes are defined, but need review for granularity. Redirect URIs are specified, but need checking for exact matching.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formalized regular review process.
    *   Scope granularity needs improvement.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Token Handling and Management (Duende IdentityServer)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_token_handling_and_management__duende_identityserver_.md)

*   **Description (Step-by-Step):**
    1.  **`AccessTokenLifetime` (IdentityServer Client Config):** Set short lifetimes for access tokens (e.g., 5-15 minutes) in the client configuration within IdentityServer.
    2.  **Refresh Token Rotation (IdentityServer Client Config):**
        *   Set `RefreshTokenUsage` to `ReUse` or `OneTimeOnly`. `OneTimeOnly` is generally recommended for better security.
        *   Set `RefreshTokenExpiration` to `Sliding` or `Absolute`.
    3.  **HTTPS Enforcement (IdentityServer Configuration & Deployment):**
        *   Configure IdentityServer to *require* HTTPS. This is typically done in `Startup.cs` and through deployment settings (e.g., IIS, Kestrel configuration).
    4. **Token Binding (DPoP - IdentityServer and Client):** If supported by both the client and your IdentityServer configuration, implement Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession (DPoP). This requires configuration on both the IdentityServer and client sides.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Token Replay (High Severity):** Short lifetimes and rotation limit replay windows.
    *   **Token Interception (High Severity):** HTTPS prevents interception.
    *   **Session Hijacking (High Severity):** Refresh token rotation mitigates impact.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Token Replay:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Token Interception:** Risk virtually eliminated.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   HTTPS is enforced in the production environment.
    *   `AccessTokenLifetime` is set, but may be too long (currently 1 hour).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Refresh token rotation (`RefreshTokenUsage`, `RefreshTokenExpiration`) is not enabled.
    *   DPoP is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Correct OpenID Connect / OAuth 2.0 Flow Configuration (Duende IdentityServer)](./mitigation_strategies/correct_openid_connect__oauth_2_0_flow_configuration__duende_identityserver_.md)

*   **Description (Step-by-Step):**
    1.  **`AllowedGrantTypes` (IdentityServer Client Config):**
        *   For confidential clients, set `AllowedGrantTypes` to `GrantTypes.Code`.
        *   For public clients, set `AllowedGrantTypes` to `GrantTypes.Code`.  *Do not* use `GrantTypes.Implicit`.
    2.  **PKCE (IdentityServer & Client):**
        *   Ensure `RequirePkce` is set to `true` in the client configuration within IdentityServer.  This *enforces* PKCE.
        *   The client application *must* implement the PKCE flow correctly (generating `code_verifier` and `code_challenge`).
    3.  **`RequireConsent` (IdentityServer Client Config):** Consider whether to require user consent (`RequireConsent = true`). This is a UX decision, but also has security implications (users are explicitly informed about permissions).
    4. **Avoid Custom Grant Types:** Do not create custom grant types unless absolutely necessary and with a thorough understanding of security.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Authorization Code Interception (High Severity):** PKCE prevents this.
    *   **Protocol Confusion (High Severity):** Using the correct flow prevents vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Authorization Code Interception:** Risk virtually eliminated with PKCE.
    *   **Protocol Confusion:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `AllowedGrantTypes` is set to `GrantTypes.Code` for most clients.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `RequirePkce` is not consistently set to `true` for all clients.
    *   One client is incorrectly using the implicit flow (needs migration).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust User Management Configuration (Duende IdentityServer)](./mitigation_strategies/robust_user_management_configuration__duende_identityserver_.md)

*   **Description (Step-by-Step):**
    1.  **Password Policies (IdentityServer Configuration):** Configure IdentityServer's password policies (usually within the `AddIdentity` configuration in `Startup.cs`):
        *   `RequireDigit`, `RequireLowercase`, `RequireUppercase`, `RequireNonAlphanumeric`, `RequiredLength`.
        *   Consider using password history and expiration (if using IdentityServer's user management).
    2.  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) (IdentityServer Configuration):**
        *   Enable MFA support in IdentityServer.
        *   Configure supported MFA methods (e.g., TOTP).
        *   Enforce MFA through policies (e.g., requiring MFA for certain clients or users).
    3.  **Account Lockout (IdentityServer Configuration):** Configure account lockout settings (usually within the `AddIdentity` configuration):
        *   `MaxFailedAccessAttempts`, `DefaultLockoutTimeSpan`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (High Severity):** Account lockout prevents this.
    *   **Credential Stuffing (High Severity):** Strong passwords and MFA mitigate this.
    *   **Account Takeover (High Severity):** MFA significantly reduces risk.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Credential Stuffing:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Account Takeover:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic password policies are in place (minimum length).
    *   Account lockout is configured.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   MFA is not enabled.
    *   Full password complexity requirements are not enforced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Session Management (Duende.BFF)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_session_management__duende_bff_.md)

*   **Description (Step-by-Step):**
    1.  **Cookie Configuration (Duende.BFF):**
        *   Ensure that the BFF's session cookie configuration sets `Secure` to `true`.
        *   Ensure `HttpOnly` is set to `true`.
        *   Explicitly set the `SameSite` attribute to `Strict` or `Lax` (in the BFF configuration).
    2.  **Session Timeout (Duende.BFF):** Configure appropriate session timeouts in the BFF configuration.
    3.  **Sliding Sessions (Duende.BFF - if used):** If using sliding sessions, ensure a maximum session lifetime is enforced in the BFF configuration.
    4. **Logout (Duende.BFF and IdentityServer):** Ensure that the BFF's logout endpoint properly clears the BFF session *and* redirects the user to IdentityServer's logout endpoint (`/connect/endsession`) to terminate the global session.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Session Hijacking (High Severity):** Secure cookies prevent this.
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Medium Severity):** `SameSite` attribute mitigates CSRF.
    *   **Session Fixation (High Severity):** Proper session management prevents this.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **CSRF:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Session Fixation:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Duende.BFF is used.
    *   `Secure` and `HttpOnly` are set.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `SameSite` is not explicitly configured.
    *   Session timeout needs review.
    *   Logout needs thorough testing (including IdentityServer interaction).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Comprehensive Logging (Duende IdentityServer)](./mitigation_strategies/comprehensive_logging__duende_identityserver_.md)

*   **Description (Step-by-Step):**
    1.  **Enable Detailed Logging (IdentityServer Configuration):** Configure IdentityServer to log detailed information about security-relevant events. This is typically done by configuring the logging level for the `IdentityServer4` or `Duende.IdentityServer` namespaces (e.g., in `appsettings.json` or through code). Log:
        *   Successful and failed login attempts.
        *   Token issuance and validation.
        *   Errors and exceptions.
        *   Administrative actions.
    2. **Audit Trails (Duende IdentityServer):** Ensure that Duende IdentityServer is configured to log all administrative actions with sufficient detail.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **All Threats (Indirectly):** Logging is crucial for detection and response.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **All Threats:** Improves detection and response capabilities.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic logging is enabled.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Detailed logging of all security-relevant events needs to be verified and potentially enhanced.
    *   Audit trail configuration needs review.
