## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path: Incorrect Redirect URI Validation

### 4.1. Threat Modeling

**Attacker Motivation:**

*   **Account Takeover:**  Gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Data Theft:**  Steal sensitive user data or access protected resources.
*   **Financial Gain:**  Perform fraudulent transactions or access financial information.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Cause harm to the application's reputation.

**Attacker Capabilities:**

*   **Low Skill:**  The attack requires basic understanding of OAuth 2.0 flows and the ability to manipulate HTTP requests.  No advanced exploitation techniques are needed.
*   **Remote Access:**  The attacker can perform the attack remotely, without needing physical access to the system.
*   **Malicious Client Application:** The attacker controls a malicious client application registered with the IdentityServer (or can manipulate the `redirect_uri` in a legitimate client's request).

**Attack Scenarios:**

1.  **Wildcard Misconfiguration:** The IdentityServer is configured to allow wildcard redirect URIs (e.g., `https://*.attacker.com`). The attacker registers a client with a redirect URI like `https://login.attacker.com`.  During the authorization flow, the attacker can redirect the user to any subdomain under `attacker.com`.
2.  **Overly Permissive Matching:** The IdentityServer uses a flawed matching algorithm that allows similar-looking but attacker-controlled URIs (e.g., `https://legitimate-app.com` vs. `https://legitimate-app.attacker.com`).
3.  **Client-Side Manipulation:**  A legitimate client application has a vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject a malicious `redirect_uri` into the authorization request.  This could be due to an open redirect vulnerability in the client or a lack of proper input validation.
4.  **Parameter Tampering:** The attacker intercepts and modifies the authorization request, changing the `redirect_uri` parameter to point to their malicious server. This requires the attacker to be in a position to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, or to exploit a vulnerability in the client application that allows them to modify the request.

### 4.2. Exploitation Scenario Walkthrough (Wildcard Misconfiguration)

1.  **Setup:**
    *   The IdentityServer is configured with a client that allows redirect URIs matching `https://*.example.com`.
    *   An attacker registers a malicious client application with a redirect URI of `https://malicious.example.com`.
    *   A legitimate user initiates the login flow with the legitimate client application.

2.  **Authorization Request:**
    *   The legitimate client application redirects the user to the IdentityServer's authorization endpoint:
        ```
        https://identityserver.example.com/connect/authorize?
        client_id=legitimate_client&
        response_type=code&
        scope=openid profile&
        redirect_uri=https://legitimate.example.com/callback&
        state=...&
        nonce=...
        ```

3.  **Attacker Intervention:**
    *   The attacker intercepts the authorization request (e.g., through a phishing link or a compromised network).  They modify the `redirect_uri` parameter:
        ```
        https://identityserver.example.com/connect/authorize?
        client_id=legitimate_client&
        response_type=code&
        scope=openid profile&
        redirect_uri=https://malicious.example.com/callback&  <-- MODIFIED
        state=...&
        nonce=...
        ```

4.  **IdentityServer Processing:**
    *   The IdentityServer validates the `client_id` and, *incorrectly*, validates the modified `redirect_uri` against the wildcard configuration (`https://*.example.com`).  Because `https://malicious.example.com/callback` matches the wildcard, the request is considered valid.
    *   The user authenticates with the IdentityServer (providing their credentials).

5.  **Authorization Code Grant:**
    *   The IdentityServer generates an authorization code and redirects the user's browser to the attacker-controlled `redirect_uri`:
        ```
        https://malicious.example.com/callback?code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&state=...
        ```

6.  **Token Exchange:**
    *   The attacker's server receives the authorization code.
    *   The attacker's server makes a back-channel request to the IdentityServer's token endpoint, exchanging the authorization code for an access token (and potentially an ID token and refresh token):
        ```
        POST https://identityserver.example.com/connect/token
        Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

        grant_type=authorization_code&
        code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&
        client_id=legitimate_client&
        client_secret=LEGITIMATE_CLIENT_SECRET&  <-- Attacker must know or guess this
        redirect_uri=https://malicious.example.com/callback  <-- Must match the redirect_uri used in the authorization request
        ```
    *  **Important Note:** The attacker needs the `client_secret` of the *legitimate* client to successfully exchange the code.  This is a crucial point.  If the legitimate client is a public client (e.g., a Single Page Application) and doesn't use a secret, the attack is much easier.  If it's a confidential client, the attacker needs to obtain the secret through other means (e.g., client application compromise, configuration leaks).

7.  **Unauthorized Access:**
    *   The IdentityServer issues an access token to the attacker's server.
    *   The attacker now has an access token that allows them to impersonate the user and access protected resources on behalf of the user.

### 4.3. Impact Assessment

*   **Confidentiality Breach:**  The attacker can access any data or resources that the compromised user has access to.  This could include personal information, financial data, or proprietary business data.
*   **Integrity Violation:**  The attacker could potentially modify data or perform actions on behalf of the user, leading to data corruption or unauthorized transactions.
*   **Availability Impact:**  While not a direct consequence of this specific vulnerability, the attacker could potentially use the compromised account to launch further attacks that disrupt the availability of the application or its services.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack could severely damage the reputation of the application and the organization behind it, leading to loss of trust and potential legal consequences.
*   **Regulatory Compliance Violations:**  Depending on the type of data accessed, the attack could violate regulations like GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, or PCI DSS, resulting in significant fines and penalties.

### 4.4. Mitigation and Prevention Recommendations

1.  **Strict Redirect URI Validation:**
    *   **Avoid Wildcards:**  Do *not* use wildcard characters (`*`) in `AllowedRedirectUris`.  This is the most critical recommendation.
    *   **Exact Matching:**  Configure Duende IdentityServer to use exact string matching for redirect URIs.  The `redirect_uri` in the authorization request must *exactly* match one of the pre-registered URIs in the `Client` configuration.
    *   **Whitelist Approach:**  Explicitly list *every* valid redirect URI for each client.  Do not rely on pattern matching or regular expressions.
    *   **Duende IdentityServer Configuration:**
        ```csharp
        new Client
        {
            ClientId = "my_client",
            // ... other client settings ...
            AllowedRedirectUris =
            {
                "https://myclient.com/signin-oidc",
                "https://myclient.com/callback",
                // Add ALL valid redirect URIs here
            },
            // ...
        }
        ```

2.  **Client Application Security:**
    *   **Prevent Open Redirects:**  Ensure that the client application itself does not have any open redirect vulnerabilities that could be used to manipulate the `redirect_uri`.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Validate any user-provided input that might influence the construction of the `redirect_uri`.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Follow secure coding practices to prevent other vulnerabilities that could be leveraged to modify the authorization request.

3.  **Consider Using PKCE:**
    *   **Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE):**  Even with strict redirect URI validation, PKCE adds an extra layer of security.  It prevents attackers from exchanging the authorization code even if they manage to intercept it.  PKCE is *strongly recommended* for public clients (e.g., SPAs, mobile apps) and is good practice for confidential clients as well.
    *   **Duende IdentityServer Support:** Duende IdentityServer fully supports PKCE.

4.  **Regular Security Audits:**
    *   **Configuration Reviews:**  Regularly review the IdentityServer configuration, paying close attention to the `AllowedRedirectUris` for each client.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities, including those related to redirect URI handling.

5.  **Use the latest version of Duende Identity Server:**
    *   New versions often contains security fixes.

### 4.5. Detection Strategies

1.  **Configuration Auditing:**
    *   **Automated Scripts:**  Develop scripts to automatically check the IdentityServer configuration for wildcard or overly permissive redirect URIs.
    *   **Regular Manual Reviews:**  Include configuration reviews as part of regular security audits.

2.  **Logging and Monitoring:**
    *   **Log Authorization Requests:**  Log all authorization requests, including the `redirect_uri` parameter.
    *   **Monitor for Anomalies:**  Implement monitoring to detect unusual patterns in redirect URIs, such as:
        *   Requests with `redirect_uri` values that don't match the expected format.
        *   A sudden increase in requests to a particular `redirect_uri`.
        *   Requests with `redirect_uri` values pointing to unknown or suspicious domains.
    *   **Duende IdentityServer Logging:**  Leverage Duende IdentityServer's logging capabilities to capture relevant information.

3.  **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):**
    *   **Configure IDS Rules:**  Configure IDS rules to detect attempts to manipulate the `redirect_uri` parameter in HTTP requests.

4.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
     *  WAF can be configured to inspect incoming requests and block those with suspicious `redirect_uri` values.

5. **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP):**
    * RASP solutions can monitor application behavior at runtime and detect attempts to exploit vulnerabilities, including those related to redirect URI handling.

## 5. Conclusion
