# Attack Tree Analysis for duendesoftware/products

Objective: Gain unauthorized access to protected resources or user data within the application, or to impersonate a legitimate user, by exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations specifically related to the Duende IdentityServer or BFF components.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak Client Secrets/Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/weak_client_secretscredentials.md)

*   **Description:** The application utilizes easily guessable, default, or otherwise compromised client secrets for confidential clients. This allows an attacker to impersonate a legitimate client and gain access to resources authorized for that client. Duende IdentityServer relies on strong, unique client secrets to ensure only authorized clients can obtain tokens.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Very Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **High-Risk Path:** This is a direct path to the attacker's goal. Compromising the client secret allows the attacker to obtain tokens as if they were the legitimate client.
*   **Critical Node:** This is a foundational weakness. If client secrets are weak, the entire authentication and authorization process is compromised.

## Attack Tree Path: [Improper Grant Type Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/improper_grant_type_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** A client is permitted to use an OAuth 2.0 grant type that is inappropriate for its security context. For example, a confidential client (like a web app) might be allowed to use the implicit flow (designed for public clients), or the Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC) grant might be enabled unnecessarily. This exposes the application to attacks specific to the weaknesses of those grant types.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **High-Risk Path:** Exploiting an inappropriate grant type often leads directly to token theft or user impersonation. For instance, the implicit flow leaks tokens in the browser history, and ROPC exposes user credentials to the client application.
*   **Critical Node:** This misconfiguration fundamentally weakens the security of the OAuth 2.0 flow.

## Attack Tree Path: [Incorrect Redirect URI Validation](./attack_tree_paths/incorrect_redirect_uri_validation.md)

*   **Description:** The IdentityServer configuration allows overly permissive or wildcard redirect URIs after the authorization process. This enables an attacker to redirect the authorization code (or token, in the case of the implicit flow) to a malicious endpoint they control. This allows the attacker to steal the authorization code and exchange it for an access token, effectively impersonating the user.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High
*   **High-Risk Path:** This is a direct path to token theft and unauthorized access. The attacker intercepts the authorization code before it reaches the legitimate client.
*   **Critical Node:** Strict redirect URI validation is a crucial security control in OAuth 2.0.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigured Token Lifetime](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigured_token_lifetime.md)

*   **Description:** Access tokens or refresh tokens are issued with excessively long lifetimes. While this doesn't directly grant *initial* access, it significantly extends the window of opportunity for an attacker to use a compromised token (obtained through *any* means, including other vulnerabilities). A long-lived access token means the attacker has more time to access protected resources. A long-lived refresh token allows the attacker to obtain new access tokens for an extended period.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Very Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High
*   **High-Risk Path:** This is not a direct path to *initial* compromise, but it *greatly* amplifies the impact of *any* other successful token compromise. It enables persistent unauthorized access.
*   **Critical Node:** This is a critical enabler for persistence. It acts as a force multiplier for other vulnerabilities.
