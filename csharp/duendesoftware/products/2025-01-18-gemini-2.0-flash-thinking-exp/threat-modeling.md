# Threat Model Analysis for duendesoftware/products

## Threat: [Weak Signing Key Exploitation](./threats/weak_signing_key_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker obtains the signing key used by IdentityServer to sign tokens. They can then forge JWT tokens, impersonate legitimate users, and gain unauthorized access to protected resources. This could involve exploiting insecure key storage, insider threats, or vulnerabilities in key management processes *within the IdentityServer deployment*.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the authentication and authorization system, allowing attackers to access any resource protected by IdentityServer. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized actions, and reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** IdentityServer's Token Signing Mechanism (specifically the cryptographic functions and key storage *within IdentityServer*).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Generate strong, cryptographically secure signing keys *as configured for IdentityServer*.
*   Store private keys securely using Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) or Key Vaults *integrated with IdentityServer*.
*   Implement strict access controls to the key material *used by IdentityServer*.
*   Implement regular key rotation *within IdentityServer's configuration*.
*   Monitor access to key storage and audit key usage *related to IdentityServer*.

## Threat: [Insecurely Configured Token Endpoint](./threats/insecurely_configured_token_endpoint.md)

**Description:** The IdentityServer's token endpoint is misconfigured, allowing unauthorized clients or anonymous users to request access tokens. This could be due to overly permissive CORS policies, missing authentication requirements, or incorrect client configurations *within IdentityServer*.

**Impact:** Unauthorized issuance of access tokens, potentially granting attackers access to protected APIs and resources without proper authentication.

**Affected Component:** IdentityServer's Token Endpoint (specifically the authentication and authorization middleware *within IdentityServer* for this endpoint).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce client authentication for the token endpoint *within IdentityServer configuration*.
*   Implement strict CORS policies to restrict allowed origins *configured in IdentityServer*.
*   Regularly review and validate client configurations *within IdentityServer*.
*   Ensure proper authorization checks are in place before issuing tokens *by IdentityServer*.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

**Description:** IdentityServer or other Duende products rely on third-party libraries that contain known security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application or the IdentityServer instance itself. This could involve remote code execution, denial of service, or data breaches *within the Duende product's environment*.

**Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, the impact can range from denial of service to complete system compromise, including data breaches and the ability to manipulate IdentityServer configuration.

**Affected Component:** Various components within IdentityServer and other Duende products that utilize vulnerable third-party libraries.

**Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update Duende products and their dependencies to the latest versions.
*   Implement a robust vulnerability management process to track and remediate known vulnerabilities *in Duende products*.
*   Utilize software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify vulnerable dependencies *of Duende products*.
*   Monitor security advisories for Duende products and their dependencies.

## Threat: [Token Theft and Replay Attack](./threats/token_theft_and_replay_attack.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts a valid access or refresh token *issued by IdentityServer*. They can then replay this token to gain unauthorized access to protected resources or to obtain new access tokens. This could occur through man-in-the-middle attacks, compromised client-side storage, or insecure transmission channels *outside of IdentityServer's direct control, but exploiting tokens it issued*.

**Impact:** Account takeover and unauthorized access to protected resources, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions.

**Affected Component:**  The entire authentication and authorization flow *involving tokens issued by IdentityServer*, including token transmission and storage mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce HTTPS for all communication to prevent token interception.
*   Utilize short-lived access tokens *configured in IdentityServer*.
*   Implement refresh token rotation *supported by IdentityServer*.
*   Consider using token binding techniques to tie tokens to specific clients or devices.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass in Duende.BFF Routing](./threats/authorization_bypass_in_duende_bff_routing.md)

**Description:** Misconfiguration or vulnerabilities in Duende.BFF's routing or authorization logic allow attackers to bypass intended authorization checks and access backend APIs without proper authorization. This could involve incorrect route configurations or flaws in the authorization middleware *within Duende.BFF*.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to backend services and data, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation of backend systems.

**Affected Component:** Duende.BFF's routing and authorization middleware.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully configure routing rules and authorization policies within Duende.BFF.
*   Implement thorough testing of routing and authorization logic *in Duende.BFF*.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining access rules *in Duende.BFF*.
*   Regularly review and audit BFF configuration.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation in Duende.Admin](./threats/privilege_escalation_in_duende_admin.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in Duende.Admin allow an attacker with limited privileges to gain administrative access to the IdentityServer instance. This could involve exploiting flaws in the authentication or authorization mechanisms within the admin interface *of Duende.Admin*.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the IdentityServer instance, allowing attackers to modify configurations, create or delete users, and potentially disrupt the entire authentication and authorization system.

**Affected Component:** Duende.Admin's authentication and authorization logic, and potentially other administrative functions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing Duende.Admin.
*   Restrict access to Duende.Admin to authorized personnel only.
*   Regularly update Duende.Admin to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Implement audit logging for all administrative actions performed through Duende.Admin.

## Threat: [Data Manipulation through Insecure Duende.Admin Interface](./threats/data_manipulation_through_insecure_duende_admin_interface.md)

**Description:** The Duende.Admin interface lacks sufficient security controls, allowing attackers with unauthorized access (or through vulnerabilities) to manipulate critical IdentityServer data, such as client configurations, user accounts, and roles *within IdentityServer via Duende.Admin*.

**Impact:** Disruption of service, unauthorized access to resources due to modified configurations, and potential compromise of user accounts.

**Affected Component:** Duende.Admin's data management and modification functionalities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust authorization checks for all data modification operations within Duende.Admin.
*   Utilize input validation to prevent malicious data injection *in Duende.Admin*.
*   Implement audit logging for all data modification actions *performed through Duende.Admin*.
*   Consider implementing multi-factor authentication for accessing Duende.Admin.
