**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** Gemini (AI Language Model)

## 1. Introduction

This document provides an enhanced architectural design of the Duende Software products, as represented in their public GitHub repository: [https://github.com/duendesoftware/products](https://github.com/duendesoftware/products). This design document aims to provide a more detailed and nuanced understanding of the system's components, their interactions, and data flows, specifically for the purpose of threat modeling.

### 1.1. Purpose

The primary purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive and detailed architectural overview of the Duende Software product suite to facilitate effective threat modeling, specifically using methodologies like STRIDE. It aims to clearly identify key components, data flows, trust boundaries, and potential attack surfaces.

### 1.2. Scope

This document covers the following Duende Software products as represented in the GitHub repository:

*   Duende IdentityServer
*   Duende.Admin
*   Duende.BFF
*   Duende.AccessTokenManagement
*   Duende.DynamicProviders

It focuses on the logical architecture, key functionalities, and the types of data handled by these products. Deployment details, specific infrastructure configurations, and code-level implementation details are outside the scope of this document.

### 1.3. Target Audience

This document is intended for:

*   Security architects and engineers responsible for threat modeling, security assessments, and penetration testing.
*   Development teams working with or integrating Duende Software products, requiring a deeper understanding of the system's architecture and security implications.
*   Operations teams responsible for deploying, maintaining, and securing these products in production environments.

## 2. System Overview

Duende Software provides a suite of products centered around Identity and Access Management (IAM), primarily built upon the foundation of IdentityServer. The core product, Duende IdentityServer, acts as a standards-compliant OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 authorization server. The other products extend and enhance its capabilities, addressing specific needs in modern application development.

Here's a more detailed high-level overview of the system architecture, highlighting the types of interactions:

## 3. Component Details

This section provides a detailed description of each Duende Software product, including the types of data they handle.

### 3.1. Duende IdentityServer

*   **Description:** The central OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 authorization server. It manages user identities, authenticates users, authorizes clients, and issues security tokens.
*   **Key Functionalities:**
    *   Authentication of users via local accounts (username/password) or external identity providers.
    *   Authorization of clients to access specific resources based on configured scopes and grants.
    *   Issuance of various security tokens:
        *   Access Tokens (for accessing protected APIs).
        *   Refresh Tokens (for obtaining new access tokens without re-authentication).
        *   ID Tokens (containing information about the authenticated user).
    *   Management of clients (applications that request tokens).
    *   Management of API resources (the APIs being protected).
    *   Management of identity resources (user claims).
    *   Session management for authenticated users.
    *   Consent management for user authorization decisions.
*   **Key Technologies:** ASP.NET Core, OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, potentially Entity Framework Core for data access.
*   **Data Storage:**
    *   Configuration Data: Clients, API Resources, Identity Resources, Scopes.
    *   Operational Data: Authorization Grants, Consents, Keys.
    *   User Data: User credentials, profile information (if local accounts are used).
*   **Deployment:** Typically deployed as a standalone, secured web application.

### 3.2. Duende.Admin

*   **Description:** A web-based administrative interface for managing the configuration and operational aspects of Duende IdentityServer.
*   **Key Functionalities:**
    *   CRUD operations for clients, API resources, and identity resources.
    *   User management (creation, modification, deletion, password resets for local accounts).
    *   Configuration of IdentityServer settings (e.g., signing keys, CORS policies).
    *   Viewing operational data (e.g., active grants, logged-in users).
    *   Auditing and logging of administrative actions.
*   **Key Technologies:** ASP.NET Core, a UI framework (likely Blazor or Razor Pages), potentially using the IdentityServer's API for management operations.
*   **Data Storage:** Primarily interacts with the same data store as Duende IdentityServer to manage configuration and view operational data. May have its own local storage for UI-specific settings.
*   **Deployment:** Deployed as a separate, secured web application that communicates with the IdentityServer instance, typically over HTTPS.

### 3.3. Duende.BFF (Backend For Frontend)

*   **Description:** A library for building secure backends for frontends. It acts as an intermediary between the frontend and backend APIs, handling authentication, authorization, and token management.
*   **Key Functionalities:**
    *   Securely handles user authentication initiated from the frontend.
    *   Manages user sessions and security cookies.
    *   Acquires and manages access tokens on behalf of the user.
    *   Makes API calls to backend services, securely injecting the access tokens.
    *   Protects sensitive operations and data from direct frontend exposure.
    *   Implements security best practices like the BFF pattern to mitigate risks associated with client-side token handling.
*   **Key Technologies:** ASP.NET Core, potentially using libraries like `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect`.
*   **Data Storage:**
    *   Session Data: User authentication state, potentially short-lived tokens.
    *   Potentially a distributed cache for storing tokens or session information for scalability.
*   **Deployment:** Integrated into the backend application that serves the frontend.

### 3.4. Duende.AccessTokenManagement

*   **Description:** A library that simplifies the process of acquiring and managing access tokens for client applications that need to call protected APIs.
*   **Key Functionalities:**
    *   Token caching to reduce the number of token requests to the IdentityServer.
    *   Automatic token renewal using refresh tokens.
    *   Abstraction of the underlying token acquisition protocols (e.g., client credentials flow, authorization code flow).
    *   Provides a consistent API for requesting tokens, regardless of the grant type.
*   **Key Technologies:** ASP.NET Core, potentially using the IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt library for token handling.
*   **Data Storage:**
    *   Token Cache: Stores acquired access tokens and refresh tokens (securely). This could be in-memory or a distributed cache (e.g., Redis).
*   **Deployment:** Integrated into client applications (both server-side and potentially client-side with careful consideration).

### 3.5. Duende.DynamicProviders

*   **Description:** A library that enables the dynamic registration and configuration of external identity providers (e.g., social logins) at runtime, without requiring application redeployment.
*   **Key Functionalities:**
    *   Allows administrators to add and configure new external identity providers through a management interface or API.
    *   Stores the configuration details of these providers (e.g., client IDs, secrets, endpoints).
    *   Integrates with Duende IdentityServer to dynamically add authentication schemes based on the configured providers.
*   **Key Technologies:** ASP.NET Core, potentially interacting with a data store for provider configurations.
*   **Data Storage:**
    *   Provider Configurations: Stores sensitive information like client IDs and secrets for external identity providers. This data must be securely stored and accessed.
*   **Deployment:** Integrated into the Duende IdentityServer instance.
