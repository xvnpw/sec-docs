## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Duende IdentityServer](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_duende_identityserver.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents any successful exploitation of Duende to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities within Duende IdentityServer Products](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_within_duende_identityserver_products.md)

This path encompasses attacks that directly target weaknesses in the Duende IdentityServer software itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Duende Core](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_duende_core.md)

Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) or discover new flaws in the core Duende IdentityServer code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Unpatched Security Flaws (CVEs)](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_unpatched_security_flaws__cves_.md)

Exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated versions of Duende IdentityServer that haven't been patched.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Insecure Defaults or Misconfigurations](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_insecure_defaults_or_misconfigurations.md)

Taking advantage of default settings or incorrect configurations that introduce security weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Duende Admin UI](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_duende_admin_ui.md)

Targeting vulnerabilities within the administrative interface of Duende IdentityServer.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication Bypass or Privilege Escalation in Admin UI](./attack_tree_paths/authentication_bypass_or_privilege_escalation_in_admin_ui.md)

Gaining unauthorized access to the administrative interface or elevating privileges within it, allowing full control over the IdentityServer.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigurations or Improper Usage of Duende IdentityServer by the Application](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurations_or_improper_usage_of_duende_identityserver_by_the_application.md)

This path focuses on how the application developers might incorrectly configure or use Duende, creating vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Client Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_client_configuration.md)

Exploiting weaknesses in how the application's client is configured within Duende.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak or Predictable Client Secrets](./attack_tree_paths/weak_or_predictable_client_secrets.md)

Using easily guessable or brute-forceable client secrets, allowing attackers to impersonate the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Improper Token Handling by the Application](./attack_tree_paths/improper_token_handling_by_the_application.md)

Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application handles the tokens issued by Duende.

## Attack Tree Path: [Storing Tokens Insecurely (e.g., LocalStorage, Cookies without HttpOnly/Secure flags)](./attack_tree_paths/storing_tokens_insecurely__e_g___localstorage__cookies_without_httponlysecure_flags_.md)

Storing sensitive tokens in easily accessible locations, allowing attackers to steal them.

## Attack Tree Path: [Improper Token Validation](./attack_tree_paths/improper_token_validation.md)

Failing to properly validate tokens on the server-side, allowing attackers to use forged or manipulated tokens.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Duende IdentityServer Products](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_duende_identityserver_products.md)

This path involves exploiting vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries that Duende IdentityServer relies on.
