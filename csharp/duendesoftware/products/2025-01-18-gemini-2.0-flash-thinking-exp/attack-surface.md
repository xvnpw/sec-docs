# Attack Surface Analysis for duendesoftware/products

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Signing Key Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_signing_key_management.md)

**Description:** The cryptographic keys used by IdentityServer to sign tokens are compromised or weak.

**How Products Contribute:** IdentityServer relies on these keys for trust and integrity of issued tokens. If compromised, attackers can forge valid tokens.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the server's file system where the signing key is stored in plain text. They then use this key to create access tokens for any user.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the authentication and authorization system, allowing attackers to impersonate any user or service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store signing keys securely using Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) or secure key vaults (e.g., Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault).
* Implement key rotation policies to regularly change signing keys.
* Restrict access to key storage locations.
* Use strong, randomly generated keys.
* Avoid storing keys directly in configuration files or code.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Client Applications](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_client_applications.md)

**Description:** OAuth 2.0/OIDC client applications are configured insecurely within IdentityServer.

**How Products Contribute:** IdentityServer manages client configurations. Incorrect settings can create vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A client is configured with an overly permissive `redirect_uri`, allowing an attacker to redirect the authorization code to their own malicious site and steal it.

**Impact:**  Authorization code theft, access token theft, account takeover.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strict `redirect_uri` matching and avoid wildcards where possible.
* Use confidential clients whenever possible and store client secrets securely.
* Properly configure allowed grant types for each client.
* Regularly review and audit client configurations.
* Implement Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for public clients.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Extension Points](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_extension_points.md)

**Description:** Security flaws are introduced through custom code implemented in IdentityServer's extension points (e.g., user stores, profile services, event handlers).

**How Products Contribute:** IdentityServer provides extensibility, but the security of custom code is the developer's responsibility.

**Example:** A custom user store implementation is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication.

**Impact:**  Authentication bypass, data breaches, privilege escalation, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Follow secure coding practices when developing custom extensions.
* Perform thorough security testing (including static and dynamic analysis) of custom code.
* Regularly update and patch any third-party libraries used in custom extensions.
* Implement proper input validation and sanitization.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Communication with Backend APIs (Duende.BFF)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_communication_with_backend_apis__duende_bff_.md)

**Description:** Communication between Duende.BFF and backend APIs is not properly secured.

**How Products Contribute:** Duende.BFF acts as a gateway to backend APIs. Insecure communication exposes sensitive data.

**Example:** Duende.BFF communicates with a backend API over HTTP instead of HTTPS, allowing an attacker to intercept sensitive data in transit.

**Impact:** Data breaches, exposure of API keys or secrets, man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always use HTTPS for communication between Duende.BFF and backend APIs.
* Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) for stronger authentication.
* Securely manage and store any API keys or secrets used for backend communication.
* Implement proper authorization checks within Duende.BFF before forwarding requests to backend APIs.

## Attack Surface: [Session Management Vulnerabilities (Duende.BFF)](./attack_surfaces/session_management_vulnerabilities__duende_bff_.md)

**Description:**  Session handling in Duende.BFF is vulnerable to attacks like session fixation or session hijacking.

**How Products Contribute:** Duende.BFF manages user sessions. Weaknesses in this management can be exploited.

**Example:** Duende.BFF uses predictable session IDs, allowing an attacker to guess a valid session ID and hijack a user's session.

**Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and functionality.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use strong, randomly generated, and unpredictable session IDs.
* Implement proper session invalidation upon logout or timeout.
* Set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on session cookies to prevent client-side script access and ensure transmission over HTTPS only.
* Implement measures to prevent session fixation attacks (e.g., regenerating session IDs after login).
