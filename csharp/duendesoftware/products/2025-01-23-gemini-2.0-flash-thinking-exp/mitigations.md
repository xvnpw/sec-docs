## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration of IdentityServer](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_of_identityserver.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Regularly review IdentityServer configuration files (e.g., `appsettings.json`, `Config.cs`) and database settings.
    2.  Harden configuration by:
        *   Setting appropriate token lifetimes (access tokens, refresh tokens, ID tokens) in `TokenEndpointOptions`, `RefreshTokenOptions`, and `IdentityTokenOptions`.
        *   Configuring CORS in `AddIdentityServer` options to restrict allowed origins.
        *   Disabling unused flows and features in `AddIdentityServer` and client configurations (e.g., device flow if not used).
        *   Ensuring proper encryption algorithms are configured for data protection in `AddIdentityServer` options.
        *   Reviewing and hardening endpoint settings in `Endpoints` configuration within `AddIdentityServer`.
    3.  Implement secure secret management specifically for IdentityServer secrets:
        *   Signing keys configured in `AddSigningCredential`. Use strong keys and consider HSMs.
        *   Client secrets defined in client configurations.
        *   Database connection strings used by IdentityServer.
    4.  Enforce strong signing key management and rotation using `AddSigningCredential` and key management features provided by Duende IdentityServer.
    5.  Configure CORS in `AddIdentityServer` options and per-client `AllowedCorsOrigins` to restrict access to authorized origins.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exposure of Secrets (High Severity):  Hardcoded signing keys or client secrets within IdentityServer configuration can be exposed.
    *   Token Theft and Misuse (High Severity):  Long token lifetimes or insecure token handling in IdentityServer can increase the window for token theft and misuse.
    *   Unauthorized Access due to Misconfigured CORS (Medium Severity):  Permissive CORS configurations in IdentityServer can allow unauthorized origins to access sensitive endpoints.
    *   Exploitation of Enabled but Unused Features (Medium Severity):  Unnecessary features enabled in IdentityServer increase the attack surface.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of Secrets: High reduction. Secure configuration and secret management directly address secret exposure risks within IdentityServer.
    *   Token Theft and Misuse: High reduction.  Proper token lifetime and configuration within IdentityServer directly limit token validity and exposure.
    *   Unauthorized Access due to Misconfigured CORS: High reduction.  Correct CORS configuration in IdentityServer directly prevents unauthorized cross-origin requests.
    *   Exploitation of Enabled but Unused Features: Medium reduction. Disabling unused features reduces the attack surface of IdentityServer.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Example: Partially implemented - Basic configuration is done via `appsettings.json`. CORS is configured, but might be too permissive. Secret management for database is in place, but signing keys are file-based.]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Example:  Implement Azure Key Vault for signing key storage.  Review and harden CORS configuration.  Disable unused flows like device flow. Implement regular configuration reviews as part of security hardening.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Management and Vulnerability Scanning for Duende Products](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_management_and_vulnerability_scanning_for_duende_products.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Maintain up-to-date versions of Duende IdentityServer and related Duende products (e.g., Duende.IdentityServer.EntityFramework, Duende.IdentityServer.AspNetIdentity).
    2.  Regularly check for updates and security advisories specifically from Duende Software regarding their products.
    3.  Include Duende IdentityServer and related packages in dependency scanning processes. Use tools that can scan NuGet packages and identify vulnerabilities in these specific libraries.
    4.  Prioritize patching vulnerabilities reported in Duende IdentityServer and its direct dependencies.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Duende Products (High to Critical Severity):  Vulnerabilities in Duende IdentityServer or its libraries can be directly exploited to compromise the identity server and the applications relying on it.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Duende Products: High reduction. Keeping Duende products updated directly mitigates known vulnerabilities within the identity server itself.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Example: Partially implemented - We try to keep NuGet packages updated, but don't have a specific process for checking Duende security advisories or prioritizing Duende product updates.]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Example:  Establish a process for monitoring Duende security advisories.  Prioritize updates for Duende IdentityServer and related packages.  Ensure dependency scanning tools specifically cover NuGet packages and report vulnerabilities in Duende products.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Client Configuration within IdentityServer](./mitigation_strategies/secure_client_configuration_within_identityserver.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Apply the principle of least privilege when configuring clients in IdentityServer.
    2.  For each client, configure:
        *   `AllowedGrantTypes`:  Only allow necessary grant types. Restrict to the minimum required for the client's functionality.
        *   `AllowedScopes`: Grant only the necessary scopes. Avoid overly broad scopes like `openid profile email` if not all are needed.
        *   `RedirectUris` and `PostLogoutRedirectUris`:  Strictly whitelist allowed redirect URIs to prevent authorization code injection and open redirects.
        *   `ClientSecrets`:  Use strong, securely stored client secrets for confidential clients. Rotate secrets regularly.
        *   `AllowedCorsOrigins`:  Configure CORS settings per client to further restrict access.
        *   `AccessTokenLifetime`, `RefreshTokenLifetime`, `IdentityTokenLifetime`: Configure appropriate token lifetimes per client based on their security needs.
        *   `RequirePkce` and `AllowPlainTextPkce`: Enforce PKCE for public clients and avoid allowing plain text PKCE.
        *   `RequireClientSecret`: Enforce client secrets for confidential clients.
    3.  Regularly audit client configurations in IdentityServer to ensure they remain secure and aligned with application requirements. Remove or update outdated clients.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Client Impersonation/Unauthorized Access (High Severity):  Weak client configurations in IdentityServer can allow attackers to impersonate clients or gain unauthorized access.
        *   Scope Creep and Over-Permissions (Medium Severity):  Overly permissive client configurations can grant clients more permissions than necessary, increasing the potential impact of a compromised client.
        *   Authorization Code Injection/Open Redirects (Medium Severity):  Loosely configured `RedirectUris` can lead to authorization code injection attacks and open redirects.
*   **Impact:**
        *   Client Impersonation/Unauthorized Access: High reduction. Secure client configuration directly controls client authentication and authorization within IdentityServer.
        *   Scope Creep and Over-Permissions: Medium reduction.  Least privilege client configuration limits the impact of compromised clients.
        *   Authorization Code Injection/Open Redirects: Medium reduction. Strict `RedirectUris` configuration in IdentityServer directly prevents these redirect-based attacks.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Example: Partially implemented - Basic client configuration is done. Redirect URIs are configured, but might not be strictly whitelisted. Scope management could be improved.]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Example:  Implement a process for regular client configuration audits.  Enforce stricter whitelisting for Redirect URIs.  Review and refine client scope configurations to adhere to least privilege.  Document client configuration best practices.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Token Security Features in IdentityServer](./mitigation_strategies/token_security_features_in_identityserver.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Utilize IdentityServer's token customization and security features:
        *   Configure appropriate token lifetimes (`AccessTokenLifetime`, `RefreshTokenLifetime`, `IdentityTokenLifetime` in client configurations and global options).
        *   Implement token revocation using IdentityServer's revocation endpoints and mechanisms.
        *   Consider using reference tokens instead of JWT access tokens for increased security and revocation capabilities (configure in client settings).
        *   Ensure refresh token rotation is enabled and configured appropriately (using `RefreshTokenUsage.OneTimeOnly` and `RefreshTokenExpiration.Sliding` in client configurations).
        *   Configure JWT claim settings in IdentityServer to minimize sensitive data in tokens and control claim inclusion.
    2.  Strictly validate tokens on resource servers using Duende IdentityServer's validation libraries (`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` or `IdentityServer4.AccessTokenValidation` - depending on IdentityServer version and ASP.NET Core version).
    3.  Properly handle token revocation signals in resource servers and clients.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Token Theft and Misuse (High Severity):  Stolen tokens can be used for unauthorized access. Long-lived tokens increase the risk.
        *   Refresh Token Theft and Abuse (High Severity):  Compromised refresh tokens can be used to obtain new access tokens indefinitely.
        *   Token Replay Attacks (Medium Severity):  Without proper validation, tokens might be replayed by attackers.
        *   Excessive Data Exposure in Tokens (Medium Severity):  Including unnecessary sensitive data in tokens increases the risk if tokens are compromised.
*   **Impact:**
        *   Token Theft and Misuse: High reduction. Short token lifetimes and token revocation directly limit the impact of stolen tokens.
        *   Refresh Token Theft and Abuse: High reduction. Refresh token rotation and proper handling mitigate refresh token compromise.
        *   Token Replay Attacks: High reduction. Strict token validation on resource servers prevents token replay.
        *   Excessive Data Exposure in Tokens: Medium reduction.  Controlling claims in tokens minimizes sensitive data exposure.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Example: Partially implemented - JWT access tokens are used. Basic token validation is in place on resource servers. Refresh tokens are used, but rotation might not be fully configured. Token revocation is not implemented.]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Example:  Implement token revocation endpoints and client-side revocation handling.  Enable and configure refresh token rotation.  Review and optimize token lifetimes.  Consider using reference tokens for high-security scenarios.  Review JWT claim settings to minimize data exposure.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Endpoint Protection and Input Validation Specific to IdentityServer Endpoints](./mitigation_strategies/endpoint_protection_and_input_validation_specific_to_identityserver_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Apply rate limiting and throttling specifically to IdentityServer endpoints like `/connect/token`, `/connect/authorize`, `/connect/userinfo`, and `/connect/revocation`.
    2.  Implement input validation on all parameters accepted by IdentityServer endpoints. This includes:
        *   Validating `client_id`, `grant_type`, `scope`, `redirect_uri`, etc., in token requests.
        *   Validating `response_type`, `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, `scope`, etc., in authorization requests.
        *   Validating user credentials in the login endpoint (if using local accounts).
    3.  Protect IdentityServer endpoints from common web attacks:
        *   Ensure HTTPS is enforced for all IdentityServer communication.
        *   Set appropriate security headers (e.g., `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Content-Security-Policy`) in IdentityServer responses.
        *   Implement CSRF protection for relevant endpoints (though IdentityServer itself has built-in CSRF protection for some flows, ensure it's correctly configured and understood).
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Brute-Force Attacks on Authentication Endpoints (Medium to High Severity): Rate limiting protects against brute-forcing login or token endpoints.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (Medium to High Severity): Rate limiting can mitigate some DoS attempts targeting IdentityServer endpoints.
        *   Injection Attacks via Input Parameters (Medium Severity): Input validation prevents injection attacks through parameters sent to IdentityServer endpoints.
        *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity): HTTPS enforcement prevents eavesdropping and tampering with communication to IdentityServer.
        *   Clickjacking and other Browser-Based Attacks (Medium Severity): Security headers mitigate clickjacking and other browser-based attacks targeting IdentityServer UI (if any).
*   **Impact:**
        *   Brute-Force Attacks on Authentication Endpoints: High reduction. Rate limiting significantly hinders brute-force attempts.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks: Medium reduction. Rate limiting provides some DoS mitigation.
        *   Injection Attacks via Input Parameters: High reduction. Input validation directly prevents injection vulnerabilities.
        *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: High reduction. HTTPS enforcement eliminates MITM risks for IdentityServer communication.
        *   Clickjacking and other Browser-Based Attacks: Medium reduction. Security headers provide defense-in-depth against these attacks.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Example: Partially implemented - HTTPS is enforced. Basic input validation might be present. Rate limiting is minimal. Security headers are not explicitly configured.]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Example:  Implement robust rate limiting for critical IdentityServer endpoints.  Conduct a thorough review and enhancement of input validation for all endpoints.  Explicitly configure security headers in IdentityServer.  Review CSRF protection configurations.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Logging and Monitoring of IdentityServer Specific Events](./mitigation_strategies/logging_and_monitoring_of_identityserver_specific_events.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Configure comprehensive logging within IdentityServer to capture security-relevant events specific to its operation:
        *   Authentication failures and successes (including user and client details).
        *   Authorization decisions (grants and denials).
        *   Token issuance and revocation events.
        *   Client authentication events.
        *   Configuration changes within IdentityServer.
        *   Errors and exceptions originating from IdentityServer components.
    2.  Focus monitoring and alerting on these IdentityServer-specific logs to detect:
        *   Suspicious authentication patterns (e.g., repeated failures, unusual locations).
        *   Unauthorized access attempts (authorization denials).
        *   Token abuse or unusual token activity.
        *   Configuration tampering.
        *   IdentityServer errors that might indicate security issues.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Delayed Incident Detection in IdentityServer (High Severity):  Without specific logging and monitoring of IdentityServer events, security incidents within the identity server itself might be missed.
        *   Lack of Audit Trail for Authentication and Authorization (Medium Severity):  Insufficient logging of IdentityServer actions makes it difficult to audit authentication and authorization processes.
*   **Impact:**
        *   Delayed Incident Detection in IdentityServer: High reduction.  Specific logging and monitoring for IdentityServer events enables faster detection of security issues within the identity provider.
        *   Lack of Audit Trail for Authentication and Authorization: High reduction. Detailed IdentityServer logs provide a clear audit trail for security and compliance purposes related to authentication and authorization.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Example: Basic logging is enabled, but not specifically focused on security events within IdentityServer.  Monitoring and alerting are not configured for IdentityServer logs.]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Example:  Enhance logging configuration to specifically capture security-relevant IdentityServer events.  Configure monitoring and alerting rules based on these logs.  Integrate IdentityServer logs into centralized security monitoring systems.]
