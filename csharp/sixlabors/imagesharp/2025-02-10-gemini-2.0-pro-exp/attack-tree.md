## Attack Tree Path: [1. Achieve RCE [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1__achieve_rce__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker aims to gain complete control of the application server by executing arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit Decoder Vulnerability [CN] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit_decoder_vulnerability__cn___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability in one of ImageSharp's image format decoders.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Leads to RCE.
*   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium - Depends on the existence of vulnerabilities and the frequency of updates.
*   **Effort:** Medium-High - Requires finding a vulnerability and crafting an exploit.
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced-Expert - Requires deep understanding of image formats and exploit development.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-Hard - May be detected by IDS/EDR, but a well-crafted exploit can evade detection.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Buffer Overflow/Over-read in Specific Decoder [CN] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_buffer_overflowover-read_in_specific_decoder__cn___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts a malicious image file (BMP, GIF, TIFF, PNG, JPEG, or WebP) that triggers a buffer overflow or over-read when ImageSharp attempts to decode it. This allows the attacker to overwrite memory and potentially execute arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Leads to RCE.
*   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium - Depends on the specific decoder and the presence of vulnerabilities.
*   **Effort:** Medium-High - Requires understanding the specific image format and crafting a precise exploit.
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced-Expert - Requires in-depth knowledge of memory corruption vulnerabilities.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-Hard - May be detected by IDS/EDR or memory analysis tools.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.a - 1.1.1.f (Malicious BMP, GIF, TIFF, PNG, JPEG, WebP) [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_a_-_1_1_1_f__malicious_bmp__gif__tiff__png__jpeg__webp___hr_.md)

*   Each of these represents a specific image format. The attacker would tailor the exploit to the specific vulnerabilities of the chosen format's decoder. The details of each exploit would vary significantly.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.4 Dependency Vulnerabilities [CN] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_4_dependency_vulnerabilities__cn___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability in a library that ImageSharp depends on for image decoding.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Leads to RCE.
*   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium - Depends on the existence of vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   **Effort:** Medium-High - Requires finding a vulnerability in a dependency and crafting an exploit.
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced-Expert - Requires deep understanding of image formats and exploit development.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-Hard - May be detected by IDS/EDR, but a well-crafted exploit can evade detection.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Achieve DoS](./attack_tree_paths/2__achieve_dos.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker aims to make the application unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** Medium-High - Service disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Resource Exhaustion (CPU/Memory) [HR] [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_resource_exhaustion__cpumemory___hr___cn_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker sends requests designed to consume excessive server resources (CPU or memory), leading to a denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Medium-High - Application becomes unresponsive or crashes.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium-High - Relatively easy to trigger if input validation and resource limits are weak.
*   **Effort:** Low - Can be achieved with readily available tools.
*   **Skill Level:** Novice-Intermediate - Requires minimal technical skill for basic attacks.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy-Medium - Easily detected by monitoring resource usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1 "Image Bomb" (Decompression Bomb) [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_image_bomb__decompression_bomb___cn_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker uploads a small, highly compressed image file that expands to a massive size when decoded, consuming a large amount of memory and potentially crashing the application.
*   **Impact:** Medium-High - Can cause the application to become unresponsive or crash.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium-High - Easy to create and deploy if input validation is lacking.
*   **Effort:** Low - Requires minimal technical skill and readily available tools.
*   **Skill Level:** Novice - Can be performed by attackers with limited knowledge.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy-Medium - Easily detected by monitoring resource usage and implementing input validation.
