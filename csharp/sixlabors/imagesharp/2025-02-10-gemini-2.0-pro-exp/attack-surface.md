# Attack Surface Analysis for sixlabors/imagesharp

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (Memory)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion__memory_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit ImageSharp's image decoding and processing to consume excessive server memory, leading to application crashes or unavailability.
*   **How ImageSharp Contributes:** ImageSharp allocates memory to decode and process images. Malformed or excessively large images can cause it to allocate more memory than available.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a 1x1 pixel PNG image that is compressed but claims to be 10,000,000 x 10,000,000 pixels. ImageSharp attempts to allocate a massive buffer for the decoded image.
*   **Impact:** Application crashes, denial of service for legitimate users.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   *Strict Image Dimension Limits:*  Enforce maximum width and height limits on uploaded images (e.g., 8192x8192).  This is the *primary* defense.
    *   *File Size Limits:*  Enforce a reasonable maximum file size (e.g., 10MB).
    *   *Memory Limits:* Configure the application environment (e.g., using Docker, Kubernetes, or server settings) to limit the total memory available to the image processing component.
    *   *Input Validation:* Before passing the image to ImageSharp, validate the image metadata (if accessible) to check for suspicious dimensions or other indicators of a malicious image.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (CPU)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion__cpu_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft images or processing requests that consume excessive CPU cycles, slowing down or halting the application.
*   **How ImageSharp Contributes:** Image decoding, especially for complex formats or with transformations, requires CPU processing.  Maliciously crafted images or requests can maximize this processing time.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads an animated GIF with 10,000 frames, each with a very short delay, and requests a complex resizing operation on each frame.
*   **Impact:** Application slowdown, denial of service for legitimate users.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   *Frame Count Limits (Animated Images):*  Strictly limit the number of frames allowed in animated images (e.g., 100 frames).
    *   *Frame Delay Limits:* Enforce a minimum frame delay (e.g., 100ms) for animated images.
    *   *Transformation Restrictions:* Limit the complexity of image transformations allowed.  For example, disallow extremely large resizes or complex filters.
    *   *CPU Timeouts:*  Set timeouts for image processing operations.  If an operation takes longer than the timeout, terminate it.
    *   *Rate Limiting:* Limit the number of image processing requests per user or IP address within a given time period.
    *   *Caching:* Cache the results of image processing operations to avoid re-processing the same image multiple times.

## Attack Surface: [Code Execution via Image Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/code_execution_via_image_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in ImageSharp's image format parsers to achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **How ImageSharp Contributes:** ImageSharp contains parsers for various image formats.  Bugs in these parsers (e.g., buffer overflows) could be exploited.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malformed JPEG image that triggers a buffer overflow in ImageSharp's JPEG decoder, allowing the attacker to inject and execute malicious code.
*   **Impact:** Complete server compromise, data theft, malware installation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   *Keep ImageSharp Updated:*  This is the *most important* mitigation.  Regularly update to the latest version of ImageSharp to get security patches.
    *   *Disable Unnecessary Formats:* If the application doesn't need to support all image formats, disable support for less common or potentially more vulnerable formats (e.g., older or less-used formats).
    *   *Fuzzing:* Regularly fuzz ImageSharp's image parsers to proactively identify vulnerabilities.
    *   *Sandboxing:* Run image processing in a sandboxed environment (e.g., a separate container or process with limited privileges) to contain any potential exploits.
    *   *Code Reviews:* Conduct thorough code reviews of any custom code that interacts with ImageSharp, focusing on input validation and error handling.
    *  *Input validation:* Validate image metadata before processing.
