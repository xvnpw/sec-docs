# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for sixlabors/imagesharp

## Mitigation Strategy: [Image Dimension Limits (within ImageSharp processing)](./mitigation_strategies/image_dimension_limits__within_imagesharp_processing_.md)

**Description:**
1.  Define `MAX_WIDTH` and `MAX_HEIGHT` constants (or configuration settings).
2.  Use `Image.Identify(stream)` to obtain image dimensions *without* fully loading the image. This is crucial for efficiency.
3.  Compare the obtained width and height against `MAX_WIDTH` and `MAX_HEIGHT`.
4.  If *either* exceeds the limits, immediately throw a custom exception (e.g., `ImageTooLargeException`) or return an error.  Do *not* proceed with further ImageSharp processing.
5.  Log the rejection.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   *Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion (High Severity):* Prevents processing of extremely large images that consume excessive memory/CPU.
    *   *Decompression Bomb (variant of DoS) (High Severity):* Mitigates images that are small on disk but expand to huge sizes in memory.
    *   *Performance Degradation (Medium Severity):* Reduces processing time.

*   **Impact:**
    *   *DoS - Resource Exhaustion:* Risk significantly reduced.
    *   *Decompression Bomb:* Risk significantly reduced.
    *   *Performance Degradation:* Noticeable performance improvement.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented in `ImageUploadService.cs`, `ProcessUploadedImage` method. Constants `MAX_WIDTH = 2048`, `MAX_HEIGHT = 2048`. `Image.Identify` used. `ImageTooLargeException` thrown.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing in `ThumbnailService.cs`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Pixel Format Restrictions](./mitigation_strategies/pixel_format_restrictions.md)

**Description:**
1.  Identify the *required* pixel formats (e.g., Rgba32, Bgr24).
2.  Create a *custom* `Configuration` instance for ImageSharp.
3.  Within the `Configuration`, register *only* the `IImageDecoder` implementations for the allowed formats. *Do not* use the default configuration.
4.  Use this custom `Configuration` when loading/processing images.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   *Code Execution Vulnerabilities (High Severity):* Reduces the attack surface by limiting executed code paths within ImageSharp.
    *   *Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):* Prevents exploiting computationally expensive formats.
    *   *Information Disclosure (Low Severity):* Mitigates vulnerabilities in obscure format handling.

*   **Impact:**
    *   *Code Execution Vulnerabilities:* Attack surface significantly reduced.
    *   *DoS:* Some improvement in DoS resilience.
    *   *Information Disclosure:* Minor risk reduction.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented. Default ImageSharp configuration is used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Needs global implementation. Establish a central location for ImageSharp configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Frame Count Limits (Animated Formats)](./mitigation_strategies/frame_count_limits__animated_formats_.md)

**Description:**
1.  Define a `MAX_FRAMES` constant (or configuration setting).
2.  After loading an image, check `image.Frames.Count`.
3.  If `image.Frames.Count` exceeds `MAX_FRAMES`, reject the image (throw exception/return error).
4.  Log the rejection.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   *Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion (High Severity):* Prevents processing of animated images with excessive frame counts.

*   **Impact:**
    *   *DoS - Resource Exhaustion:* Risk significantly reduced for animated formats.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in `GifProcessingService.cs`. Limit hardcoded and too high (`MAX_FRAMES = 1000`).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Limit should be configurable.
    *   Missing for animated WebP images (`WebPService.cs`).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Metadata Handling (Strip or Whitelist)](./mitigation_strategies/metadata_handling__strip_or_whitelist_.md)

**Description:**
1. **Option A (Strip Metadata):** Use `image.Mutate(x => x.RemoveMetadata())` to remove all metadata.
2. **Option B (Whitelist Metadata):**
    *   Define a list of `AllowedMetadataKeys`.
    *   Iterate through metadata entries.
    *   If a key is *not* in `AllowedMetadataKeys`, remove the entry.
    *   If a key *is* allowed, sanitize the value before use.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * *Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):* Prevents leakage of sensitive information in metadata.
    * *Code Execution Vulnerabilities (Low Severity):* Reduces attack surface by limiting metadata processing.

* **Impact:**
    * *Information Disclosure:* Risk significantly reduced.
    * *Code Execution Vulnerabilities:* Minor risk reduction.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * No metadata handling implemented. Metadata is preserved.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * Needs implementation where images are processed and metadata is accessed. Decide between stripping or whitelisting.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unnecessary Features](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unnecessary_features.md)

**Description:**
1.  Review ImageSharp's documentation and identify unused features (encoders, decoders, processing operations).
2.  Use ImageSharp's configuration options (custom `Configuration` instance) to disable these features.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   *Code Execution Vulnerabilities (High Severity):* Reduces the attack surface.
    *   *Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):* May improve performance.

*   **Impact:**
    *   *Code Execution Vulnerabilities:* Attack surface reduced.
    *   *DoS:* Potential for minor performance improvements.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented. Default ImageSharp configuration is used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Requires review of ImageSharp features and application requirements. Implement during ImageSharp setup.
