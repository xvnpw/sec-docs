## Attack Surface: [Malicious Image File Parsing (Decoding Vulnerabilities)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_image_file_parsing__decoding_vulnerabilities_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitable flaws within ImageSharp's image decoding logic can be triggered by maliciously crafted image files.
*   **ImageSharp Contribution:** ImageSharp is responsible for parsing various image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, WebP, etc.). Vulnerabilities in its decoding implementations directly expose the application to attacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted JPEG image that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in ImageSharp's JPEG decoding process. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Code Execution:**  Successful exploitation can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Malicious images can crash the application or consume excessive resources, leading to service disruption.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Memory corruption vulnerabilities might, in some scenarios, lead to the leakage of sensitive information from the server's memory.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Immediately update ImageSharp to the latest version to patch known decoding vulnerabilities. Monitor ImageSharp security advisories and release notes for critical updates.
    *   **Input Validation (Limited Effectiveness for Decoding Flaws):** While general input validation is good practice, it's often insufficient to prevent attacks exploiting deep parsing vulnerabilities. Focus on keeping ImageSharp updated.
    *   **Sandboxing/Isolation:**  Consider running image processing operations in a sandboxed environment or isolated process with limited privileges to contain the impact of a successful exploit. This can prevent code execution from compromising the entire system.
    *   **Memory Safety Practices (Report Issues):**  While ImageSharp is managed code, report any suspected memory safety issues or crashes during image processing to the ImageSharp development team for investigation and fixes.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion via Complex Image Operations](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_via_complex_image_operations.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can leverage ImageSharp's image processing capabilities to perform computationally intensive operations, leading to resource exhaustion and Denial of Service.
*   **ImageSharp Contribution:** ImageSharp provides a rich set of image manipulation functions (resizing, filtering, effects, etc.).  Uncontrolled or excessively complex operations performed by ImageSharp can consume significant server resources.
*   **Example:** An attacker repeatedly requests resizing and applying multiple complex filters (e.g., blur, convolution) to extremely large images through the application's image processing endpoint. This can exhaust CPU and memory resources, causing the application to become unresponsive to legitimate users.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The application becomes unavailable or severely degraded for legitimate users due to resource starvation.
    *   **Performance Degradation:**  Overall application performance suffers as server resources are consumed by malicious image processing requests.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Limits:**  Strictly limit the maximum allowed image dimensions, file sizes, and processing parameters (e.g., filter complexity, number of operations) that can be processed by ImageSharp.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on image processing endpoints to restrict the number of requests from a single IP address or user within a given timeframe. This prevents attackers from overwhelming the server with processing requests.
    *   **Resource Quotas and Timeouts:**  Set resource quotas (CPU, memory) and timeouts for image processing operations. If processing exceeds these limits, terminate the operation to prevent resource exhaustion.
    *   **Asynchronous Processing and Queues:** Offload image processing to background queues or worker processes. This prevents resource-intensive operations from blocking the main application thread and improves responsiveness.
    *   **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms for processed images. If the same image processing request is made repeatedly, serve the cached result instead of re-processing the image, reducing resource consumption.
