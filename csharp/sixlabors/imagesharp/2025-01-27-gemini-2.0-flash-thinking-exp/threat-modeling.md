# Threat Model Analysis for sixlabors/imagesharp

## Threat: [Malicious Image Parsing Exploit](./threats/malicious_image_parsing_exploit.md)

Description: An attacker crafts a malicious image file (JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc.) specifically designed to exploit vulnerabilities within ImageSharp's image parsing logic. By uploading or providing this image for processing, the attacker aims to trigger a bug in ImageSharp's code that handles the image format. This could involve manipulating image headers, metadata, or embedded data structures to cause unexpected behavior during parsing.
Impact:
* Denial of Service (DoS): ImageSharp consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory) during parsing, leading to application slowdown or crash.
* Remote Code Execution (RCE): A parsing vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by overwriting memory or hijacking control flow during image processing.
* Information Disclosure: Parsing errors expose sensitive data from server memory or the image file itself.
Affected ImageSharp Component: Image decoders within `SixLabors.ImageSharp.Formats` namespace (e.g., `JpegDecoder`, `PngDecoder`, `GifDecoder`). Specifically, the code responsible for interpreting image file formats and extracting image data.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
* Keep ImageSharp Updated:  Immediately apply updates to the latest ImageSharp version to patch known parsing vulnerabilities.
* Resource Limits: Implement resource limits (CPU, memory, processing time) for image processing operations to mitigate DoS attacks if parsing becomes computationally expensive due to an exploit attempt.
* Sandboxing (Advanced): For high-security environments, consider isolating image processing within a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential RCE vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Algorithmic Complexity Exploitation in Image Processing](./threats/algorithmic_complexity_exploitation_in_image_processing.md)

Description: An attacker leverages computationally expensive image processing algorithms within ImageSharp by providing specific image inputs or processing parameters. The attacker aims to overload the server by forcing ImageSharp to perform resource-intensive operations, leading to a Denial of Service. This could involve requesting extreme image transformations (e.g., very large resizes, complex filter chains) that consume excessive CPU and memory.
Impact:
* Denial of Service (DoS): Server resource exhaustion (CPU, memory) causing application slowdown or unavailability for legitimate users.
Affected ImageSharp Component: Image processing modules within `SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing` namespace (e.g., `ResizeProcessor`, `FilterProcessor`). Specifically, algorithms for image transformations, filters, and other manipulations.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
* Input Validation and Sanitization:  Strictly validate and sanitize user-provided image processing parameters (e.g., resize dimensions, filter options) to prevent excessively large or complex operations. Reject requests with parameters exceeding defined limits.
* Resource Limits: Implement timeouts for image processing operations to prevent indefinite processing and resource exhaustion.
* Queueing and Background Processing: Offload image processing to background queues or worker processes to prevent blocking the main application thread and limit the impact of resource-intensive operations on user responsiveness.
* Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of image processing requests from a single user or IP address within a given timeframe to prevent abuse.
