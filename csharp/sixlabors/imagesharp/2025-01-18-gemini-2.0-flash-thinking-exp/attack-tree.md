## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via ImageSharp Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_imagesharp_exploitation.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the highest level of risk. Success at this node means the application's security has been breached due to ImageSharp vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Image Parsing Vulnerability for RCE](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_image_parsing_vulnerability_for_rce.md)

This node represents a critical weakness in ImageSharp's core functionality. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [ImageSharp Allocates Excessive Memory Without Limits](./attack_tree_paths/imagesharp_allocates_excessive_memory_without_limits.md)

This highlights a fundamental flaw in ImageSharp's resource management, making it susceptible to memory exhaustion attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [ImageSharp's Parser Fails to Handle Malformed Input Gracefully](./attack_tree_paths/imagesharp's_parser_fails_to_handle_malformed_input_gracefully.md)

This indicates a lack of robust error handling in ImageSharp's parsing logic, allowing attackers to crash the application with malformed images.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

This path represents the most severe outcome, allowing the attacker to gain complete control over the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Buffer Overflow during Image Decoding](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_buffer_overflow_during_image_decoding.md)

This classic vulnerability in image parsing can lead to memory corruption and potentially RCE.
    * Attack Vectors: Providing maliciously crafted image files that exploit buffer overflows during the decoding process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Format-Specific Vulnerability (e.g., in JPEG, PNG decoders)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_format-specific_vulnerability__e_g___in_jpeg__png_decoders_.md)

Vulnerabilities in the underlying libraries used by ImageSharp for decoding specific formats can be exploited for RCE.
    * Attack Vectors: Providing images specifically crafted to trigger known vulnerabilities in JPEG, PNG, or other supported image format decoders.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Metadata Handling (e.g., EXIF parsing)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_metadata_handling__e_g___exif_parsing_.md)

Flaws in how ImageSharp parses and handles image metadata can be exploited for RCE.
    * Attack Vectors: Embedding malicious code or data within image metadata (like EXIF tags) that is executed when ImageSharp processes the image.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/cause_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

This path aims to disrupt the application's availability, making it unusable for legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Image](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion_via_malicious_image.md)

Attackers can provide images that consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk), leading to a DoS.

## Attack Tree Path: [Memory Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/memory_exhaustion.md)

Specifically targeting memory consumption to overwhelm the server.
    * Attack Vectors: Uploading extremely large images or images that expand significantly during processing, causing ImageSharp to allocate excessive memory.

## Attack Tree Path: [Crash Application via Parsing Error](./attack_tree_paths/crash_application_via_parsing_error.md)

Sending malformed images to trigger errors in ImageSharp's parser, leading to application crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Malformed Image File](./attack_tree_paths/provide_malformed_image_file.md)

The initial step in exploiting parsing errors for DoS.
    * Attack Vectors: Providing image files that violate the format specification, causing ImageSharp's parser to fail.
