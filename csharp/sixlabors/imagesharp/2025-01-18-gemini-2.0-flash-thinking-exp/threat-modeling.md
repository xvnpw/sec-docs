# Threat Model Analysis for sixlabors/imagesharp

## Threat: [Maliciously Crafted Image File (JPEG)](./threats/maliciously_crafted_image_file__jpeg_.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted JPEG image designed to exploit a vulnerability in ImageSharp's JPEG decoding process. This could involve malformed headers, excessive data segments, or other techniques to trigger a bug.

**Impact:** Could lead to Denial of Service (application crash or hang), Remote Code Execution (if a critical vulnerability exists in the decoder), or information disclosure (memory leaks).

**Affected ImageSharp Component:** `SixLabors.ImageSharp.Formats.Jpeg.JpegDecoder`

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep ImageSharp updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
*   Implement strict input validation on uploaded image files, checking file type and size before processing with ImageSharp.
*   Consider using a separate, isolated process or sandbox to handle image processing, limiting the impact of a potential exploit.
*   Implement resource limits (memory, CPU time) for image processing operations.

## Threat: [Maliciously Crafted Image File (PNG)](./threats/maliciously_crafted_image_file__png_.md)

**Description:** Similar to the JPEG threat, an attacker uploads a PNG image crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in ImageSharp's PNG decoding, potentially through malformed chunks or compression issues.

**Impact:** Could lead to Denial of Service, Remote Code Execution, or information disclosure.

**Affected ImageSharp Component:** `SixLabors.ImageSharp.Formats.Png.PngDecoder`

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep ImageSharp updated.
*   Implement strict input validation.
*   Consider sandboxing image processing.
*   Implement resource limits.

## Threat: [Maliciously Crafted Image File (GIF)](./threats/maliciously_crafted_image_file__gif_.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads a GIF image designed to exploit vulnerabilities in ImageSharp's GIF decoding, potentially through issues with LZW compression or frame handling.

**Impact:** Could lead to Denial of Service, Remote Code Execution, or information disclosure.

**Affected ImageSharp Component:** `SixLabors.ImageSharp.Formats.Gif.GifDecoder`

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep ImageSharp updated.
*   Implement strict input validation.
*   Consider sandboxing image processing.
*   Implement resource limits.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow/Underflow in Image Dimensions](./threats/integer_overflowunderflow_in_image_dimensions.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides an image with extremely large or negative dimensions. This could cause integer overflow or underflow issues during calculations within ImageSharp's processing logic (e.g., when resizing or cropping), potentially leading to buffer overflows or other memory corruption.

**Impact:** Denial of Service, potential for memory corruption and Remote Code Execution.

**Affected ImageSharp Component:** Core image processing functions within `SixLabors.ImageSharp` namespace, particularly those dealing with image dimensions and buffer allocation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement validation on image dimensions before processing. Reject images with excessively large or negative dimensions.
*   Keep ImageSharp updated, as the library developers may have implemented checks against such issues.
