## Threat Model: Compromising Applications Using Semantic Kernel - High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Objective:** Gain unauthorized control or access to the application or its underlying resources by leveraging weaknesses in the Semantic Kernel integration.

**Sub-Tree of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   Compromise Application via Semantic Kernel [CRITICAL NODE]
    *   Exploit LLM Interaction Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]
        *   Perform Prompt Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]
            *   Inject Malicious Instructions into Prompts [HIGH-RISK PATH]
    *   Exploit Plugin Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]
        *   Identify and Exploit Vulnerable Native Functions [HIGH-RISK PATH]
    *   Exploit Configuration or Deployment Weaknesses [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]
        *   Expose Sensitive Information in Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]
            *   Hardcode API Keys or Credentials [HIGH-RISK PATH]
        *   Exploit Insecure Plugin Management
            *   Load Untrusted or Unverified Plugins [HIGH-RISK PATH]

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Nodes:**

*   **Compromise Application via Semantic Kernel:** This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. If successful, the attacker gains unauthorized control or access to the application and its resources. This node is critical because it signifies the complete failure of the application's security with respect to Semantic Kernel vulnerabilities.

*   **Exploit LLM Interaction Vulnerabilities:** This node is critical because it represents a broad category of attacks that directly target the core interaction between the application and the LLM. Successful exploitation here can lead to significant control over the LLM's behavior and the application's functionality.

*   **Perform Prompt Injection:** This node is critical due to the high likelihood and potential impact of prompt injection attacks. It's a direct way for attackers to manipulate the LLM's behavior and potentially the application's actions.

*   **Exploit Plugin Vulnerabilities:** This node is critical because successful exploitation of plugin vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, granting the attacker significant control over the application and its environment.

*   **Exploit Configuration or Deployment Weaknesses:** This node is critical because it often represents easily exploitable vulnerabilities stemming from common mistakes in configuration and deployment. Success here can provide attackers with direct access to sensitive information or the ability to introduce malicious code.

**High-Risk Paths:**

*   **Exploit LLM Interaction Vulnerabilities -> Perform Prompt Injection -> Inject Malicious Instructions into Prompts:** This path represents a direct and highly probable attack vector. Attackers can craft malicious instructions within prompts to force the LLM to perform unintended actions, such as data exfiltration or executing commands on the underlying system. The likelihood is high because many applications do not adequately sanitize user inputs before sending them to the LLM. The impact is critical as it can lead to significant security breaches.

*   **Exploit Plugin Vulnerabilities -> Identify and Exploit Vulnerable Native Functions:** This path involves attackers identifying and exploiting security vulnerabilities within the code of custom or built-in Semantic Kernel plugins. This could include common software vulnerabilities like code injection, buffer overflows, or format string bugs. The likelihood depends on the security practices followed during plugin development, but the impact is critical as successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.

*   **Exploit Configuration or Deployment Weaknesses -> Expose Sensitive Information in Configuration -> Hardcode API Keys or Credentials:** This path highlights a common and easily exploitable weakness. Developers may inadvertently hardcode sensitive information like API keys or database credentials directly into the application's configuration files. This makes it trivial for attackers to obtain these credentials and gain unauthorized access to external services or the application's data. The likelihood is medium-high due to this being a frequent developer oversight, and the impact is high as it provides direct access to sensitive resources.

*   **Exploit Configuration or Deployment Weaknesses -> Exploit Insecure Plugin Management -> Load Untrusted or Unverified Plugins:** This path focuses on the risks associated with insecure plugin management. If the application allows loading plugins from untrusted sources without proper verification or signing, attackers can introduce malicious plugins into the application's environment. These malicious plugins can then execute arbitrary code or perform other malicious actions. The likelihood depends on the application's design and security controls, but the impact is critical as it allows for the introduction of attacker-controlled code.
