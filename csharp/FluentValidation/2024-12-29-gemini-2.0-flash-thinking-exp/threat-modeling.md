- **Threat:** Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
  - **Description:** An attacker crafts a specific input string that exploits a poorly written or overly complex regular expression used directly within a FluentValidation `RegularExpressionValidator`. This input causes the regex engine to backtrack excessively, consuming significant CPU resources and potentially leading to application slowdown or denial of service.
  - **Impact:** Application slowdown, resource exhaustion, denial of service.
  - **Affected Component:** `RegularExpressionValidator` (within custom or built-in validators).
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Carefully review and test all regular expressions used in FluentValidation rules.
    - Employ techniques to prevent ReDoS, such as using non-backtracking regex engines or limiting the complexity of the expressions.
    - Consider using dedicated libraries for complex string validation instead of relying solely on regular expressions within FluentValidation.
    - Implement timeouts for regex execution within the application if possible, though this might not be directly configurable within FluentValidation itself.

- **Threat:** Information Disclosure through Verbose Error Messages
  - **Description:** An attacker submits invalid input to the application and analyzes the detailed error messages generated by FluentValidation. These messages, if not customized, might reveal sensitive information about the data model, validation rules, or internal application logic, aiding the attacker in understanding the application's structure and potential vulnerabilities.
  - **Impact:** Information leakage, aiding attackers in understanding the application's vulnerabilities.
  - **Affected Component:** `ValidationResult`, `RuleFor` configurations, default error message generation within FluentValidation.
  - **Risk Severity:** High
  - **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Customize error messages within FluentValidation to be generic and user-friendly, avoiding the exposure of internal details.
    - Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms in the application that separate user-facing errors from detailed debugging information. Configure FluentValidation to return less verbose errors to the client.
    - Avoid including sensitive data or internal implementation details in default FluentValidation error messages.
