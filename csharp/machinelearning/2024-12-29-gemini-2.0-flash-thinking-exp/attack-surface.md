### Key Attack Surface List (ML-Specific, High & Critical):

*   **Description:** Malicious Model Injection/Loading
    *   **How Machine Learning Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The application loads and executes machine learning models. If the source of these models is untrusted or lacks integrity checks, attackers can inject malicious models.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a crafted model file disguised as a legitimate one. This malicious model, when loaded by the application using `MLContext.Model.Load()`, contains code that executes arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, complete compromise of the server, data breach, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Validate Model Sources:** Only load models from trusted and verified sources.
        *   **Implement Integrity Checks:** Use cryptographic hashing (e.g., SHA256) to verify the integrity of model files before loading.
        *   **Restrict Model Storage Access:** Securely store model files with appropriate access controls.
        *   **Code Review:** Carefully review code that handles model loading and deserialization.

*   **Description:** Model Poisoning (Indirect)
    *   **How Machine Learning Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If the application uses user-provided data to train or fine-tune machine learning models, attackers can inject malicious or biased data into the training set.
    *   **Example:** In a sentiment analysis application, attackers submit numerous reviews with manipulated sentiment labels, causing the model to learn incorrect associations and produce biased results.
    *   **Impact:** Skewed model predictions, biased outcomes, reputational damage, potential financial loss due to incorrect decisions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Data Sanitization and Validation:** Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for training data.
        *   **Anomaly Detection:** Employ techniques to detect and filter out potentially malicious or anomalous data points in the training set.
        *   **Data Provenance Tracking:** Track the origin and modifications of training data.
        *   **Regular Model Retraining and Monitoring:** Periodically retrain models with fresh, validated data and monitor their performance for signs of poisoning.

*   **Description:** Adversarial Examples during Prediction
    *   **How Machine Learning Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Machine learning models can be susceptible to adversarial examples â€“ carefully crafted inputs designed to cause the model to make incorrect predictions.
    *   **Example:** In an image recognition system, an attacker subtly modifies an image of a stop sign, causing the model to misclassify it as a speed limit sign, potentially leading to dangerous situations in an autonomous vehicle context (if the application is related to that).
    *   **Impact:** Circumvention of security measures, manipulation of business logic, incorrect decision-making by the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Adversarial Training:** Train models with adversarial examples to make them more robust.
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  While not foolproof against all adversarial attacks, robust input validation can filter out some obvious manipulations.
        *   **Defensive Distillation:** Train a "student" model on the outputs of a more robust "teacher" model.
        *   **Input Transformation:** Apply transformations to input data that can disrupt adversarial perturbations.
