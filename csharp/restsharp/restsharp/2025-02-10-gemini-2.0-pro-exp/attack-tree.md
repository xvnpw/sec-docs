## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in how RestSharp (or the underlying libraries it uses) handles the deserialization of data received from a server. Deserialization is the process of converting data from a serialized format (like JSON or XML) back into objects that the application can use. If the deserialization process is not handled securely, an attacker can inject malicious code that gets executed when the data is deserialized.

*   **Sub-Vectors:**

    *   **[1.1 Use Unsafe Deserializer] `[CRITICAL]`**
        *   **Description:** This is the root cause of many deserialization vulnerabilities.  The application is configured to use a deserializer in a way that allows an attacker to control the types of objects that are created during deserialization.  A classic example is using `TypeNameHandling.All` in Newtonsoft.Json without a strict whitelist. This setting tells the deserializer to trust type information embedded in the serialized data, allowing the attacker to specify arbitrary types.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Avoid `TypeNameHandling.All` (or equivalent settings in other deserializers).
            *   Use `TypeNameHandling.None` if possible.
            *   If type information is necessary, use a strict, well-tested whitelist of allowed types.
            *   Consider using a deserializer that is designed for security and doesn't rely on type information from the serialized data.

    *   **[1.1.1 JSON.NET (Newtonsoft)] `[CRITICAL]`**
        *   **Description:** This specifically targets Newtonsoft.Json, a very popular JSON library often used with RestSharp.  Newtonsoft.Json has had numerous deserialization vulnerabilities over the years, particularly when used with unsafe configurations like `TypeNameHandling.All`.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Keep Newtonsoft.Json up to date.
            *   Follow the mitigation steps for "Use Unsafe Deserializer."
            *   Use a vulnerability scanner to identify known vulnerabilities in your dependencies.

    *   **[1.3 Inject Malicious Payload] `[CRITICAL]`**
        *   **Description:** This is the final step in the deserialization attack. The attacker crafts a malicious payload (usually JSON) that, when deserialized, will execute arbitrary code. This payload often contains "gadget chains" – sequences of objects and method calls that exploit the deserialization process to achieve code execution.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Input validation and sanitization *before* deserialization can help, but are not a complete solution.  The primary mitigation is to use a safe deserializer configuration.
            *   Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect attempts to exploit deserialization vulnerabilities.

    *   **[1.3.1 JSON]**
        *   **Description:** The malicious payload is crafted using JSON.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Weaknesses in Request Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_weaknesses_in_request_configuration.md)

*   **[3.1 Bypass Certificate Validation] `[CRITICAL]` `[HIGH-RISK]`**

    *   **Description:** This attack involves circumventing the checks that ensure the server the application is communicating with is legitimate.  RestSharp, like other HTTP clients, uses TLS/SSL certificates to verify the server's identity.  If certificate validation is disabled or improperly implemented, an attacker can perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, intercepting and potentially modifying the communication between the application and the server.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   *Never* disable certificate validation in production.
        *   If you need to customize certificate validation (e.g., for testing with self-signed certificates), use a *robust* and *secure* `RemoteCertificateValidationCallback`.  Ensure the callback properly checks the certificate chain, expiration, and revocation status.  *Never* simply return `true` from the callback.
        *   Use a trusted certificate authority (CA) for production certificates.

    *   **Sub-Vectors:**

        *   **[3.1.1 Disable] `[CRITICAL]`**
            *   **Description:** This is the most severe form of the vulnerability – completely disabling certificate validation. This leaves the application completely vulnerable to MitM attacks.
            *   **Mitigation:**  Never disable certificate validation in production code.
