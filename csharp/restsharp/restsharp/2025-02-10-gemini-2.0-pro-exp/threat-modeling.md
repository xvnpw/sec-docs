# Threat Model Analysis for restsharp/restsharp

## Threat: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data (RCE)](./threats/deserialization_of_untrusted_data__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a crafted response to the application using RestSharp. This response contains malicious data designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the deserializer (e.g., JSON.NET, System.Text.Json, XML parser). The attacker aims to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server by leveraging RestSharp's deserialization process.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker gains full control over the application and potentially the underlying server, allowing them to steal data, install malware, or disrupt services.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `RestClient.Deserialize<T>()` (and related methods like `Execute<T>()`, `ExecuteAsync<T>()`)
    *   The specific serializer/deserializer in use (e.g., `NewtonsoftJsonSerializer`, `SystemTextJsonSerializer`, `XmlSerializer`, `XmlDataContractSerializer`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Prefer `SystemTextJsonSerializer`:** Use the built-in `System.Text.Json` serializer/deserializer whenever possible.
    *   **Update Newtonsoft.Json:** If using Newtonsoft.Json (Json.NET), use the *absolute latest* patched version. Migrate to `System.Text.Json` if possible.
    *   **Secure XML Handling:** If using XML, *strictly* avoid `XmlSerializer`. Prefer `XmlDataContractSerializer` and *always* disable DTD processing: `new RestClientOptions { ConfigureXmlDeserializer = options => options.DtdProcessing = DtdProcessing.Prohibit }`. Avoid XML entirely if possible.
    *   **Type Whitelisting:** Implement a strict whitelist of allowed types for deserialization.
    *   **Input Validation (Content Type):** Validate the `Content-Type` header *before* deserialization.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep RestSharp and all serializer/deserializer libraries up-to-date.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan for vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via RestSharp](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_restsharp.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a malicious URL (or a component of a URL) that is then used by RestSharp to make a request.  The attacker exploits RestSharp's request-making capabilities to access internal services, sensitive files, or external systems that the application should not be able to reach. This is a *direct* threat because RestSharp is the component making the attacker-controlled request.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, data exfiltration, potential for further attacks on internal systems, denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `RestClient` constructor (where the base URL is set).
    *   `RestRequest` constructor (where the resource URL is set).
    *   Any method that accepts a URL or URL segment as input (e.g., `AddParameter`, `AddUrlSegment`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict URL Whitelisting:** Implement a *strict* whitelist of allowed domains and protocols. Do *not* allow arbitrary URLs.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** If user input *must* be used, sanitize and validate it thoroughly. Use a URL encoding library.
    *   **Avoid User-Provided URLs:** Whenever possible, avoid using user-provided URLs directly.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Use network segmentation to limit the application's network access.
    *   **Dedicated Service Account:** Use a dedicated service account with minimal network privileges.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs (Due to RestSharp Misconfiguration)](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_logs__due_to_restsharp_misconfiguration_.md)

*   **Description:** RestSharp, due to its configuration or how it's used, logs sensitive information (API keys, tokens, PII) from request headers, bodies, or URLs. This is a *direct* threat because it's RestSharp's logging behavior that exposes the data.
*   **Impact:** Credential theft, unauthorized access to APIs and services, data breaches, privacy violations.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `RestClient.UseDefaultSerializers()` (if default logging is enabled).
    *   `RestClientOptions.ConfigureMessageHandler` (if custom logging is implemented and logs sensitive data).
    *   `RestClient.AddDefaultHeader()` (if sensitive headers are added globally).
    *   Any method that adds parameters or headers to the request (e.g., `AddHeader`, `AddParameter`, `AddBody`) *if logging is misconfigured*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable Default Logging:** Disable RestSharp's default logging of request/response bodies and headers.
    *   **Custom Logging Filters:** Implement custom logging filters to *redact* sensitive data *before* logging.
    *   **Secure Log Storage:** Store logs securely with appropriate access controls and encryption.
    *   **Log Monitoring:** Implement log monitoring and alerting.
    *   **Avoid URL Parameters for Secrets:** Never include sensitive data in URL parameters.
    *   **Review `ConfigureMessageHandler`:** Carefully review any custom message handlers for logging issues.

## Threat: [Incorrect Certificate Validation (Man-in-the-Middle) via RestSharp Configuration](./threats/incorrect_certificate_validation__man-in-the-middle__via_restsharp_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** RestSharp is configured to disable or improperly handle HTTPS certificate validation, *directly* making the application vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. The attacker intercepts and potentially modifies the communication.
*   **Impact:** Data interception, data modification, credential theft, impersonation of the server.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `RestClientOptions.RemoteCertificateValidationCallback`
    *   `RestClientOptions.Proxy` (if a malicious proxy is configured)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable Certificate Validation:** *Never* disable certificate validation in production.
    *   **Proper `RemoteCertificateValidationCallback`:** If customization is needed, use `RemoteCertificateValidationCallback` to implement *robust* validation. Do *not* simply return `true`.
    *   **Trusted Proxy Configuration:** If using a proxy, ensure it is configured correctly and is trustworthy.
    *   **Certificate Pinning:** Consider certificate pinning (with careful management).
