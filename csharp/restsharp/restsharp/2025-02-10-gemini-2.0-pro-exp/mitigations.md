# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for restsharp/restsharp

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization (RestSharp Parameter Handling)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization__restsharp_parameter_handling_.md)

1.  **Use RestSharp's Parameter Methods Exclusively:**  *Always* use RestSharp's built-in methods for adding parameters: `AddParameter`, `AddQueryParameter`, `AddBody`, `AddFile`, etc.  *Never* manually construct query strings or request bodies by concatenating user-supplied input or any untrusted data.  RestSharp's methods handle the necessary encoding to prevent injection at the HTTP level.  Choose the correct method based on where the parameter should be placed (query string, URL segment, request body, headers).
2.  **Leverage `ParameterType`:** When using `AddParameter`, explicitly specify the `ParameterType` (e.g., `ParameterType.QueryString`, `ParameterType.UrlSegment`, `ParameterType.RequestBody`, `ParameterType.HttpHeader`).  This provides clarity and helps RestSharp handle the parameter correctly.  Avoid using `ParameterType.GetOrPost` as it can lead to ambiguity.
3.  **File Uploads (AddFile):** When uploading files, use `AddFile` and ensure you are validating the file content and type *before* passing it to RestSharp. RestSharp handles the multipart/form-data encoding, but you are responsible for the file's safety.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Indirect Injection Attacks (at the target API):** (Severity: High, depends on the target API) - Reduces the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities in the *target* API by ensuring that only properly encoded data is sent.  This prevents attackers from injecting malicious characters that could be misinterpreted by the receiving API.
    *   **HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP):** (Severity: Medium) - By using the correct `ParameterType`, you prevent ambiguity in how parameters are handled, mitigating HPP attacks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Indirect Injection:** Risk significantly reduced, as RestSharp handles the encoding.
    *   **HPP:** Risk reduced by explicit parameter type handling.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Parameter Encoding: Used consistently throughout the `Services/ApiService.cs` class (using `AddParameter`, `AddQueryParameter`).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Explicit `ParameterType`: The `ParameterType` is not always explicitly specified.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Deserialization (RestSharp Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_deserialization__restsharp_configuration_.md)

1.  **Use Safe Deserializers:** Configure RestSharp to use a safe deserializer. For JSON, prefer `System.Text.Json` (or a securely configured Newtonsoft.Json).  This is often the default, but it's good to be explicit. You can set the `Options.UseDefaultSerializers = false` and add only required serializer.
2.  **XML Deserialization (If Necessary):** If you *must* use XML deserialization, explicitly configure the underlying `XmlSerializer` used by RestSharp to disable the processing of external entities and DTDs.  You can achieve this by:
    *   Creating a custom `IXmlDeserializer` that configures the `XmlReaderSettings` appropriately (setting `DtdProcessing = DtdProcessing.Prohibit` and `XmlResolver = null`).
    *   Registering your custom deserializer with RestSharp using `RestClientOptions`.
3.  **Content Type Validation (Before Deserialization):** Before calling a deserialization method (like `ExecuteAsync<T>`), check the `response.ContentType` property and ensure it matches the expected content type (e.g., "application/json").  Do *not* attempt to deserialize if the content type is unexpected.
4. **Use Strongly-Typed Deserialization:** Deserialize responses to specific, well-defined classes (e.g., `ExecuteAsync<MyResponseModel>`) instead of generic types like `object` or `dynamic`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Deserialization Attacks (leading to RCE):** (Severity: Critical) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious code through crafted serialized data.
    *   **XML External Entity (XXE) Attacks:** (Severity: Critical) - Specifically prevents XXE attacks if XML is used.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Deserialization Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced by using safe deserializers and strong typing.
    *   **XXE Attacks:** Risk eliminated if external entities are disabled via custom `IXmlDeserializer`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   JSON Deserialization: Using `System.Text.Json` (implicitly, as it's the default).
    *   Strongly-Typed Deserialization: Used consistently in `Services/ApiService.cs`.
    *   Content-Type Validation: Basic check in `Services/ApiService.cs` before deserialization.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Explicit Deserializer Configuration: Not explicitly setting `Options.UseDefaultSerializers = false`.
    *   XML Deserialization Security: No custom `IXmlDeserializer` is implemented to handle XML securely (although XML is not currently used).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Authentication (RestSharp Authenticators)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_authentication__restsharp_authenticators_.md)

1.  **Use Built-in Authenticators:** For standard authentication methods (Basic, OAuth2, JWT), use RestSharp's built-in authenticators: `HttpBasicAuthenticator`, `JwtAuthenticator`, `OAuth2Authenticator`.  These classes handle the complexities of the authentication protocols and are less prone to errors than custom implementations.  Instantiate the appropriate authenticator and assign it to the `RestClient.Authenticator` property.
2.  **Configure Authenticators Correctly:** Provide the necessary credentials or configuration parameters to the authenticator (e.g., username/password for `HttpBasicAuthenticator`, client ID/secret for `OAuth2Authenticator`, token for `JwtAuthenticator`).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** (Severity: Critical) - Ensures that authentication mechanisms are implemented correctly, reducing the risk of bypass.
    *   **Incorrect Protocol Implementation:** (Severity: High) - Avoids errors in implementing complex authentication protocols.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** Risk significantly reduced by using built-in, well-tested authenticators.
    *   **Incorrect Protocol Implementation:** Risk minimized.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Built-in Authenticators: Using `JwtAuthenticator` in `Services/AuthService.cs`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   None (assuming the `JwtAuthenticator` is configured with the correct token retrieval mechanism).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Request and Response Interception (RestSharp Interceptors)](./mitigation_strategies/request_and_response_interception__restsharp_interceptors_.md)

1.  **Implement `IRestInterceptor` or Use Events:** Create custom interceptors by implementing the `IRestInterceptor` interface or by using the `RestClient.OnBeforeRequest` and `RestClient.OnAfterRequest` events.  These allow you to intercept and modify requests and responses.
2.  **Sanitize Logged Data:** Within the interceptors, if you log request or response data, *always* sanitize the data to remove sensitive information (credentials, tokens, PII) before logging.  Use the interceptor to access the `request` and `response` objects.
3.  **Add Security Headers:** Use interceptors to add security-related headers to requests (e.g., `Strict-Transport-Security`, custom headers for API keys).  This can be done by modifying the `request.AddHeader` method within the interceptor.
4. **Request and Response Validation:** Use interceptors to perform additional validation on the request or response, beyond what is done in the main application logic. For example, you could check for specific response codes or patterns in the response body that indicate an error or attack.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** (Severity: High) - Logging and inspection can help detect attempts to send sensitive data to unauthorized endpoints.
    *   **Unexpected API Behavior:** (Severity: Medium) - Helps identify and diagnose unexpected responses from the target API.
    *   **Injection Attacks (Indirect):** (Severity: High) - Interceptors can be used to further validate request data and potentially detect injection attempts.
    *   **Missing Security Headers:** (Severity: Medium) - Allows adding security headers to improve the overall security posture.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Increases visibility and helps detect anomalies.
    *   **Unexpected API Behavior:** Improves debugging and troubleshooting capabilities.
    *   **Injection Attacks:** Adds another layer of defense.
    *   **Missing Security Headers:** Improves security by enforcing secure headers.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic Logging Interceptor: A simple interceptor logs request URLs in `Services/ApiService.cs` using `OnBeforeRequest`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive Logging: The current interceptor doesn't log full request/response details.
    *   Sanitization: Logged data is not sanitized.
    *   Security Headers: No security headers are added via interceptors.
    *   Additional Validation: No additional validation is performed in interceptors.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Timeout and Retry Configuration (RestSharp Options)](./mitigation_strategies/timeout_and_retry_configuration__restsharp_options_.md)

1.  **Configure Timeouts:** Set appropriate timeouts on the `RestClient` using the `RestClientOptions.Timeout` and potentially `RestClientOptions.ReadWriteTimeout` properties.  This prevents the application from hanging indefinitely if the target API is unresponsive.  Choose timeouts that are appropriate for the expected response times of the API.
2.  **Implement Retry Logic (Carefully):** If appropriate, implement retry logic for transient errors. RestSharp *does not* have built-in retry mechanisms. You must implement this yourself, potentially using a library like Polly.  If you implement retries:
    *   Use exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the target API.
    *   Set a maximum number of retries.
    *   Only retry on specific error codes (e.g., 503 Service Unavailable, 429 Too Many Requests). *Do not* retry on client errors (4xx) other than 429.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Against Your Application:** (Severity: Medium) - Timeouts prevent your application from being blocked by slow or unresponsive APIs.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Against the Target API:** (Severity: Medium) - Careful retry logic (with exponential backoff) prevents your application from overwhelming the target API during temporary outages.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS (Your Application):** Risk significantly reduced by setting appropriate timeouts.
    *   **DoS (Target API):** Risk reduced by using exponential backoff and limiting retries.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Timeouts: Timeouts are configured in `Services/ApiService.cs` using `RestClientOptions`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Retry Logic: No retry logic is implemented.
