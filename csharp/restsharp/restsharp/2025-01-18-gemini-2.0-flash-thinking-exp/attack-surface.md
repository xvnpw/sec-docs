# Attack Surface Analysis for restsharp/restsharp

## Attack Surface: [Parameter Injection](./attack_surfaces/parameter_injection.md)

* **Description:** Attackers can manipulate request parameters (URL, query, body) by injecting malicious code or unexpected values.
    * **How RestSharp Contributes:** RestSharp's methods for adding parameters (e.g., `AddParameter`, string interpolation in URLs) can be vulnerable if user-supplied data is directly incorporated without proper sanitization or encoding.
    * **Example:**  A user-controlled value for a `username` parameter is directly inserted into a URL: `client.Get(new RestRequest($"/users/{userInput}"))`. An attacker could input `1; DROP TABLE users;` leading to potential SQL injection if the backend is vulnerable.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, code execution on the backend.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use RestSharp's parameter handling methods correctly: Utilize `AddParameter` with the parameter type specified (e.g., `ParameterType.QueryString`, `ParameterType.UrlSegment`) and let RestSharp handle basic encoding.
        * Implement robust server-side input validation and sanitization.
        * Avoid direct string concatenation or interpolation for constructing URLs with user input.

## Attack Surface: [Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/header_injection.md)

* **Description:** Attackers can inject arbitrary HTTP headers into requests.
    * **How RestSharp Contributes:**  RestSharp's methods for adding headers (e.g., `AddHeader`) can be exploited if user-provided data is used to set header values without proper validation.
    * **Example:**  A user-controlled value is used to set a header: `request.AddHeader("Custom-Header", userInput)`. An attacker could input `X-Forwarded-For: malicious_ip\r\nAnother-Header: evil_value`, potentially leading to HTTP Response Splitting or other header-based attacks.
    * **Impact:** HTTP Response Splitting, cache poisoning, session hijacking.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid using user input directly for setting header values. If necessary, strictly validate and sanitize the input against a whitelist.
        * Understand the implications of setting specific headers and avoid allowing user control over critical headers.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

* **Description:**  Applications deserialize data received from external sources, and if this data is malicious, it can lead to code execution or other vulnerabilities.
    * **How RestSharp Contributes:** RestSharp's built-in deserializers (e.g., for JSON, XML) can be vulnerable if the application doesn't validate the structure and content of the response before deserialization, especially if custom deserialization logic is used.
    * **Example:** An application uses RestSharp to fetch data from an external API and deserializes it into a .NET object. A malicious API could send a crafted JSON payload that, when deserialized, exploits a vulnerability in the deserialization process or the target class.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, data corruption.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Validate the structure and content of responses before deserialization.
        * Avoid deserializing directly into complex objects if possible. Consider using Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and mapping to domain objects after validation.
        * Keep RestSharp and its dependencies updated to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.
        * Be cautious when using custom deserialization logic.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tlsssl_configuration.md)

* **Description:**  Misconfiguration of TLS/SSL settings can weaken the security of communication.
    * **How RestSharp Contributes:** RestSharp allows developers to configure TLS/SSL settings, including disabling certificate validation. Disabling certificate validation makes the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
    * **Example:**  Code that explicitly disables certificate validation: `client.RemoteCertificateValidationCallback = (sender, certificate, chain, sslPolicyErrors) => true;`. This bypasses security checks and allows attackers to intercept communication.
    * **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping, data interception.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Never disable certificate validation in production environments.
        * Ensure the application and the underlying .NET framework are configured to use strong and up-to-date TLS versions.
        * Properly handle certificate errors and do not ignore them.
