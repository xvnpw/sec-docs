### 4. Deep Analysis of Header Injection Attack Surface

#### 4.1 Understanding the Vulnerability: Header Injection

Header Injection vulnerabilities arise when an attacker can control the content of HTTP headers sent by an application. HTTP headers are crucial for communication between clients and servers, controlling various aspects of the request and response. Injecting arbitrary headers can lead to a range of security issues.

The core of the vulnerability lies in the interpretation of special characters within HTTP headers, particularly the Carriage Return (CR, `\r`) and Line Feed (LF, `\n`) characters. These characters are used to delimit headers and the body of an HTTP message. By injecting `\r\n` sequences, an attacker can effectively terminate the current header and introduce new ones, or even start a new HTTP response within the current one (HTTP Response Splitting).

#### 4.2 RestSharp's Role and Potential Pitfalls

RestSharp provides several ways to manipulate HTTP headers, which, if not used carefully, can become avenues for header injection:

* **`AddHeader(string name, string value)`:** This is the most direct method for adding headers. If the `value` parameter is derived from user input without proper sanitization, it becomes a prime target for injection.

    ```csharp
    // Vulnerable Example
    var userInput = GetUserInput(); // Potentially contains malicious characters
    var request = new RestRequest("resource", Method.Get);
    request.AddHeader("Custom-Header", userInput);
    ```

* **`DefaultRequestHeaders`:** This property allows setting default headers for all subsequent requests made by a `RestClient` instance. While less directly tied to individual user input, if the values assigned to these default headers are influenced by configuration or data sources that are not properly validated, it can still lead to injection.

    ```csharp
    // Potentially Vulnerable Example (if configData is user-influenced)
    var configData = LoadConfiguration();
    var client = new RestClient("https://api.example.com");
    client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("X-API-Key", configData["apiKey"]);
    ```

* **`AddParameter(string name, string value, ParameterType.HttpHeader)`:** While primarily intended for query parameters or request body, `AddParameter` can also be used to set headers. Similar to `AddHeader`, unsanitized input in the `value` parameter poses a risk.

    ```csharp
    // Vulnerable Example
    var userAgent = GetUserInput();
    var request = new RestRequest("resource", Method.Get);
    request.AddParameter("User-Agent", userAgent, ParameterType.HttpHeader);
    ```

The key pitfall is the **lack of automatic sanitization or encoding** of header values by RestSharp. It relies on the developer to ensure that the data passed to these methods is safe and does not contain malicious characters.

#### 4.3 Attack Vectors and Scenarios

Building upon the provided example, here are more detailed attack vectors and scenarios:

* **HTTP Response Splitting:** This is the most severe consequence. By injecting `\r\n\r\n` followed by a crafted HTTP response, an attacker can trick the client into processing a malicious response. This can lead to:
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting JavaScript code into the fake response.
    * **Cache Poisoning:**  Causing the malicious response to be cached by intermediate proxies or the client's browser.
    * **Redirection to Malicious Sites:**  Injecting a `Location` header in the fake response.

    **Example:** If `userInput` is `X-Forwarded-For: malicious_ip\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n<html><script>alert('XSS')</script></html>`, the server might send a response that the client interprets as containing malicious JavaScript.

* **Cache Poisoning (Header Manipulation):**  Injecting headers that influence caching behavior can lead to cache poisoning without necessarily performing a full response split. For example, manipulating `Vary` headers or `Cache-Control` directives.

    **Example:** Injecting `Vary: User-Agent` could cause different users to receive cached responses intended for others, potentially exposing sensitive information.

* **Session Hijacking (Cookie Manipulation):**  While less direct, an attacker might attempt to inject `Set-Cookie` headers to overwrite or set their own session cookies. This is often more difficult to achieve reliably due to server-side cookie handling and security measures.

    **Example:** Injecting `Set-Cookie: sessionid=attacker_session; Path=/` might attempt to set a malicious session cookie, though servers typically have mechanisms to prevent this.

* **Information Disclosure:** Injecting headers that reveal internal server information or bypass security checks.

    **Example:** Injecting `X-Debug-Mode: true` might inadvertently enable debugging features on the server.

* **Bypassing Security Controls:** Injecting headers that are trusted by backend systems or firewalls, potentially bypassing security checks.

    **Example:** Injecting `X-Real-IP: trusted_internal_ip` might trick a backend system into believing the request originated from a trusted source.

#### 4.4 Impact Assessment (Detailed)

The impact of a successful header injection attack can be significant:

* **High Risk Severity (as stated):** This is justified due to the potential for severe consequences like XSS and cache poisoning.
* **Reputation Damage:** Successful attacks can erode user trust and damage the organization's reputation.
* **Financial Loss:**  Depending on the nature of the application, attacks could lead to financial losses through fraud, data breaches, or service disruption.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Data breaches resulting from header injection could lead to violations of privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
* **Compromised User Accounts:** Session hijacking can grant attackers access to user accounts and sensitive data.
* **Service Disruption:** Cache poisoning can lead to widespread disruption of service for users.

#### 4.5 Mitigation Strategies (Detailed and Actionable)

To effectively mitigate the Header Injection attack surface when using RestSharp, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** This is the most crucial step.
    * **Whitelist Approach:** Define an allowed set of characters for header values and reject any input containing characters outside this set (especially `\r` and `\n`).
    * **Encoding/Escaping:**  While not always straightforward for HTTP headers, consider encoding special characters if a whitelist approach is not feasible. However, be cautious as improper encoding can lead to other issues.
    * **Regular Expression Validation:** Use regular expressions to enforce the expected format and character set of header values.

    ```csharp
    // Example of Input Validation
    private string SanitizeHeaderValue(string input)
    {
        // Example: Allow only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores
        return Regex.Replace(input, @"[^a-zA-Z0-9\-_]", "");
    }

    var userInput = GetUserInput();
    var sanitizedInput = SanitizeHeaderValue(userInput);
    var request = new RestRequest("resource", Method.Get);
    request.AddHeader("Custom-Header", sanitizedInput);
    ```

* **Avoid Direct User Input for Critical Headers:**  Minimize or eliminate the ability for users to directly control the values of sensitive headers like `Content-Type`, `Authorization`, `Set-Cookie`, etc. If user control is absolutely necessary, implement extremely strict validation.

* **Consider Framework-Level Protections:** Explore if the underlying HTTP client used by RestSharp offers any built-in protections against header injection. However, relying solely on these is not recommended.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not a direct mitigation for header injection, a properly configured CSP can help mitigate the impact of HTTP Response Splitting by preventing the execution of injected scripts.

* **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify potential instances of unsanitized header manipulation. Pay close attention to areas where user input is used to construct HTTP requests.

* **Educate Developers:** Ensure developers are aware of the risks associated with header injection and understand how to use RestSharp securely.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Avoid granting excessive permissions to applications that might be exploited to inject malicious headers.

* **Secure Configuration Management:** If header values are derived from configuration files, ensure these files are securely managed and protected from unauthorized modification.
