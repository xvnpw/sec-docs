# Threat Model Analysis for restsharp/restsharp

## Threat: [Insecure TLS Configuration](./threats/insecure_tls_configuration.md)

**Description:** A RestSharp client configured to use outdated or weak TLS protocols (e.g., SSLv3, TLS 1.0/1.1) or with disabled certificate validation allows an attacker performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack to intercept and potentially modify communication between the application and the remote API. The attacker could eavesdrop on sensitive data being transmitted or inject malicious data into the communication stream. This directly involves RestSharp's configuration of its underlying HTTP client.

**Impact:** Loss of confidentiality (sensitive data exposed), loss of integrity (data manipulation), potential for unauthorized actions on the remote API.

**Affected RestSharp Component:** `RestClient` configuration, specifically settings related to `SslProtocols` and `RemoteCertificateValidationCallback`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Explicitly configure the `RestClient` to use only strong and up-to-date TLS protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher).
*   Ensure that certificate validation is enabled and properly implemented. Do not disable certificate validation unless absolutely necessary and with a thorough understanding of the risks.
*   Regularly review and update the application's TLS configuration.

## Threat: [URL Injection](./threats/url_injection.md)

**Description:** If the base URL or parts of the request URL are constructed dynamically and passed to RestSharp's methods without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious URLs. This causes the RestSharp client to send requests to unintended and potentially malicious servers controlled by the attacker. The attacker could then harvest credentials, execute further attacks from the application's context, or simply disrupt service. This directly involves how RestSharp handles the provided URL.

**Impact:** Redirection to malicious sites, potential exposure of sensitive data to attackers, execution of unintended actions on attacker-controlled servers.

**Affected RestSharp Component:** `RestClient.Execute()` and related methods where the `RestRequest.Resource` is dynamically constructed.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid constructing URLs dynamically using user input whenever possible.
*   If dynamic URL construction is necessary, strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input before incorporating it into the URL.
*   Use parameterized requests where applicable to separate data from the URL structure.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If the application uses RestSharp's deserialization features to process responses from external APIs, vulnerabilities in the deserialization process could be exploited. An attacker could manipulate the API response to include malicious data that, when deserialized by RestSharp, leads to arbitrary code execution on the application server. This is a direct consequence of using RestSharp to handle potentially untrusted data.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the application server.

**Affected RestSharp Component:** `IRestResponse.Content`, `IRestResponse.Data`, and methods used for deserialization (often external libraries configured with RestSharp).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources if possible.
*   If deserialization is necessary, carefully consider the data types being deserialized and the potential for malicious input.
*   Use safe deserialization practices and libraries that are less prone to vulnerabilities.
*   Implement input validation on the deserialized data before using it within the application.

## Threat: [Exposure of API Keys and Secrets](./threats/exposure_of_api_keys_and_secrets.md)

**Description:** Developers might inadvertently hardcode API keys, authentication tokens, or other sensitive credentials directly within the RestSharp client configuration or request construction (e.g., directly in code, configuration files without proper protection). An attacker gaining access to the application's codebase or configuration could easily retrieve these credentials and use them to impersonate the application or gain unauthorized access to the remote API. This directly involves how authentication is configured and used within RestSharp.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to remote APIs, potential data breaches, and misuse of the application's identity.

**Affected RestSharp Component:** `RestClient.Authenticator`, `RestRequest.AddHeader()`, `RestRequest.AddQueryParameter()`, and any code where authentication details are configured.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Never hardcode sensitive credentials directly in the code.
*   Store API keys and secrets securely using environment variables, secure configuration management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault), or dedicated secrets management libraries.
*   Ensure that configuration files containing sensitive information are properly protected with appropriate access controls.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in RestSharp Library or Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_restsharp_library_or_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Like any software library, RestSharp itself or its dependencies might contain security vulnerabilities. Attackers could exploit these known vulnerabilities if the application is using an outdated or vulnerable version of the library. This is a direct risk associated with using the RestSharp library.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability, but it could range from denial of service to remote code execution.

**Affected RestSharp Component:** The entire RestSharp library and its dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical or High).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep RestSharp and all its dependencies updated to the latest stable versions.
*   Regularly monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for known issues affecting RestSharp and its dependencies.
*   Use dependency scanning tools to identify and manage vulnerable dependencies.
