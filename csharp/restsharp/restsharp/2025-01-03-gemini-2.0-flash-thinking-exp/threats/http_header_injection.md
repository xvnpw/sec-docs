## Deep Dive Analysis: HTTP Header Injection Threat in RestSharp Application

As a cybersecurity expert working with the development team, let's conduct a deep analysis of the HTTP Header Injection threat within our application utilizing the RestSharp library.

**Understanding the Threat: HTTP Header Injection**

HTTP Header Injection is a type of web security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker can control the content of HTTP headers sent by the application to a server. This control allows the attacker to inject arbitrary headers, potentially leading to various malicious outcomes. The core issue lies in the application's failure to properly sanitize or validate user-provided data before incorporating it into HTTP headers.

**How it Works in the Context of RestSharp:**

RestSharp provides a convenient way to build and execute HTTP requests. The `RestRequest` object allows developers to add headers using the `AddHeader` method. The vulnerability arises when the application directly uses user-supplied data as the value for a header without proper validation or sanitization.

**Breakdown of the Attack Vector:**

1. **User Input as Header Data:** The application receives input from a user (e.g., through a form field, API parameter, or configuration setting) that is intended to be part of an HTTP header.

2. **Direct Inclusion in `AddHeader`:** The application uses the `RestRequest.AddHeader(name, value)` method, directly passing the unsanitized user input as the `value` parameter.

3. **CRLF Injection:** Attackers can exploit this by injecting Carriage Return (CR - `%0d` or `\r`) and Line Feed (LF - `%0a` or `\n`) characters into the user-provided data. These characters are used to delimit HTTP headers.

4. **Header Manipulation:** By injecting CRLF sequences, the attacker can effectively terminate the current header and introduce new, attacker-controlled headers.

5. **Malicious Payloads:** These injected headers can contain various malicious payloads, depending on the target server's behavior and the attacker's goals.

**Detailed Impact Analysis:**

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    * If the target server reflects the injected headers in its response (e.g., in an error message or a debugging output), the attacker can inject JavaScript code within a crafted header like `X-Malicious-Header: <script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
    * When the user's browser receives this response, the injected script will execute, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect the user, or perform other malicious actions within the user's session.

* **Session Hijacking:**
    * Attackers might try to inject headers that influence session management, although this is less common with modern secure session handling. However, in poorly configured systems, they might attempt to manipulate `Set-Cookie` headers or other session-related headers.

* **Bypassing Security Filters on the Target Server:**
    * Some web application firewalls (WAFs) or security filters rely on specific header values for their logic. An attacker might inject headers to bypass these filters. For example, they might inject a header that makes the request appear to originate from a trusted source.

* **Information Disclosure:**
    * In some cases, attackers might inject headers that cause the server to reveal sensitive information in its response headers.

* **Cache Poisoning:**
    * By injecting headers that influence caching behavior (e.g., `Cache-Control`), attackers might be able to poison the cache with malicious content.

**Affected RestSharp Component: `RestRequest.AddHeader`**

The primary point of vulnerability lies in the direct use of the `RestRequest.AddHeader` method with unsanitized user input. RestSharp itself doesn't inherently sanitize header values. It's the responsibility of the application developer to ensure the data passed to `AddHeader` is safe.

**Code Example (Vulnerable):**

```csharp
using RestSharp;

public class MyApiClient
{
    private readonly RestClient _client;

    public MyApiClient(string baseUrl)
    {
        _client = new RestClient(baseUrl);
    }

    public IRestResponse MakeRequest(string userAgent)
    {
        var request = new RestRequest("/api/data", Method.GET);
        request.AddHeader("User-Agent", userAgent); // Potential vulnerability here
        return _client.Execute(request);
    }
}

// Example usage with malicious input:
string maliciousUserAgent = "MyBrowser\r\nX-Malicious-Header: <script>alert('XSS')</script>";
var apiClient = new MyApiClient("https://example.com");
var response = apiClient.MakeRequest(maliciousUserAgent);
```

In this example, if the `userAgent` variable contains CRLF sequences, it can inject a new header `X-Malicious-Header` with malicious JavaScript.

**Risk Severity: High**

The risk severity is indeed high due to the potential for significant impact, including XSS, which can lead to account compromise and data theft. The ease of exploitation, especially if user input is directly used in headers, further elevates the risk.

**Detailed Analysis of Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Avoid Directly Setting Headers with User-Provided Data:** This is the most effective mitigation. Whenever possible, avoid using user input directly as header values. Instead, rely on predefined headers or derive header values based on validated and sanitized user input.

* **Implement Strict Validation and Sanitization of User Input:** If it's absolutely necessary to use user-provided data in headers, implement robust validation and sanitization.
    * **Validation:** Ensure the input conforms to the expected format and length for the specific header. Reject any input that doesn't meet the criteria.
    * **Sanitization:**  Remove or encode potentially harmful characters, specifically CR (`\r`) and LF (`\n`). Consider using a library specifically designed for input sanitization. Encoding these characters (e.g., replacing them with their URL-encoded equivalents `%0d` and `%0a`) can prevent header injection.

* **Use RestSharp's Methods for Setting Headers with Predefined Values Where Possible:** RestSharp offers methods for setting common headers with predefined values. Utilize these methods whenever applicable. For example, for setting the `Content-Type` header, use `request.AddHeader("Content-Type", "application/json")` instead of relying on user input.

**Further Considerations and Best Practices:**

* **Contextual Encoding:**  When reflecting header values in responses (which should generally be avoided), ensure proper output encoding to prevent XSS.

* **Security Headers:** Implement security headers like `Content-Security-Policy (CSP)` and `X-Frame-Options` on the target server to mitigate the impact of potential XSS attacks.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address potential header injection vulnerabilities.

* **Developer Training:** Educate developers about the risks of header injection and secure coding practices.

* **Code Reviews:** Implement thorough code reviews to catch instances where user input is being used directly in headers without proper validation or sanitization.

* **Consider using RestSharp's Fluent Interface:** While not a direct mitigation, using the fluent interface can sometimes make the code more readable and potentially highlight areas where user input is being used in headers.

**Testing and Verification:**

* **Manual Testing:**  Manually craft requests with malicious header values containing CRLF sequences and potential XSS payloads to test the application's resilience.

* **Automated Security Scanning Tools:** Utilize static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST) tools to automatically identify potential header injection vulnerabilities.

* **Penetration Testing:** Engage security professionals to perform penetration testing and simulate real-world attacks.

**Conclusion:**

HTTP Header Injection is a serious threat that can have significant consequences for applications using RestSharp. By understanding the attack mechanism and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, we can significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability. A layered approach, combining secure coding practices, input validation, and regular security testing, is crucial for protecting our application and its users. As cybersecurity experts, it's our responsibility to guide the development team in building secure and resilient applications.
