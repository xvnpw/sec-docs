## Deep Dive Analysis: HTTP Header Injection Attack Surface in RestSharp Applications

This document provides a deep analysis of the HTTP Header Injection attack surface within applications utilizing the RestSharp library. We will explore the mechanics of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and provide detailed mitigation strategies for the development team.

**1. Understanding the Attack Surface: HTTP Header Injection**

HTTP Header Injection occurs when an attacker can control the content of HTTP headers sent by an application. This control allows them to insert arbitrary headers, potentially leading to various security vulnerabilities. The core issue lies in the application's failure to properly sanitize or validate user-provided data before incorporating it into HTTP headers.

**Key Components of the Attack:**

* **User-Controlled Data:** The attacker manipulates input fields, URL parameters, or other data sources that the application uses to construct HTTP headers.
* **Lack of Sanitization:** The application directly uses this user-controlled data without proper validation or encoding, allowing malicious characters (like newline characters: `\r\n`) to be injected.
* **RestSharp's Role:** RestSharp provides convenient methods for developers to add custom headers to HTTP requests. While this functionality is essential for many legitimate use cases, it becomes a vulnerability when combined with unsanitized user input.

**2. RestSharp's Contribution to the Attack Surface**

RestSharp offers several ways to manipulate HTTP headers, making it a key component in this attack surface:

* **`AddHeader(string name, string value)`:** This is the most direct method for adding custom headers. If the `value` parameter is derived from user input without proper sanitization, it becomes a prime injection point.
* **`AddParameter(string name, object value, ParameterType.HttpHeader)`:**  While primarily used for other parameter types, this method can also be used to add headers. Similar to `AddHeader`, unsanitized `value` can lead to injection.
* **`DefaultRequestHeaders` Property:**  While less directly tied to individual user input, if the application logic populates `DefaultRequestHeaders` based on user-provided data (e.g., configuration files influenced by users), it can also become an attack vector.

**The core problem is that RestSharp, by design, trusts the developer to provide valid header names and values. It doesn't inherently perform input validation or sanitization on the header content.**

**3. Detailed Attack Scenarios and Exploitation Techniques**

Let's expand on the provided example and explore specific attack scenarios:

* **HTTP Response Splitting/Smuggling:**
    * **Mechanism:** An attacker injects newline characters (`\r\n`) followed by additional headers and a blank line (`\r\n`) into a header value. This tricks the server or intermediary proxies into interpreting the injected content as the start of a new HTTP response.
    * **Example:**  Imagine the application allows users to set a custom "Tracking-ID" header. An attacker could input:
        ```
        evil\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n<script>alert('XSS')</script>
        ```
        If the server or a proxy doesn't properly handle this, it might interpret the injected script as part of the response to the next request.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Serving Malicious Content:** Attackers can serve arbitrary HTML content, including scripts, leading to XSS.
        * **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can potentially inject headers that manipulate session cookies or authentication mechanisms.
        * **Bypassing Security Controls:**  Attackers might be able to bypass web application firewalls or other security measures.

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Headers:**
    * **Mechanism:** While less common than XSS in the response body, certain headers can be used to inject scripts if the client-side application or a browser extension processes them without proper escaping.
    * **Example:**  An attacker might inject a script into a custom header that is later displayed or processed by client-side JavaScript.
    * **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, leading to data theft, session hijacking, or defacement.

* **Cache Poisoning:**
    * **Mechanism:** By injecting headers that influence caching behavior (e.g., `Cache-Control`, `Expires`), an attacker can manipulate how intermediaries cache responses.
    * **Example:** An attacker could inject headers that cause a malicious response to be cached and served to other users.
    * **Impact:**  Widespread distribution of malicious content, denial of service by serving error pages, or information disclosure.

**4. Impact Assessment: Beyond the Basics**

The "High" risk severity is accurate. The potential impact of HTTP Header Injection can be significant:

* **Reputational Damage:** Successful attacks can severely damage the application's and the organization's reputation.
* **Data Breach:**  XSS and session hijacking can lead to the theft of sensitive user data.
* **Financial Loss:**  Downtime, incident response costs, and potential legal repercussions can result in significant financial losses.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Failure to protect against such vulnerabilities can lead to violations of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

**5. Deep Dive into Mitigation Strategies**

The provided mitigation strategies are a good starting point. Let's elaborate on them with specific techniques and best practices:

* **Header Value Validation (Crucial):**
    * **Disallow Control Characters:**  Strictly reject or strip out control characters like `\r` and `\n`. Regular expressions or built-in string manipulation functions can be used for this.
    * **Whitelist Allowed Characters:** Define a set of allowed characters for header values and reject any input containing characters outside this set.
    * **Length Limits:** Impose reasonable length limits on header values to prevent excessively long or malformed inputs.
    * **Encoding:**  While not always a direct solution for injection, proper encoding (e.g., URL encoding) can help in certain scenarios, but it's not a substitute for validation.
    * **Context-Aware Validation:**  The validation rules might need to be specific to the header being set. For example, email addresses in a `Reply-To` header might require a different validation pattern than a simple tracking ID.

* **Avoid Direct User Input in Headers (Best Practice):**
    * **Indirect Mapping:** Instead of directly using user input, map it to predefined, safe header values. For example, if a user selects a language preference, map that selection to a specific `Accept-Language` header value.
    * **Abstraction Layers:** Create an abstraction layer that handles header construction. This layer can enforce validation and sanitization rules before passing data to RestSharp.
    * **Limited User Control:**  Carefully consider which headers truly need to be influenced by user input. Minimize the attack surface by limiting this control.

**Additional Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not a direct mitigation for header injection, a properly configured CSP can help mitigate the impact of XSS attacks that might result from successful header injection.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Proactively identify and address potential header injection vulnerabilities through regular security assessments.
* **Secure Coding Training for Developers:**  Educate developers about the risks of header injection and best practices for secure header handling.
* **Utilize Security Libraries and Frameworks:** Explore if any security-focused libraries or frameworks can provide additional layers of protection against header injection.
* **Input Sanitization Libraries:** Leverage well-vetted input sanitization libraries specific to your programming language to handle the complexities of removing or escaping malicious characters.
* **Output Encoding:** While the focus is on request headers, remember that if the *response* headers are also influenced by user input (less common but possible), proper output encoding is crucial to prevent response splitting vulnerabilities.

**6. Developer Guidance and Best Practices**

For the development team using RestSharp, here's actionable guidance:

* **Treat all user input as potentially malicious.** Never trust user-provided data directly when constructing HTTP headers.
* **Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all data that influences header values.**
* **Favor indirect mapping and abstraction layers over directly using user input in `AddHeader` or `AddParameter` with `ParameterType.HttpHeader`.**
* **Conduct thorough code reviews, specifically focusing on areas where RestSharp's header manipulation methods are used.**
* **Integrate security testing into the development lifecycle.** Use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities and perform dynamic testing to verify mitigations.
* **Stay updated on security best practices and common attack vectors related to HTTP headers.**
* **Document all header manipulation logic clearly, including the validation and sanitization measures in place.**

**7. Testing Strategies to Identify Header Injection Vulnerabilities**

* **Manual Testing:**
    * **Fuzzing:**  Send requests with various combinations of special characters (including `\r`, `\n`, `;`, `:`, etc.) in header values to observe how the application and server respond.
    * **Boundary Value Analysis:** Test with extremely long header values or values containing unusual characters.
    * **Specific Payload Injection:**  Attempt to inject known HTTP response splitting payloads (e.g., injecting `Content-Type` and HTML content).
* **Automated Testing:**
    * **Security Scanners:** Utilize web application security scanners that can automatically detect header injection vulnerabilities. Configure the scanners to specifically target header manipulation points.
    * **Penetration Testing Tools:** Employ tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP to intercept and modify requests, allowing for targeted header injection testing.
    * **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests that specifically target the header construction logic, ensuring that validation and sanitization mechanisms are working as expected.
* **Code Review:**  Manually review the code to identify instances where user input is directly used in header manipulation without proper sanitization.

**8. Conclusion**

HTTP Header Injection is a serious vulnerability that can have significant consequences. By understanding how RestSharp contributes to this attack surface and implementing robust mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk. A layered approach, combining input validation, avoiding direct user input, and regular security testing, is crucial for building secure applications that utilize the RestSharp library.
