## Attack Tree Visualization

Compromise Application via RestSharp Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)
├─── AND 1. Exploit Request Manipulation (HIGH-RISK PATH)
│   ├─── OR 1.1. Inject Malicious Content into Requests (CRITICAL NODE)
│   │   ├─── 1.1.2. Inject Malicious Query Parameters (HIGH-RISK PATH)
│   │   │   └─── Insight: If RestSharp is used to construct URLs with query parameters based on user input, attackers can inject malicious parameters leading to information disclosure, data manipulation, or even command injection on the server-side if not properly handled.
│   │   ├─── 1.1.3. Inject Malicious Request Body (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)

│   │   │   └─── Insight: If the application disables SSL certificate validation in RestSharp (e.g., for testing purposes and not re-enabled in production), it becomes vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attacks.
│   │   ├─── 3.4.2. Exploiting Insufficient Certificate Pinning
│   │   │   └─── Insight: If the application implements certificate pinning incorrectly or incompletely with RestSharp, attackers might be able to bypass it with a valid but malicious certificate.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via RestSharp Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_restsharp_exploitation_(critical_node).md)

This is the root goal and represents the ultimate impact if any of the high-risk paths are successfully exploited. It's critical because it signifies a complete security breach.

## Attack Tree Path: [AND 1. Exploit Request Manipulation (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/and_1._exploit_request_manipulation_(high-risk_path).md)

This path focuses on manipulating the requests sent by the application using RestSharp. It's high-risk because it directly targets the interaction between the application and external services, making it a prime target for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR 1.1. Inject Malicious Content into Requests (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/or_1.1._inject_malicious_content_into_requests_(critical_node).md)

This node represents the injection of malicious data into various parts of the HTTP request. It's critical because successful injection can lead to a wide range of server-side vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2. Inject Malicious Query Parameters (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/1.1.2._inject_malicious_query_parameters_(high-risk_path).md)

Insight: If RestSharp is used to construct URLs with query parameters based on user input, attackers can inject malicious parameters leading to information disclosure, data manipulation, or even command injection on the server-side if not properly handled.

Attack Vectors:
* Crafting URLs with malicious SQL queries to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* Injecting commands that the server-side application might execute directly (command injection).
* Manipulating parameters to bypass authentication or authorization checks.
* Injecting scripts for cross-site scripting (XSS) if the URL is later reflected in a web page (though less directly related to RestSharp itself).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3. Inject Malicious Request Body (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/1.1.3._inject_malicious_request_body_(high-risk_path,_critical_node).md)

Insight: When sending data in the request body (e.g., POST, PUT), attackers can inject malicious payloads (e.g., SQL injection, XML External Entity (XXE), command injection) if the server-side application doesn't properly sanitize and validate the input. This is amplified if RestSharp's serialization features are misused.

Attack Vectors:
* Injecting SQL code within JSON or XML payloads for SQL injection.
* Crafting XML payloads to exploit XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities, potentially leading to file disclosure or remote code execution.
* Injecting commands within serialized data that the server-side might deserialize and execute.

## Attack Tree Path: [AND 2. Exploit Response Handling (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/and_2._exploit_response_handling_(high-risk_path).md)

This path focuses on exploiting how the application handles responses received via RestSharp. It's high-risk because vulnerabilities in response handling can lead to severe consequences, especially when dealing with deserialization.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR 2.1. Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/or_2.1._exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities_(high-risk_path,_critical_node).md)

Attackers can manipulate the server response to contain malicious payloads that, when deserialized by the application using RestSharp, can lead to code execution.

Attack Vectors:
* A compromised or malicious server sends a specially crafted JSON or XML payload.
* RestSharp deserializes this payload, triggering a vulnerability in the deserialization library or custom deserialization logic.
* This can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the application server.

## Attack Tree Path: [AND 3. Exploit RestSharp Configuration and Features (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/and_3._exploit_restsharp_configuration_and_features_(high-risk_path).md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from the configuration and usage of RestSharp's features. It's high-risk because misconfigurations or insecure usage patterns can directly expose sensitive information or create attack vectors.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR 3.1. Insecure Authentication Handling (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/or_3.1._insecure_authentication_handling_(high-risk_path,_critical_node).md)

This node focuses on vulnerabilities related to how authentication is implemented with RestSharp.

Attack Vectors:
* **3.1.1. Leaking Credentials via RestSharp Configuration:**
    * Developers might accidentally hardcode API keys, tokens, or passwords directly in the code where RestSharp is configured.
    * Credentials might be stored insecurely in configuration files accessible to attackers.
    * Attackers gaining access to the codebase or configuration can retrieve these credentials, gaining full access to protected resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1. Leaking Credentials via RestSharp Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/3.1.1._leaking_credentials_via_restsharp_configuration.md)

Insight: If authentication credentials (e.g., API keys, tokens) are hardcoded or stored insecurely within the RestSharp client configuration, an attacker gaining access to the application's codebase or configuration files could retrieve these credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR 3.4. Exploiting Certificate Validation Issues (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/or_3.4._exploiting_certificate_validation_issues_(high-risk_path,_critical_node).md)

This node focuses on vulnerabilities related to how the application validates SSL/TLS certificates when making requests with RestSharp.

Attack Vectors:
* **3.4.1. Man-in-the-Middle via Disabled Certificate Validation:**
    * Developers might disable certificate validation (e.g., during development or due to misconfiguration), making the application vulnerable to MITM attacks.
    * Attackers can intercept communication, steal credentials, or manipulate data in transit.
* **3.4.2. Exploiting Insufficient Certificate Pinning:**
    * If certificate pinning is implemented incorrectly or incompletely, attackers might be able to bypass it using a valid certificate issued by a compromised Certificate Authority.
    * This allows for MITM attacks even with certificate pinning in place.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.4.1. Man-in-the-Middle via Disabled Certificate Validation](./attack_tree_paths/3.4.1._man-in-the-middle_via_disabled_certificate_validation.md)

Insight: If the application disables SSL certificate validation in RestSharp (e.g., for testing purposes and not re-enabled in production), it becomes vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.4.2. Exploiting Insufficient Certificate Pinning](./attack_tree_paths/3.4.2._exploiting_insufficient_certificate_pinning.md)

Insight: If the application implements certificate pinning incorrectly or incompletely with RestSharp, attackers might be able to bypass it with a valid but malicious certificate.
