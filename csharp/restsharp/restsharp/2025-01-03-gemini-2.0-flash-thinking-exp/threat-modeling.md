# Threat Model Analysis for restsharp/restsharp

## Threat: [HTTP Header Injection](./threats/http_header_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious content into HTTP headers if the application allows user-controlled data to be directly added as headers in a RestSharp request. This could lead to various attacks, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the response is mishandled by the target server and reflected back to a user, or bypassing security controls on the server. The attacker manipulates the headers to inject scripts or commands.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), session hijacking, bypassing security filters on the target server, information disclosure.

**Affected RestSharp Component:** `RestRequest.AddHeader`, header manipulation logic within the application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid directly setting headers with user-provided data.
*   If necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization of user input before adding it to headers.
*   Use RestSharp's methods for setting headers with predefined values where possible.

## Threat: [Request Body Injection / Manipulation](./threats/request_body_injection__manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious data into the request body if the application constructs the request body using unsanitized user input and uses RestSharp to send it. This could lead to vulnerabilities on the receiving server, such as command injection, SQL injection (if the target API interacts with a database), or data manipulation. The attacker crafts a malicious payload within the request body.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the target server, data breaches, data corruption, unauthorized access to data.

**Affected RestSharp Component:** `RestRequest.AddJsonBody`, `RestRequest.AddXmlBody`, `RestRequest.AddParameter`, body construction logic within the application.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data used in the request body.
*   Utilize RestSharp's serialization features with well-defined data structures to minimize the risk of injection.
*   Avoid constructing request bodies using direct string concatenation of user input.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization of Response Data](./threats/insecure_deserialization_of_response_data.md)

**Description:** If the application uses RestSharp's deserialization features on untrusted data without proper safeguards, an attacker could craft a malicious response that, when deserialized by RestSharp, executes arbitrary code on the application server. The attacker controls the response from the external service.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the application server, complete compromise of the application.

**Affected RestSharp Component:** `IRestResponse.Content`, `JsonSerializer`, `XmlSerializer`, custom deserialization logic.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Only deserialize data from trusted and expected sources.
*   Implement robust input validation on the deserialized data before using it.
*   Consider using safer serialization formats or custom deserialization logic that avoids automatic object instantiation based on untrusted input.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack due to Insecure TLS Configuration](./threats/man-in-the-middle_(mitm)_attack_due_to_insecure_tls_configuration.md)

**Description:** If the application does not properly configure TLS/SSL settings within RestSharp, it might be vulnerable to MITM attacks. An attacker could intercept communication between the application and the target server, potentially eavesdropping on sensitive data or manipulating the communication. This can happen if weak ciphers are allowed or server certificate validation is disabled within RestSharp's configuration.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access.

**Affected RestSharp Component:** `RestClient.ConfigureWebRequest`, TLS/SSL configuration settings.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure RestSharp is configured to use strong TLS versions (TLS 1.2 or higher) and secure cipher suites.
*   Implement proper server certificate validation within RestSharp's configuration.
*   Consider using certificate pinning for enhanced security.
*   Enforce the use of HTTPS for all sensitive communications.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Authentication Credentials](./threats/insecure_storage_of_authentication_credentials.md)

**Description:** The application might store API keys, authentication tokens, or other credentials used with RestSharp insecurely (e.g., hardcoded in the code, in plain text configuration files, or in easily accessible locations). An attacker gaining access to the application's codebase or configuration could steal these credentials used by RestSharp.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to external APIs, data breaches, impersonation.

**Affected RestSharp Component:**  Authentication mechanisms used with RestSharp (e.g., `RestRequest.AddHeader` for API keys, `Authenticator` implementations).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store credentials securely using appropriate mechanisms like environment variables, secure configuration management tools, or dedicated secrets management services.
*   Avoid hardcoding credentials in the application code.
*   Encrypt sensitive configuration data.

## Threat: [Improper Handling of Authentication Tokens](./threats/improper_handling_of_authentication_tokens.md)

**Description:** The application might not handle authentication tokens returned by the API (and potentially processed by RestSharp) securely. This could include logging tokens, storing them in easily accessible locations, or not implementing proper token revocation mechanisms. An attacker gaining access to these tokens could impersonate the user when making requests using RestSharp.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, account takeover.

**Affected RestSharp Component:**  Token handling logic within the application, potentially involving `IRestResponse.Content` and storage mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store authentication tokens securely (e.g., using secure storage mechanisms like the operating system's credential store or encrypted storage).
*   Avoid logging authentication tokens.
*   Implement proper token management practices, including secure storage, transmission (always over HTTPS), and revocation.
