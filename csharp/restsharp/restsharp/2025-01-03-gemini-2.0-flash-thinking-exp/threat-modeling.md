# Threat Model Analysis for restsharp/restsharp

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization](./threats/insecure_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious API response payload. When RestSharp deserializes this payload (especially when using vulnerable serializers like `Newtonsoft.Json` with default settings), it can lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the server hosting the application. The vulnerability lies in how RestSharp handles the deserialization process of untrusted data.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server hosting the application, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data breach, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Deserialization functionality within RestSharp, particularly when using serializers like `Newtonsoft.Json`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Prefer secure serializers like `System.Text.Json` if compatibility allows.
        *   If using `Newtonsoft.Json`, configure it with secure settings to disable type name handling or use `TypeNameHandling.None` or `TypeNameHandling.Auto` with strict `SerializationBinder`.
        *   Implement schema validation on the server-side to ensure only expected data structures are processed.
        *   Consider using custom deserialization logic for critical data to have more control over the process.

## Threat: [Parameter Injection via URL](./threats/parameter_injection_via_url.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates user-controlled input that is directly used to construct the request URL in RestSharp without proper sanitization or encoding. This allows them to inject arbitrary parameters or modify existing ones, potentially leading to unintended actions on the target server. RestSharp's functionality for building URLs becomes the vector for this injection if not used securely.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, modification of data on the server, bypassing security controls, potential exploitation of server-side vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** `RestClient.Execute` method and related methods for building request URLs within RestSharp.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use RestSharp's built-in parameter addition methods (`AddParameter`, `AddQueryParameter`, `AddUrlSegment`) instead of manually concatenating strings to build URLs.** These methods handle proper encoding.
        *   Validate and sanitize all user-provided input before incorporating it into request parameters or URL segments.
        *   Implement server-side input validation to further protect against malicious parameters.

## Threat: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (if using XML serializer)](./threats/xml_external_entity_(xxe)_injection_(if_using_xml_serializer).md)

*   **Description:** If RestSharp is configured to use an XML serializer (like the default `DotNetXmlSerializer` or `System.Xml.Linq.XDocument`), and the application processes untrusted XML responses, an attacker can embed malicious external entity references in the XML. When RestSharp parses this XML using its configured serializer, it might attempt to resolve these external entities, potentially leading to the disclosure of local files or internal network resources on the server hosting the application.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (access to local files, internal network resources), denial of service, server-side request forgery (SSRF).
    *   **Affected Component:** XML deserialization functionality within RestSharp, particularly when using default XML serializers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **If possible, avoid using XML as the primary data format and prefer JSON.**
        *   If XML is necessary, configure the XML deserializer within RestSharp to disable the processing of external entities. This typically involves setting properties like `XmlReaderSettings.DtdProcessing` to `DtdProcessing.Ignore` and `XmlReaderSettings.XmlResolver` to `null`.
        *   Sanitize and validate XML responses before processing them.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack due to Insufficient TLS Configuration](./threats/man-in-the-middle_(mitm)_attack_due_to_insufficient_tls_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** If the application does not enforce HTTPS for communication with external services using RestSharp, or if certificate validation within RestSharp is disabled or improperly configured, an attacker can intercept network traffic between the application and the remote server. This allows them to eavesdrop on sensitive data being transmitted or even modify requests and responses. RestSharp's configuration directly impacts the security of the network communication.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, data manipulation, potential for impersonation and further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Underlying HTTP communication mechanisms used by RestSharp and its TLS configuration options.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use HTTPS for all communication with external services.** Configure the `RestClient.BaseUrl` accordingly.
        *   **Ensure that RestSharp's certificate validation is enabled and configured correctly.** Avoid disabling certificate validation unless absolutely necessary and with a clear understanding of the risks. Investigate and configure options like `ClientCertificates` and `RemoteCertificateValidationCallback` if needed for specific scenarios but with caution.
        *   Consider implementing certificate pinning for critical connections to further enhance security.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerable Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerable_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** RestSharp relies on other libraries. If any of these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities through the application using RestSharp. While not a direct vulnerability *in* RestSharp's code, it's a threat directly impacting applications *using* RestSharp.
    *   **Impact:** Various security vulnerabilities depending on the compromised dependency, potentially leading to remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** RestSharp's dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability. Can be Critical or High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regularly update RestSharp and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions.**
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies and address them promptly.
        *   Monitor security advisories for RestSharp and its dependencies.
