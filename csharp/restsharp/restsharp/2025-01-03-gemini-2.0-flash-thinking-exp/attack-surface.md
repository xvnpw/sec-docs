# Attack Surface Analysis for restsharp/restsharp

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe URL Construction](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_url_construction.md)

**Description:** The application constructs API endpoint URLs by concatenating user-supplied input or other untrusted data without proper sanitization or encoding.

**How RestSharp Contributes:** RestSharp directly uses the provided URL string when making requests. If the URL is malicious, RestSharp will transmit it.

**Example:** An attacker manipulates a parameter that is used to build the URL path, leading to a request to an unintended endpoint (e.g., `https://api.example.com/users/../../admin`).

**Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Open Redirects, potentially accessing or modifying unintended resources.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input before incorporating it into URLs.
*   **Parameterized Requests:** Utilize RestSharp's features for parameterized requests, which automatically handle encoding and prevent direct string concatenation for URL construction.
*   **URL Whitelisting:** If possible, maintain a whitelist of allowed base URLs or path segments.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/http_header_injection.md)

**Description:** The application allows user-controlled data to be directly inserted into HTTP headers sent by RestSharp.

**How RestSharp Contributes:** RestSharp provides methods to add custom headers to requests. If the application doesn't sanitize the values, attackers can inject malicious headers.

**Example:** An attacker injects newline characters and additional headers into a custom header field, potentially leading to HTTP Response Splitting or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the response is mishandled by intermediaries or the client.

**Impact:** HTTP Response Splitting/Smuggling, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via headers, Cache Poisoning.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Header Value Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize any user-provided input before setting it as a header value.
*   **Avoid Direct User Input in Headers:**  Whenever possible, avoid directly using user input to construct header values. Use predefined header values or transform user input into safe representations.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization of Responses](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization_of_responses.md)

**Description:** The application relies on RestSharp's automatic deserialization of API responses without proper validation of the `Content-Type` or the integrity of the response data.

**How RestSharp Contributes:** RestSharp automatically deserializes responses based on the `Content-Type` header. If an attacker can control the response content or the `Content-Type`, they might be able to trigger insecure deserialization vulnerabilities.

**Example:** An attacker compromises the API server or performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack and injects malicious serialized data (e.g., in JSON format) with a valid `Content-Type`, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the application server.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Validate `Content-Type`:**  Explicitly validate the `Content-Type` header of the response to ensure it matches the expected format.
*   **Use Safe Deserialization Settings:**  If using JSON.NET (a common dependency), configure it with secure settings to prevent deserialization of unexpected types.
*   **Verify Response Integrity:**  Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of the API response, such as using digital signatures or message authentication codes (MACs).

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Redirects](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery_(ssrf)_via_redirects.md)

**Description:** The application allows RestSharp to follow HTTP redirects without proper validation of the redirect target.

**How RestSharp Contributes:** RestSharp, by default, follows HTTP redirects. If the application doesn't control or validate the redirect targets returned by the API, it can be tricked into making requests to internal or external resources.

**Example:** An attacker manipulates the API response to include a redirect to an internal service or a malicious external site. RestSharp follows this redirect, potentially exposing internal resources or performing actions on behalf of the server.

**Impact:** Access to internal resources, port scanning, potential for further exploitation of internal services.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Limit Redirects:** Configure RestSharp to limit the number of redirects it will follow.
*   **Validate Redirect Targets:** Implement logic to validate the target URLs of redirects before allowing RestSharp to follow them. This might involve whitelisting allowed domains or IP addresses.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Protocol Usage](./attack_surfaces/insecure_protocol_usage.md)

**Description:** The application uses RestSharp to communicate with APIs over insecure protocols (HTTP) instead of HTTPS, especially when transmitting sensitive data.

**How RestSharp Contributes:** RestSharp can be configured to use either HTTP or HTTPS. If the application doesn't enforce HTTPS, communication is vulnerable.

**Example:** API keys, authentication tokens, or other sensitive data are transmitted over an unencrypted HTTP connection, allowing attackers to intercept and steal this information.

**Impact:** Data interception, Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, credential compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Enforce HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS for API communication, especially when dealing with sensitive data. Configure RestSharp to only use HTTPS.
*   **Implement Certificate Pinning:** For critical APIs, consider implementing certificate pinning to further protect against MITM attacks.
