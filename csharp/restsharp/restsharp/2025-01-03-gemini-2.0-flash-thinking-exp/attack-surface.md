# Attack Surface Analysis for restsharp/restsharp

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization.md)

**Description:** The application processes data received from an external API, often in formats like JSON or XML, using RestSharp's deserialization capabilities. If the incoming data is malicious and the application doesn't validate it *after* deserialization, it can lead to code execution or other unintended consequences.

**How RestSharp Contributes:** RestSharp directly handles the fetching and deserialization of data from API responses. If the application trusts the deserialized objects without further validation, it becomes vulnerable.

**Example:** An attacker manipulates the API response to include malicious code within a JSON object. RestSharp deserializes this object, and if the application then uses this object without validation (e.g., directly invoking methods based on a property value), the malicious code can be executed.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, data corruption, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement robust input validation *after* deserialization. Do not assume the deserialized data is safe.
*   Use specific data transfer objects (DTOs) with defined types. Avoid deserializing directly into generic objects or dictionaries.
*   Consider using immutable objects where appropriate.
*   Keep the deserialization library (e.g., Newtonsoft.Json, System.Text.Json) updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Parameter Injection through Request Construction](./attack_surfaces/parameter_injection_through_request_construction.md)

**Description:** User-controlled data is directly used to construct request parameters (query parameters, headers, body) without proper sanitization or encoding.

**How RestSharp Contributes:** RestSharp provides methods to programmatically build requests, including adding parameters and headers. If these methods are used with unsanitized user input, it creates an injection point.

**Example:** An attacker can manipulate a username field that is then used to construct a query parameter in a subsequent API call made with RestSharp. `client.Execute(new RestRequest($"/users?name={userInput}"));` If `userInput` contains malicious characters, it could potentially impact the target API or lead to HTTP Response Splitting if injecting into headers.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, manipulation of API behavior, potential for server-side vulnerabilities on the target API.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Always sanitize and encode user input before using it to construct requests. Use appropriate encoding methods for URLs, headers, and request bodies.
*   Use RestSharp's parameter addition methods (`AddParameter`, `AddHeader`) which often handle basic encoding. Avoid string interpolation directly into request URLs or headers where possible.
*   Implement input validation to restrict the characters and format of user-provided data.

## Attack Surface: [URL Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/url_manipulation.md)

**Description:** The base URL or endpoint path used with RestSharp is derived from user input or external configuration without proper validation.

**How RestSharp Contributes:** RestSharp's `RestClient` and `RestRequest` objects use URLs to define the target API. If these URLs are dynamically constructed from untrusted sources, it opens the door to manipulation.

**Example:** The application takes a user-provided API endpoint and uses it directly with RestSharp: `var client = new RestClient(userProvidedUrl);`. An attacker could provide a malicious URL, causing the application to send requests to an unintended server.

**Impact:** Data exfiltration to malicious servers, exposure of sensitive information, potential for further attacks against the unintended target.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Never directly use user input to construct the base URL of the `RestClient`.
*   If the endpoint path needs to be dynamic, use a whitelist of allowed paths or a secure mechanism to map user input to valid endpoints.
*   Thoroughly validate any externally configured URLs.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Authentication Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_authentication_handling.md)

**Description:** Authentication credentials (API keys, tokens, usernames/passwords) are handled insecurely when using RestSharp's authentication features.

**How RestSharp Contributes:** RestSharp provides mechanisms to add authentication headers or parameters to requests. If the application stores or transmits these credentials insecurely while using RestSharp's features, it becomes a vulnerability.

**Example:** Developers might hardcode API keys directly in the code or configuration files used with RestSharp's authentication methods (e.g., `client.Authenticator = new HttpBasicAuthenticator("user", "password");`).

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the target API, data breaches, impersonation.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Never hardcode credentials in the application code.
*   Store sensitive credentials securely using environment variables, secure configuration management tools (e.g., Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault), or the operating system's credential management system.
*   Use secure authentication protocols like OAuth 2.0 where possible.
*   Avoid logging authentication credentials.

## Attack Surface: [TLS/SSL Configuration Issues](./attack_surfaces/tlsssl_configuration_issues.md)

**Description:** The application's RestSharp configuration allows insecure connections (HTTP instead of HTTPS) or disables certificate validation, making it susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**How RestSharp Contributes:** RestSharp uses the underlying .NET framework's TLS/SSL implementation. However, developers can configure settings within RestSharp's `RestClient` that weaken security.

**Example:** Developers might disable certificate validation for debugging purposes: `client.RemoteCertificateValidationCallback = (sender, certificate, chain, sslPolicyErrors) => true;`. This makes the application vulnerable to MITM attacks where an attacker can intercept and modify communication.

**Impact:** Data interception, eavesdropping, manipulation of communication, credential theft.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Always use HTTPS for communication with external APIs. Ensure the base URL in `RestClient` starts with `https://`.
*   Do not disable certificate validation in production environments.
*   Consider using certificate pinning for critical APIs if appropriate.
