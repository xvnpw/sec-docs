# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for restsharp/restsharp

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce HTTPS in RestSharp Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_https_in_restsharp_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Verify `BaseUrl` Scheme:** When creating a new `RestClient` instance, explicitly set the `BaseUrl` property to use the `https://` scheme. For example: `var client = new RestClient("https://api.example.com");`
    2.  **Check Request URLs:** Ensure that when creating `RestRequest` objects, the resource paths are combined with the `BaseUrl` in a way that maintains the `https://` scheme. Avoid accidentally constructing `http://` URLs.
    3.  **Review Dynamic URL Construction:** If you dynamically construct URLs for RestSharp requests, carefully review the logic to guarantee that the resulting URLs always use `https://` when interacting with external APIs that require secure connections.
    4.  **Client Configuration (Explicit HTTPS - if applicable):**  While RestSharp generally handles HTTPS based on the URL, check if your specific RestSharp version offers any explicit configuration options to enforce HTTPS connections or reject HTTP. Consult the RestSharp documentation for version-specific features.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from intercepting and eavesdropping on communication initiated by RestSharp, protecting data in transit.
    *   **Eavesdropping (High Severity):** Ensures that sensitive data sent and received by RestSharp is encrypted and protected from unauthorized access during transmission.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** High Reduction - Directly mitigates MITM attacks by ensuring encrypted communication through HTTPS.
    *   **Eavesdropping:** High Reduction -  Provides strong protection against eavesdropping by encrypting the communication channel used by RestSharp.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, all our RestSharp client configurations are set to use HTTPS for our production and staging environments. We ensure `BaseUrl` is always set to `https://`.

*   **Missing Implementation:** We need to add code review checklists to specifically verify HTTPS usage in RestSharp configurations during development and ensure developers are aware of the importance of HTTPS when using RestSharp.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure RestSharp Request Timeouts](./mitigation_strategies/configure_restsharp_request_timeouts.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Set `RestClient.Timeout`:**  Configure the `Timeout` property of the `RestClient` instance to set a connection timeout in milliseconds. This limits how long RestSharp will wait to establish a connection. Example: `client.Timeout = 10000;` (10 seconds).
    2.  **Set `RestRequest.Timeout` (if needed):** For individual requests that require different timeouts than the default `RestClient.Timeout`, configure the `Timeout` property of the `RestRequest` object.
    3.  **Choose Appropriate Timeout Values:** Select timeout values for `RestClient` and `RestRequest` that are reasonable for the expected API response times and network conditions. Avoid excessively long timeouts.
    4.  **Handle Timeout Exceptions:** Implement `try-catch` blocks around RestSharp request execution to handle `TimeoutException` (or similar exceptions depending on RestSharp version) that may be thrown when requests exceed the configured timeouts.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (Medium Severity):** Prevents RestSharp from indefinitely waiting for responses from slow or unresponsive APIs, which could be indicative of a DoS attack or general API unavailability, thus protecting application resources.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Limits the resources (threads, connections) consumed by your application due to stalled RestSharp requests, improving application stability and preventing resource depletion.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** Medium Reduction - Timeouts make the application more resilient to DoS attempts targeting external APIs by preventing resource exhaustion due to prolonged waiting.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Medium Reduction - Prevents resource depletion caused by long-running RestSharp requests, enhancing application performance and stability.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, we have a default `RestClient.Timeout` set in our base RestSharp client initialization for most API interactions.

*   **Missing Implementation:** We need to review and potentially fine-tune the timeout values for different RestSharp clients based on the specific APIs they interact with. We also need to ensure consistent and robust error handling for timeout exceptions across all RestSharp usage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Credential Injection into RestSharp Requests](./mitigation_strategies/secure_credential_injection_into_restsharp_requests.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid Hardcoding Credentials in RestSharp Code:** Never hardcode API keys, tokens, passwords, or other sensitive credentials directly into your code where you configure RestSharp requests (e.g., in `AddDefaultHeader`, `AddHeader`, `Authenticator`).
    2.  **Use RestSharp Authentication Mechanisms Securely:** If using RestSharp's built-in authentication mechanisms (like `JwtAuthenticator`, `HttpBasicAuthenticator`, or custom authenticators), ensure you are providing credentials retrieved from secure sources (environment variables, secure vaults, etc.) and not hardcoded values.
    3.  **Inject Credentials via Headers or Parameters:** When adding credentials to RestSharp requests (e.g., using `AddHeader` or `AddParameter`), retrieve the credential values from secure configuration sources at runtime and inject them into the request.
    4.  **Review Custom Authentication Logic:** If you implement custom authentication logic with RestSharp (e.g., interceptors or request modification), carefully review the code to ensure credentials are handled securely and not exposed or hardcoded.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Credential Exposure (High Severity):** Prevents accidental or intentional exposure of sensitive credentials within the application code or RestSharp configurations, reducing the risk of unauthorized API access.
    *   **Insider Threats (Medium Severity):** Limits the risk of credential compromise by preventing credentials from being directly embedded in the codebase, making it harder for malicious insiders to extract them.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Credential Exposure:** High Reduction - Secure credential injection methods significantly reduce the risk of credentials being leaked through code or configuration.
    *   **Insider Threats:** Medium Reduction - Makes it more difficult for insiders to access credentials directly from the application code related to RestSharp usage.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. We retrieve API keys from environment variables in production, but some older code might still have less secure credential handling practices.

*   **Missing Implementation:** We need to conduct a code audit to identify and remediate any instances of hardcoded credentials in RestSharp configurations or request construction. We should enforce secure credential injection practices across all projects using RestSharp and provide clear guidelines for developers.
