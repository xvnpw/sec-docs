### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1. HTTP Header Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]

**Attack Vector:** 1.1. HTTP Header Injection

**Description:**

HTTP Header Injection occurs when an attacker can control or influence the content of HTTP headers sent by an application. In the context of RestSharp, this vulnerability arises when user-provided input, without proper sanitization or validation, is directly incorporated into HTTP headers within RestSharp requests.

**How it works in RestSharp:**

RestSharp provides several ways to add headers to HTTP requests:

*   **`AddHeader(name, value)`:** This method directly adds a header with the provided name and value. If the `value` is derived from user input and not properly sanitized, it can be manipulated to inject malicious headers.
*   **`AddDefaultHeader(name, value)`:** Similar to `AddHeader`, but these headers are added to all subsequent requests made by the RestClient instance. Vulnerable if default headers are constructed from unsanitized user input during application initialization.
*   **`Parameters` collection (ParameterType.HttpHeader):** While less common for direct user input, if parameters of type `HttpHeader` are populated with unsanitized user data, they can also lead to injection.
*   **String Concatenation/Formatting:**  Manually constructing header strings using string concatenation or formatting with user input is a highly risky practice.

**Vulnerability Examples in RestSharp:**

Let's consider a scenario where an application allows users to set a custom "User-Agent" header.

**Vulnerable Code Example:**

```csharp
using RestSharp;

public class VulnerableExample
{
    public static void SendRequest(string userInput)
    {
        var client = new RestClient("https://api.example.com");
        var request = new RestRequest("/resource", Method.Get);

        // Vulnerable: Directly using user input in header value
        request.AddHeader("User-Agent", userInput);

        var response = client.Execute(request);
        Console.WriteLine(response.Content);
    }
}
```

**Exploitation:**

An attacker could provide the following input for `userInput`:

```
MyCustomAgent\r\nX-Malicious-Header: InjectedValue
```

When this input is used in `AddHeader`, RestSharp will send the following headers (simplified):

```
GET /resource HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
User-Agent: MyCustomAgent
X-Malicious-Header: InjectedValue
... (other headers)
```

The attacker has successfully injected a new header `X-Malicious-Header`.

**Impact:**

The impact of HTTP Header Injection can range from medium to high depending on the context and the specific headers that can be injected.

*   **Bypass Security Controls:** Attackers can inject headers to bypass security mechanisms like:
    *   **Authentication/Authorization:** Injecting headers like `Authorization`, `Cookie`, or custom authentication headers to gain unauthorized access. (Less likely in direct injection, but possible in complex scenarios).
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Injecting or manipulating `Content-Security-Policy` headers to weaken or disable CSP, enabling Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
    *   **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):**  Crafting headers to evade WAF rules and filters.
*   **Access Escalation:** In certain scenarios, injecting specific headers might lead to access escalation by manipulating server-side logic that relies on header information for authorization decisions.
*   **Server-Side Vulnerabilities:**  Injected headers can sometimes trigger vulnerabilities in the backend server or application logic that processes these headers. This could lead to:
    *   **Log Injection:** Injecting malicious data into server logs by manipulating headers like `Referer` or `User-Agent`, potentially causing log analysis issues or even code execution in log processing systems.
    *   **Cache Poisoning:** Injecting headers that influence caching behavior, potentially poisoning caches with malicious content.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Injecting headers that cause excessive server-side processing or resource consumption.
*   **Information Disclosure:** In rare cases, injecting specific headers might lead to the server disclosing sensitive information in response headers or logs.

**Likelihood:** Medium

The likelihood is medium because while developers are generally aware of SQL injection and XSS, HTTP Header Injection is often overlooked.  Applications that dynamically construct headers based on user input without proper validation are susceptible.

**Impact:** Medium

The impact is medium because while it might not always lead to direct data breaches, it can bypass security controls, potentially escalate privileges, and open doors to other vulnerabilities. The severity depends heavily on the application's architecture and how headers are processed on the server-side.

**Effort:** Low

Exploiting HTTP Header Injection is generally low effort. Simple tools or even manual crafting of HTTP requests can be used to inject headers.

**Skill Level:** Low

The skill level required to exploit this vulnerability is low. Basic understanding of HTTP headers and how to manipulate them is sufficient.

**Detection Difficulty:** Medium

Detecting HTTP Header Injection can be medium in difficulty. It might not be immediately apparent in application logs or standard security monitoring.  Specialized security tools and careful code reviews are needed for effective detection.

**Mitigation Strategies (Detailed and RestSharp Specific):**

1.  **Sanitize and Validate User Input Before Using in Headers:**
    *   **Input Validation:**  Implement strict input validation on any user-provided data that will be used in HTTP headers. Define allowed characters, lengths, and formats. Reject or sanitize any input that does not conform to these rules.
    *   **Encoding:**  While not always sufficient alone, consider encoding user input before adding it to headers. However, be cautious as encoding might not prevent all injection attempts, especially if the server-side application decodes the input before processing.
    *   **Example (Validation):**

        ```csharp
        public static void SendRequestSecure(string userInput)
        {
            var client = new RestClient("https://api.example.com");
            var request = new RestRequest("/resource", Method.Get);

            // Secure: Input validation
            if (IsValidHeaderValue(userInput)) // Implement IsValidHeaderValue function
            {
                request.AddHeader("User-Agent", userInput);
            }
            else
            {
                // Handle invalid input (e.g., log error, reject request)
                Console.WriteLine("Invalid User-Agent input.");
                return;
            }

            var response = client.Execute(request);
            Console.WriteLine(response.Content);
        }

        private static bool IsValidHeaderValue(string value)
        {
            // Example validation: Allow only alphanumeric, spaces, and limited special characters
            return System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.IsMatch(value, "^[a-zA-Z0-9\\s\\-_.,;:]+$");
        }
        ```

2.  **Use RestSharp's Built-in Header Methods (`AddHeader`, `AddDefaultHeader`):**
    *   **Avoid Manual String Construction:**  Resist the temptation to manually construct header strings using string concatenation or formatting. RestSharp's `AddHeader` and `AddDefaultHeader` methods are designed to handle header encoding and formatting correctly, reducing the risk of injection if used with sanitized input.
    *   **Parameterization (with Caution):** While RestSharp's `Parameters` collection can be used for headers, it's generally safer to use `AddHeader` for explicit header manipulation. If using parameters for headers, ensure the parameter values are rigorously validated.

3.  **Avoid String Concatenation for Header Construction:**
    *   **Directly Use `AddHeader`:**  Instead of building header strings manually, directly use `request.AddHeader(headerName, headerValue)`. This ensures proper handling of header formatting by RestSharp.
    *   **Example (Secure - Avoiding String Concatenation):**

        ```csharp
        // Secure: Using AddHeader directly
        request.AddHeader("Custom-Header", sanitizedUserInput);
        ```

4.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Headers:**
    *   **Only Add Necessary Headers:**  Avoid adding headers based on user input unless absolutely necessary.  Minimize the number of headers that are dynamically constructed from user data.
    *   **Default Headers with Caution:**  Be extremely careful when using `AddDefaultHeader` with user-influenced values, as these headers will be applied to all subsequent requests, potentially widening the attack surface.

5.  **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  During code reviews, specifically scrutinize code sections that handle HTTP header manipulation, especially where user input is involved.
    *   **Static Analysis Tools:** Utilize static analysis security testing (SAST) tools that can identify potential HTTP Header Injection vulnerabilities in code.
    *   **Dynamic Analysis and Penetration Testing:**  Include HTTP Header Injection testing in dynamic application security testing (DAST) and penetration testing activities to identify vulnerabilities in a running application.

6.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    *   **WAF Rules:**  Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with rulesets designed to detect and prevent HTTP Header Injection attacks. WAFs can analyze incoming requests and block those that contain suspicious header patterns.
    *   **Defense in Depth:** WAFs should be considered as a defense-in-depth measure, not a replacement for secure coding practices.

**Testing and Verification:**

*   **Manual Testing:** Manually craft HTTP requests using tools like `curl`, `Postman`, or browser developer tools to inject malicious headers and observe the application's behavior.
*   **Automated Security Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanners that can detect HTTP Header Injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Unit and Integration Tests:** Write unit and integration tests that specifically test header handling logic, including scenarios with potentially malicious input.
*   **Penetration Testing:** Engage penetration testers to conduct thorough security assessments, including testing for HTTP Header Injection vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion:**

HTTP Header Injection is a real and potentially impactful vulnerability in RestSharp applications if developers are not careful about handling user input when constructing HTTP headers. By understanding the mechanisms of this attack, following secure coding practices, implementing input validation, and utilizing RestSharp's API correctly, developers can significantly mitigate the risk of HTTP Header Injection and build more secure applications. Regular security audits and testing are crucial to ensure the effectiveness of implemented mitigation strategies.
