### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.1. Inject Malicious Headers via User-Controlled Input [CRITICAL NODE]

#### 4.1. Understanding Header Injection

**What is Header Injection?**

Header injection is a type of web security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker can control or influence the HTTP headers sent by a web application. This is typically achieved by injecting malicious data into user-controlled input fields that are subsequently used to construct HTTP headers without proper sanitization or validation.

**Why is it Critical?**

This node is marked as **CRITICAL** because successful header injection can have severe consequences, potentially leading to:

* **Cache Poisoning:** Attackers can manipulate caching directives (e.g., `Cache-Control`, `Expires`) to poison caches, serving malicious content to other users or causing denial of service.
* **Session Hijacking/Fixation:** By injecting or manipulating `Cookie` headers, attackers can potentially steal or fixate user sessions.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** In certain scenarios, injecting headers that are reflected in responses (though less common directly from header injection itself, more related to response header manipulation vulnerabilities) or manipulating content-type headers could indirectly contribute to XSS vulnerabilities.
* **Open Redirection:** Injecting the `Location` header in responses can redirect users to attacker-controlled websites, leading to phishing or malware distribution.
* **Bypassing Security Controls:**  Attackers might manipulate headers used for authentication, authorization, or access control to bypass security mechanisms.
* **Information Disclosure:**  Injecting headers can sometimes lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, depending on the application's behavior and how headers are processed.
* **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (Indirectly):** While not direct SSRF, manipulating headers like `Host` or `X-Forwarded-Host` in certain backend systems could be exploited in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve SSRF-like outcomes.

#### 4.2. Header Injection in RestSharp Applications

RestSharp is a .NET library for making REST and HTTP API calls. Applications using RestSharp construct HTTP requests programmatically.  The vulnerability arises when user-controlled input is used to build these requests, specifically when setting HTTP headers, without proper security measures.

**How can it be achieved in RestSharp?**

In RestSharp, headers are typically added to requests using methods like:

* **`RestRequest.AddHeader(string name, string value)`:** This is the primary method for adding custom headers to a request. If the `name` or `value` parameters are directly derived from user input without validation, it becomes a potential injection point.
* **`RestRequest.AddParameter(string name, object value, ParameterType type)`:** While primarily used for query parameters, body parameters, and URL segments, if `ParameterType.HttpHeader` is used and the `value` is user-controlled, it can also lead to header injection.
* **Directly manipulating `RestRequest.Headers` collection:**  Although less common for direct user input, if the application logic allows modification of the `RestRequest.Headers` collection based on user input, it could be vulnerable.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine an application that allows users to set a custom "User-Agent" header for API requests.

```csharp
var client = new RestClient("https://api.example.com");
var request = new RestRequest("/resource", Method.Get);

// User input from a form field or query parameter
string userAgentInput = GetUserInput("userAgent");

// Vulnerable code: Directly using user input in header
request.AddHeader("User-Agent", userAgentInput);

var response = client.Execute(request);
```

In this vulnerable example, if `userAgentInput` is not properly validated, an attacker could inject malicious content. For instance, they could inject a CRLF sequence (`\r\n`) followed by another header, potentially manipulating subsequent headers or even the HTTP response body if the server is vulnerable to CRLF injection.

#### 4.3. Potential Attack Vectors and Examples

**Common Attack Vectors:**

* **CRLF Injection:** Injecting Carriage Return (`\r`) and Line Feed (`\n`) characters into header values. This allows attackers to inject new headers or even the HTTP response body in some cases, leading to various attacks like response splitting, cache poisoning, and session hijacking.
* **Header Value Manipulation:** Injecting malicious values into existing headers to alter their intended behavior. For example, manipulating the `Host` header, `X-Forwarded-For`, or custom headers used for application logic.

**Examples of Malicious Header Injection:**

1. **Cache Poisoning via `Cache-Control` Injection:**

   If an attacker can inject into a header that is used to set `Cache-Control`, they could force the server or intermediary caches to store a malicious response for a prolonged period.

   **Example Payload (injected into a user-controlled header value):**
   ```
   evil-header: value\r\nCache-Control: max-age=0
   ```
   This could force the response to be immediately expired in caches, potentially causing denial of service or unexpected behavior. Conversely, they could try to extend the cache lifetime for malicious content.

2. **Session Hijacking/Fixation via `Cookie` Injection:**

   While less direct in header injection (usually response header manipulation is more relevant for setting cookies), in some scenarios, if the application logic processes and reflects headers in responses, or if backend systems are vulnerable, injecting `Set-Cookie` headers might be possible.

   **Example Payload (injected into a user-controlled header value - less likely to be directly exploitable in RestSharp request headers, but illustrates the concept):**
   ```
   evil-header: value\r\nSet-Cookie: sessionid=malicious_session_id; Path=/
   ```
   This attempts to set a cookie on the client's browser.

3. **Open Redirection via `Location` Injection (Less Direct, more relevant to response header injection):**

   If the application somehow reflects request headers into response headers (highly unusual and bad practice), or if backend systems are vulnerable to CRLF injection and response splitting, an attacker might try to inject a `Location` header to redirect users.

   **Example Payload (injected into a user-controlled header value - highly unlikely to be directly exploitable in RestSharp request headers, but illustrates the concept):**
   ```
   evil-header: value\r\nLocation: http://attacker.com/malicious_page
   ```
   This attempts to redirect the user to `http://attacker.com/malicious_page`.

4. **Manipulating `X-Forwarded-For` for Access Control Bypass or Logging Spoofing:**

   If the application or backend systems rely on the `X-Forwarded-For` header for IP-based access control or logging, an attacker could inject a forged IP address.

   **Example Payload (injected into a user-controlled header value):**
   ```
   X-Forwarded-For: 1.2.3.4
   ```
   This could potentially bypass IP-based restrictions or spoof logs.

#### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies for RestSharp Applications

To effectively mitigate header injection vulnerabilities in RestSharp applications, developers should implement the following strategies:

1. **Input Validation and Sanitization:**

   * **Strictly validate all user-controlled input:** Before using any user-provided data to construct HTTP headers, rigorously validate the input against expected formats and character sets.
   * **Sanitize input:** Remove or encode potentially dangerous characters, especially CRLF sequences (`\r`, `\n`, `%0d`, `%0a`). Use appropriate encoding functions provided by your programming language or security libraries.
   * **Use allowlists (preferred) over blocklists:** Define what characters and formats are allowed in header values rather than trying to block specific malicious patterns, which can be easily bypassed.

2. **Secure Header Construction Practices:**

   * **Avoid direct concatenation of user input into header strings:**  Instead of directly embedding user input into header strings, use parameterized or safer header construction methods if available (though RestSharp's `AddHeader` is already parameterized in terms of name and value, the *value* still needs sanitization).
   * **Consider using dedicated security libraries or functions:**  Explore libraries or functions that provide secure header encoding and construction to help prevent common injection vulnerabilities.

3. **Context-Aware Encoding:**

   * **Encode output based on context:** If header values are ever reflected in responses (which should generally be avoided for security reasons), ensure proper output encoding based on the context (e.g., HTML encoding if reflected in HTML, URL encoding if reflected in URLs).

4. **Principle of Least Privilege:**

   * **Minimize user control over headers:**  Limit the extent to which users can influence HTTP headers. Only allow customization of headers when absolutely necessary and with strong security controls.
   * **Default to secure configurations:**  Set default headers securely and avoid exposing sensitive headers to user manipulation.

5. **Regular Security Audits and Testing:**

   * **Conduct regular security code reviews:**  Have security experts review the codebase to identify potential header injection vulnerabilities and other security flaws.
   * **Perform penetration testing:**  Simulate real-world attacks to test the application's resilience against header injection and other vulnerabilities.
   * **Use Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools:**  Integrate security scanning tools into the development pipeline to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities.

6. **Security Awareness Training:**

   * **Educate developers about header injection vulnerabilities:** Ensure that developers are aware of the risks and best practices for preventing header injection.
   * **Promote secure coding practices:**  Foster a security-conscious development culture within the team.

**Example of Mitigation (Input Validation and Sanitization):**

```csharp
var client = new RestClient("https://api.example.com");
var request = new RestRequest("/resource", Method.Get);

string userAgentInput = GetUserInput("userAgent");

// Sanitize user input - Example: Remove CRLF characters
string sanitizedUserAgent = userAgentInput.Replace("\r", "").Replace("\n", "");

// Add the sanitized header
request.AddHeader("User-Agent", sanitizedUserAgent);

var response = client.Execute(request);
```

**Note:**  While simple replacement of `\r` and `\n` is a basic example, more robust sanitization might involve using regular expressions or dedicated encoding functions depending on the complexity of allowed header values and the specific context.  For critical headers, consider completely disallowing user customization or using predefined, safe options.

**Conclusion:**

The "Inject Malicious Headers via User-Controlled Input" attack path is a critical security concern for applications using RestSharp. By understanding the nature of header injection vulnerabilities, potential attack vectors in RestSharp applications, and implementing robust mitigation strategies like input validation, secure coding practices, and regular security testing, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of successful exploitation and protect their applications and users.  Prioritizing secure header handling is crucial for building resilient and secure applications with RestSharp.
