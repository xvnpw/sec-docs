# Threat Model Analysis for restsharp/restsharp

## Threat: [Parameter Injection](./threats/parameter_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates request parameters by injecting malicious code or unexpected values. This is achieved by exploiting dynamically constructed parameters using unsanitized user input when using RestSharp's parameter adding features. The attacker aims to alter server-side behavior, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized actions, or command execution on the server.
*   **Impact:** High. Can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, data manipulation, or server-side command execution depending on the server-side vulnerability.
*   **RestSharp Component Affected:** `RestRequest.AddParameter()` function, URL construction logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always sanitize and validate user input before using it to construct request parameters.
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements on the server-side to prevent SQL injection if applicable.
    *   Encode parameters properly using RestSharp's built-in encoding mechanisms or manual URL encoding functions.
    *   Implement input validation on the server-side as well.

## Threat: [URL Manipulation](./threats/url_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the target URL used by RestSharp by exploiting dynamically constructed URLs based on unsanitized user input or external data. The attacker redirects requests to malicious servers under their control to steal data, perform phishing attacks, or compromise the application's integrity by interacting with unintended endpoints through RestSharp.
*   **Impact:** High. Can lead to data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers, phishing attacks, or interaction with malicious endpoints leading to further compromise.
*   **RestSharp Component Affected:** `RestClient` base URL configuration, `RestRequest` resource path construction.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly validate and sanitize any user input or external data used to construct URLs.
    *   Use whitelisting for allowed URLs or domains if possible.
    *   Avoid dynamic URL construction based on untrusted input.
    *   Implement robust input validation on the server-side to prevent redirection to malicious URLs.

## Threat: [Request Body Manipulation](./threats/request_body_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious content into the request body (e.g., JSON, XML) by exploiting dynamically constructed bodies using unsanitized user input when using RestSharp to send data. This can lead to server-side vulnerabilities like XXE (if XML is used), command injection, or other injection attacks depending on how the server processes the request body sent by RestSharp.
*   **Impact:** High. Can lead to server-side vulnerabilities like XXE, command injection, data manipulation, or denial of service depending on the server-side processing of the request body.
*   **RestSharp Component Affected:** `RestRequest.AddBody()`, serialization mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize and validate user input before including it in the request body.
    *   Use secure serialization libraries and configurations.
    *   If using XML, disable external entity processing to prevent XXE attacks.
    *   Implement robust input validation on the server-side to handle potentially malicious request bodies.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization](./threats/insecure_deserialization.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits insecure deserialization vulnerabilities by providing malicious data in the server response that is then deserialized by RestSharp. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the client-side if vulnerable deserialization methods are used by RestSharp, especially with formats like XML or custom deserializers.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Can lead to arbitrary code execution on the client application, potentially compromising the entire system.
*   **RestSharp Component Affected:** Deserialization features, `IRestResponse.Content`, custom deserializers.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid deserializing untrusted data.
    *   Use secure deserialization methods and libraries.
    *   If using XML, ensure secure XML parsing configurations are used to prevent XXE during deserialization.
    *   Carefully review and secure any custom deserializers used with RestSharp.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependencies of RestSharp](./threats/vulnerable_dependencies_of_restsharp.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in RestSharp's dependencies to compromise applications using RestSharp. If RestSharp relies on libraries with known security flaws, applications using RestSharp become indirectly vulnerable to those flaws.
*   **Impact:** High. Can range from information disclosure to remote code execution depending on the vulnerability in the dependency.
*   **RestSharp Component Affected:** RestSharp's dependency management, underlying libraries.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update RestSharp to the latest version to benefit from dependency updates and security patches.
    *   Monitor security advisories for RestSharp and its dependencies.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify and address vulnerable dependencies.

## Threat: [Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration](./threats/insecure_tlsssl_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker performs man-in-the-middle attacks by exploiting insecure TLS/SSL configurations in the application or RestSharp's environment. This includes disabling certificate validation, using outdated protocols, or weak ciphers, allowing attackers to eavesdrop on or modify communication between the application and the server when using RestSharp for HTTPS requests.
*   **Impact:** High. Can lead to data breaches, eavesdropping, and manipulation of communication between the client and server.
*   **RestSharp Component Affected:** HTTPS request handling, TLS/SSL configuration (potentially influenced by underlying .NET framework).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure TLS/SSL certificate validation is enabled and properly configured.
    *   Use strong and up-to-date TLS/SSL protocols and cipher suites.
    *   Avoid disabling certificate validation in production environments.
    *   Regularly review and update TLS/SSL configurations.
