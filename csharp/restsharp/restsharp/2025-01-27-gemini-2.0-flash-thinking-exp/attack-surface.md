# Attack Surface Analysis for restsharp/restsharp

## Attack Surface: [Parameter Injection](./attack_surfaces/parameter_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code or commands into request parameters (path, query, headers) to manipulate server-side logic or gain unauthorized access.
*   **RestSharp Contribution:** RestSharp's API for constructing requests with parameters directly facilitates this attack surface. If developers use RestSharp to build requests by directly embedding unsanitized user inputs into parameters, they create a vulnerability. RestSharp itself doesn't sanitize inputs; this is the developer's responsibility when using the library.
*   **Example:** An application uses user input to dynamically construct a RestSharp request path like `client.Execute(new RestRequest($"/items/{userInput}"))`. If `userInput` is not validated, an attacker could inject `../admin` to potentially access admin resources.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, privilege escalation, data modification, or denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-supplied data *before* incorporating it into RestSharp request parameters. Use allow-lists and reject invalid characters or patterns.
    *   **Parameterized Queries/Paths (where applicable):**  If the target API supports parameterized queries or paths in a safer way (e.g., using placeholders that are handled server-side to prevent injection), utilize those mechanisms in conjunction with RestSharp.
    *   **Encoding Awareness:** Understand RestSharp's parameter encoding behavior and ensure it aligns with the API's expectations. Be aware of contexts where manual encoding might still be necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Request Body Manipulation (XXE, SSRF via Body)](./attack_surfaces/request_body_manipulation__xxe__ssrf_via_body_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate the request body content to exploit vulnerabilities like XML External Entity (XXE) injection or Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) when the body content is processed by the server.
*   **RestSharp Contribution:** RestSharp handles request body serialization and sending. If the application uses RestSharp to send XML requests or includes URLs within the request body based on user input, and doesn't sanitize this input, it can be vulnerable. RestSharp's role is in *sending* the potentially malicious body, the vulnerability arises from how the *application constructs* the body and how the *server processes* it.
*   **Example (XXE):** An application uses RestSharp to send XML requests and deserializes XML responses. If user-controlled data is used to build the XML request body using RestSharp, an attacker could inject an external entity definition within the XML to read local files or trigger denial of service.
*   **Example (SSRF via Body):** An application allows users to provide URLs that are included in the JSON request body sent via RestSharp. If the server-side application processes these URLs without validation, an attacker could provide an internal URL to access internal resources.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (file access, internal network information), remote code execution (in XXE cases), or denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (especially for XXE and SSRF)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate and sanitize user-provided data *before* it is included in the request body that RestSharp sends.
    *   **Use Safe Serialization Formats:** Prefer JSON over XML when possible, as JSON is inherently less prone to XXE vulnerabilities.
    *   **Disable External Entities (XXE):** If XML is necessary, configure the XML serialization/deserialization process (potentially outside of RestSharp's direct control, depending on how serialization is implemented) to disable external entity processing.
    *   **URL Validation (SSRF):**  Validate URLs in request bodies against an allow-list of permitted domains or protocols *before* sending the request with RestSharp. Avoid processing user-provided URLs directly on the server without validation.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the deserialization process to execute arbitrary code or cause denial of service by sending malicious payloads that are deserialized by the application.
*   **RestSharp Contribution:** RestSharp's features for automatic deserialization of API responses into objects directly contribute to this attack surface. If the application uses RestSharp to deserialize responses from untrusted APIs without proper security measures, it becomes vulnerable. RestSharp itself performs the deserialization based on configuration; the risk is in deserializing untrusted data.
*   **Example:** An application uses RestSharp to consume an external API and automatically deserializes JSON responses into .NET objects using RestSharp's built-in deserializers or custom ones configured with RestSharp. If the API is compromised or malicious, an attacker could send a crafted JSON payload that exploits a deserialization vulnerability in the .NET framework or libraries used for deserialization, triggered by RestSharp's deserialization process.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation (Post-Deserialization):** Validate the *deserialized objects* after RestSharp has processed the response. Check for unexpected values, types, or structures before using the data.
    *   **Secure Deserialization Practices:**  If possible, avoid automatic deserialization of responses from completely untrusted APIs. If deserialization is necessary, use secure deserialization libraries and configurations. Consider using safer data formats or custom parsing logic instead of relying solely on automatic deserialization for untrusted sources.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Limit the permissions of the application process to minimize the impact if code execution occurs due to a deserialization vulnerability.

## Attack Surface: [Certificate Validation Issues (If Misconfigured via RestSharp)](./attack_surfaces/certificate_validation_issues__if_misconfigured_via_restsharp_.md)

*   **Description:** Improper or disabled certificate validation weakens TLS/SSL security, making the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks by accepting fraudulent certificates.
*   **RestSharp Contribution:** While RestSharp defaults to secure certificate validation, it provides options to *customize or disable* certificate validation through properties like `client.RemoteCertificateValidationCallback`. If developers use these options incorrectly, especially by disabling validation for production, they directly introduce this vulnerability through RestSharp's configuration.
*   **Example:** During development or testing, certificate validation is disabled in RestSharp using `client.RemoteCertificateValidationCallback = (sender, certificate, chain, sslPolicyErrors) => true;`. This setting is mistakenly left in production code, allowing an attacker with a fraudulent certificate to intercept traffic without detection when RestSharp makes requests.
*   **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, data interception, and potential data modification.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Disabling Certificate Validation:**  Never disable certificate validation in production environments. Remove any code that disables or weakens certificate validation before deploying.
    *   **Review Custom Validation Logic:** If custom certificate validation is absolutely necessary via `RemoteCertificateValidationCallback`, carefully review and thoroughly test the custom logic to ensure it is secure and correctly validates certificate chains and hostnames. Ensure it doesn't inadvertently bypass security checks.
    *   **Configuration Management:**  Use configuration management practices to ensure that certificate validation settings are correctly configured for different environments (development, testing, production) and that insecure settings are not accidentally deployed to production.
