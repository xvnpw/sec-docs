# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for restsharp/restsharp

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update RestSharp](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_restsharp.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update RestSharp
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Current RestSharp Version:** Check your project's dependency file (e.g., `.csproj`, `packages.config`) to determine the currently used RestSharp version.
    2.  **Monitor for Updates:** Regularly check NuGet.org or the RestSharp GitHub repository ([https://github.com/restsharp/restsharp/releases](https://github.com/restsharp/restsharp/releases)) for new releases.
    3.  **Review Release Notes:** Examine the release notes for each new RestSharp version, paying close attention to security fixes and bug resolutions.
    4.  **Update RestSharp Dependency:** Update the RestSharp package in your project's dependency file to the latest stable version. Use your package manager (e.g., NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio, `dotnet add package RestSharp` in CLI).
    5.  **Test Application:** After updating RestSharp, thoroughly test your application's functionalities that utilize RestSharp to ensure compatibility and identify any regressions introduced by the update.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in RestSharp (High Severity):** Outdated RestSharp versions may contain known security vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Updating patches these vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities within the RestSharp library itself.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Dependency versions are tracked, and updates are considered during quarterly reviews, but it's a manual process.
    *   *Location:* Project documentation mentions quarterly dependency review.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated checks for RestSharp updates are not in place.
    *   Update process is not consistently applied immediately upon new RestSharp releases.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce TLS/SSL for All RestSharp Requests](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_tlsssl_for_all_restsharp_requests.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce TLS/SSL for All RestSharp Requests
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Base URL with HTTPS:** When creating a `RestClient` instance in RestSharp, ensure the `BaseUrl` property is set to an HTTPS endpoint (e.g., `client = new RestClient("https://api.example.com");`).
    2.  **Verify Server HTTPS Configuration:** Confirm that the API server you are interacting with is correctly configured to accept HTTPS connections and has a valid SSL/TLS certificate.
    3.  **Explicitly Set Request Protocol (If Needed):** While RestSharp defaults to HTTPS when the base URL starts with `https://`, you can explicitly ensure HTTPS by configuring the request URI appropriately when creating `RestRequest` objects.
    4.  **Test HTTPS Connections:** Verify through testing that all RestSharp requests are indeed made over HTTPS. You can use browser developer tools or network inspection tools to confirm the protocol used for communication.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from intercepting and potentially manipulating communication between your application and the API server by ensuring encrypted communication.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping (High Severity):** Protects sensitive data transmitted via RestSharp requests and responses from being intercepted and read by unauthorized parties.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of data breaches and MitM attacks by enforcing encrypted communication for all RestSharp interactions.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Base URLs are generally configured with `https://`, but explicit checks and enforcement within the code are not consistently applied.
    *   *Location:* Configuration files where API base URLs are defined.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent checks within the application code to ensure all RestSharp requests are directed to HTTPS endpoints.
    *   Potentially, configuration to explicitly reject insecure HTTP connections at the RestSharp client level if possible (depending on underlying HTTP client capabilities).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Request Timeouts in RestSharp](./mitigation_strategies/configure_request_timeouts_in_restsharp.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configure Request Timeouts in RestSharp
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Set RestClient Timeout:** Configure the `Timeout` property of the `RestClient` instance. This sets a timeout in milliseconds for the entire request, including connection establishment, sending data, and receiving the response.  Example: `client.Timeout = 10000; // 10 seconds`.
    2.  **Set RestRequest Timeout (Optional):** For individual requests, you can also set the `RequestTimeout` property of the `RestRequest` object to override the `RestClient`'s default timeout for specific calls. Example: `request.RequestTimeout = 5000; // 5 seconds for this request`.
    3.  **Choose Appropriate Timeout Values:** Select timeout values that are reasonable for your API's expected response times and network conditions.  Too short timeouts can lead to false positives, while excessively long timeouts can leave your application vulnerable to resource exhaustion.
    4.  **Handle Timeout Exceptions:** Implement proper exception handling in your code to catch `TimeoutException` (or similar exceptions depending on the underlying HTTP client) that RestSharp might throw when requests exceed the configured timeouts. Handle these exceptions gracefully and prevent application crashes or hangs.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents attackers from causing your application to hang indefinitely by sending requests that take an excessively long time to respond or never respond. Timeouts limit the resources consumed by such requests.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):**  Limits the resources (threads, connections) consumed by slow or unresponsive API calls, preventing resource depletion and improving application stability under load or attack.
*   **Impact:** Moderately reduces the impact of DoS attacks and resource exhaustion by limiting the duration of RestSharp requests.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Default RestSharp timeout behavior might be relied upon, but explicit configuration of timeouts is not consistently applied across all `RestClient` instances.
    *   *Location:*  Some RestSharp client initializations might implicitly use default timeouts.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent and explicit configuration of `Timeout` for all `RestClient` instances and `RequestTimeout` for critical `RestRequest`s where needed.
    *   Documentation of chosen timeout values and the rationale behind them.
    *   Robust error handling specifically for timeout exceptions in RestSharp request execution.
