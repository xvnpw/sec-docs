# Threat Model Analysis for microsoft/garnet

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Garnet Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_garnet_communication.md)

Description: An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and Garnet servers. By eavesdropping on unencrypted communication, they can steal sensitive data being cached or modify data in transit, potentially corrupting the cache or application behavior.
Impact: Information Disclosure, Data Breach, Data Corruption, Potential Application Malfunction.
Affected Garnet Component: Network communication channel between application and Garnet servers.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Enforce TLS/SSL encryption for all communication between the application and Garnet.
    * Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for stronger authentication.
    * Use strong cipher suites for TLS/SSL.
    * Regularly update TLS/SSL libraries.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attack Targeting Garnet Cluster](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__attack_targeting_garnet_cluster.md)

Description: An attacker floods the Garnet cluster with a high volume of requests, exceeding its capacity and causing it to become unresponsive or crash. This disrupts application functionality that relies on the cache, leading to service unavailability.
Impact: Denial of Service, Application Unavailability, Performance Degradation, Potential Revenue Loss.
Affected Garnet Component: Garnet cluster infrastructure (network interfaces, server nodes).
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement rate limiting and request throttling on the application side towards Garnet.
    * Utilize network firewalls and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to filter malicious traffic directed at Garnet.
    * Properly size and scale the Garnet cluster infrastructure to handle expected load and potential spikes.
    * Implement load balancing across Garnet nodes to distribute traffic.

## Threat: [Compromise of Garnet Server Nodes](./threats/compromise_of_garnet_server_nodes.md)

Description: An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Garnet software, operating system, or misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access to a Garnet server node. Once compromised, they can access and exfiltrate cached data, potentially modify or delete it, or use the compromised node to launch further attacks within the network.
Impact: Information Disclosure, Data Breach, Data Manipulation, Data Loss, Lateral Movement, System Compromise, Potential for persistent backdoor and long-term compromise.
Affected Garnet Component: Garnet server nodes, Garnet software, Operating System running Garnet.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Regularly patch and update Garnet software and underlying operating systems to address known vulnerabilities.
    * Harden Garnet server configurations by disabling unnecessary services, enforcing strong passwords, and following security best practices.
    * Implement strong access control and authentication mechanisms for Garnet server management and access.
    * Utilize intrusion detection systems (IDS) and security monitoring to detect suspicious activity on Garnet servers.
    * Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability scanning of Garnet infrastructure to identify and remediate weaknesses.
    * Implement the principle of least privilege for access control to Garnet servers and related resources.

## Threat: [Insufficient Access Control to Garnet Management Interfaces](./threats/insufficient_access_control_to_garnet_management_interfaces.md)

Description: An attacker gains unauthorized access to Garnet management interfaces (if exposed) due to weak credentials, default passwords, or lack of proper access control mechanisms. This allows them to reconfigure the cluster, potentially disrupt service availability, or access and manipulate sensitive data stored in the cache.
Impact: Unauthorized Access, Configuration Tampering, Denial of Service, Data Breach, Potential for privilege escalation and further system compromise.
Affected Garnet Component: Garnet management interfaces (if any are exposed for management).
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Restrict access to Garnet management interfaces to only authorized personnel and systems.
    * Implement strong authentication mechanisms for management interfaces, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible.
    * Use role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions for different administrative tasks.
    * Disable or secure any unnecessary management interfaces that are not actively used.
    * Regularly audit access logs for management interfaces to detect and investigate any suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Data Leakage through Cached Data](./threats/data_leakage_through_cached_data.md)

Description: Sensitive data is cached in Garnet without proper protection or access control. An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the Garnet cluster (e.g., through node compromise or management interface vulnerability) can access and exfiltrate this sensitive cached data, leading to data breaches and privacy violations.
Impact: Information Disclosure, Data Breach, Privacy Violation, Reputational Damage, Legal and regulatory repercussions due to exposure of sensitive data.
Affected Garnet Component: Garnet cache storage, data access control mechanisms within Garnet itself.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Minimize the caching of sensitive data in Garnet whenever possible.
    * Implement granular access control mechanisms within Garnet to restrict access to cached data based on roles and permissions.
    * Consider applying data masking, anonymization, or encryption techniques to sensitive data before it is cached in Garnet.
    * Implement and enforce data retention policies to automatically remove sensitive data from the cache after it is no longer needed.
    * Regularly review the types of data being cached and the effectiveness of access control policies.

## Threat: [Serialization/Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./threats/serializationdeserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: If Garnet or the application interacting with Garnet uses serialization/deserialization for data exchange, vulnerabilities in these processes (e.g., insecure deserialization) can be exploited. By crafting malicious serialized data, an attacker could potentially achieve remote code execution on either the application or Garnet server side, leading to full system compromise.
Impact: Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, Data Corruption, System Compromise, Complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
Affected Garnet Component: Data serialization/deserialization processes within Garnet or in the application's interaction with Garnet.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Use secure and well-vetted serialization libraries and formats that are less prone to vulnerabilities.
    * Avoid using insecure serialization formats like Java serialization if possible.
    * Regularly update serialization libraries to patch known vulnerabilities and stay current with security best practices.
    * Implement robust input validation and sanitization even after deserialization to prevent exploitation of deserialization flaws.
    * Consider using safer data exchange formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers which are generally less susceptible to deserialization vulnerabilities compared to binary formats.
