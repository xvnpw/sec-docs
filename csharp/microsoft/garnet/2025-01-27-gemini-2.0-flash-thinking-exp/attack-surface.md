# Attack Surface Analysis for microsoft/garnet

## Attack Surface: [Network Exposure - Garnet Server Port](./attack_surfaces/network_exposure_-_garnet_server_port.md)

*   **Description:** Garnet exposes a network port to accept client connections, creating a direct network attack vector.
*   **How Garnet Contributes:** Garnet *requires* a network port to function as a cache server, inherently exposing it to network-based attacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits an unpatched vulnerability in Garnet's network protocol implementation by sending specially crafted packets to the server port, leading to remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Garnet server within a private network segment, limiting direct exposure to the public internet.
    *   **Firewall Hardening:** Implement strict firewall rules to allow connections only from authorized clients and networks to the Garnet port.
    *   **Regular Security Patching:**  Apply security patches and updates for Garnet promptly to address known vulnerabilities in the network protocol and server implementation.
    *   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Deploy IDS/IPS to monitor network traffic to the Garnet port for malicious patterns and attempts to exploit vulnerabilities.
    *   **TLS Encryption:** Enforce TLS encryption for all client connections to Garnet to protect data in transit and prevent eavesdropping.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** If Garnet uses insecure deserialization practices, attackers can inject malicious serialized payloads to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **How Garnet Contributes:** Garnet's internal communication or data handling might rely on serialization. Vulnerabilities in how Garnet deserializes data can be exploited.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized object within a cache request. When Garnet deserializes this object, it triggers a vulnerability in the deserialization process, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Garnet server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise, data breach, data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Serialization Libraries:** Ensure Garnet uses secure and up-to-date serialization libraries. Avoid vulnerable or known-to-be-problematic deserialization methods.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Pre-Deserialization):**  Implement robust input validation and sanitization *before* deserializing any data received from clients or external sources.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Garnet server process with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
    *   **Sandboxing/Containerization:** Deploy Garnet within a sandboxed environment or container to restrict the server's access to system resources and limit the blast radius of a compromise.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct security audits and code reviews of Garnet's serialization and deserialization logic to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Cache Poisoning (High Impact Scenarios)](./attack_surfaces/cache_poisoning__high_impact_scenarios_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious data into the cache, leading to application malfunction or serving compromised data to users, with potentially high impact.
*   **How Garnet Contributes:** Garnet's core function is data storage. If access controls are weak or input validation is insufficient *at the Garnet level or in the application using Garnet*, it can be exploited for cache poisoning.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the application's logic that interacts with Garnet, allowing them to inject malicious JavaScript code into a cached value. When users access the application and retrieve this poisoned data from the cache, the malicious JavaScript executes in their browsers, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or other client-side compromises.
*   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), serving malicious content to users, application logic manipulation, potential for account takeover or further attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (Specifically focusing on high-impact scenarios like XSS or application logic compromise)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation and Output Encoding (Application Side):** Implement rigorous input validation and output encoding in the application code that interacts with Garnet to prevent injection of malicious data into the cache and to safely handle data retrieved from the cache.
    *   **Access Control Lists (ACLs) within Garnet (if available):** Utilize Garnet's access control features (if provided) to restrict write access to the cache to only authorized application components.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy in the application to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities arising from cache poisoning.
    *   **Regular Security Testing (Application and Garnet Integration):** Conduct regular security testing, including penetration testing and code reviews, to identify and address vulnerabilities in the application's caching logic and Garnet integration.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configurations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configurations.md)

*   **Description:** Garnet's default settings might have security weaknesses, such as disabled authentication or overly permissive access, leading to vulnerabilities if not hardened.
*   **How Garnet Contributes:** Garnet, like many systems, might prioritize ease of initial setup over security in its default configuration.
*   **Example:** Garnet is deployed with default settings that do not require authentication. An attacker on the same network can connect to the Garnet server without credentials and gain full access to cached data, potentially modifying or deleting it.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to cached data, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Configuration Hardening Guide:**  Consult Garnet's security configuration guide and documentation to understand and implement recommended security hardening steps.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Disable any Garnet features or functionalities that are not required for the application's use case to reduce the attack surface.
    *   **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Enable and enforce strong authentication mechanisms for client access to Garnet. Implement granular authorization to control access to specific cache operations and data.
    *   **Regular Configuration Reviews:** Periodically review Garnet's configuration settings to ensure they remain secure and aligned with security best practices.
    *   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Use Infrastructure as Code to automate the deployment and configuration of Garnet with secure settings enforced from the outset.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Critical Impact)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_impact_.md)

*   **Description:** Garnet relies on third-party libraries. Critical vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited through Garnet, leading to severe consequences.
*   **How Garnet Contributes:** Garnet's security is indirectly dependent on the security of its dependencies. Vulnerable dependencies become attack vectors accessible via Garnet.
*   **Example:** A critical remote code execution vulnerability (e.g., Log4Shell-like) is discovered in a logging library that Garnet uses. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests to Garnet that trigger the vulnerable logging functionality, leading to server compromise.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise, data breach, denial of service, wide-ranging system impact depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):** Generate and maintain an SBOM for Garnet to track all dependencies and their versions.
    *   **Automated Dependency Scanning:** Implement automated tools to regularly scan Garnet's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Proactive Dependency Updates:**  Establish a process for promptly updating Garnet's dependencies to the latest versions, especially when security patches are released.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring and Alerting:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases to receive timely notifications about new vulnerabilities affecting Garnet's dependencies.
    *   **Vendor Security Communication:**  Establish communication channels with Garnet's maintainers or vendor to stay informed about security updates and recommended mitigation measures.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion Attacks (High Severity DoS)](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_attacks__high_severity_dos_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can intentionally exhaust Garnet's resources (memory, CPU) to cause denial of service, severely impacting application availability.
*   **How Garnet Contributes:** Garnet, as a cache server, is designed to consume resources. Maliciously crafted requests or excessive data can be used to overload its resource limits.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a flood of requests to Garnet to store a massive amount of data, exceeding the server's memory capacity and causing it to crash or become unresponsive, leading to application downtime.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, application downtime, inability to access cached data, potential cascading failures in dependent systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Resource Quotas and Limits:** Configure resource quotas and limits for Garnet, such as maximum memory usage, connection limits, and request size limits.
    *   **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Implement rate limiting and request throttling mechanisms to control the rate of client requests and prevent overwhelming the server.
    *   **Input Validation and Size Restrictions:**  Validate the size and nature of data being stored in the cache to prevent excessively large or malicious data from consuming resources.
    *   **Monitoring and Alerting (Resource Usage):** Implement comprehensive monitoring of Garnet's resource usage (CPU, memory, network) and set up alerts to detect and respond to resource exhaustion attempts.
    *   **Load Balancing and Scalability:** Deploy Garnet in a load-balanced and scalable architecture to distribute traffic and resource consumption across multiple instances, improving resilience to DoS attacks.
