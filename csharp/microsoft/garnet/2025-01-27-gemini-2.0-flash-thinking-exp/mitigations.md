## Mitigation Strategy: [Mutual Authentication between Garnet Nodes](./mitigation_strategies/mutual_authentication_between_garnet_nodes.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Garnet Authentication Mechanisms:**  Consult Garnet's documentation to identify supported authentication mechanisms for node-to-node communication within the Garnet cluster. Look for features like certificate-based authentication, shared secrets, or integration with authentication services.
    2.  **Configure Mutual Authentication in Garnet:** Configure Garnet to enforce mutual authentication between nodes. This ensures that each node verifies the identity of other nodes before establishing communication and joining the cluster. This configuration should be done through Garnet's configuration files, API, or management interface.
    3.  **Secure Credential Management within Garnet:** Securely manage any credentials (certificates, keys, secrets) required for mutual authentication within Garnet. Utilize Garnet's built-in credential management features if available, or integrate with secure secrets management solutions for storing and distributing credentials to Garnet nodes.
    4.  **Test and Verify Authentication:** Thoroughly test the mutual authentication setup within Garnet to ensure that only authorized nodes can successfully join and communicate within the Garnet cluster. Monitor Garnet logs for authentication failures and unauthorized connection attempts.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Rogue Node Injection (High Severity): Prevents unauthorized or malicious nodes from joining the Garnet cluster and potentially injecting malicious data, disrupting operations, or gaining unauthorized access.
    *   Impersonation Attacks (High Severity):  Makes it difficult for an attacker to impersonate a legitimate Garnet node and gain unauthorized access to the data grid or disrupt cluster operations.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Rogue Node Injection: Significantly reduces risk.
    *   Impersonation Attacks: Significantly reduces risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No. Mutual authentication between Garnet nodes using Garnet's features is not currently configured.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Investigation into Garnet's authentication capabilities and implementation of mutual authentication for all Garnet node communication using Garnet's built-in features.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Garnet Operations](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac__for_garnet_operations.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Explore Garnet's RBAC Features:**  Investigate if Garnet provides built-in Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) features or mechanisms for managing permissions and access to data and operations within the data grid. Consult Garnet's documentation for RBAC configuration options.
    2.  **Define Garnet Roles and Permissions:** If Garnet supports RBAC, define roles that align with your application's access control requirements (e.g., `data_reader`, `data_writer`, `admin`). Assign granular permissions to each role, specifying which Garnet operations and data resources each role can access. Configure these roles and permissions within Garnet's RBAC system.
    3.  **Integrate Application with Garnet RBAC:**  Modify your application code to integrate with Garnet's RBAC system. When your application interacts with Garnet, ensure that it authenticates and authorizes requests based on the defined roles and permissions. This might involve using Garnet's client libraries or APIs to enforce RBAC.
    4.  **Enforce RBAC Policies within Garnet:** Configure Garnet to enforce the defined RBAC policies. Ensure that access control decisions are made by Garnet itself based on the roles and permissions, rather than relying solely on application-level checks.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Modification (Medium Severity): Prevents users or application components from modifying data in Garnet that they are not authorized to change, enforced directly by Garnet.
    *   Unauthorized Data Deletion (Medium Severity): Protects against accidental or malicious deletion of data by unauthorized users, controlled by Garnet's access control.
    *   Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity): Limits the impact of compromised application components or accounts by restricting their access to only necessary operations within Garnet, as enforced by Garnet's RBAC.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Modification: Moderately reduces risk.
    *   Unauthorized Data Deletion: Moderately reduces risk.
    *   Privilege Escalation: Moderately reduces risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No. RBAC is not currently implemented using Garnet's features (if any exist). Application-level authorization is basic and not integrated with Garnet's potential RBAC capabilities.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Investigation into Garnet's RBAC features and implementation of a formal RBAC system within Garnet, integrated with the application's access patterns.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Rate Limiting and Request Throttling within Garnet](./mitigation_strategies/implement_rate_limiting_and_request_throttling_within_garnet.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Check for Garnet Rate Limiting Features:**  Review Garnet's documentation to determine if it offers built-in rate limiting or request throttling features. Look for configuration options that allow you to control the rate of incoming requests or operations processed by Garnet.
    2.  **Configure Garnet Rate Limits:** If Garnet provides rate limiting features, configure them to protect against excessive request rates. Define appropriate rate limits and throttling thresholds based on Garnet's capacity and expected legitimate traffic patterns. Configure these limits within Garnet's configuration or management interface.
    3.  **Apply Rate Limits to Critical Operations:** Focus rate limiting on critical or resource-intensive Garnet operations that are most susceptible to DoS attacks or resource exhaustion.
    4.  **Monitor Rate Limiting Effectiveness:** Implement monitoring to track the effectiveness of Garnet's rate limiting. Monitor request rates, throttled requests, and Garnet's resource utilization to ensure that rate limiting is functioning as intended and protecting against excessive load.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (High Severity): Protects Garnet directly from being overwhelmed by a flood of requests by enforcing rate limits within Garnet itself, preventing service disruption.
    *   Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity): Prevents a single client or operation from monopolizing Garnet resources by limiting request rates at the Garnet level, ensuring fair resource allocation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks: Significantly reduces risk.
    *   Resource Exhaustion: Moderately reduces risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No. Rate limiting and request throttling are not currently implemented using Garnet's features.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Investigation into Garnet's rate limiting capabilities and implementation of rate limiting and throttling within Garnet itself to protect against DoS and resource exhaustion.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Scan Garnet Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_scan_garnet_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Garnet's Dependencies:**  Obtain a comprehensive list of all libraries and components that Microsoft Garnet depends on. This list should include both direct and transitive dependencies. This information is typically available in Garnet's project files (e.g., build scripts, dependency manifests).
    2.  **Automate Dependency Scanning for Garnet:** Integrate a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool into your development and deployment pipeline specifically for scanning Garnet's dependencies. Configure the SCA tool to analyze Garnet's dependency list regularly and automatically.
    3.  **Schedule Regular Scans:** Schedule automated scans of Garnet's dependencies on a regular basis (e.g., daily or weekly). This ensures continuous monitoring for newly discovered vulnerabilities in Garnet's dependency chain.
    4.  **Vulnerability Reporting and Remediation for Garnet Dependencies:** Establish a clear process for reviewing and addressing vulnerability reports generated by the SCA tool for Garnet's dependencies. Prioritize remediation based on vulnerability severity and potential impact on Garnet and your application. This may involve updating Garnet dependencies or applying security patches provided by dependency maintainers.
