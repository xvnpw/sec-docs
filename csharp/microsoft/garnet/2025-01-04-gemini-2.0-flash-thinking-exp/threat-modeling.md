# Threat Model Analysis for microsoft/garnet

## Threat: [Unencrypted Inter-Node Communication](./threats/unencrypted_inter-node_communication.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts network packets exchanged between Garnet nodes. They analyze the unencrypted data to gain access to sensitive information stored in the key-value store. This could involve passively monitoring network traffic or actively performing man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Impact:** Confidential data stored in Garnet is exposed to unauthorized parties. This could lead to data breaches, compliance violations, and reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** Inter-node communication module, network layer.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enable TLS encryption for inter-node communication.
* Configure Garnet to enforce encrypted connections.
* Use a private network for Garnet cluster communication.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Inter-Node Traffic](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_inter-node_traffic.md)

**Description:** An attacker positions themselves between Garnet nodes and intercepts, modifies, or relays communication. They could alter data being replicated, inject malicious commands, or disrupt the cluster's operation.

**Impact:** Data integrity is compromised, leading to inconsistent data across the cluster. The attacker could potentially gain control over the cluster's behavior, leading to denial of service or data corruption.

**Affected Component:** Inter-node communication module, authentication and authorization mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for strong authentication between nodes.
* Ensure robust certificate management for inter-node communication.
* Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Garnet Node Spoofing](./threats/garnet_node_spoofing.md)

**Description:** An attacker creates a rogue node that masquerades as a legitimate Garnet node. This rogue node could attempt to join the cluster, potentially injecting malicious data or disrupting cluster operations.

**Impact:** The attacker could introduce corrupted data into the cluster, leading to data inconsistency. They could also disrupt the cluster's consensus mechanisms and cause instability or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Cluster membership management, node authentication.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong node authentication mechanisms when joining the cluster.
* Use secure bootstrapping processes for new nodes.
* Monitor cluster membership for unexpected additions.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attack on Garnet Nodes](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__attack_on_garnet_nodes.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods Garnet nodes with a large number of requests, overwhelming their resources (CPU, memory, network). This prevents legitimate clients from accessing the data store.

**Impact:** The application relying on Garnet becomes unavailable, leading to service disruption and potential financial losses.

**Affected Component:** Request processing pipeline, network input/output.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting on client requests.
* Use load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple Garnet nodes.
* Configure appropriate resource limits for Garnet processes.
* Employ network traffic filtering to block malicious traffic.

## Threat: [Data Loss Due to Insufficient Replication](./threats/data_loss_due_to_insufficient_replication.md)

**Description:** If replication is not configured correctly or a sufficient number of nodes fail simultaneously, data that was only present on the failed nodes can be permanently lost.

**Impact:** Permanent loss of data stored in Garnet, potentially leading to business disruption, data integrity issues, and regulatory non-compliance.

**Affected Component:** Data replication module, persistence mechanisms (if enabled).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure an appropriate replication factor based on availability requirements.
* Monitor the health and status of Garnet nodes.
* Implement automated failover mechanisms.
* Regularly back up the Garnet data (if persistence is enabled).

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion on Garnet Nodes](./threats/resource_exhaustion_on_garnet_nodes.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to cause excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory, disk I/O) on Garnet nodes, leading to performance degradation or crashes. This could involve sending large data payloads or triggering inefficient operations.

**Impact:** Reduced application performance, service unavailability, and potential data corruption if nodes crash unexpectedly.

**Affected Component:** Request processing, memory management, storage engine.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent processing of excessively large or malicious data.
* Configure resource limits and quotas for Garnet processes.
* Monitor resource utilization on Garnet nodes and set up alerts for anomalies.
* Regularly review and optimize Garnet configurations.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Garnet's Dependencies](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_garnet's_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Garnet relies on other libraries and frameworks. Attackers could exploit known vulnerabilities in these dependencies to compromise Garnet's functionality or gain access to the underlying system.

**Impact:** A wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, denial of service, and information disclosure.

**Affected Component:** Various modules depending on the vulnerable dependency.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Garnet and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using software composition analysis tools.
* Follow security best practices when integrating with external libraries.

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration of Management Interfaces](./threats/insecure_configuration_of_management_interfaces.md)

**Description:** Garnet's management interfaces (if exposed) are not properly secured with strong authentication and authorization. Attackers could exploit this to gain administrative control over the cluster.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Garnet cluster, allowing attackers to read, modify, or delete any data, and potentially disrupt the entire service.

**Affected Component:** Management API, authentication and authorization modules.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Restrict access to management interfaces to authorized personnel and networks.
* Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication for management access.
* Disable or secure any unnecessary management endpoints.
* Regularly audit access to management interfaces.
