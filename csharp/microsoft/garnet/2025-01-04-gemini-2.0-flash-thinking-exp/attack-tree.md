## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Garnet](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_garnet.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Garnet's Redis Protocol Implementation [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_garnet's_redis_protocol_implementation__critical_.md)

*   Attackers target the way Garnet interprets and processes Redis commands.
*   Vulnerabilities in the parsing logic can be exploited to cause unexpected behavior, errors, or even crashes.
*   Malformed commands can potentially bypass security checks or trigger internal errors.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Command Injection Vulnerabilities (Likely Low Probability for a pure data store) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_command_injection_vulnerabilities__likely_low_probability_for_a_pure_data_store___critical_.md)

*   If Garnet has any features (even unintended ones) that allow the execution of commands on the underlying server, attackers could inject malicious commands.
*   This could lead to complete control over the server hosting Garnet.
*   This is considered critical due to the severe impact, even if the likelihood is low for a typical data store.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Commands on the Garnet Server (if applicable)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_commands_on_the_garnet_server__if_applicable_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication/Authorization (if implemented by Garnet) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authenticationauthorization__if_implemented_by_garnet___critical_.md)

*   If Garnet implements its own authentication or authorization mechanisms (beyond relying on network security), weaknesses in this implementation can be exploited.
*   Successful bypass allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to data stored in Garnet or perform unauthorized administrative actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Data](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_data.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Garnet's In-Memory Data Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_garnet's_in-memory_data_handling.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Memory Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_memory_exhaustion.md)

*   **Send Large Numbers of Requests:** Attackers flood Garnet with a high volume of requests, consuming excessive memory and potentially leading to a denial of service.
*   This overwhelms Garnet's capacity to store data, causing performance degradation or crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send Large Numbers of Requests](./attack_tree_paths/send_large_numbers_of_requests.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Garnet's Networking Implementation](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_garnet's_networking_implementation.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Perform Denial of Service Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/perform_denial_of_service_attacks.md)

*   **Flood the Server with Connection Requests:** Attackers initiate a large number of connection requests to Garnet, overwhelming its ability to handle new connections and leading to a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Flood the Server with Connection Requests](./attack_tree_paths/flood_the_server_with_connection_requests.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (if insecurely configured) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle_attacks__if_insecurely_configured___critical_.md)

*   **Intercept and Modify Data in Transit (if TLS is not enforced or improperly configured):** If communication between the application and Garnet is not encrypted using TLS/SSL, attackers on the network can intercept and potentially modify data being exchanged.
*   **Steal Authentication Credentials (if any are transmitted):** If authentication credentials are exchanged without proper encryption, attackers can intercept and steal them, gaining unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept and Modify Data in Transit (if TLS is not enforced or improperly configured)](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_and_modify_data_in_transit__if_tls_is_not_enforced_or_improperly_configured_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Steal Authentication Credentials (if any are transmitted)](./attack_tree_paths/steal_authentication_credentials__if_any_are_transmitted_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Garnet's Configuration Weaknesses [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_garnet's_configuration_weaknesses__critical_.md)

*   **Leverage Insecure Default Configurations:**
    *   **Gain Unauthorized Access if no authentication is default:** If Garnet's default configuration does not require authentication, attackers can directly connect and access data without any credentials.
    *   **Exploit open ports if not properly firewalled:** If Garnet's port is exposed to the internet or untrusted networks due to misconfigured firewalls, attackers can directly connect and attempt to exploit vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Insecure Default Configurations](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_insecure_default_configurations.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access if no authentication is default](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_if_no_authentication_is_default.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit open ports if not properly firewalled](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_open_ports_if_not_properly_firewalled.md)
