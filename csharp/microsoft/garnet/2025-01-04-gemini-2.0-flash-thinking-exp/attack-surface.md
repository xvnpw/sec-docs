# Attack Surface Analysis for microsoft/garnet

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Network Communication](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_network_communication.md)

**Description:** Communication between the application and the Garnet instance occurs over an unencrypted network protocol.

**How Garnet Contributes:** Garnet's configuration or default settings allow or do not enforce encrypted communication channels.

**Example:** An attacker eavesdropping on the network intercepts sensitive data being transferred between the application and Garnet.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, potential data theft.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Enable TLS/SSL encryption for network communication with the Garnet instance.
*   Configure Garnet to enforce encrypted connections.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Authentication and Authorization](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_authentication_and_authorization.md)

**Description:** The Garnet instance does not require proper authentication or authorization to access or modify data.

**How Garnet Contributes:** Garnet's configuration or lack of enforced authentication mechanisms allows any network entity to interact with it.

**Example:** An unauthorized user on the network can connect to the Garnet instance and read, modify, or delete data.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, data loss.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strong authentication mechanisms provided by Garnet (if available).
*   Configure Garnet to require authentication for all access attempts.
*   Restrict network access to the Garnet instance to only authorized applications and services.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Network Requests](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_network_requests.md)

**Description:** The application constructs Garnet commands based on user input without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject malicious commands that Garnet processes.

**How Garnet Contributes:** Garnet's command processing mechanism can be vulnerable if the application doesn't properly escape or validate input used in commands sent to it.

**Example:** An attacker manipulates user input in the application, which is then used to construct a Garnet command that deletes critical data.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with Garnet to prevent command injection.
*   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user input before using it to construct Garnet commands.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker overwhelms the Garnet instance with excessive requests or data, causing it to become unavailable.

**How Garnet Contributes:** Garnet's resource management or lack of proper rate limiting can make it susceptible to DoS attacks.

**Example:** An attacker sends a large number of read or write requests directly to the Garnet instance, consuming its resources and making it unresponsive.

**Impact:** Application downtime, service disruption.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Configure resource limits within Garnet (if available) to prevent excessive resource consumption.
*   Deploy Garnet in an environment with sufficient resources to handle expected load and potential spikes.
*   Implement monitoring and alerting for Garnet resource utilization.

## Attack Surface: [Data Confidentiality at Rest (if not configured properly)](./attack_surfaces/data_confidentiality_at_rest__if_not_configured_properly_.md)

**Description:** Sensitive data stored by Garnet on disk is not encrypted, making it vulnerable if the underlying storage is compromised.

**How Garnet Contributes:** Garnet relies on the underlying storage mechanism (RocksDB), and its configuration determines if data at rest is encrypted.

**Example:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the server's file system where Garnet stores its data and can read sensitive information directly from the disk files.

**Impact:** Data breach, exposure of sensitive information.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Enable encryption at rest for the underlying storage used by Garnet (e.g., using RocksDB encryption features).
*   Ensure proper access controls are in place to restrict access to the Garnet data directory.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Garnet Dependencies (e.g., RocksDB)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_garnet_dependencies__e_g___rocksdb_.md)

**Description:** Garnet relies on underlying libraries (like RocksDB), and vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be directly exploited through Garnet.

**How Garnet Contributes:** As a user of these libraries, Garnet's functionality is directly impacted by vulnerabilities present in them.

**Example:** A known vulnerability exists in the version of RocksDB used by Garnet, allowing for a remote code execution when interacting with Garnet.

**Impact:** Potential for remote code execution, data breach, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep Garnet and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   Regularly monitor security advisories for Garnet and its dependencies.
