## Mitigation Strategy: [Encryption of Inter-Node Communication within Garnet](./mitigation_strategies/encryption_of_inter-node_communication_within_garnet.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Encryption of Inter-Node Communication within Garnet
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Garnet Inter-Node Communication Mechanisms:** Determine how Garnet nodes communicate with each other (e.g., specific protocols, ports, libraries used for control plane and data replication).
    2.  **Configure Garnet for Encryption:** Explore Garnet's configuration options to enable encryption for inter-node communication. This might involve setting configuration parameters to use TLS/SSL or other supported encryption protocols.
    3.  **Certificate Management within Garnet:** If TLS/SSL is used, configure certificate management within Garnet. This includes generating, distributing, and managing certificates for each Garnet node.  Determine how Garnet handles certificate storage and loading.
    4.  **Verify Encryption Implementation:** After configuration, verify that inter-node communication is indeed encrypted. Use network monitoring tools to inspect traffic and confirm encryption protocols are in use. Check Garnet logs for confirmation of encryption being enabled.
    5.  **Performance Testing with Encryption:** Evaluate the performance impact of encryption on Garnet's operations. RDMA is performance-sensitive, so measure latency and throughput with encryption enabled to ensure it meets application requirements.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Insecure Inter-Node Communication and Data Eavesdropping (High Severity) - Prevents eavesdropping on sensitive data transmitted between Garnet nodes.
    *   RDMA Spoofing and Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Medium Severity) - Encryption can provide some protection against man-in-the-middle attacks by ensuring data integrity and confidentiality of inter-node messages.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Insecure Inter-Node Communication and Data Eavesdropping: High Risk Reduction
    *   RDMA Spoofing and Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Likely **Not Implemented** by default in Garnet.  Garnet's focus on performance might mean encryption is not a default feature and needs explicit configuration or potentially code contributions if not natively supported. Check Garnet documentation for encryption configuration options.
    *   **Location:** Garnet application level, configuration files, potentially code modifications within Garnet project.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Needs to be implemented within Garnet's configuration or code. This requires investigation into Garnet's capabilities and potentially development effort to integrate encryption protocols into its inter-node communication mechanisms if not already available.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Mutual Authentication for Inter-Node Communication within Garnet](./mitigation_strategies/mutual_authentication_for_inter-node_communication_within_garnet.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Mutual Authentication for Inter-Node Communication within Garnet
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Garnet Node Authentication Mechanisms:** Investigate if Garnet provides built-in mechanisms for node authentication during cluster formation and inter-node communication.
    2.  **Configure Garnet for Mutual Authentication:** If supported, configure Garnet to enforce mutual authentication. This might involve configuring certificate-based authentication (TLS/SSL with client certificates) or other authentication methods supported by Garnet.
    3.  **Credential Management within Garnet:** Implement a secure way to manage and distribute authentication credentials (certificates, keys) to Garnet nodes. Determine how Garnet handles credential storage, loading, and rotation.
    4.  **Enforce Authentication in Garnet Configuration:** Configure Garnet to reject connections from nodes that fail mutual authentication. Ensure that only successfully authenticated nodes can join the cluster and participate in communication.
    5.  **Monitor Authentication Attempts:** Monitor Garnet logs for authentication attempts, failures, and successes to detect potential unauthorized node join attempts or authentication issues.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Insecure Inter-Node Communication and Data Eavesdropping (Medium Severity) - Prevents unauthorized nodes from joining the cluster and potentially eavesdropping on communication.
    *   Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks Targeting Garnet Cluster (Medium Severity) - Makes it harder for unauthorized nodes to join and disrupt the cluster by requiring valid authentication.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Insecure Inter-Node Communication and Data Eavesdropping: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks Targeting Garnet Cluster: Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely **Not Implemented** by default in Garnet. Mutual authentication adds complexity and might not be a default feature in performance-focused systems like Garnet. Check Garnet documentation for authentication configuration options.
    *   **Location:** Garnet application level, configuration files, potentially code modifications within Garnet project.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Needs to be implemented within Garnet's configuration or code. This requires investigation into Garnet's capabilities and potentially development effort to integrate mutual authentication mechanisms into node joining and communication processes if not already available.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Fine-Grained Access Control within Garnet](./mitigation_strategies/fine-grained_access_control_within_garnet.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Fine-Grained Access Control within Garnet
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Garnet's Access Control Features:** Examine Garnet's documentation and code to understand if it provides any built-in access control mechanisms. This could include user roles, permissions, namespaces, or ACLs within Garnet itself.
    2.  **Define Access Control Policies for Garnet Data:** Determine the required access control policies for data stored in Garnet. Identify different user roles, applications, or data sensitivity levels and define corresponding access permissions (read, write, delete, etc.) within Garnet.
    3.  **Configure Garnet Access Control (If Available):** If Garnet provides access control features, configure them to enforce the defined access policies. This might involve defining roles, assigning permissions to roles, and associating users or applications with roles within Garnet.
    4.  **Implement Custom Access Control (If Necessary):** If Garnet's built-in access control is insufficient, consider implementing custom access control mechanisms. This might involve extending Garnet's code to integrate with external authentication and authorization systems or developing custom access control logic within the application layer interacting with Garnet.
    5.  **Regularly Review and Update Garnet Access Control Policies:** Periodically review and update access control policies within Garnet to reflect changes in user roles, application requirements, or security policies. Audit access control configurations to ensure they are correctly implemented.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Leakage through Insecure Access Control within Garnet (High Severity) - Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data stored and managed by Garnet.
    *   Privilege Escalation within Garnet (Medium Severity) - Limits the impact of compromised accounts or applications by restricting their access to only necessary data and operations within Garnet.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Leakage through Insecure Access Control within Garnet: High Risk Reduction
    *   Privilege Escalation within Garnet: Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Likely **Partially Implemented** or **Not Implemented** depending on Garnet's design.  High-performance in-memory key-value stores might prioritize speed over complex access control. Check Garnet documentation and code for existing access control features.
    *   **Location:** Garnet application level, potentially requires code modifications or extensions within Garnet project.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Needs to be implemented or enhanced within Garnet. This requires development effort to design and implement fine-grained access control mechanisms and integrate them into Garnet's core functionality if not already present or sufficient.
