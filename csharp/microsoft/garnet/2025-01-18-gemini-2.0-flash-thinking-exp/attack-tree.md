## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Missing/Weak Authentication/Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_missingweak_authenticationauthorization.md)

**Attack Vector:** If Garnet lacks strong authentication or authorization mechanisms, or if the application doesn't properly leverage them, an attacker can bypass access controls. This allows them to directly read, modify, or delete data stored in Garnet without providing valid credentials.

**Likelihood:** Medium - Many systems initially have weak default configurations or developers might overlook proper implementation of authentication and authorization.

**Impact:** Critical - Successful exploitation grants the attacker full access to the application's data stored in Garnet, leading to potential data breaches, manipulation, or deletion.

**Effort:** Low to Medium - Exploiting default weak credentials or simple bypasses requires low effort. More complex scenarios might require some reverse engineering or understanding of the application's interaction with Garnet.

**Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate - Exploiting default credentials requires minimal skill. Identifying and exploiting more complex authorization flaws requires intermediate skills.

**Detection Difficulty:** Moderate - Detection depends on the presence and effectiveness of logging and monitoring of access attempts to Garnet. Without proper logging, unauthorized access can be difficult to detect.

## Attack Tree Path: [Write Malicious Data](./attack_tree_paths/write_malicious_data.md)

**Attack Vector:** If an attacker gains unauthorized write access to Garnet, they can inject malicious or corrupted data. This can lead to various issues, including application malfunction, data corruption, and potentially even the introduction of vulnerabilities that can be exploited later.

**Likelihood:** Medium - This depends on the security of the application's write operations to Garnet and the access controls in place. If write access is not strictly controlled, the likelihood increases.

**Impact:** Significant - Injecting malicious data can cause significant damage to the application's functionality and data integrity. This can lead to incorrect application behavior, data loss, or the need for costly recovery efforts.

**Effort:** Low to Medium - If authentication and authorization are weak, gaining write access can be relatively easy. Crafting effective malicious data might require some understanding of the application's data model.

**Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate - Simple data corruption can be achieved with basic knowledge. Crafting sophisticated malicious data might require intermediate skills.

**Detection Difficulty:** Moderate to Difficult - Detecting malicious data injection depends on the application's data validation mechanisms and monitoring for data anomalies. Without proper validation, corrupted data might go unnoticed for some time.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker can intentionally overwhelm Garnet with a large number of requests (read or write) or by storing extremely large keys or values. This can consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O), leading to performance degradation or a complete denial of service for the application.

**Likelihood:** High - Resource exhaustion attacks are relatively easy to execute, requiring minimal technical skill and readily available tools.

**Impact:** Significant - A successful resource exhaustion attack can render the application unavailable, impacting users and potentially causing financial losses or reputational damage.

**Effort:** Low - Sending a large number of requests or storing large data chunks requires minimal effort and can be automated.

**Skill Level:** Novice - Basic knowledge of scripting or readily available DDoS tools is sufficient to launch this type of attack.

**Detection Difficulty:** Easy -  Spikes in resource usage, slow response times, and error messages are usually clear indicators of a resource exhaustion attack. Monitoring system performance is crucial for detection.
