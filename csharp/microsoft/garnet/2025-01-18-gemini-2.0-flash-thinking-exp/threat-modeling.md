# Threat Model Analysis for microsoft/garnet

## Threat: [In-Memory Data Corruption via Malicious Input](./threats/in-memory_data_corruption_via_malicious_input.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a specific input (key or value) that, when processed by Garnet, triggers a bug or vulnerability *within Garnet's code* leading to corruption of data stored in Garnet's memory. This could involve exploiting parsing errors, buffer overflows, or incorrect type handling within Garnet's internal data structures.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption within Garnet. This could lead to the application retrieving incorrect information, application errors, or inconsistent state. Depending on the data's importance, this could have significant business consequences.
    *   **Affected Garnet Component:** In-Memory Data Structures/Storage Engine
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Garnet updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   While application-level input validation is important, rely on Microsoft's efforts to secure Garnet's internal processing.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Memory Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service_via_memory_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests to Garnet, intentionally using operations that consume significant memory *within Garnet's memory management*. This can exhaust the available memory allocated to the Garnet process, leading to performance degradation or a complete crash.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability or severe performance degradation due to Garnet's inability to process requests. This can disrupt services and impact users.
    *   **Affected Garnet Component:** Memory Management
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Monitor Garnet's memory usage and set up alerts for high memory consumption.
        *   Properly configure Garnet's memory allocation settings based on expected usage.

## Threat: [Data Loss on Unexpected Termination without Proper Persistence](./threats/data_loss_on_unexpected_termination_without_proper_persistence.md)

*   **Description:** If the application relies on data stored solely in Garnet's in-memory storage and the Garnet process terminates unexpectedly (e.g., due to a crash *within Garnet*, hardware failure, or forced shutdown), the data will be lost if Garnet's persistence mechanisms are not configured or functioning correctly.
    *   **Impact:** Permanent loss of data stored in Garnet. The severity depends on the importance and recoverability of this data.
    *   **Affected Garnet Component:** Persistence (if enabled, otherwise In-Memory Storage)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if persistence is not properly configured for critical data)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully evaluate the need for data persistence and configure Garnet's persistence options appropriately for critical data.
        *   Implement regular backups of persisted data.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Underlying .NET Runtime](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_underlying__net_runtime.md)

*   **Description:** Garnet is built on the .NET runtime. Vulnerabilities in the underlying .NET runtime could potentially be exploited to compromise the Garnet process or the system it runs on. This is a direct dependency risk for Garnet.
    *   **Impact:** Potential compromise of the Garnet instance and the underlying system, leading to data breaches, denial of service, or other security incidents.
    *   **Affected Garnet Component:** Dependencies (specifically the .NET Runtime)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the severity of the .NET vulnerability (can be Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the .NET runtime updated to the latest version with security patches.

## Threat: [Race Conditions Leading to Data Inconsistency](./threats/race_conditions_leading_to_data_inconsistency.md)

*   **Description:** If Garnet itself does not properly handle concurrent access to data *internally*, race conditions can occur. This can lead to inconsistent data states where the final value of a piece of data depends on the unpredictable order of execution of concurrent operations *within Garnet*.
    *   **Impact:** Data inconsistency and potential application errors due to incorrect or outdated information being retrieved from Garnet.
    *   **Affected Garnet Component:** Concurrency Control Mechanisms
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium (While potentially high impact, the likelihood depends on Garnet's internal implementation. Keeping it for completeness as it's a direct Garnet concern).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Garnet updated, as updates may include fixes for concurrency issues.
        *   Understand Garnet's concurrency model and any guarantees it provides.
