# Attack Surface Analysis for microsoft/garnet

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Network Communication with Garnet](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_network_communication_with_garnet.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between the application and the Garnet server is not encrypted, allowing attackers to eavesdrop on or manipulate data in transit.
    *   **How Garnet Contributes:** Garnet, by default, might not enforce encrypted communication (like TLS). The application developer needs to configure this. If not configured properly, the network channel is vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on the same network intercepts the communication and reads sensitive data being stored or retrieved from Garnet, such as user credentials or personal information.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data integrity compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Configure Garnet to use TLS for all client-server communication. Ensure the application is connecting to Garnet using the secure protocol. Implement mutual authentication if highly sensitive data is involved.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Authentication/Authorization to Garnet](./attack_surfaces/insecure_authenticationauthorization_to_garnet.md)

*   **Description:** Weak or missing authentication mechanisms for accessing the Garnet instance allow unauthorized access to the data store.
    *   **How Garnet Contributes:** Garnet provides authentication mechanisms, but the application developer is responsible for configuring and enforcing them correctly. Default or weak configurations can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Garnet instance due to default credentials or a lack of proper authentication, allowing them to read, modify, or delete any data stored within.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Configure strong authentication for Garnet. Avoid default credentials. Implement role-based access control if Garnet supports it or build an authorization layer within the application. Regularly review and update access credentials.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) against Garnet](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__against_garnet.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker overwhelms the Garnet instance with requests, causing it to become unavailable and disrupting the application's functionality.
    *   **How Garnet Contributes:** Garnet, like any server, has resource limitations. If the application doesn't implement proper rate limiting or request validation, it can be a vector for DoS attacks against the underlying Garnet instance.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a flood of read or write requests to Garnet, exhausting its resources and preventing legitimate application requests from being processed.
    *   **Impact:** Application downtime, service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement rate limiting on application requests to Garnet. Implement request validation to prevent malformed or excessively large requests.
        *   **Users/Operations:** Monitor Garnet resource usage. Implement network-level protections like firewalls and intrusion detection systems. Consider using Garnet in a clustered or replicated setup for increased resilience.

## Attack Surface: [Key Predictability or Insecure Key Management](./attack_surfaces/key_predictability_or_insecure_key_management.md)

*   **Description:** The keys used to access data in Garnet are predictable, easily guessable, or stored insecurely within the application.
    *   **How Garnet Contributes:** Garnet relies on the keys provided by the application to access data. If these keys are weak, the security of the data stored in Garnet is compromised.
    *   **Example:** The application uses sequential IDs or easily guessable strings as keys in Garnet, allowing an attacker to enumerate and access data belonging to other users.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data breach.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Generate strong, unpredictable keys using cryptographically secure methods. Avoid storing keys directly in the application code. Use secure key management practices, such as storing keys in environment variables or dedicated secrets management systems.
