## Threat Model for Application Using Garnet (Attack Tree Analysis) - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Attacker's Goal:** Compromise the application by exploiting vulnerabilities within the Garnet in-memory data store.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* **High-Risk Path:** Exploit Garnet's Redis Protocol Implementation **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    * **High-Risk Path:** Send Malicious Redis Commands **(CRITICAL NODE)**
        * **High-Risk Path:** Command Injection **(CRITICAL NODE)**
* **High-Risk Path:** Exploit Garnet's Configuration and Deployment **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    * **High-Risk Path:** Insecure Default Configuration **(CRITICAL NODE)**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* **High-Risk Path: Exploit Garnet's Redis Protocol Implementation (CRITICAL NODE)**
    * **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in how Garnet implements the Redis protocol. As the primary interface for interacting with Garnet, weaknesses here can allow attackers to manipulate data or disrupt service.
    * **Critical Node Justification:** This is a critical node because it represents the main entry point for interacting with Garnet. Compromising the protocol implementation can have widespread and severe consequences.

* **High-Risk Path: Send Malicious Redis Commands (CRITICAL NODE)**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft and send specially designed Redis commands to Garnet that exploit parsing errors, unexpected behavior, or vulnerabilities in the command handling logic.
    * **Critical Node Justification:** This node is critical because it directly leads to potentially high-impact attacks like command injection. Successfully sending malicious commands bypasses intended security measures.

* **High-Risk Path: Command Injection (CRITICAL NODE)**
    * **Attack Vector:** By sending carefully crafted Redis commands, an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the Garnet process. This could involve leveraging vulnerabilities in how Garnet interprets command arguments or interacts with the underlying operating system.
    * **Critical Node Justification:** This is a critical node due to its high potential impact. Successful command injection can lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.

* **High-Risk Path: Exploit Garnet's Configuration and Deployment (CRITICAL NODE)**
    * **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities arising from insecure configuration settings or improper deployment practices of Garnet.
    * **Critical Node Justification:** This is a critical node because misconfigurations are often easily exploitable and can provide a direct route for attackers to compromise the application.

* **High-Risk Path: Insecure Default Configuration (CRITICAL NODE)**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage default settings in Garnet that expose vulnerabilities, such as the lack of authentication or insecure network bindings.
    * **Critical Node Justification:** This node is critical because it represents a common and often easily exploitable weakness. If Garnet is deployed with insecure defaults, it becomes a prime target for attackers with minimal effort.
