Here's the updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving Garnet:

### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Garnet:

*   **Threat:** Memory Exhaustion leading to Denial of Service
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker sends a large number of requests to store data in Garnet, intentionally using up all available memory within the Garnet process. Alternatively, they could store extremely large individual data entries directly within Garnet.
        *   **How:** By exploiting the application's logic for storing data in Garnet or by directly interacting with Garnet's API if exposed.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   The Garnet instance runs out of memory, leading to crashes or becoming unresponsive.
        *   The application relying on Garnet will experience downtime or errors.
        *   Data might be lost if persistence is not configured or fails within Garnet.
    *   **Affected Garnet Component:**
        *   Memory Manager module.
        *   Data Ingestion/Storage functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement limits on the size of individual data entries stored in Garnet's configuration.
        *   Implement limits on the total number of entries allowed in Garnet's configuration.
        *   Configure maximum memory usage for the Garnet instance through its configuration settings.
        *   Monitor Garnet's memory consumption and set up alerts for high usage specifically for the Garnet process.
        *   Consider using Garnet's eviction policies if applicable and configured within Garnet.

*   **Threat:** Data Loss on Unexpected Termination
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** While not directly initiated by an attacker exploiting Garnet, the lack of proper persistence mechanisms *within Garnet* makes the application vulnerable to data loss if the Garnet process terminates unexpectedly (e.g., due to a crash within Garnet, hardware failure affecting the Garnet server, or intentional shutdown of the Garnet instance without proper saving).
        *   **How:** The attacker might indirectly cause this by triggering a bug *in Garnet* that leads to a crash.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data stored solely in Garnet's in-memory store since the last persistence operation will be lost.
        *   This can lead to inconsistencies in the application's state and potential data integrity issues directly related to the data managed by Garnet.
    *   **Affected Garnet Component:**
        *   Persistence module (if not configured or failing within Garnet).
        *   In-Memory Data Storage within Garnet.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure and enable Garnet's persistence features (e.g., snapshotting, AOF) within Garnet's configuration.
        *   Implement regular backups of the data persisted by Garnet.
        *   Ensure proper error handling and recovery mechanisms are in place for Garnet failures.
        *   Consider the trade-offs between performance and durability when choosing a persistence strategy for Garnet.

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Network Communication
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker intercepts network traffic directly to or from the Garnet instance.
        *   **How:** By positioning themselves on the network path and using tools to capture and potentially modify data packets exchanged with the Garnet server.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   The attacker can eavesdrop on data being exchanged with Garnet, potentially revealing sensitive information stored within it.
        *   The attacker could modify requests or responses intended for Garnet, leading to data corruption or unauthorized actions within Garnet.
    *   **Affected Garnet Component:**
        *   Network Listener within Garnet.
        *   Communication Protocol used by Garnet.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure all communication with the Garnet instance is encrypted using TLS/SSL, configured within Garnet or the network infrastructure.
        *   Implement mutual authentication to verify the identity of both the application and the Garnet instance during network communication.
        *   Use secure network configurations and avoid running Garnet on untrusted networks without proper protection.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Network Flooding
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker floods the Garnet instance directly with a large volume of network requests, overwhelming its resources.
        *   **How:** By sending a high number of connection requests or data packets directly to the Garnet network listener.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   The Garnet instance becomes unresponsive, leading to application downtime and inability to serve user requests that rely on Garnet.
    *   **Affected Garnet Component:**
        *   Network Listener within Garnet.
        *   Connection Handling within Garnet.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on the network interface used by Garnet or within Garnet's configuration if supported.
        *   Configure connection limits on the Garnet instance through its configuration.
        *   Use network security measures like firewalls to filter malicious traffic before it reaches Garnet.
        *   Consider using techniques like SYN cookies on the Garnet server to mitigate SYN flood attacks.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Serialization/Deserialization Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** If Garnet itself serializes or deserializes complex objects (e.g., for persistence or data transfer), an attacker could craft malicious serialized data that, when processed by Garnet, leads to code execution or other vulnerabilities *within the Garnet process*.
        *   **How:** By injecting malicious payloads into data stored in Garnet (if it handles serialization for storage) or by manipulating data during transit if encryption is not used and Garnet handles deserialization of incoming data.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Remote code execution on the Garnet server.
        *   Data corruption or unauthorized access to data managed by Garnet.
    *   **Affected Garnet Component:**
        *   Data Ingestion/Storage functions (if Garnet handles serialization for internal storage).
        *   Data Retrieval functions (if Garnet handles deserialization of data it retrieves or receives).
        *   Persistence module (if serialization is used for persistence).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing serialized complex objects directly within Garnet if possible. Prefer storing simple data types.
        *   If serialization is necessary within Garnet, use secure serialization libraries and practices within the Garnet codebase.
        *   Carefully validate and sanitize data before deserialization within Garnet's code.
        *   Implement input validation within Garnet to prevent the storage or processing of potentially malicious serialized data.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Default Configurations
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits default configurations of Garnet that are not secure.
        *   **How:** By leveraging publicly known default credentials for accessing Garnet's management interfaces (if any), open ports used by Garnet, or disabled security features within Garnet's configuration.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized access to the Garnet instance.
        *   Ability to read, modify, or delete data stored in Garnet.
        *   Potential for further compromise of the server running Garnet.
    *   **Affected Garnet Component:**
        *   Configuration Management within Garnet.
        *   Authentication/Authorization modules within Garnet.
        *   Network Listener (if default ports are insecurely exposed).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Change all default passwords and credentials for any Garnet management interfaces immediately after installation.
        *   Review and harden the default configuration of Garnet before deployment.
        *   Disable any unnecessary features or services offered by Garnet.
        *   Restrict network access to the Garnet instance to only authorized hosts through Garnet's configuration or network firewalls.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Garnet Dependencies
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in the libraries and frameworks that Garnet directly depends on.
        *   **How:** By leveraging publicly disclosed exploits targeting those dependencies within the Garnet process.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromise of the Garnet instance.
        *   Potential for remote code execution or other security breaches within the Garnet process.
    *   **Affected Garnet Component:**
        *   Any module within Garnet relying on the vulnerable dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability. Can be Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Garnet and all its direct dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Regularly scan Garnet's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using software composition analysis tools.
