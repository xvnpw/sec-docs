Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Garnet, focusing on high and critical severity:

**Key Attack Surface: Garnet Protocol Parsing Vulnerabilities**

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from Garnet's handling of malformed or unexpected data in its custom network protocol.
*   **How Garnet Contributes:** Garnet's implementation of its custom network protocol requires parsing incoming requests. Flaws in this parsing logic can be exploited.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a crafted request with an overly long field or an unexpected data type that Garnet's parser fails to handle correctly, leading to a crash or memory corruption.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service (crashing the Garnet instance), potential for remote code execution if memory corruption is exploitable.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data received over the Garnet protocol.
    *   Use well-tested parsing libraries or implement parsing logic defensively.
    *   Fuzz testing the protocol implementation to identify edge cases and vulnerabilities.

**Key Attack Surface: Insecure Deserialization in Garnet Protocol**

*   **Description:** If Garnet uses serialization to transmit data, vulnerabilities can arise from insecure deserialization of attacker-controlled data.
*   **How Garnet Contributes:** Garnet might serialize data for network transmission or internal storage. If deserialization is not handled securely, malicious payloads can be injected.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized object that, when deserialized by Garnet, executes arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data corruption, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources if possible.
    *   Use safe deserialization methods and libraries that prevent code execution.
    *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., signatures) on serialized data.

**Key Attack Surface: Lack of Encryption for Garnet Communication (MITM)**

*   **Description:** If communication between the application and Garnet (or between Garnet instances) is not encrypted, it's vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
*   **How Garnet Contributes:** Garnet establishes network connections. If these connections are not secured with TLS/SSL, the data transmitted is in plaintext.
*   **Example:** An attacker intercepts communication between the application and Garnet, reading sensitive data being cached or modifying requests to manipulate the cache.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to cached information, data manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always enable TLS/SSL encryption for all communication channels involving Garnet.
    *   Ensure proper certificate validation is in place.

**Key Attack Surface: Cache Poisoning**

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious data into the Garnet cache, which is then served to legitimate users or the application.
*   **How Garnet Contributes:** Garnet's core functionality is caching. If access control or input validation within Garnet is weak, attackers can manipulate the cache content.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Garnet's cache management to insert a malicious entry. When the application retrieves this entry, it executes malicious code or displays misleading information to users.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, serving malicious content to users, data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for any operations that modify the cache within Garnet.
    *   Sanitize data within Garnet before storing it in the cache to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Implement mechanisms within Garnet to detect and invalidate poisoned cache entries.
