# Attack Surface Analysis for microsoft/garnet

## Attack Surface: [Network Eavesdropping & Data Interception](./attack_surfaces/network_eavesdropping_&_data_interception.md)

*   **Description:**  Unauthorized capture and potential modification of data transmitted between Garnet clients and servers, or between Garnet nodes.
    *   **Garnet's Contribution:** Garnet relies on network communication for its core functionality.  Without proper encryption, this communication is vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on the same network segment as a Garnet client uses a packet sniffer to capture unencrypted RESP commands and responses, revealing sensitive data stored in the cache.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data modification, loss of confidentiality, potential for command injection if the attacker can modify requests.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Critical if sensitive data is involved)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce Strong TLS:**  Use TLS 1.3 (preferred) or TLS 1.2 (minimum) with strong cipher suites.
        *   **Certificate Validation:**  Rigorously validate server certificates (and client certificates in mTLS).
        *   **Mutual TLS (mTLS):**  Consider mTLS for inter-node communication to ensure both client and server are authenticated.
        *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate Garnet servers and clients on a dedicated network segment to limit exposure.
        *   **Regular Audits:**  Regularly audit TLS configurations and certificate management practices.

## Attack Surface: [Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Network Flooding](./attack_surfaces/denial-of-service__dos__via_network_flooding.md)

*   **Description:**  Overwhelming the Garnet server with network traffic, preventing legitimate clients from accessing the service.
    *   **Garnet's Contribution:** Garnet's network-facing nature makes it a target for DoS attacks.  Its performance is directly tied to network capacity.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a flood of SYN packets to the Garnet server's port, exhausting its connection pool and preventing legitimate clients from connecting.
    *   **Impact:** Service unavailability, disruption of dependent applications, potential financial losses.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting on incoming connections and requests per client IP address or other identifiers.
        *   **Network Firewalls:**  Use firewalls to block malicious traffic and restrict access to Garnet's ports.
        *   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Deploy IDS/IPS to detect and block DoS attacks.
        *   **Load Balancing:**  Distribute traffic across multiple Garnet instances using a load balancer.
        *   **Connection Timeouts:** Configure appropriate timeouts to prevent connections from lingering indefinitely.

## Attack Surface: [Memory Exhaustion (Resource Exhaustion DoS)](./attack_surfaces/memory_exhaustion__resource_exhaustion_dos_.md)

*   **Description:**  Causing Garnet to consume all available memory, leading to a crash and denial of service.
    *   **Garnet's Contribution:** Garnet is an *in-memory* data store.  Its performance and availability are directly tied to available memory.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a large number of `SET` commands with very large values, causing Garnet to allocate excessive memory and eventually crash.
    *   **Impact:** Service unavailability, data loss (if persistence is not configured or fails), disruption of dependent applications.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Memory Limits:**  Configure maximum memory limits for the Garnet server process.
        *   **Eviction Policies:**  Implement eviction policies (LRU, LFU, etc.) to automatically remove data when memory is scarce.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Validate the size of keys and values to prevent excessively large data from being stored.
        *   **Monitoring:**  Monitor memory usage and set alerts for high memory consumption.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Cluster Node Joining](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_cluster_node_joining.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker adding a malicious node to the Garnet cluster.
    *   **Garnet's Contribution:** Garnet supports clustering for scalability and high availability.  The cluster membership mechanism is a potential attack vector.
    *   **Example:** An attacker, without proper credentials, uses Garnet's cluster management commands to add a rogue node that then steals or corrupts data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data corruption, cluster instability, potential for further attacks from the compromised node.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authentication:**  Require strong authentication (e.g., passwords, API keys, certificates) for nodes to join the cluster.
        *   **Mutual TLS (mTLS):**  Use mTLS for inter-node communication to ensure only authorized nodes can communicate.
        *   **Access Control Lists (ACLs):**  Implement ACLs to restrict which nodes can join the cluster.
        *   **Auditing:**  Regularly audit the cluster membership and logs for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Injecting malicious code through the deserialization of custom objects stored in Garnet.
    *   **Garnet's Contribution:** If Garnet is configured to store and retrieve custom objects (not just primitive data types), the deserialization process becomes a potential attack vector.
    *   **Example:** An attacker stores a specially crafted object that, when deserialized by Garnet, executes arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution (RCE), complete server compromise, data breach, data corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Custom Objects:**  If possible, avoid storing custom objects in Garnet.  Use primitive data types or well-defined data formats (JSON, Protocol Buffers) with secure parsing libraries.
        *   **Secure Deserialization Libraries:**  If custom objects are necessary, use a secure serialization/deserialization library that is specifically designed to prevent deserialization vulnerabilities.
        *   **Type Whitelisting:**  Implement strict type whitelisting, allowing only specific, known-safe classes to be deserialized.
        *   **Sandboxing:**  Consider deserializing objects in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of any potential exploits.
