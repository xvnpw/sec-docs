# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for microsoft/garnet

## Mitigation Strategy: [Garnet-Native Rate Limiting (If Supported)](./mitigation_strategies/garnet-native_rate_limiting__if_supported_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Check Garnet Documentation:** Thoroughly review the official Garnet documentation for your specific version to determine if native rate limiting features are available. Look for configuration options related to:
        *   Connections per client/IP.
        *   Requests per second per client/IP/key prefix.
        *   Resource quotas (memory, CPU) per client/connection.
    2.  **Configure Rate Limits:** If native features are found, configure them directly within Garnet's configuration files (e.g., `garnet.conf` or similar).  Define appropriate limits based on expected traffic patterns and application requirements.
    3.  **Test and Monitor:** After configuring rate limits, thoroughly test their effectiveness using load testing tools. Monitor Garnet's performance metrics and logs to ensure the limits are working as expected and not causing unintended side effects. Adjust limits as needed.
    4. **Handle Rate Limit Exceeded (Garnet Side):** If Garnet has built-in mechanisms for handling rate limit violations (e.g., returning specific error codes), configure these appropriately.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **DoS/DDoS targeting Garnet's throughput (Severity: High):** Directly limits the rate of requests processed by Garnet, preventing overload.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: High):** Prevents individual clients from consuming excessive Garnet resources.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS/DDoS:** High impact (if Garnet's native rate limiting is robust and configurable).
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** High impact. Directly controls resource consumption within Garnet.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented (pending investigation of Garnet version capabilities).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Full implementation depends on Garnet's feature set.  Needs research and configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Leverage Garnet's Authentication and Authorization (If Supported)](./mitigation_strategies/leverage_garnet's_authentication_and_authorization__if_supported_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Check Garnet Documentation:** Determine if Garnet supports built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms.  Look for features such as:
        *   Password-based authentication.
        *   Client certificate authentication.
        *   Access Control Lists (ACLs) based on users, roles, or key prefixes.
    2.  **Enable and Configure Authentication:** If supported, enable authentication in Garnet's configuration.  Create user accounts or configure client certificate requirements.
    3.  **Define Authorization Rules (ACLs):** If Garnet supports ACLs, define rules that grant specific permissions (read, write, delete) to different users or roles for different key spaces or resources.  Follow the principle of least privilege.
    4.  **Integrate with Application (If Necessary):** If Garnet's authentication is used, the application may need to be modified to provide credentials or handle authentication tokens.
    5.  **Test and Monitor:** Thoroughly test the authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure they are working correctly. Monitor Garnet's logs for any authentication failures or unauthorized access attempts.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: High):** Prevents unauthorized clients from connecting to Garnet and accessing data.
    *   **Data Breaches (Severity: High):** Limits the impact of a compromised account by restricting access based on authorization rules.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** High impact (if Garnet's authentication is robust).
    *   **Data Breaches:** High impact (if ACLs are properly configured).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented (pending investigation of Garnet version capabilities).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Full implementation depends on Garnet's feature set. Needs research and configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Garnet's Encryption at Rest (If Supported)](./mitigation_strategies/enable_garnet's_encryption_at_rest__if_supported_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Check Garnet Documentation:** Determine if the specific Garnet version and storage engine being used support encryption at rest. Look for configuration options related to encryption keys, algorithms, and key management.
    2.  **Configure Encryption:** If supported, enable encryption at rest in Garnet's configuration files. This typically involves:
        *   Specifying an encryption key (or a key management system).
        *   Choosing an encryption algorithm (e.g., AES-256).
    3.  **Key Management:** Implement a secure key management strategy. This is *crucial*.
        *   **Never** hardcode encryption keys in the configuration files or application code.
        *   Use a secure key management system (KMS) or a hardware security module (HSM) to store and manage encryption keys.
        *   Implement key rotation policies to regularly change encryption keys.
    4.  **Test and Monitor:** After enabling encryption, verify that data is being encrypted correctly. Monitor Garnet's performance to ensure that encryption is not causing significant overhead.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breaches from Server Compromise (Severity: High):** Protects data if the Garnet server itself is compromised (e.g., physical theft, unauthorized access to the server's file system).
    *   **Compliance Requirements (Severity: Medium):** Helps meet compliance requirements for data protection (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breaches:** High impact.  Prevents unauthorized access to data even if the server is compromised.
    *   **Compliance:** High impact for meeting regulatory requirements.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented (pending investigation of Garnet version and storage engine capabilities).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Full implementation depends on Garnet's feature set and requires a robust key management strategy.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Secure Inter-Node Communication (Garnet Clustering/Replication - Using Garnet's Features)](./mitigation_strategies/configure_secure_inter-node_communication__garnet_clusteringreplication_-_using_garnet's_features_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Check Garnet Documentation:** Review Garnet's documentation for its clustering and replication features.  Look for configuration options related to:
        *   TLS/SSL encryption for inter-node communication.
        *   Mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication.
        *   Allowed cipher suites.
        *   Certificate management.
    2.  **Enable TLS and mTLS:** Configure Garnet to use TLS for all inter-node communication.  Enable mTLS to require mutual authentication between nodes.
    3.  **Configure Strong TLS Settings:** Specify strong cipher suites and TLS versions (TLS 1.3 preferred).
    4.  **Certificate Management (Garnet-Specific):** If Garnet provides specific tools or configurations for managing certificates for inter-node communication, use them.  Otherwise, manage certificates securely using external tools and processes.
    5. **Test and Monitor:** Verify that TLS and mTLS are working correctly by inspecting network traffic and Garnet logs. Monitor for any connection errors or security warnings.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Severity: High):** TLS encryption prevents interception and modification of inter-node traffic.
    *   **Unauthorized Node Joining (Severity: High):** mTLS ensures only authorized nodes can participate in the cluster.
    *   **Data Exfiltration/Tampering (Severity: High):** Encryption protects data confidentiality and integrity during replication.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **MitM Attacks:** High impact. TLS effectively eliminates MitM risks.
    *   **Unauthorized Node Joining:** High impact. mTLS prevents rogue nodes.
    *   **Data Exfiltration/Tampering:** High impact. Encryption protects data in transit.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   TLS is enabled, but mTLS and strong cipher suites are not configured (using Garnet's basic TLS settings).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   mTLS needs to be configured.
    *   Stronger TLS settings need to be applied.
    *   Certificate management needs to be reviewed and potentially improved (using Garnet's features if available).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable and Configure Garnet Audit Logging (If Supported)](./mitigation_strategies/enable_and_configure_garnet_audit_logging__if_supported_.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Check Garnet Documentation:** Determine if Garnet supports audit logging. Look for configuration options related to:
        * Log levels (e.g., INFO, WARNING, ERROR, AUDIT).
        * Log formats (e.g., text, JSON).
        * Log destinations (e.g., file, syslog).
        * Log rotation policies.
    2. **Enable Audit Logging:** If supported, enable audit logging in Garnet's configuration. Configure the log level to capture relevant events (e.g., successful and failed connections, data access operations, configuration changes).
    3. **Configure Log Format and Destination:** Choose an appropriate log format and destination. JSON format is often preferred for easier parsing and analysis. Consider sending logs to a centralized logging system for aggregation and analysis.
    4. **Log Rotation:** Configure log rotation to prevent log files from growing indefinitely.
    5. **Monitor and Analyze Logs:** Regularly monitor and analyze Garnet's audit logs for any suspicious activity or security events. Use log analysis tools or SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems to automate this process.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Security Incident Detection (Severity: Medium):** Provides an audit trail for investigating security incidents.
    * **Unauthorized Access Detection (Severity: Medium):** Helps identify unauthorized access attempts or successful breaches.
    * **Compliance Requirements (Severity: Medium):** Helps meet compliance requirements for audit logging.

* **Impact:**
    * **Security Incident Detection:** Moderate impact. Provides valuable information for investigations.
    * **Unauthorized Access Detection:** Moderate impact. Helps detect suspicious activity.
    * **Compliance:** High impact for meeting regulatory requirements.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * Basic logging is enabled, but audit-specific logging is not configured (pending investigation of Garnet's capabilities).

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * Needs to be enabled and configured specifically for audit purposes, if supported by Garnet. Log analysis procedures need to be established.
