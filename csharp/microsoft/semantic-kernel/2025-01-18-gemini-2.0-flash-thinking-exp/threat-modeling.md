# Threat Model Analysis for microsoft/semantic-kernel

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Injection](./threats/malicious_plugin_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Plugin Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker could upload or introduce a crafted plugin file containing malicious code to a directory monitored by the application's plugin loading mechanism (e.g., using `Kernel.Plugins.LoadFromDirectory`). Upon loading, this code would execute with the application's privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the application, including data exfiltration, modification, denial of service, or using the application as a pivot point to attack other systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Kernel.Plugins.LoadFromDirectory`, `Kernel.Plugins.LoadFromPromptDirectory`, `Kernel.Plugins.RegisterCustomFunction`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls on plugin directories, allowing only authorized users to write to them.
        *   Use code signing to verify the authenticity and integrity of plugins before loading.
        *   Employ sandboxing or containerization to isolate plugin execution and limit their access to system resources.
        *   Regularly audit plugin code for suspicious activity or vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a secure plugin update mechanism to ensure plugins are up-to-date with security patches.

## Threat: [Plugin Path Traversal](./threats/plugin_path_traversal.md)

*   **Threat:** Plugin Path Traversal
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate input parameters related to plugin paths (if exposed or controllable) to load plugins from unintended locations outside the designated plugin directory. This could allow loading of malicious plugins from arbitrary file system locations.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code from untrusted sources, potentially leading to system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Kernel.Plugins.LoadFromDirectory`, `Kernel.Plugins.LoadFromPromptDirectory`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate all user-provided input related to plugin paths.
        *   Use absolute paths for plugin loading and avoid relying on relative paths.
        *   Implement allow-lists for permitted plugin locations instead of relying on deny-lists.
        *   Run the application with the least privileges necessary to load plugins from the intended locations.

## Threat: [Insecure Plugin Dependencies](./threats/insecure_plugin_dependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Plugin Dependencies
    *   **Description:** Plugins may rely on external libraries or dependencies that contain known security vulnerabilities. If the application doesn't manage these dependencies securely, it could inherit these vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if present in loaded plugins.
    *   **Impact:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Affected Component:** Plugin loading mechanism, any plugin utilizing vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement dependency scanning and management practices for plugin dependencies.
        *   Regularly update plugin dependencies to their latest secure versions.
        *   Consider using isolated environments or containers for plugin execution to limit the impact of vulnerable dependencies.
        *   Encourage or enforce the use of Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) for plugins to track dependencies.

## Threat: [Direct Prompt Injection](./threats/direct_prompt_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Direct Prompt Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides malicious input that is directly incorporated into a prompt sent to the Language Model (LLM). This crafted input manipulates the LLM's behavior to perform unintended actions, bypass security measures, or reveal sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Data exfiltration from the LLM's knowledge, unauthorized actions performed by the LLM, generation of harmful or inappropriate content, or denial of service by overwhelming the LLM.
    *   **Affected Component:** `PromptTemplateEngine`, `Kernel.InvokeAsync`, any function constructing and sending prompts to the LLM.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization to remove or neutralize potentially malicious input before it reaches the prompt.
        *   Use prompt engineering techniques to make prompts more resilient to injection attacks (e.g., clear instructions, delimiters).
        *   Employ LLMs with built-in defense mechanisms against prompt injection, if available.
        *   Implement output validation and filtering to detect and block harmful or unexpected LLM responses.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Prompts](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_prompts.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information in Prompts
    *   **Description:** Developers might inadvertently include sensitive information (API keys, internal data, secrets) directly within prompt templates or during prompt construction. This information could be logged, exposed through errors, or even leaked through LLM responses.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of confidential data, leading to potential compromise of other systems, data breaches, or unauthorized access to services.
    *   **Affected Component:** `PromptTemplateEngine`, any code constructing prompts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in prompts.
        *   Use secure secret management solutions (e.g., environment variables, key vaults) to store and inject sensitive data into prompts.
        *   Implement logging and error handling that avoids exposing sensitive data.
        *   Regularly review prompt templates and construction logic for potential information leaks.

## Threat: [Compromised Connector Credentials](./threats/compromised_connector_credentials.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Connector Credentials
    *   **Description:** If the application stores or manages credentials for connectors (e.g., API keys for LLM services, database credentials) insecurely, an attacker could gain access to these credentials and use them to interact with external services maliciously.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external services, data breaches at connected services, financial losses due to unauthorized API usage, or reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** Connector implementations, credential storage mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault) to store and manage connector credentials.
        *   Avoid storing credentials directly in code or configuration files.
        *   Implement proper access controls and encryption for credential storage.
        *   Regularly rotate connector credentials.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Memory Store](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_memory_store.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Memory Store
    *   **Description:** If the application uses Semantic Kernel's memory features (e.g., vector databases) and access to this store is not properly controlled, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored within it.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of confidential data, potential misuse of stored information, or manipulation of the memory store's contents.
    *   **Affected Component:** `MemoryStore` implementations (e.g., `VolatileMemoryStore`, integrations with vector databases).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing the memory store.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit within the memory store.
        *   Regularly audit access logs to the memory store for suspicious activity.
        *   Follow the security best practices of the specific memory store implementation being used.
