## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Semantic Kernel Application (CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_semantic_kernel_application__critical_node_.md)

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node signifies a complete breach of the application's security, potentially leading to data exfiltration, service disruption, or other severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Plugin System (HIGH-RISK PATH START):](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_plugin_system__high-risk_path_start_.md)

* This path focuses on leveraging the extensibility of Semantic Kernel through its plugin system. Attackers aim to introduce or exploit vulnerabilities within plugins to gain control.

    * **2.1. Introduce Malicious Plugin (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * **Exploit Lack of Plugin Verification/Sandboxing:**
            * **Attack Vector:** The application fails to adequately verify the integrity and safety of plugins before installation or execution. This allows an attacker to upload a plugin containing malicious code.
            * **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution within the application's context, potentially leading to full system compromise.
        * **Upload/Install Malicious Plugin:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the plugin management interface or gain unauthorized access to the plugin directory to directly upload and install a malicious plugin.
            * **Impact:**  Similar to the above, arbitrary code execution and full system compromise.

    * **2.2. Exploit Vulnerability in Existing Plugin (HIGH-RISK PATH START):**
        * **Identify Vulnerable Plugin (e.g., Code Injection, Path Traversal):**
            * **Attack Vector:** Attackers analyze the code of existing plugins to identify security vulnerabilities such as code injection flaws, path traversal issues, or insecure dependencies.
            * **Impact:**  Depends on the vulnerability, but can range from information disclosure to arbitrary code execution.
        * **Trigger Vulnerability via SK Function Call:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Once a vulnerability is identified, attackers craft specific inputs to Semantic Kernel functions that utilize the vulnerable plugin, triggering the exploit.
            * **Impact:** Exploitation of the identified vulnerability, potentially leading to code execution or data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Manipulate Semantic Functions/Prompts (HIGH-RISK PATH START):](./attack_tree_paths/3__manipulate_semantic_functionsprompts__high-risk_path_start_.md)

* This path targets the core interaction with the Large Language Model (LLM) through prompt manipulation.

    * **3.1. Prompt Injection (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * **Inject Malicious Instructions/Data into User Input:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft user inputs that contain malicious instructions or data intended to manipulate the LLM's behavior. This could involve instructing the LLM to bypass security measures, execute commands, or disclose sensitive information.
            * **Impact:**  Can range from unauthorized actions performed by the LLM to the disclosure of sensitive data.
        * **Trigger Execution of Malicious Actions via LLM:**
            * **Attack Vector:** The LLM, interpreting the injected instructions, performs the attacker's desired actions, potentially without the application's explicit authorization.
            * **Impact:**  Execution of unintended or malicious actions, data breaches, or further compromise of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Connector Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH START):](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_connector_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_start_.md)

* This path focuses on vulnerabilities related to how Semantic Kernel connects to external services, particularly the LLM.

    * **4.1. Compromise LLM API Credentials (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * **Exploit Misconfiguration/Hardcoded Credentials:**
            * **Attack Vector:** The application stores LLM API credentials insecurely, such as hardcoding them in the code or storing them in easily accessible configuration files without proper encryption.
            * **Impact:**  Full access to the LLM service using the compromised credentials, allowing the attacker to make arbitrary requests and potentially incur costs or access sensitive data.
        * **Intercept/Steal Credentials:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Attackers intercept network traffic between the application and the LLM service to steal API credentials during transmission. This could involve techniques like man-in-the-middle attacks or exploiting network vulnerabilities.
            * **Impact:** Similar to the above, full access to the LLM service.
