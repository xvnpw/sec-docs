## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Validation (Semantic Kernel Context)](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_validation__semantic_kernel_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Sanitization and Validation (Semantic Kernel Context)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Semantic Kernel Input Points:** Pinpoint where user input flows into Semantic Kernel *specifically*. This includes:
        *   User input passed directly to Semantic Functions as arguments.
        *   User input used to dynamically construct prompts within Semantic Kernel Skills or Orchestrators.
        *   Data from external sources (databases, APIs) that is used to populate Semantic Kernel prompts.
    2.  **Define Semantic Kernel Validation Rules:** Establish validation rules tailored to the context of Semantic Kernel prompts and function arguments. Consider:
        *   Validating input types expected by Semantic Functions (e.g., string, number, boolean).
        *   Validating input format against prompt templates to prevent template injection.
        *   Using Semantic Kernel's built-in input validation mechanisms if available (check Semantic Kernel documentation for features).
    3.  **Implement Sanitization within Semantic Kernel Flow:** Integrate sanitization functions *within the Semantic Kernel application logic* before input is used in prompts or function calls. This could be:
        *   Custom sanitization functions called before invoking Semantic Functions.
        *   Sanitization steps within Semantic Kernel Skills or Orchestrators.
        *   Using Semantic Kernel's built-in sanitization features if available.
    4.  **Focus on Prompt Injection Prevention:** Prioritize sanitization techniques that are effective against prompt injection attacks, such as:
        *   Encoding special characters that could be interpreted as prompt commands.
        *   Stripping potentially malicious keywords or syntax.
        *   Validating input against expected patterns to detect anomalies.
    5.  **Error Handling within Semantic Kernel:** Implement error handling within Semantic Kernel workflows to gracefully manage invalid input and prevent unexpected behavior or crashes.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Prompt Injection (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from manipulating Semantic Kernel's LLM interactions by injecting malicious instructions through user input processed by Semantic Kernel.
    *   **Semantic Function Argument Injection (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious arguments into Semantic Functions, potentially leading to unexpected function behavior or vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Prompt Injection:** High reduction. Directly reduces the risk of prompt injection attacks targeting Semantic Kernel applications.
    *   **Semantic Function Argument Injection:** Medium reduction. Mitigates risks associated with malicious input to Semantic Functions.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in the customer support chat feature, where basic HTML encoding is applied to user input *before* it's passed to the Semantic Kernel chat skill.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No validation of input types or formats specifically for Semantic Functions.
    *   Sanitization is not consistently applied across all Semantic Kernel input points, especially in API endpoints interacting with Semantic Kernel.
    *   Semantic Kernel specific validation features (if any exist) are not utilized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Prompt Engineering for Robustness (Semantic Kernel Focus)](./mitigation_strategies/prompt_engineering_for_robustness__semantic_kernel_focus_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Semantic Kernel Prompt Template Design:** Design prompt templates within Semantic Kernel Skills and Orchestrators with a focus on robustness against injection.
        *   Use clear delimiters in prompt templates to separate system instructions from user input placeholders (e.g., `{{$userInput}}`).
        *   Structure prompts to explicitly instruct the LLM to treat user input as data within the Semantic Kernel context.
        *   Incorporate contextual information from Semantic Kernel's context variables to guide LLM interpretation.
    2.  **Semantic Function Prompt Review:**  Specifically review prompts used in Semantic Functions for potential injection vulnerabilities.
        *   Ensure prompts are well-defined and minimize ambiguity that could be exploited.
        *   Test prompts with various inputs, including potential injection attempts, within the Semantic Kernel environment.
    3.  **Leverage Semantic Kernel Features for Prompt Management:** Utilize Semantic Kernel's features for prompt management and versioning to track changes and maintain secure prompt configurations.
    4.  **Contextual Awareness in Semantic Kernel Prompts:**  Utilize Semantic Kernel's context management to pass relevant application state and context into prompts. This can help the LLM understand the intended purpose of user input within the application's workflow and reduce misinterpretations.
    5.  **Iterative Testing within Semantic Kernel:**  Test prompt robustness *within the Semantic Kernel application* by simulating user interactions and injection attempts through the application's interface. Observe the application's behavior and refine prompts accordingly.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Prompt Injection (High Severity):** Makes Semantic Kernel prompts more resilient to manipulation, reducing the effectiveness of injection attacks within the application's workflows.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Prompt Injection:** Medium to High reduction.  Increases the difficulty of successful prompt injection within Semantic Kernel applications. The effectiveness depends on the sophistication of prompt engineering within Semantic Kernel Skills and Orchestrators.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic prompt engineering with delimiters is used in the customer support chat Skill within Semantic Kernel.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No explicit "instruction following" prompt design within Semantic Kernel Skills.
    *   Contextual information from Semantic Kernel's context is not fully leveraged in prompts for robustness.
    *   Systematic testing of prompt robustness against injection attempts *within the Semantic Kernel application* is lacking.

        *   Access to external resources *through* Semantic Kernel (e.g., file system access mediated by a Semantic Kernel plugin).
    2.  **Implement Semantic Kernel Permission Controls (if available):** Utilize any permission control mechanisms provided by Semantic Kernel itself to restrict plugin and function access. (Check Semantic Kernel documentation for features related to plugin/function permissions or sandboxing).
    3.  **Code-Level Permission Checks in Semantic Kernel Plugins:** If Semantic Kernel doesn't provide built-in permission controls, implement permission checks *within the code of native Semantic Kernel plugins*.  This might involve:
        *   Checking for specific context variables before performing sensitive actions.
        *   Implementing access control logic within plugin methods to restrict resource access.
    4.  **Regular Semantic Kernel Permission Review:** Periodically review the permissions (or implicit access rights) of Semantic Kernel Plugins and Functions to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege and are still necessary.

    2.  **Implement Sanitization/Anonymization in Semantic Kernel Flow:** Integrate sanitization and anonymization techniques *within the Semantic Kernel application logic* before sensitive data is included in prompts sent to LLMs. This could be:
        *   Sanitization steps within Semantic Kernel Skills or Orchestrators.
        *   Custom sanitization functions called before invoking Semantic Functions that interact with LLMs.
        *   Using Semantic Kernel's data transformation features (if any) for sanitization.
    3.  **Apply Before Semantic Kernel - LLM Call:** Ensure sanitization/anonymization is applied *immediately before* the point where Semantic Kernel sends prompts containing sensitive data to the LLM service.
    4.  **Context-Aware Sanitization in Semantic Kernel:**  Implement sanitization that is context-aware within Semantic Kernel workflows. Ensure that sanitized/anonymized data still allows Semantic Kernel and the LLM to perform the intended task effectively within the application's logic.
