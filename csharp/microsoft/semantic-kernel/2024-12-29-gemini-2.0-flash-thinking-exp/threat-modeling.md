Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve the Semantic Kernel library:

*   **Threat:** Prompt Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious user input that manipulates the LLM's behavior *through the Semantic Kernel's prompt processing*. This causes the LLM to deviate from its intended purpose or execute unintended actions by injecting instructions or commands within the prompt that the LLM interprets as part of its task *within the context managed by Semantic Kernel*.
    *   **Impact:** The LLM might perform actions the user didn't intend *within the application's scope*, reveal sensitive information accessible through the kernel, generate harmful content *using the kernel's capabilities*, or bypass security controls *implemented within the kernel*.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Kernel.InvokeAsync`, `Skill` execution, `PromptTemplateEngine`
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully design prompt templates to minimize the possibility of injection *within the Semantic Kernel context*.
        *   Use parameterized prompts or template engines *provided by or integrated with Semantic Kernel* to separate instructions from user data.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization *before passing data to Semantic Kernel functions* to remove potentially malicious content.
        *   Consider using techniques like prompt hardening or adversarial training for the LLM *that are compatible with Semantic Kernel's prompt structure*.
        *   Review and audit prompt templates regularly *within the Semantic Kernel configuration*.

*   **Threat:** Indirect Prompt Injection (Data Poisoning)
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates external data sources that the LLM or Semantic Kernel *directly accesses and uses* to generate responses or perform actions. This could involve poisoning knowledge bases, documents, or other data sources that *Semantic Kernel's memory connectors or retrieval functions* rely on.
    *   **Impact:** The LLM might generate incorrect, biased, or harmful outputs based on the poisoned data *when accessed and processed by Semantic Kernel*, leading to misinformation or unintended consequences *within the application*.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Memory` connectors, `Retrieval` functions, any skill utilizing external data sources *through Semantic Kernel's interfaces*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls and validation for external data sources *integrated with Semantic Kernel*.
        *   Regularly audit and verify the integrity of data used by the application *through Semantic Kernel's data access mechanisms*.
        *   Implement mechanisms to detect and flag potentially malicious or anomalous data *before it's consumed by Semantic Kernel*.
        *   Consider using data provenance techniques to track the origin and modifications of data *used by Semantic Kernel*.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Plugin Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker introduces or exploits a malicious plugin (native or semantic) *within the Semantic Kernel's plugin ecosystem* that can execute arbitrary code, access sensitive resources, or compromise the application's security. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in existing plugins *loaded by Semantic Kernel* or introducing entirely new malicious ones *through Semantic Kernel's plugin loading mechanisms*.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application *using Semantic Kernel's execution environment*, data breaches *accessible through the kernel's context*, denial of service *affecting the kernel's functionality*, or unauthorized access to systems *via the kernel's capabilities*.
    *   **Affected Component:** `SkillCollection`, `Kernel.ImportFunctions`, `FunctionView`
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a secure plugin management system *within the Semantic Kernel application* with strict verification and signing of plugins.
        *   Limit the sources from which plugins can be loaded *by Semantic Kernel*.
        *   Enforce a principle of least privilege for plugin execution *within the Semantic Kernel runtime*.
        *   Regularly audit and scan plugins for vulnerabilities *before and after loading them into Semantic Kernel*.
        *   Isolate plugin execution environments (sandboxing) *within or around the Semantic Kernel process*.

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure through Plugin Interactions
    *   **Description:** A plugin, either intentionally or unintentionally, exposes sensitive information through its interactions *within the Semantic Kernel framework*. This could involve logging sensitive data *handled by the plugin within the kernel*, making insecure network requests *initiated by the plugin through the kernel*, or returning sensitive information in its output *processed by the kernel*.
    *   **Impact:** Leakage of confidential data, PII, or other sensitive information *handled or accessible by Semantic Kernel*.
    *   **Affected Component:** All plugin types (`NativeFunction`, `SemanticFunction`), `KernelArguments`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review the code and functionality of all plugins *used within Semantic Kernel*.
        *   Implement secure logging practices *within the application and plugins*, avoiding the logging of sensitive data.
        *   Enforce secure communication protocols for plugins making network requests *through Semantic Kernel's environment*.
        *   Sanitize plugin outputs before displaying them to users *after being processed by Semantic Kernel*.

*   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation through Plugin Capabilities
    *   **Description:** A plugin is granted excessive permissions or capabilities *within the Semantic Kernel environment*, allowing an attacker to leverage the plugin to perform actions they are not authorized to do. This could occur due to overly broad permission models *within Semantic Kernel's plugin system* or vulnerabilities in the plugin's authorization logic *as interpreted by the kernel*.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, modification of data, or execution of privileged operations *within the scope of the Semantic Kernel application*.
    *   **Affected Component:** `SkillCollection`, `Kernel.ImportFunctions`, `FunctionView`, potentially custom authorization mechanisms *integrated with Semantic Kernel*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a fine-grained permission model for plugins *within the Semantic Kernel framework*, granting only necessary access.
        *   Regularly review and audit plugin permissions *configured within Semantic Kernel*.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege when designing and implementing plugins *for use with Semantic Kernel*.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of LLM API Keys and Credentials
    *   **Description:** Sensitive API keys or credentials required to access LLMs are exposed *within the Semantic Kernel application's configuration or usage*. This could happen through storing keys in code *used by Semantic Kernel*, configuration files *read by the kernel*, or insecure environment variables *accessed by the kernel*.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized use of LLM services *configured within Semantic Kernel*, leading to financial costs, data breaches *through the compromised LLM access*, or service disruptions.
    *   **Affected Component:** `OpenAIClient`, `AzureOpenAIClient`, any custom LLM connector *used by Semantic Kernel*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store API keys securely using secrets management solutions (e.g., Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault) *and integrate them with Semantic Kernel's configuration*.
        *   Avoid storing API keys directly in code or configuration files *used by Semantic Kernel*.
        *   Use environment variables or configuration providers designed for secure secret management *and accessed by Semantic Kernel*.
        *   Implement proper access controls for accessing and managing API keys *used by the Semantic Kernel application*.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Plan Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the planning or orchestration capabilities of Semantic Kernel *itself* to execute a sequence of actions that are harmful or unintended. This could involve crafting malicious plans *that Semantic Kernel interprets and executes* or exploiting vulnerabilities in the planning logic *within Semantic Kernel*.
    *   **Impact:** The application performs actions *orchestrated by Semantic Kernel* that compromise security, data integrity, or availability.
    *   **Affected Component:** `SequentialPlanner`, `StepwisePlanner`, custom planners.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust validation and authorization checks *within Semantic Kernel* before executing plans.
        *   Carefully review and audit the logic of planning components *within Semantic Kernel*.
        *   Limit the capabilities and permissions available to the planner *within the Semantic Kernel configuration*.
        *   Consider using a "dry-run" mode for plans *offered by or implemented around Semantic Kernel* before actual execution.
