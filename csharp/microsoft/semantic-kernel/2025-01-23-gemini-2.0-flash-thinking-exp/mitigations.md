# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for microsoft/semantic-kernel

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Input Validation and Sanitization (Semantic Kernel Context)](./mitigation_strategies/robust_input_validation_and_sanitization__semantic_kernel_context_.md)

### Description:
1.  **Identify Semantic Kernel Input Points:** Pinpoint where user input enters the Semantic Kernel pipeline. This includes:
    *   `Kernel.InvokePromptAsync()` and similar prompt invocation methods.
    *   Input passed to Semantic Functions via `ContextVariables`.
    *   Data loaded into `Memory` and used in prompts.
2.  **Sanitize Inputs Before Semantic Kernel Processing:** Implement sanitization *before* passing user input to Semantic Kernel functions or prompts. This ensures that potentially malicious input is neutralized before it interacts with the LLM through Semantic Kernel.
    *   **Utilize Sanitization Libraries:** Employ established input sanitization libraries appropriate for your programming language to handle common injection vectors.
    *   **Context-Aware Sanitization:**  Tailor sanitization based on the expected input type and the context in which it will be used within Semantic Kernel. For example, sanitize differently for text intended for summarization versus text intended for code generation.
3.  **Validate Input Structure for Semantic Functions:** If Semantic Functions expect structured input (e.g., JSON, specific formats), validate the input against a schema or predefined structure *before* invoking the function. This prevents unexpected input formats from causing errors or vulnerabilities within the function execution.
### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   Prompt Injection (High Severity) - Prevents attackers from manipulating prompts *via inputs processed by Semantic Kernel* to execute unintended commands or extract data.
### Impact:
High Reduction - Significantly reduces the likelihood of successful prompt injection attacks originating from user inputs processed by Semantic Kernel.
### Currently Implemented:
Partially Implemented - Basic input validation exists in some areas before data is passed to Semantic Kernel functions, but comprehensive sanitization specifically targeting prompt injection vulnerabilities within the Semantic Kernel context is missing.
### Missing Implementation:
Need to implement robust sanitization functions *before* user inputs are passed to `Kernel.InvokePromptAsync()`, `ContextVariables`, and data loaded into `Memory`.  Context-aware sanitization and structured input validation for Semantic Functions are also missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Prompt Engineering Best Practices (Semantic Kernel Focused)](./mitigation_strategies/prompt_engineering_best_practices__semantic_kernel_focused_.md)

### Description:
1.  **Semantic Kernel Prompt Templates:** Leverage Semantic Kernel's built-in prompt templating features to create structured and controlled prompts.

    *   **Configuration:** Utilize Semantic Kernel's prompt configuration options (e.g., `TemplateFormat`, `TemplateEngine`) to enforce consistent prompt structure and processing.
2.  **Function Calling and Prompt Orchestration in Semantic Kernel:** Design Semantic Functions and Kernel plans to orchestrate LLM interactions in a secure and predictable manner.
    *   **Function Boundaries:**  Clearly define the boundaries and responsibilities of each Semantic Function to limit the scope of potential vulnerabilities within individual functions.
    *   **Controlled Function Chaining:**  Use Kernel plans or controlled function chaining to manage the flow of information between Semantic Functions and limit the potential for unintended interactions or data leakage.
3.  **Review and Audit Semantic Kernel Prompts and Functions:** Regularly review and audit all Semantic Kernel prompts and Semantic Functions for potential vulnerabilities and adherence to best practices.
    *   **Security Focused Code Reviews:** Include security considerations in code reviews for Semantic Functions and prompt templates.
    *   **Prompt Testing:**  Test prompts with various inputs, including potentially malicious inputs, to identify prompt injection vulnerabilities.
### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   Prompt Injection (Medium Severity) - Reduces the attack surface by making it harder to manipulate prompts *within the Semantic Kernel framework*.
*   Unintended LLM Behavior (Medium Severity) - Improves the predictability and reliability of LLM responses *within Semantic Kernel applications*, reducing unexpected or harmful outputs.
### Impact:
Medium Reduction - Makes prompt injection more difficult and reduces the likelihood of unintended LLM behavior *specifically within the Semantic Kernel application*. Effectiveness depends on the complexity of the application and prompts designed within Semantic Kernel.
### Currently Implemented:
Partially Implemented - Semantic Kernel prompt templates are used in some areas, but not consistently. Function calling is utilized, but security-focused design principles for Semantic Functions are not fully implemented.
### Missing Implementation:
Need to standardize the use of Semantic Kernel prompt templates across the entire application. Implement security-focused design principles for all Semantic Functions. Establish a regular review and audit process for Semantic Kernel prompts and functions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Output Validation and Filtering (Semantic Kernel Context)](./mitigation_strategies/output_validation_and_filtering__semantic_kernel_context_.md)

### Description:

2.  **Validation within Semantic Functions:**  Incorporate output validation logic directly within Semantic Functions.
    *   **Return Type Validation:**  If a Semantic Function is expected to return a specific data type or format, validate the output within the function before returning it.
    *   **Content Validation:**  Implement logic within Semantic Functions to check the content of the LLM output against expected criteria (e.g., keyword checks, regular expression matching).
3.  **Post-Processing after Semantic Kernel Invocation:** Apply post-processing steps to the output returned by `Kernel.InvokePromptAsync()` or Semantic Functions.
    *   **Filtering Functions:** Create dedicated functions to filter LLM outputs based on security and content safety criteria.
    *   **Output Sanitization:** Sanitize LLM outputs to remove or encode potentially harmful content before further use.
4.  **Semantic Kernel Middleware (Future Consideration):**  Explore the potential for developing or utilizing Semantic Kernel middleware (if such a feature becomes available) to intercept and process LLM outputs before they reach the application logic.
### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   Exposure of Harmful Content (Medium Severity) - Prevents users from being exposed to offensive, inappropriate, or malicious content generated by the LLM *and processed by Semantic Kernel*.
*   Data Leakage through LLM Output (Medium Severity) - Reduces the risk of sensitive information being inadvertently included in LLM outputs *processed by Semantic Kernel* and exposed to users.
*   Prompt Injection Exploitation via Output (Medium Severity) - Can mitigate some types of prompt injection attacks where the attacker aims to manipulate the LLM output *processed by Semantic Kernel* to cause harm.
### Impact:
Medium Reduction - Output validation and filtering *within the Semantic Kernel context* act as a safety net, reducing the impact of unintended or malicious LLM outputs generated and processed by the framework.
### Currently Implemented:
Partially Implemented - Basic keyword filtering might be implemented in some post-processing steps *after* Semantic Kernel processing, but comprehensive validation and filtering within Semantic Functions and dedicated post-processing functions are missing.
### Missing Implementation:
Need to implement robust output validation logic within Semantic Functions and dedicated post-processing functions *after* Semantic Kernel invocation. Explore and implement return type and content validation within Semantic Functions.
