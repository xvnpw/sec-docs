# Deep Analysis: Sensitive Data Leakage Through Prompts in Semantic Kernel

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Sensitive Data Leakage Through Prompts" threat within the context of a Semantic Kernel application.  This includes identifying specific vulnerabilities, assessing the likelihood and impact of exploitation, and proposing concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level descriptions provided in the initial threat model.  We aim to provide developers with practical guidance to prevent this threat.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on data leakage occurring *within* the Semantic Kernel processing pipeline.  This means we are concerned with:

*   Data included in prompts passed to `Kernel.InvokeAsync()` (and related functions like `RunAsync`).
*   Data embedded within `PromptTemplate` definitions.
*   Data handled by custom SK components (skills, plugins, connectors, memory implementations).
*   Data logged by SK's internal logging mechanisms (including custom `ILogger` implementations).

We *exclude* general data leakage concerns outside the SK context (e.g., network sniffing of HTTPS traffic, vulnerabilities in the LLM provider's infrastructure *not* directly related to SK's input).  However, we *do* consider the LLM provider's data handling policies as they relate to the data *sent by SK*.

### 1.3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review (Hypothetical & Example-Based):**  We will analyze hypothetical and example code snippets demonstrating common patterns in SK usage to identify potential leakage points.  This includes examining how prompts are constructed, how skills are defined, and how logging is configured.
2.  **Data Flow Analysis:** We will trace the flow of data through the SK pipeline, focusing on where sensitive information might be introduced, processed, and potentially exposed.
3.  **Best Practices Research:** We will research and incorporate best practices for secure coding, data handling, and logging within the .NET ecosystem and specifically within the context of AI-driven applications.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:** We will expand upon the initial mitigation strategies, providing specific implementation details and recommendations.
5.  **Tooling Recommendations:** We will suggest tools and techniques that can assist in identifying and preventing this threat.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1. Vulnerability Points and Examples

Let's examine specific scenarios where sensitive data leakage can occur:

**2.1.1.  `Kernel.InvokeAsync()` and Direct Prompt Construction:**

```csharp
// **VULNERABLE EXAMPLE**
string apiKey = "YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY"; // Hardcoded or improperly stored
string userInput = GetUserInput(); // Untrusted input
string prompt = $"Translate the following text to French: {userInput}.  Use API key: {apiKey}";
var result = await kernel.InvokeAsync("TranslateSkill", "Translate", new() { ["input"] = prompt });
```

*   **Vulnerability:** The `apiKey` is directly embedded in the prompt.  Even if `userInput` is sanitized, the API key is exposed.  This prompt is likely logged by SK and sent to the LLM provider.
*   **Data Flow:**  The sensitive `apiKey` flows directly from the application code into the prompt string, then to the LLM and potentially into logs.

**2.1.2.  `PromptTemplate` with Hardcoded Sensitive Data:**

```csharp
// **VULNERABLE EXAMPLE**
string promptTemplateConfig = @"
{{$input}}
---
Internal System Note:  Customer ID is {{CUSTOMER_ID}}.  Do not disclose this.
";

var promptTemplate = new PromptTemplate(
    promptTemplateConfig,
    new PromptTemplateConfig {  }, //Assume default config
    kernel.PromptTemplateEngine
);

// ... later ...
var renderedPrompt = await promptTemplate.RenderAsync(kernel, new KernelArguments() { ["input"] = userInput, ["CUSTOMER_ID"] = "12345" });
var result = await kernel.InvokeAsync("SomeSkill", new() { ["input"] = renderedPrompt });

```

*   **Vulnerability:**  While `CUSTOMER_ID` might be passed as a separate argument, the template itself contains a comment instructing the LLM *not* to disclose it.  This is insufficient; the LLM might ignore the instruction, and the `CUSTOMER_ID` is still present in the prompt sent to the LLM and potentially logged.  The template itself might also be logged or stored.
*   **Data Flow:** The sensitive `CUSTOMER_ID` is passed as an argument, rendered into the prompt, and then flows to the LLM and logs.

**2.1.3.  Custom Skill with Insecure Data Handling:**

```csharp
// **VULNERABLE EXAMPLE**
public class CustomerInfoSkill
{
    [KernelFunction]
    public async Task<string> GetCustomerDetails(string customerId, Kernel kernel)
    {
        // Simulate fetching sensitive data (e.g., from a database)
        string customerDetails = $"Name: John Doe, Address: 123 Main St, SSN: {GetSSN(customerId)}";

        // Directly include sensitive data in the prompt
        string prompt = $"Summarize the following customer details: {customerDetails}";
        var result = await kernel.InvokePromptAsync(prompt);
        return result.ToString();
    }

    private string GetSSN(string customerId)
    {
        // **HIGHLY VULNERABLE:**  This should NEVER be done in a real application.
        //  Illustrates the worst-case scenario.
        return "123-45-6789";
    }
}
```

*   **Vulnerability:** The skill retrieves sensitive data (SSN) and directly includes it in the prompt.  This is a major security flaw.
*   **Data Flow:** Sensitive data flows from a (simulated) database, through the skill's logic, directly into the prompt, and then to the LLM and logs.

**2.1.4.  Custom `ILogger` Implementation:**

```csharp
// **VULNERABLE EXAMPLE**
public class MyCustomLogger : ILogger
{
    public void Log<TState>(LogLevel logLevel, EventId eventId, TState state, Exception exception, Func<TState, Exception, string> formatter)
    {
        // **VULNERABLE:** Logs the entire state, which might include the prompt.
        File.AppendAllText("my_log.txt", formatter(state, exception) + Environment.NewLine);
    }
    // ... other ILogger methods ...
}

// ... in your application setup ...
builder.Services.AddLogging(loggingBuilder =>
{
    loggingBuilder.AddProvider(new MyCustomLoggerProvider(new MyCustomLogger()));
});
```

*   **Vulnerability:** The custom logger does not redact or filter sensitive information from the log messages.  If SK logs the prompt (which it often does for debugging), the sensitive data will be written to the log file.
*   **Data Flow:**  Sensitive data within the prompt flows from SK's internal logging mechanism to the custom logger, which then writes it to a file.

### 2.2. Likelihood and Impact

*   **Likelihood:** High.  The ease with which sensitive data can be inadvertently included in prompts, especially during development and testing, makes this a very likely vulnerability.  Developers might not fully appreciate the implications of sending data to an LLM.
*   **Impact:** High.  As stated in the original threat model, this can lead to exposure of confidential data, privacy violations, reputational damage, and potential for further attacks.  The specific impact depends on the nature of the leaked data (e.g., API keys, PII, internal business secrets).

### 2.3. Refined Mitigation Strategies

Let's expand on the initial mitigation strategies with more concrete details:

**2.3.1.  Data Loss Prevention (DLP) (SK-Specific):**

*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Custom `IPromptFilter` (Recommended):** Create a custom `IPromptFilter` implementation. This interface allows you to intercept and modify prompts *before* they are sent to the LLM.  Within the filter, use regular expressions, keyword matching, or even a dedicated DLP library (e.g., a .NET port of a DLP engine) to scan the prompt for sensitive data.  If found, redact, replace, or reject the prompt.
    *   **Skill-Level Checks:**  Within each skill, before calling `Kernel.InvokeAsync()`, perform a DLP check on the constructed prompt.  This is less centralized than an `IPromptFilter` but can be useful for skills that handle particularly sensitive data.
    *   **Integration with Existing DLP Solutions:** If your organization already uses a DLP solution, explore integrating it with your SK application.  This might involve calling the DLP API from your `IPromptFilter` or skill.

*   **Example (Conceptual `IPromptFilter`):**

```csharp
public class DlpPromptFilter : IPromptFilter
{
    public Task OnPromptRenderingAsync(PromptRenderingContext context)
    {
        // No-op in this case, we modify the prompt after rendering
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    public Task OnPromptRenderedAsync(PromptRenderedContext context)
    {
        string prompt = context.RenderedPrompt;

        // Simple regex for demonstration (replace with a robust DLP solution)
        var regex = new Regex(@"\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}\b"); // Email regex
        if (regex.IsMatch(prompt))
        {
            context.RenderedPrompt = regex.Replace(prompt, "[REDACTED EMAIL]");
            // Or, throw an exception to prevent the prompt from being sent:
            // throw new InvalidOperationException("Sensitive data detected in prompt.");
        }
        // Add more checks for other sensitive data patterns (API keys, SSNs, etc.)

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}

// ... in your application setup ...
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IPromptFilter, DlpPromptFilter>();
```

**2.3.2.  Input Sanitization (SK-Specific):**

*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Early Sanitization:** Sanitize user input *immediately* upon receiving it, before it's used anywhere in the SK pipeline.
    *   **Type-Specific Sanitization:**  Use different sanitization techniques depending on the expected data type.  For example, use HTML encoding for strings that will be displayed in a web page, and use parameterization for database queries.
    *   **Whitelist Approach:**  Instead of trying to remove all potentially harmful characters, define a whitelist of allowed characters and reject any input that contains characters outside the whitelist.
    *   **Library Usage:** Utilize established libraries like `HtmlSanitizer` for HTML sanitization or custom-built sanitizers for specific data formats.

**2.3.3.  Parameterization (SK-Specific):**

*   **Implementation:**
    *   **`KernelArguments`:**  Use `KernelArguments` to pass sensitive data as separate arguments to skills, rather than embedding them directly in the prompt.  This is the *preferred* method.
    *   **Prompt Template Placeholders:**  Use placeholders (e.g., `{{$variable}}`) in your `PromptTemplate` definitions and provide the values for these placeholders through `KernelArguments`.
    *   **Avoid String Concatenation:**  Never build prompts by concatenating strings, especially if those strings contain user input or sensitive data.

* **Example (Corrected from 2.1.1):**
```csharp
// **CORRECTED EXAMPLE**
string apiKey = GetApiKeyFromSecureStore(); // Retrieve from a secure store (e.g., Azure Key Vault)
string userInput = GetUserInput(); // Untrusted input
string prompt = $"Translate the following text to French: {userInput}"; //API Key is not here
var result = await kernel.InvokeAsync("TranslateSkill", "Translate", new() { ["input"] = prompt, ["apiKey"] = apiKey }); //Pass API Key separately
```

**2.3.4.  Secure Logging (SK-Specific):**

*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Redaction in Custom Loggers:**  If you use a custom `ILogger`, implement redaction logic to remove or mask sensitive data before writing it to the log.
    *   **Filtering Log Levels:**  Configure your logging to avoid logging at levels that include full prompts (e.g., `Debug` or `Trace`).  Use `Information` or higher for production environments.
    *   **Structured Logging:**  Use structured logging to log data in a key-value format.  This makes it easier to filter and redact sensitive fields.
    *   **Log Management Tools:**  Use log management tools (e.g., Serilog, Application Insights) that provide built-in redaction capabilities.

*   **Example (Improved Custom Logger):**

```csharp
// **IMPROVED EXAMPLE**
public class MySecureLogger : ILogger
{
    public void Log<TState>(LogLevel logLevel, EventId eventId, TState state, Exception exception, Func<TState, Exception, string> formatter)
    {
        string message = formatter(state, exception);

        // Redact sensitive data (example: email addresses)
        var regex = new Regex(@"\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}\b");
        message = regex.Replace(message, "[REDACTED EMAIL]");

        File.AppendAllText("my_log.txt", message + Environment.NewLine);
    }
    // ... other ILogger methods ...
}
```

**2.3.5.  Review LLM Provider Policies:**

*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Thorough Review:**  Carefully read the privacy policy and terms of service of your LLM provider.  Pay close attention to data retention, usage, and security practices.
    *   **Data Processing Agreements (DPAs):**  If you are handling sensitive data subject to regulations like GDPR or CCPA, ensure you have a DPA in place with your LLM provider.
    *   **Zero Data Retention Policies:** If possible, choose an LLM provider that offers a zero data retention option, or configure your account to minimize data retention.
    *   **Consider On-Premise LLMs:** For extremely sensitive data, consider using an on-premise LLM deployment to maintain complete control over your data.

## 3. Tooling Recommendations

*   **Static Code Analysis:** Use static code analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube, Roslyn Analyzers) to identify potential security vulnerabilities, including hardcoded secrets and insecure data handling.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Use DAST tools to test your running application for vulnerabilities, including data leakage.
*   **Dependency Analysis:** Use dependency analysis tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check) to identify vulnerable third-party libraries.
*   **Secret Scanning Tools:** Use secret scanning tools (e.g., git-secrets, truffleHog) to detect secrets that might have been accidentally committed to your code repository.
*   **.NET Security Libraries:** Leverage .NET security libraries like `System.Security.Cryptography` for encryption and data protection.
* **Microsoft Purview:** If using Azure, consider using Microsoft Purview for data governance and compliance, including DLP capabilities.

## 4. Conclusion

The "Sensitive Data Leakage Through Prompts" threat in Semantic Kernel applications is a serious concern, but it can be effectively mitigated through a combination of careful coding practices, robust input validation, secure logging, and the use of appropriate tooling.  By implementing the strategies outlined in this analysis, developers can significantly reduce the risk of exposing sensitive information and build more secure and trustworthy AI-powered applications.  The key is to treat all data passed to the LLM, and handled within the SK pipeline, as potentially sensitive and apply appropriate security measures at every stage.  Regular security reviews and updates are crucial to maintain a strong security posture.
