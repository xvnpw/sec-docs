Okay, let's create a design document for the Microsoft Semantic Kernel project.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Enable developers to easily integrate AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) into their applications.
*   Provide a flexible and extensible framework for building AI-powered features.
*   Simplify the orchestration of AI components and services.
*   Foster innovation and experimentation with AI technologies.
*   Reduce the complexity of working with various AI models and APIs.
*   Support multiple programming languages (C#, Python, Java).

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Data privacy and security: LLMs can potentially expose sensitive data if not handled carefully.
*   Model bias and fairness: LLMs can exhibit biases that lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.
*   Reliability and availability: Applications relying on LLMs need to be resilient to failures and ensure consistent performance.
*   Cost management: Using LLMs can be expensive, so cost optimization is crucial.
*   Dependency on third-party services: Reliance on external AI models and APIs introduces potential risks.
*   Rapidly evolving technology: The AI landscape is changing quickly, requiring continuous adaptation and updates.
*   Lack of explainability: LLM decisions can be difficult to understand, posing challenges for debugging and accountability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Secure coding practices: The project's GitHub repository shows evidence of secure coding practices, including input validation and handling of secrets. (Described in contribution guidelines and code reviews).
*   security control: Dependency management: The project uses package managers (NuGet, pip, Maven) to manage dependencies, reducing the risk of using vulnerable libraries. (Described in project files).
*   security control: Code reviews: The project uses pull requests and code reviews to ensure code quality and security. (Visible in the GitHub repository).
*   security control: Static analysis: The project likely uses static analysis tools to identify potential security vulnerabilities. (Inferred from Microsoft's standard development practices).
*   security control: Authentication and authorization: The project itself doesn't handle authentication/authorization directly, but it's designed to integrate with services that do (e.g., Azure OpenAI, Hugging Face). (Described in documentation and examples).
*   accepted risk: The project relies on the security of third-party LLM services (e.g., OpenAI, Azure OpenAI). The project itself does not control the security of these services.
*   accepted risk: The project is under active development, and new vulnerabilities may be introduced.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement dynamic analysis (DAST) to complement static analysis.
*   security control: Conduct regular penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities that automated tools might miss.
*   security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure program.
*   security control: Implement a robust secrets management solution (e.g., Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault).
*   security control: Provide clear guidance on securely configuring and deploying applications built with the Semantic Kernel.
*   security control: Implement monitoring and logging to detect and respond to security incidents.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   The Semantic Kernel should support integration with various authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0, Azure Active Directory).
    *   Authentication credentials should be securely stored and managed.
*   Authorization:
    *   The Semantic Kernel should allow developers to define granular access control policies for different AI components and services.
    *   Authorization should be enforced consistently across all supported programming languages.
*   Input Validation:
    *   All inputs to the Semantic Kernel and underlying LLMs should be validated to prevent prompt injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
    *   Input validation should be context-aware and consider the specific LLM being used.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Sensitive data (e.g., API keys, user data) should be encrypted in transit and at rest.
    *   Cryptographic keys should be securely managed.
*   Output Encoding:
    *   Output from the Semantic Kernel should be properly encoded to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and other injection vulnerabilities.

    *   Checks out the source code.
    *   Restores dependencies (using NuGet, pip, Maven).
    *   Compiles the code.
    *   Runs unit tests.
    *   Performs static analysis (SAST) to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
    *   Checks for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   Packages the code into build artifacts (NuGet packages, pip packages, Maven packages).
