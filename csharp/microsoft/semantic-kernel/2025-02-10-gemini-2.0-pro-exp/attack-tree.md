## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: [!!1.1 Prompt Injection!!] (leading to code execution)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node__!!1_1_prompt_injection!!___leading_to_code_execution_.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker crafts malicious input to be used in prompts, aiming to inject code or commands that will be executed by either native functions or the AI model itself. This is the most critical vulnerability due to the kernel's reliance on prompts.
*   **Sub-Node: [!!1.1.1 Craft malicious prompts to native functions!!]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker targets native functions (written in C#, Python, etc.) that are part of the Semantic Kernel application. If these functions use prompt input without proper sanitization, the attacker can inject code directly into the system. This is a classic code injection vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A native function that executes a shell command based on a user-provided prompt. The attacker could inject shell commands to read files, execute programs, or establish a reverse shell.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** Very High (potential for complete system compromise)
    *   **Effort:** Low/Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium/Hard
*  **High-Risk Path:** The path leading to 1.1.1 is considered high-risk because it represents a direct and relatively easy way to achieve code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: [!!3.2.1 Use default or weak credentials!!]](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node__!!3_2_1_use_default_or_weak_credentials!!_.md)

*   **Description:** The Semantic Kernel, or the application using it, is configured with default or easily guessable credentials. This allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the kernel's functionality.
    *   **Example:** Using "admin/admin" or a blank password for accessing the kernel's configuration or management interface.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (assuming basic security practices are followed, but devastating if present)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (complete control over the kernel and potentially the entire application)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: [1.2 Kernel Function Overload] -> [1.2.1 Flood with requests to native/semantic functions]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__1_2_kernel_function_overload__-__1_2_1_flood_with_requests_to_nativesemantic_functio_34b27992.md)

* **Description:** The attacker sends a large number of requests to the Semantic Kernel, targeting either native or semantic functions. The goal is to overwhelm the system's resources, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
    * **Example:** Repeatedly calling a computationally expensive semantic function that involves a large language model, causing the server to become unresponsive.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Medium/High (disruption of service)
    * **Effort:** Low
    * **Skill Level:** Novice
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Easy/Medium
