# Threat Model Analysis for microsoft/semantic-kernel

## Threat: [Direct Prompt Injection](./threats/direct_prompt_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Direct Prompt Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious user input that is directly incorporated into a prompt processed by Semantic Kernel. This can manipulate the AI model's instructions, causing it to perform unintended actions, reveal sensitive information managed by Semantic Kernel, or generate harmful content through Semantic Kernel's execution.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches of information accessible to the AI through Semantic Kernel, unauthorized actions performed via Semantic Kernel's functionalities, generation of harmful or inappropriate content orchestrated by Semantic Kernel.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Kernel.RunAsync`, `PromptTemplateEngine`, any function within Semantic Kernel that constructs and executes prompts based on user input.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the application layer *before* input reaches Semantic Kernel's prompt processing.
        *   Design prompts defensively within Semantic Kernel, clearly separating instructions from user-provided data.
        *   Utilize Semantic Kernel's features for prompt templating in a way that minimizes direct injection risks.
        *   Consider output filtering mechanisms within the application to catch and block potentially harmful outputs generated by Semantic Kernel.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Execution](./threats/malicious_plugin_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Plugin Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker introduces a malicious plugin into the Semantic Kernel environment, and Semantic Kernel loads and executes it. This allows for arbitrary code execution within the context of the Semantic Kernel application, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise of the server or client running Semantic Kernel, data breaches of any information accessible to the application, denial of service by malicious code executed through Semantic Kernel.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Kernel.ImportPluginFrom...` functions, `FunctionView`, `SkillCollection`, the entire plugin execution pipeline within Semantic Kernel.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a strict plugin vetting and approval process *before* plugins are made available to Semantic Kernel.
        *   Only load plugins from trusted and verified sources within Semantic Kernel.
        *   Utilize code signing or other integrity checks to verify the authenticity of plugins loaded by Semantic Kernel.
        *   Explore and implement any available sandboxing or isolation mechanisms provided by Semantic Kernel or the underlying platform for plugin execution.
        *   Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring of plugin loading and execution within Semantic Kernel.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerable Plugins](./threats/exploiting_vulnerable_plugins.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerable Plugins
    *   **Description:** A plugin loaded and executed by Semantic Kernel contains security vulnerabilities (e.g., injection flaws, insecure dependencies). Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities through Semantic Kernel's plugin execution mechanism to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code within the plugin's context.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches of information accessible by the vulnerable plugin through Semantic Kernel, unauthorized access to resources managed by the plugin or the application, potential for arbitrary code execution within the plugin's scope facilitated by Semantic Kernel.
    *   **Affected Component:** The specific vulnerable plugin code, the plugin execution pipeline within Semantic Kernel that allows interaction with the plugin.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly audit and scan plugins for known vulnerabilities before and after integration with Semantic Kernel.
        *   Keep plugins and their dependencies updated to the latest versions, leveraging Semantic Kernel's mechanisms for plugin management if available.
        *   Encourage or require plugin developers to follow secure coding practices for plugins intended to be used with Semantic Kernel.
        *   Implement security policies within the application that restrict the capabilities and access of plugins loaded by Semantic Kernel.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Leakage from Memory](./threats/sensitive_data_leakage_from_memory.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Leakage from Memory
    *   **Description:** Sensitive information (e.g., user data, internal configurations, temporary credentials) stored within Semantic Kernel's memory management features is accessed by unauthorized users or processes due to insufficient access controls or vulnerabilities within Semantic Kernel's memory implementation.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches of sensitive information managed by Semantic Kernel's memory, exposure of internal application details, potential for further attacks using leaked credentials or configuration data stored by Semantic Kernel.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Memory` connectors within Semantic Kernel (e.g., `VolatileMemoryStore`, custom memory implementations), the `SemanticKernel.Memory.IMemoryStore` interface and its implementations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls for Semantic Kernel's memory components, ensuring only authorized parts of the application can access sensitive data.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data before storing it within Semantic Kernel's memory if supported by the chosen memory connector or through custom implementation.
        *   Minimize the storage of highly sensitive information within Semantic Kernel's memory if alternative secure storage mechanisms are available.
        *   Regularly audit the usage and access patterns of Semantic Kernel's memory to identify potential vulnerabilities or unauthorized access.
