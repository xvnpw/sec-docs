## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Plugin Vulnerabilities -> Load Malicious Plugin](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_plugin_vulnerabilities_-_load_malicious_plugin.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Attacker identifies that the application loads Semantic Kernel plugins.
    *   Attacker discovers weak access controls on the directory or registry where plugins are stored.
    *   Attacker gains write access to this location, either through misconfiguration or by exploiting another vulnerability in the system.
    *   Attacker uploads a malicious plugin containing code designed to compromise the application. This could be a backdoor, a data exfiltration tool, or code to manipulate application logic.
    *   Alternatively, the attacker uses social engineering techniques to trick an administrator or user with sufficient privileges into manually installing the malicious plugin. This could involve phishing emails or impersonating a trusted source.
    *   Once loaded, the malicious plugin's code executes within the application's context, potentially gaining access to sensitive data, executing commands, or disrupting operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit LLM Connector Vulnerabilities -> Steal or Abuse LLM API Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_llm_connector_vulnerabilities_-_steal_or_abuse_llm_api_credentials.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Attacker identifies that the application uses Semantic Kernel to interact with an external LLM service.
    *   Attacker discovers that the API key for the LLM service is stored insecurely. This could be:
        *   Hardcoded directly in the application's source code.
        *   Stored in configuration files with insufficient access permissions.
        *   Stored in environment variables that are easily accessible.
    *   Attacker gains access to this insecurely stored API key through various means, such as:
        *   Examining the application's codebase (if publicly accessible or through a code leak).
        *   Exploiting a local file inclusion vulnerability to read configuration files.
        *   Gaining unauthorized access to the server's environment variables.
    *   With the stolen API key, the attacker can directly access the LLM service outside the application's intended use.
    *   Attacker can then abuse the LLM service for malicious purposes, such as:
        *   Incurring significant costs on the application owner's account.
        *   Generating malicious content or spreading misinformation.
        *   Potentially training the LLM on malicious data, affecting its future behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit LLM Connector Vulnerabilities -> Perform Prompt Injection via Connector](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_llm_connector_vulnerabilities_-_perform_prompt_injection_via_connector.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Attacker identifies that the application uses Semantic Kernel to generate prompts for an LLM based on user input or other data.
    *   Attacker finds that user-provided input is directly incorporated into the prompt without proper sanitization or validation.
    *   Attacker crafts malicious input that includes instructions or commands intended to be executed by the LLM, rather than treated as data.
    *   When the Semantic Kernel constructs the prompt, the malicious input is included.
    *   The LLM interprets the injected instructions and executes them. This could lead to:
        *   **Data Exfiltration:**  The LLM could be instructed to reveal sensitive information it has access to.
        *   **Unauthorized Actions:** The LLM could be instructed to perform actions the user is not authorized to take.
        *   **Logic Manipulation:** The LLM's output or behavior could be manipulated to disrupt the application's intended functionality.
        *   **Social Engineering:** The LLM could be tricked into generating convincing phishing messages or other deceptive content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak Access Controls on Plugin Storage](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_access_controls_on_plugin_storage.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**  Attacker exploits misconfigured file system permissions, lack of authentication on a plugin repository, or vulnerabilities in the plugin management system to gain unauthorized write access to the plugin storage location.

## Attack Tree Path: [Socially Engineer User/Admin to Install Malicious Plugin](./attack_tree_paths/socially_engineer_useradmin_to_install_malicious_plugin.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** Attacker uses phishing emails, impersonation, or other social engineering tactics to trick a legitimate user with sufficient privileges into downloading and installing a malicious plugin.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak Storage of API Keys](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_storage_of_api_keys.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** Attacker gains access to API keys stored in plaintext in configuration files, hardcoded in the application, or exposed through insecure environment variables or logging.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Configuration Files with Insufficient Permissions](./attack_tree_paths/access_configuration_files_with_insufficient_permissions.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** Attacker exploits vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to read configuration files that contain sensitive information like API keys due to overly permissive file system permissions or lack of proper access controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Instructions/Commands in User Input (Prompt Injection)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_instructionscommands_in_user_input__prompt_injection_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** Attacker crafts specific input strings that, when incorporated into the LLM prompt, cause the LLM to execute unintended commands or reveal sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Storage of Intermediate Results](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_storage_of_intermediate_results.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** Attacker gains access to temporary files, in-memory data structures, or other locations where Semantic Kernel stores intermediate results that may contain sensitive information, due to lack of encryption or inadequate access controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Temporary Files or In-Memory Structures](./attack_tree_paths/access_temporary_files_or_in-memory_structures.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** Attacker exploits vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to read temporary files or memory locations where sensitive data processed by Semantic Kernel might be temporarily stored.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Unsafe Evaluation of Template Expressions](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_unsafe_evaluation_of_template_expressions.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** Attacker injects malicious code or commands into template expressions used by Semantic Kernel, which are then executed by a vulnerable templating engine.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Settings Allowing Execution of External Commands](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_settings_allowing_execution_of_external_commands.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** Attacker modifies Semantic Kernel's configuration settings to enable the execution of arbitrary external commands or scripts, allowing them to run malicious code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Change Logging or Debugging Settings to Reveal Secrets](./attack_tree_paths/change_logging_or_debugging_settings_to_reveal_secrets.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** Attacker modifies Semantic Kernel's logging or debugging configuration to output sensitive information, such as API keys or internal application details, which can then be intercepted or accessed.
