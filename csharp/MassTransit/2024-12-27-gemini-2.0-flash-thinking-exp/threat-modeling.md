| Threat | Description | Impact | Affected Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Insecure Broker Connection Configuration** | An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the message broker by exploiting insecure connection settings within MassTransit's configuration. This could involve reading, writing, or deleting messages, potentially disrupting the application's functionality or accessing sensitive data. | **Critical:** Complete compromise of messaging infrastructure, data breaches, service disruption. | `IBusControl.ConnectReceiveEndpoint`, `RabbitMqTransportOptions`, `AzureServiceBusTransportOptions` (configuration settings) | **Critical** | - Store broker credentials securely (e.g., using environment variables, secrets management tools like HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault). <br> - Enforce TLS/SSL for all broker connections using MassTransit's configuration (`UseSsl()`). <br> - Regularly review and update broker connection configurations within the MassTransit setup. <br> - Utilize broker-specific authentication and authorization mechanisms configured through MassTransit. <br> - Avoid hardcoding credentials in the application code where MassTransit is configured. |
| **Deserialization Vulnerabilities** | An attacker could send a maliciously crafted message that, when deserialized by MassTransit's configured serializer, leads to arbitrary code execution on the receiving application. This is especially relevant when using insecure serialization formats like `BinaryFormatter` or misconfiguring JSON serializers. | **Critical:** Remote code execution, complete system compromise, data breaches. | `ISerializer` implementations configured in MassTransit (especially `NewtonsoftJsonSerializer`, `SystemTextJsonSerializer` if not configured carefully, and the dangerous `BinaryFormatter`), message consumer code. | **Critical** | - **Strongly prefer using secure serialization formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers** configured within MassTransit. Avoid using .NET's `BinaryFormatter` or similar insecure serializers. <br> - Implement robust input validation on deserialized message content within your message consumers. <br> - Consider using signed or encrypted messages (configurable within MassTransit through custom middleware or broker features) to ensure integrity and authenticity. <br> - Keep MassTransit and its serialization dependencies updated to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities. <br> - Configure JSON serializers used by MassTransit to prevent deserialization of unexpected types (e.g., using `TypeNameHandling.None` or `TypeNameHandling.Auto` with strict allow lists). |
| **Message Content Tampering** | An attacker with access to the message broker could modify message content before it reaches the consumer if messages are not signed or encrypted within the MassTransit pipeline. This could lead to incorrect data processing, unauthorized actions, or data corruption. | **High:** Data integrity compromise, potential for business logic errors, unauthorized actions. | Message transport layer as used by MassTransit, message serialization/deserialization configured in MassTransit. | **High** | - Implement message signing using cryptographic techniques (e.g., HMAC with a shared secret) within MassTransit's message publishing or receiving pipeline (using custom middleware). <br> - Encrypt sensitive message content before publishing using mechanisms integrated with or alongside MassTransit. <br> - Utilize broker-level message integrity features if available and configurable through MassTransit. |
| **Denial of Service through Message Flooding** | An attacker could publish a large number of messages to overwhelm consumers or the message broker itself, leading to a denial of service. This can be exacerbated if MassTransit is configured to aggressively retry failed messages. | **High:** Service disruption, resource exhaustion. | Message publishing logic using MassTransit, message broker interaction through MassTransit, retry mechanisms configured in MassTransit (`UseMessageRetry()`). | **High** | - Implement rate limiting on message producers using MassTransit's features or external mechanisms. <br> - Configure queue limits and dead-letter exchanges on the message broker, which MassTransit will interact with. <br> - Monitor message queue sizes and consumer performance related to MassTransit endpoints. <br> - Implement backpressure mechanisms in consumers that MassTransit can leverage. <br> - Configure retry mechanisms in MassTransit (`UseMessageRetry()`) with appropriate backoff strategies and limits to prevent retry storms. |
| **Vulnerabilities in Custom Middleware or Filters** | If custom middleware or filters developed for MassTransit are not implemented securely, they could introduce vulnerabilities such as authentication bypass, authorization flaws, or information leakage within the messaging pipeline. | **High to Critical:** Depending on the vulnerability, could lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, or service disruption within the messaging context. | Custom middleware components (`IPipe`) registered with MassTransit, custom filters (`IFilter`) registered with MassTransit endpoints. | **High to Critical** | - Follow secure coding practices when developing custom middleware and filters for MassTransit. <br> - Conduct thorough security reviews and testing of custom components integrated with MassTransit. <br> - Keep custom components updated with security patches. <br> - Enforce code review processes for custom components used within the MassTransit pipeline. |
