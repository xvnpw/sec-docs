*   **Threat:** Deserialization of Untrusted Data
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized payload and sends it to the application. The ET framework, upon receiving this data, deserializes it without proper validation. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the server or client. The attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in the deserialization process of the underlying serialization library used by ET (e.g., Protobuf, MessagePack).
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the affected server or client. This can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and further attacks.
    *   **Affected ET Component:**  Network Layer (specifically the message handling and deserialization logic), potentially the `MessageDispatcher` or specific `MessageHandler` implementations. The underlying serialization library used by ET is also affected.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation on all data received over the network before deserialization.
        *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources if possible.
        *   Use secure serialization libraries and keep them updated with the latest security patches.
        *   Consider using alternative serialization methods that are less prone to deserialization vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., digital signatures) on serialized data to ensure it hasn't been tampered with.

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Internal Communication
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between ET actors within the application. If the communication channels provided by ET are not configured to use encryption (e.g., using TLS/SSL), the attacker can eavesdrop on the communication, potentially stealing sensitive information or modifying messages in transit. The attacker might position themselves on the network path between actors.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, allowing the attacker to gain access to sensitive data exchanged between actors. Message tampering can lead to manipulation of application state and unauthorized actions.
    *   **Affected ET Component:**  Network Layer (specifically the transport layer used for internal actor communication, e.g., TCP or KCP implementations within ET).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce encryption (TLS/SSL) for all internal communication between ET actors, utilizing ET's network configuration options.
        *   Implement mutual authentication between actors to ensure they are communicating with legitimate parties, leveraging ET's authentication mechanisms if available.
        *   Isolate the internal network where ET actors communicate to reduce the attack surface.

*   **Threat:** Injection of Malicious Code through Hot-Reloading
    *   **Description:** If the hot-reloading mechanism provided by ET (if it exists) is not properly secured, an attacker who gains unauthorized access to the deployment process can inject malicious code. This code will then be dynamically loaded and executed by the application. The attacker might exploit weak authentication or authorization controls on the hot-reload deployment endpoint exposed by ET.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the application server. This can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and further attacks.
    *   **Affected ET Component:**  Code Hot-Reloading Module (if ET provides one).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for the hot-reloading mechanism provided by ET.
        *   Use secure channels (e.g., HTTPS with client certificates) for deploying hot-reload updates through ET's mechanisms.
        *   Implement code signing to verify the integrity and authenticity of the code being deployed via ET's hot-reload feature.
        *   Restrict access to the hot-reload deployment process to authorized personnel only.
        *   Implement auditing and logging of all hot-reload deployments initiated through ET.

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure through Actor State
    *   **Description:** If ET's actor state management does not provide adequate protection, vulnerabilities could allow unauthorized access to sensitive information stored within actor instances. This could be due to insecure default access control mechanisms within ET or vulnerabilities in how ET manages actor state. An attacker might exploit weaknesses in the framework to access actor internals.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, exposure of sensitive application logic, and potential compromise of user data.
    *   **Affected ET Component:** Actor Model (state management and access control mechanisms provided by ET), individual `Actor` implementations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in actor state if possible.
        *   Utilize ET's provided access control mechanisms to restrict access to actor state.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data stored within actor state, potentially leveraging ET's provided encryption features if available.
        *   Regularly audit actor state management and access control implementations within the ET application.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in ET Dependencies
    *   **Description:** ET relies on various third-party libraries. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit them to compromise the application. The attacker might target specific vulnerabilities in libraries like Protobuf or networking libraries used by ET.
    *   **Impact:** Various security risks depending on the vulnerability in the dependency, including remote code execution, denial of service, and information disclosure.
    *   **Affected ET Component:**  Dependency Management within ET, specific third-party libraries used by ET.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability. Can be Critical or High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update ET and all its dependencies to the latest versions with security patches.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in ET's dependencies.
        *   Monitor security advisories for ET and its dependencies.
        *   Consider using a software bill of materials (SBOM) to track ET's dependencies.
