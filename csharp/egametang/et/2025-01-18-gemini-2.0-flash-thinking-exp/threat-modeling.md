# Threat Model Analysis for egametang/et

## Threat: [Malicious Deserialization](./threats/malicious_deserialization.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Deserialization
    * **Description:** An attacker sends crafted, malicious serialized data that is processed by `et`'s deserialization logic. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the server, as `et` directly handles the process of converting the received byte stream into objects.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, server compromise, denial of service.
    * **Affected Component:** `et`'s message decoding/deserialization logic, potentially the specific codec integration within `et` (if it handles serialization directly).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict input validation *before* the data reaches `et`'s deserialization process.
        * If `et` allows configuration of deserialization settings, ensure they are set to be as restrictive as possible.
        * Keep any serialization libraries used *by* `et` updated.

## Threat: [Message Routing Exploitation](./threats/message_routing_exploitation.md)

**Threat:** Message Routing Exploitation
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts messages to exploit vulnerabilities in `et`'s internal message routing mechanisms. This could allow them to bypass intended message flow, send messages to unintended recipients, or trigger actions they are not authorized for, directly manipulating how `et` directs network traffic within the application.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to functionalities or data, privilege escalation within the `et`-managed network, data manipulation.
    * **Affected Component:** `et`'s message routing mechanism, internal message dispatching logic.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly review and test the message routing logic *within* `et`'s context (if configurable or extensible).
        * Implement access controls and authentication that are enforced *before* or during `et`'s routing process.

## Threat: [Race Condition in Message Processing](./threats/race_condition_in_message_processing.md)

**Threat:** Race Condition in Message Processing
    * **Description:** An attacker sends a sequence of messages designed to trigger race conditions within `et`'s concurrent message processing. This can lead to inconsistent internal state within `et`, data corruption in messages being handled, or unexpected behavior in how `et` manages network connections.
    * **Impact:** Data corruption within the `et` managed network, inconsistent application behavior due to `et`'s state, potential denial of service if `et` becomes unstable.
    * **Affected Component:** `et`'s internal concurrency management, message queue handling within `et`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * If `et` provides configuration options for concurrency, ensure they are appropriately set.
        * Understand `et`'s threading model and ensure any interactions with `et` from the application are thread-safe.

## Threat: [Malicious Request Flooding (Resource Exhaustion within `et`)](./threats/malicious_request_flooding__resource_exhaustion_within__et__.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Request Flooding (Resource Exhaustion within `et`)
    * **Description:** An attacker sends a large volume of requests or specific message types that overwhelm `et`'s internal resources (e.g., connection pools, message queues, processing threads). This can lead to `et` becoming unresponsive or crashing, causing a denial of service.
    * **Impact:** Service unavailability due to `et` being overloaded, performance degradation of the application's network communication.
    * **Affected Component:** `et`'s network handling, connection management, internal message processing queues.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Utilize any built-in rate limiting or connection limiting features provided by `et`.
        * Implement upstream rate limiting or firewalls to filter malicious traffic before it reaches `et`.

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow via Malformed Input](./threats/buffer_overflow_via_malformed_input.md)

**Threat:** Buffer Overflow via Malformed Input
    * **Description:** An attacker sends network data that exceeds the expected buffer size in `et`'s input handling. If `et` lacks proper bounds checking, this could lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing the attacker to overwrite memory within the `et` process and execute arbitrary code.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, potential remote code execution within the context of the application using `et`.
    * **Affected Component:** `et`'s network input handling, message parsing within `et`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure that the version of `et` being used has addressed any known buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
        * If possible, configure `et` to enforce strict limits on the size of incoming data.

## Threat: [Interception of Communication (if `et` doesn't enforce/facilitate encryption)](./threats/interception_of_communication__if__et__doesn't_enforcefacilitate_encryption_.md)

**Threat:** Interception of Communication (if `et` doesn't enforce/facilitate encryption)
    * **Description:** If `et` is used for network communication and does not enforce or provide clear mechanisms for implementing encryption (like TLS), attackers on the network can intercept and potentially read or modify the data being transmitted. This is a direct consequence of `et`'s role in handling the raw communication.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, manipulation of communication handled by `et`.
    * **Affected Component:** `et`'s core network communication layer, if it lacks built-in encryption or clear guidance for its implementation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure that the application using `et` implements encryption (e.g., using TLS) at a layer above `et` if `et` doesn't handle it directly.
        * If `et` provides options for secure communication, ensure they are enabled and configured correctly.
