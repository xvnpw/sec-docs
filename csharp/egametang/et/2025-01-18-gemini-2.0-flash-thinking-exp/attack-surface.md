# Attack Surface Analysis for egametang/et

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Connection Handling](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_connection_handling.md)

* **Denial of Service (DoS) via Connection Handling**
    * **Description:** An attacker overwhelms the application by establishing a large number of connections, exhausting server resources and making it unresponsive to legitimate users.
    * **How `et` Contributes:** `et` is responsible for accepting and managing TCP connections. If the application doesn't implement proper connection limits or resource management around `et`'s connection handling, it becomes vulnerable to this attack.
    * **Example:** An attacker script repeatedly opens new TCP connections to the application's `et` listener without sending further data or closing the connections, eventually exhausting the server's connection limit or memory.
    * **Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption, potential system crashes.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement Connection Limits: Configure the application to limit the maximum number of concurrent connections accepted by `et`.
        * Resource Management: Ensure the application properly handles connection closures and reclaims resources associated with closed connections.
        * Timeouts: Implement timeouts for idle connections to free up resources.
        * Rate Limiting on Connections:  Limit the rate at which new connections can be established from a single IP address.

## Attack Surface: [Message Injection/Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/message_injectionmanipulation.md)

* **Message Injection/Manipulation**
    * **Description:** An attacker sends crafted or malicious messages to the application through the `et` connection, potentially triggering unintended actions or exploiting vulnerabilities in message processing logic.
    * **How `et` Contributes:** `et` provides the underlying transport for messages. If the application doesn't properly validate and sanitize messages received via `et`, it's susceptible to this attack.
    * **Example:** An attacker sends a message with a forged message ID or malicious data payload that exploits a flaw in the application's message handler, leading to data corruption or unauthorized actions.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, application crashes, remote code execution (depending on the vulnerability).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Strict Input Validation: Implement rigorous validation of all incoming messages received via `et`, including message IDs, data types, and content.
        * Message Authentication: Use mechanisms like message signing or MACs to verify the integrity and authenticity of messages.
        * Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure message handlers only have the necessary permissions to perform their intended actions.
        * Sanitize Input: Sanitize any user-provided data within messages before processing or using it in further operations.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if using custom codecs)](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities__if_using_custom_codecs_.md)

* **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if using custom codecs)**
    * **Description:** If the application uses custom codecs (serialization/deserialization mechanisms) with `et` and these codecs are vulnerable to deserialization attacks, an attacker can send malicious serialized data to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    * **How `et` Contributes:** `et` allows for custom codecs to be used for message serialization and deserialization. If the chosen codec is inherently insecure or used improperly, `et` becomes the transport mechanism for these malicious payloads.
    * **Example:** The application uses the `gob` codec without proper safeguards. An attacker sends a specially crafted `gob`-encoded message that, when deserialized, instantiates malicious objects and executes arbitrary code on the server.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete compromise of the server.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid Insecure Deserialization:  Prefer safer serialization formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers, which are less prone to deserialization vulnerabilities.
        * Input Validation During Deserialization: If custom codecs are necessary, implement strict validation of the deserialized data before using it.
        * Principle of Least Privilege (Deserialization Context): Ensure the deserialization process runs with minimal privileges.
        * Regularly Update Libraries: Keep the serialization libraries used with `et` up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Vulnerabilities (if implemented)](./attack_surfaces/middleware_vulnerabilities__if_implemented_.md)

* **Middleware Vulnerabilities (if implemented)**
    * **Description:** If the application uses custom middleware within the `et` framework, vulnerabilities in this middleware can be exploited by attackers sending specific requests.
    * **How `et` Contributes:** `et` provides a mechanism for implementing middleware to intercept and process messages. If this middleware is poorly written or contains security flaws, it becomes an attack vector accessible through `et`.
    * **Example:** A custom authentication middleware has a bypass vulnerability. An attacker crafts a message that circumvents the authentication checks and gains unauthorized access.
    * **Impact:**  Bypass of security controls, unauthorized access, potential for further exploitation depending on the middleware's function.
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the middleware's purpose and vulnerability).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Secure Coding Practices for Middleware: Develop middleware with security in mind, following secure coding principles.
        * Thorough Testing of Middleware:  Conduct comprehensive testing, including security testing, of all custom middleware components.
        * Regular Security Audits of Middleware:  Subject middleware to regular security audits to identify potential vulnerabilities.
        * Principle of Least Privilege for Middleware: Ensure middleware components have only the necessary permissions.
