## Mitigation Strategy: [Strictly Define and Enforce Message Schemas using `et`'s Capabilities](./mitigation_strategies/strictly_define_and_enforce_message_schemas_using__et_'s_capabilities.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strictly Define and Enforce Message Schemas using `et`'s Capabilities
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize `et`'s Schema Definition (if available):**  Check `et`'s documentation and examples to see if it provides a built-in mechanism for defining message schemas. This might involve using specific data structures, configuration files, or APIs provided by `et` for schema registration.
    2.  **Register Message Types with `et`:**  Use `et`'s message registration features to formally declare all message types that your application will exchange. This registration process should ideally include schema information for each message type.
    3.  **Enable `et`'s Built-in Schema Validation:** If `et` offers schema validation as a feature, ensure it is enabled in your `et` configuration. This might be a configuration flag, a specific initialization parameter, or a setting within `et`'s message handling pipeline.
    4.  **Leverage `et`'s Deserialization Mechanisms:**  Use `et`'s provided deserialization functions or methods to convert incoming network data into application-level message objects. These deserialization functions should ideally perform schema validation as part of the process if configured.
    5.  **Handle `et`'s Schema Validation Errors:** Implement error handling to catch and process schema validation errors reported by `et`. When `et` indicates a message is invalid according to the schema, ensure your application rejects the message and logs the error appropriately.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Malformed or unexpected message structures can lead to buffer overflows, memory corruption, or other deserialization exploits. `et`'s schema validation, if used, directly mitigates this by rejecting non-conforming messages *before* they are processed by the application logic.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):**  Without schema enforcement at the `et` level, unexpected data types or formats can lead to incorrect application behavior. `et`'s schema validation ensures data conforms to defined types as early as possible in the processing pipeline.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities:** High risk reduction.  By leveraging `et`'s schema validation, you offload the initial validation step to the network library itself, making it a more robust and integrated defense.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues:** Medium risk reduction.  Early schema validation within `et` improves data integrity from the moment the message is received and deserialized.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Currently, the project uses custom JSON schema files, but these are validated in application code *after* `et` has processed the raw network data.  `et` itself is not directly involved in schema validation.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Investigate if `et` provides any built-in schema definition or validation features. If so, migrate schema definitions to use `et`'s mechanisms.
    *   Configure `et` to perform schema validation during deserialization if this feature is available.
    *   Modify the application to rely on `et`'s schema validation errors instead of performing validation solely in application code.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Message Sizes using `et`'s Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/limit_message_sizes_using__et_'s_configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Limit Message Sizes using `et`'s Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Consult `et`'s Documentation for Size Limits:** Review `et`'s documentation to identify configuration options related to message size limits. Look for settings that allow you to define maximum sizes for incoming messages, outgoing messages, or both.
    2.  **Configure Global Message Size Limits in `et`:**  If `et` provides a global message size limit setting, configure it to a reasonable maximum value based on your application's needs. This global limit will apply to all messages processed by `et`.
    3.  **Configure Per-Message-Type Size Limits in `et` (if available):**  If `et` offers more granular control, explore options to set different size limits for specific message types. This allows for more optimized limits based on the expected payload of each message type.
    4.  **Utilize `et`'s Size Limit Enforcement:** Ensure that `et`'s size limit enforcement is active.  `et` should automatically reject or truncate messages that exceed the configured size limits.
    5.  **Handle `et`'s Size Limit Errors:** Implement error handling to catch and process errors reported by `et` when a message exceeds the size limit. Log these errors for monitoring and debugging.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Processing excessively large messages can lead to buffer overflows in `et`'s internal processing. Configuring size limits in `et` directly prevents `et` from attempting to process messages beyond a safe size.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (Medium to High Severity):** Attackers can send a flood of extremely large messages to exhaust server resources. `et`'s size limits act as a first line of defense by discarding oversized messages before they consume significant resources.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities:** High risk reduction.  Configuring size limits within `et` provides a direct and effective mitigation against buffer overflows related to message size.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** Medium to High risk reduction.  `et`'s size limits help to quickly discard oversized messages in DoS attacks, reducing the impact on application resources.
*   **Currently Implemented:** A global message size limit is configured in `et`'s initialization file (`et_config.ini`). This configuration is directly within `et`'s settings.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Explore if `et` supports per-message-type size limits for more granular control.
    *   Review `et`'s error handling for size limit violations. Ensure the application properly logs and potentially handles these errors reported by `et`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure `et`'s Network Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure__et_'s_network_configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure `et`'s Network Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review `et`'s Network Configuration Options:**  Thoroughly examine `et`'s documentation and configuration files to understand all network-related settings. This includes listening ports, network interfaces, protocol options (TCP, UDP, etc.), and any security-related network configurations.
    2.  **Apply Least Privilege to `et`'s Network Bindings:** Configure `et` to listen only on the necessary network interfaces and ports. Avoid binding `et` to wildcard addresses (0.0.0.0) if it only needs to serve local clients or a specific network segment. Bind to specific IP addresses or interfaces as appropriate.
    3.  **Configure Secure Protocols in `et` (if supported):** If `et` supports secure network protocols like TLS/SSL for encryption and authentication, enable and configure these features. This might involve setting up certificates, key files, and cipher suites within `et`'s configuration.
    4.  **Restrict Access to `et`'s Listening Ports:** Use firewalls or network access control lists (ACLs) to restrict network access to `et`'s listening ports. Only allow connections from authorized clients or network segments.
    5.  **Disable Unnecessary `et` Network Features:** If `et` offers optional network features or protocols that are not required by your application, disable them in `et`'s configuration to reduce the attack surface.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Network Access (High Severity):** Insecure network configuration of `et` can allow unauthorized clients to connect to `et` services, potentially bypassing application-level access controls or exploiting vulnerabilities in `et` or the application.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity if unencrypted):** If `et` communication is not encrypted, attackers on the network can eavesdrop on or manipulate messages exchanged between clients and the application.
    *   **Network-Level DoS Attacks (Medium to High Severity):**  Exposing `et` services unnecessarily to the public internet or untrusted networks increases the risk of network-level DoS attacks targeting `et`'s network infrastructure.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Network Access:** High risk reduction. Secure network configuration of `et` is fundamental to controlling who can interact with the application at the network level.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** High risk reduction (if encryption is enabled). Using secure protocols in `et` (like TLS) directly mitigates MitM attacks by encrypting network communication.
    *   **Network-Level DoS Attacks:** Medium to High risk reduction. Restricting access and disabling unnecessary features reduces the attack surface and potential vectors for network-level DoS attacks.
*   **Currently Implemented:** `et` is configured to listen on a specific port (defined in `et_config.ini`). Firewall rules are in place to restrict access to this port from outside the internal network.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Investigate if `et` supports TLS/SSL or other encryption options for network communication. If so, implement encryption to protect data in transit.
    *   Review `et`'s network interface binding configuration. Ensure it is bound to the most restrictive interface necessary and not unnecessarily exposed.
    *   Document `et`'s network configuration requirements and best practices for secure deployment as part of the application's security guidelines.
