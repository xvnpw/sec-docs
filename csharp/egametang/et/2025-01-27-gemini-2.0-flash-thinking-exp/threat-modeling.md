# Threat Model Analysis for egametang/et

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via `et` Code](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via__et__code.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the application. This code is executed in a user's browser due to a vulnerability within the `et` library itself, specifically in how `et` handles user-provided data or manipulates the DOM. The attacker could steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or deface the application.
**Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, malware distribution, website defacement.
**Affected et component:** Potentially any part of `et` that handles user input or DOM manipulation.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Conduct thorough code reviews of `et`'s source code for XSS vulnerabilities.
*   Ensure `et` properly sanitizes or escapes user-provided data before rendering or DOM manipulation.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the impact of XSS.
*   Regularly update `et` to benefit from potential security patches.

## Threat: [Prototype Pollution in `et`](./threats/prototype_pollution_in__et_.md)

**Description:** An attacker leverages a vulnerability in `et` that allows them to modify JavaScript prototypes. By polluting prototypes, the attacker can inject properties into built-in JavaScript objects, potentially altering the application's behavior in unexpected and harmful ways. This could lead to privilege escalation, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution within the application using `et`.
**Impact:** Application instability, privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution, denial of service.
**Affected et component:** Parts of `et` that modify JavaScript prototypes (if any).
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Review `et`'s code for prototype modifications.
*   Avoid using libraries that aggressively modify prototypes if possible.
*   Implement strong input validation to prevent attackers from controlling data used in prototype modifications.
*   Monitor for unexpected application behavior that might indicate prototype pollution.

## Threat: [Logic Errors in `et` Leading to Security Issues](./threats/logic_errors_in__et__leading_to_security_issues.md)

**Description:** Bugs or flaws in `et`'s internal logic cause unexpected behavior that can be exploited by an attacker. These logic errors within `et` itself could lead to vulnerabilities such as bypassing access controls, information disclosure, or other security breaches within the context of the application using `et`.
**Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized access, application malfunction.
**Affected et component:** Any module or function within `et` containing logic errors.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly test the application's integration with `et` to identify unexpected behavior.
*   Monitor application logs for errors and anomalies related to `et`.
*   Report any identified bugs to the `et` library maintainers.
*   Implement robust error handling and input validation in the application.

## Threat: [Developer-Introduced XSS via Misuse of `et`](./threats/developer-introduced_xss_via_misuse_of__et_.md)

**Description:** Developers incorrectly use `et` in a way that introduces XSS vulnerabilities. Even if `et` itself is secure, improper integration, such as rendering unsanitized user input directly within an `et` effect, can create an XSS vulnerability. An attacker can then inject malicious scripts that are executed due to the developer's misuse of `et`.
**Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, malware distribution, website defacement.
**Affected et component:** Application code that integrates with `et`.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Provide secure coding training to developers on using `et` safely.
*   Establish clear guidelines for handling user input and using `et` effects securely.
*   Conduct code reviews to identify and correct insecure usage of `et`.
*   Implement input validation and output encoding in the application, especially when using `et` to display dynamic content.
