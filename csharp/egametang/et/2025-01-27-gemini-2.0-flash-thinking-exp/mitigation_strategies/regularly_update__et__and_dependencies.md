#### 4.6. Threats Mitigated

*   **Known Vulnerabilities in `et` or Dependencies (High Severity):**  **Effectiveness: High.** Regularly updating `et` and dependencies is highly effective in mitigating known vulnerabilities. By applying patches and updates, the application is protected against exploits targeting these known weaknesses.
*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in `et` (Low Severity):** **Effectiveness: Low to Moderate.** While this strategy primarily targets known vulnerabilities, it can indirectly reduce the window of exposure to zero-day vulnerabilities. Staying up-to-date means being closer to the latest versions, which may include fixes for recently discovered vulnerabilities, even if they were not publicly known as zero-days initially. However, it does not directly prevent zero-day exploits.  Other mitigation strategies like Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP), and proactive security monitoring are more relevant for zero-day threats.

*   **Minimally Reduces risk of zero-day vulnerabilities in `et`:** **Accurate.** The impact on zero-day vulnerabilities is minimal and indirect.  It's more about reducing the overall attack surface and staying closer to potentially faster fixes, rather than directly preventing zero-day exploits.

#### 4.8. Currently Implemented & Missing Implementation

*   **Currently Implemented: Partially Implemented.**  The description accurately reflects a common scenario where updates are done periodically but lack systematic automation and vulnerability monitoring.
*   **Missing Implementation:** The "Missing Implementation" points are crucial and accurately identify the key areas for improvement:
    *   **Automated dependency vulnerability scanning:** This is a critical missing piece for proactive vulnerability management.
    *   **Formal patch management process:**  Essential for a structured and reliable approach to applying security patches.
    *   **Automated dependency updates (where feasible):** Automation is key to efficiency and consistency, but needs to be implemented cautiously with testing and rollback mechanisms.
