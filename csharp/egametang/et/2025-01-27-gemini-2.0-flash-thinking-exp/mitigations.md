## Mitigation Strategy: [Rigorous Protocol Design and Review (When Using `et` for Custom Protocols)](./mitigation_strategies/rigorous_protocol_design_and_review__when_using__et__for_custom_protocols_.md)

### 1. Rigorous Protocol Design and Review (When Using `et` for Custom Protocols)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Rigorous Protocol Design and Review (within `et` context)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Security Requirements for `et`-based Protocol:** When implementing a custom network protocol using `et`, explicitly document security requirements (confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, authorization) *specific to how the protocol is handled within `et`*.
    2.  **Threat Modeling for `et` Protocol Implementation:** Conduct threat modeling exercises focused on the `et` implementation of your custom protocol. Identify potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities *arising from how `et` is used to process protocol messages*. Consider attacker capabilities and motivations in the context of `et`'s features.
    3.  **Secure Design Principles in `et` Protocol Logic:** Apply secure protocol design principles within the code that handles your custom protocol using `et`'s API. Focus on least privilege, defense in depth, separation of concerns, and fail-safe defaults *within the `et` event handlers and message processing logic*.
    4.  **Peer Review of `et` Protocol Code:** Have the `et` protocol implementation code reviewed by multiple developers and security experts. Focus on logic flaws, edge cases, and potential security weaknesses *in how `et`'s API is used and how protocol states are managed within `et`*.
    5.  **Documentation of `et` Protocol Usage:** Create comprehensive documentation of how your custom protocol is implemented using `et`, including security considerations, threat models, and rationale behind design choices *specifically related to `et`'s features and configurations*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Protocol Logic Flaws in `et` Implementation (High Severity):** Vulnerabilities in the protocol's logic *as implemented using `et`*, that can be exploited to bypass security controls, cause denial of service, or gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Authentication/Authorization Bypasses in `et` Protocol Handling (High Severity):** Weaknesses in authentication or authorization mechanisms within the protocol *as implemented using `et`*, allowing unauthorized users to access resources or perform actions.
    *   **Data Integrity Violations in `et` Protocol Processing (Medium Severity):** Lack of mechanisms to ensure data integrity *within the `et` protocol handling code*, leading to potential data manipulation or corruption without detection.
    *   **Confidentiality Breaches in `et` Protocol Communication (Medium Severity):** Absence of encryption or other confidentiality measures *in the protocol as used with `et`*, exposing sensitive data transmitted over the network.
*   **Impact:** Significantly Reduces risk for all listed threats by proactively addressing vulnerabilities at the design and implementation stage *within the `et` context*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Security requirements are generally considered, but formal threat modeling and dedicated security reviews *specifically for the `et` protocol implementation* are not consistently performed. Design documentation exists but lacks detailed security considerations *related to `et` usage*.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Formal threat modeling exercises *focused on the `et` protocol implementation* are missing. Dedicated security reviews by security experts *with `et` and network protocol expertise* are not consistently performed. Security considerations in protocol documentation need to be significantly expanded and formalized *with respect to `et`'s role*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization at Protocol Level (Within `et` Handlers)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_at_protocol_level__within__et__handlers_.md)

### 2. Input Validation and Sanitization at Protocol Level (Within `et` Handlers)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation and Sanitization at Protocol Level (in `et` handlers)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Input Points in `et` Handlers:** Pinpoint all locations within your `et` event handlers and message processing logic where external data is received and processed (e.g., message headers, message bodies, parameters received *through `et`*).
    2.  **Define Validation Rules for `et` Protocol Inputs:** For each input point *within `et` handlers*, define strict validation rules based on the expected data type, format, length, and allowed values.
    3.  **Implement Validation Checks in `et` Handlers:** Implement validation checks at the earliest possible stage of data processing *within your `et` handlers*, before the data is used in application logic.
    4.  **Sanitize Input in `et` Handlers:** If input needs to be processed further (e.g., for display or storage), sanitize it *within your `et` handlers* to neutralize potentially harmful characters or sequences (e.g., HTML escaping, SQL parameterization).
    5.  **Handle Invalid Input in `et` Handlers:** Define clear error handling for invalid input *detected within `et` handlers*. Reject invalid input, log the event (for security monitoring), and return informative error messages (without revealing sensitive internal details) *through `et`'s response mechanisms*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks via `et` Protocol Inputs (High Severity):** Prevents various injection attacks (e.g., command injection, SQL injection, log injection) by sanitizing and validating input *received and processed through `et`* before further processing.
    *   **Buffer Overflow in `et` Protocol Handling (High Severity):** Mitigates buffer overflow vulnerabilities by validating input lengths *within `et` handlers* and preventing excessively long inputs from overflowing buffers.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed `et` Protocol Messages (Medium Severity):** Reduces DoS risks by rejecting malformed or excessively large inputs *received through `et`* that could consume excessive resources or crash the application.
    *   **Protocol Confusion Exploiting `et` Protocol Handling (Medium Severity):** Prevents protocol confusion attacks by strictly validating message formats *within `et` handlers* and ensuring adherence to the defined protocol.
*   **Impact:** Significantly Reduces risk for injection attacks and buffer overflows *related to `et` protocol handling*. Moderately Reduces risk for DoS and protocol confusion *exploiting `et`'s protocol processing*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Basic input validation exists for some message types *handled by `et`*, but it's not consistently applied across all input points *within `et` handlers*. Sanitization is not systematically implemented *in `et` handlers*.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Comprehensive input validation is missing for all protocol message types and parameters *processed by `et` handlers*. Systematic input sanitization is not implemented *within `et` handlers*. Error handling for invalid input *detected in `et` handlers* needs to be improved to be more secure and informative.

*   **Impact:** Significantly Reduces risk of undiscovered protocol vulnerabilities *in the `et` implementation*. Moderately Reduces risk of implementation errors *in `et` protocol handlers* and configuration issues *related to `et` protocol setup*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Implemented. Security audits are performed on the overall application, but specific audits focusing on the custom protocol implementation *using `et`* are not regularly conducted.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Establish a process for regular security audits specifically targeting the custom protocol implementation *using `et`*. Budget and schedule penetration testing by security experts with protocol security and *`et` library* expertise.

    3.  **Authorization Checks per `et` Connection Request:** Perform authorization checks for every request *received through an `et` connection*, based on the associated user context. Do not rely on connection identity alone for authorization *within `et` handlers*.
    4.  **Prevent Cross-Connection Data Leakage in `et`:** Ensure that data or resources associated with one *`et` connection* are not inadvertently accessible or leaked to other *`et` connections*, especially in connection pooling scenarios *managed by `et`*.
    5.  **`et` Connection Termination on Session Logout:** Properly terminate *`et` connections* when a user session ends (logout, timeout) to prevent unauthorized access through lingering connections *managed by `et`*.
