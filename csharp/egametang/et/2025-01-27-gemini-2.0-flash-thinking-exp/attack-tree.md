# Attack Tree Analysis for egametang/et

Objective: Gain unauthorized access to sensitive application configuration data managed by `et` and/or manipulate this data to compromise the application's functionality or security.

## Attack Tree Visualization

*   Exploit et Server Vulnerabilities **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
    *   Authentication and Authorization Bypass **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
        *   Default/Weak Credentials **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
            *   **1.1.1. Use default credentials if not changed (e.g., for etcd or et server itself if any)** **(CRITICAL NODE)**
        *   No/Weak Authentication Implemented **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
            *   **1.4.1. Access et server API without any authentication if not enforced by default or misconfigured** **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    *   Dependency Vulnerabilities (Indirectly via et) **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
        *   Vulnerabilities in etcd **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
            *   **4.1.1. Exploit known vulnerabilities in the etcd version used by et (if et doesn't enforce secure etcd setup)** **(CRITICAL NODE)**
*   Exploit et Configuration Weaknesses (Deployment/Operational Issues) **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
    *   Insecure et Server Configuration **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
        *   Exposed et Server API **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
            *   **5.1.1. et server API accessible from the public internet without proper network segmentation or firewall rules** **(CRITICAL NODE)**
        *   Weak etcd Configuration (via et deployment) **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
            *   **5.3.1. et deployment leads to insecure etcd setup (e.g., default ports exposed, no authentication on etcd itself)** **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    *   Misuse of et by Application Developers **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
        *   Storing Highly Sensitive Data in et without Proper Encryption **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
            *   **6.1.1. Developers store secrets (API keys, database passwords) in plain text in et configuration, increasing risk of exposure** **(CRITICAL NODE)**
*   Exploit et Client-Side Issues (Less Direct, but Possible)
    *   Compromised et Client Application
        *   Stored Credentials in et Client Application **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
            *   **7.2.1. Hardcoded or insecurely stored credentials in the application code used to connect to et server** **(CRITICAL NODE)**
