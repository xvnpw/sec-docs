# Threat Model Analysis for egametang/et

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization via Custom Codec](./threats/insecure_deserialization_via_custom_codec.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious message that exploits vulnerabilities in a custom codec used with `et`. Upon deserialization by the `et` library, this could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, data corruption, or denial of service. The attacker might send a specially crafted byte stream that triggers a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issues during the deserialization process.

**Impact:** **Critical**. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to gain complete control over the server, steal sensitive data, or disrupt the application's functionality.

**Affected `et` Component:** `codec` module, specifically the custom codec implementation used by the application.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly audit and test all custom codecs for vulnerabilities.
*   Prefer using well-established and vetted serialization libraries instead of custom implementations.
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on received data *after* deserialization.
*   Consider using memory-safe deserialization techniques if available in the chosen codec.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Connection Flooding](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_connection_flooding.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a large number of connection requests to the `et` server, overwhelming its resources and preventing legitimate clients from connecting. This can render the application unavailable.

**Impact:** **High**. The application becomes unavailable to legitimate users, potentially causing business disruption and financial loss.

**Affected `et` Component:** The underlying connection handling within `et`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement connection rate limiting and throttling at the application level, potentially leveraging `et`'s connection management features if applicable.
*   Properly configure operating system limits on open connections.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Potential Bugs or Vulnerabilities in `et` itself](./threats/exploitation_of_potential_bugs_or_vulnerabilities_in__et__itself.md)

**Description:**  An attacker discovers and exploits a previously unknown bug or vulnerability within the `et` library's code. This could lead to various security issues, including denial of service, information disclosure, or even remote code execution.

**Impact:** **Medium** to **Critical**, depending on the nature and severity of the vulnerability.

**Affected `et` Component:** Any module or function within the `et` library containing the vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Medium (as it depends on undiscovered vulnerabilities)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Stay updated with the latest releases of `et` and review any reported security vulnerabilities.
*   Subscribe to security advisories related to Go and its ecosystem.
*   Consider using static analysis and security scanning tools on the application code, including the `et` library (although this might not catch all library-specific vulnerabilities).
*   In case of a discovered vulnerability, apply patches or workarounds promptly.
