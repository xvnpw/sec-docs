# Attack Surface Analysis for egametang/et

## Attack Surface: [Malformed Message Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/malformed_message_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The application using `et` is vulnerable to specially crafted, malformed messages that exploit weaknesses in `et`'s message parsing logic.

**How `et` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `et` is responsible for defining and handling the message framing and potentially the serialization/deserialization of data. Flaws in this implementation directly lead to parsing vulnerabilities.

**Example:** An attacker sends a message with an incorrect length field, causing `et` to read beyond the allocated buffer, potentially leading to a crash or memory corruption within the `et` library or the application.

**Impact:** Denial of service (application crash due to `et` error), potential for remote code execution if memory corruption within `et` is exploitable.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Utilize `et`'s features for robust message validation if available.**
* **If implementing custom parsing logic alongside `et`, ensure it is rigorously tested and free from buffer overflows or similar vulnerabilities.**
* **Keep `et` updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches related to message parsing.**

## Attack Surface: [Lack of RPC Authentication and Authorization (if using `et`'s RPC features)](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_rpc_authentication_and_authorization__if_using__et_'s_rpc_features_.md)

**Description:** If the application utilizes `et`'s built-in RPC capabilities (if any) without implementing proper authentication and authorization within the `et` usage, unauthorized clients can invoke remote procedures.

**How `et` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If `et` provides a mechanism for RPC without enforcing or providing clear guidance for implementing authentication and authorization, it directly contributes to this attack surface. The ease or difficulty of implementing security within `et`'s RPC framework is a factor.

**Example:** An attacker can send RPC calls through `et` to a sensitive function without providing any credentials, if `et` doesn't enforce or facilitate this check, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation, denial of service (by invoking resource-intensive functions).

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Leverage any authentication mechanisms provided by `et`'s RPC framework.**
* **Implement custom authentication and authorization checks within the RPC handlers defined when using `et`.**
* **Ensure the application's usage of `et`'s RPC clearly defines and enforces access control.**

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service through Connection Flooding](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service_through_connection_flooding.md)

**Description:** An attacker can overwhelm the application by initiating a large number of connection requests handled by `et`, potentially exhausting server resources managed by the library.

**How `et` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `et` is responsible for managing the underlying TCP connections. Vulnerabilities or limitations in `et`'s connection handling can make the application susceptible to connection floods.

**Example:** An attacker sends thousands of connection requests per second, overwhelming `et`'s connection handling logic and consuming CPU, memory, and network bandwidth managed by the library, making the application unresponsive.

**Impact:** Application unavailability, impacting business operations and user experience due to `et`'s inability to handle legitimate connections.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Utilize any connection management features provided by `et` (e.g., connection limits, timeouts).**
* **Implement rate limiting on connection attempts before they reach `et` (e.g., using a firewall or reverse proxy).**
* **Configure `et` with appropriate resource limits to prevent excessive consumption.**

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion due to Unclosed Connections](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_due_to_unclosed_connections.md)

**Description:** If `et` or the application's usage of `et` doesn't properly close connections (e.g., due to errors within `et` or improper handling of `et`'s connection events), resources like file descriptors and memory managed by `et` can be exhausted.

**How `et` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `et` is responsible for managing connection lifecycles. Bugs within `et`'s connection management or a lack of proper cleanup can lead to resource leaks within the library.

**Example:** Due to an error within `et`, connections are not properly closed after a client disconnects, leading to a gradual increase in resource consumption by the `et` library until the application becomes unstable or crashes.

**Impact:** Denial of service (application crashes or becomes unresponsive due to `et` resource exhaustion).

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Ensure proper handling of connection events and errors provided by `et` to close connections gracefully.**
* **Monitor resource usage related to `et` (e.g., number of open connections, memory usage).**
* **Investigate and address any reported issues or bugs within `et` related to connection management and resource cleanup.**
* **Set appropriate timeouts and keep-alive settings within `et`'s configuration if available.**
