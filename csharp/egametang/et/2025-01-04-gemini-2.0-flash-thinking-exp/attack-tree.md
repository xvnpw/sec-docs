# Attack Tree Analysis for egametang/et

Objective: To gain unauthorized access or control over the application utilizing the `et` networking library, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or other malicious outcomes.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   Compromise Application Using ET **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    *   OR
        *   **Exploit Weaknesses in Transport Layer Implementation (ET-Specific) (HIGH-RISK PATH START)**
            *   AND
                *   Target WebSocket Implementation
                    *   Exploit Lack of Proper Input Sanitization on WebSocket Messages **(CRITICAL NODE)** **(HIGH-RISK PATH END)**
        *   **Exploit Weaknesses in Message Handling (Specific to ET's Usage) (HIGH-RISK PATH START)**
            *   AND

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weaknesses in Transport Layer Implementation (ET-Specific) --> Exploit Lack of Proper Input Sanitization on WebSocket Messages](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weaknesses_in_transport_layer_implementation__et-specific__--_exploit_lack_of_proper_input_s_aff150ed.md)

This path highlights the risk of vulnerabilities in `et`'s WebSocket handling that could allow attackers to bypass or circumvent input sanitization mechanisms at the application level. If `et` itself has flaws in how it processes WebSocket frames, it might allow malicious payloads to reach the application logic even if the application intends to sanitize them.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weaknesses in Message Handling (Specific to ET's Usage) --> Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities or Exploit Lack of Proper Input Validation on Messages Received via ET](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weaknesses_in_message_handling__specific_to_et's_usage__--_exploit_deserialization_vulnerabi_c9720b7f.md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the application uses `et` for message passing. Unsafe deserialization practices or a lack of input validation on messages received through `et` are direct and highly impactful attack vectors.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerabilities Introduced by ET --> Connection Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_denial_of_service__dos__vulnerabilities_introduced_by_et_--_connection_exhaustion.md)

This path represents a straightforward and easily executed DoS attack. By simply opening a large number of connections, an attacker can quickly overwhelm the server and disrupt service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Weaknesses in ET Usage --> Insufficient Rate Limiting or Lack of Proper TLS/Encryption Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_weaknesses_in_et_usage_--_insufficient_rate_limiting_or_lack_of_proper_tlsencr_77d7827d.md)

This path emphasizes the importance of secure configuration. Failing to implement proper rate limiting or neglecting to configure TLS encryption creates easily exploitable vulnerabilities that can lead to DoS or data breaches.
