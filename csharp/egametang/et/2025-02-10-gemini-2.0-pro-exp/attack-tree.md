## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Network Communication](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_network_communication.md)

This is the most significant attack surface due to the framework's reliance on network communication for client-server and server-server interactions.

*   **KCP Protocol Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **Send Malformed KCP Packets [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted KCP packets that violate the KCP protocol specification. This could include invalid header fields, incorrect checksums, or oversized payloads.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
        *   **Impact:** High (Can lead to crashes, DoS, or potentially code execution if a buffer overflow is triggered)
        *   **Effort:** Low (Fuzzing tools are readily available)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Requires understanding of KCP and fuzzing)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Network monitoring can detect unusual traffic, but interpreting it requires expertise)
        *   **Mitigation:** Rigorous input validation of all KCP packet fields. Fuzz testing of the KCP handling code.

    *   **Inject Fake KCP Packets [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** An attacker injects KCP packets that appear to be legitimate but are not authorized. This requires bypassing any authentication or session management mechanisms used by `et` for KCP.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (If authentication is robust) to High (If weak or absent)
        *   **Impact:** High (Can lead to unauthorized actions and game state manipulation)
        *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires bypassing authentication)
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced (Requires understanding of authentication mechanisms)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (If authentication is bypassed, the traffic may look legitimate)
        *   **Mitigation:** Strong authentication and session management for KCP connections.  Consider using cryptographic signatures for KCP packets.

*   **WebSocket Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **Send Malformed WebSocket Messages [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** An attacker sends WebSocket messages that violate the WebSocket protocol specification (RFC 6455). This could include invalid framing, incorrect opcodes, or oversized payloads.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
        *   **Impact:** High (Can lead to server-side errors, crashes, or potentially code execution)
        *   **Effort:** Low (Fuzzing tools are readily available)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:** Strict adherence to the WebSocket protocol specification.  Robust input validation of all WebSocket frames and message payloads. Fuzz testing.

*   **Message Handling Vulnerabilities (Protobuf) [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **Send Malformed Protobuf Messages [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** An attacker sends Protobuf messages that are syntactically valid (according to the .proto schema) but contain semantically incorrect or malicious data. This exploits weaknesses in the application's handling of Protobuf data *after* deserialization.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (If `et` relies solely on Protobuf schema validation)
        *   **Impact:** High (Can lead to logic errors and game state manipulation)
        *   **Effort:** Low (Fuzzing tools can generate malformed Protobuf messages)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Requires understanding of Protobuf and fuzzing)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires application-level logging and monitoring)
        *   **Mitigation:**  Application-level validation of all Protobuf data *after* deserialization.  Don't rely solely on the schema.  Implement checks for data ranges, consistency, and expected values. Fuzz testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Hot Reloading](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_hot_reloading.md)

This feature, while convenient for development, introduces a significant security risk if not implemented carefully.

*   **Inject Malicious Code During Hot Reload [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** An attacker replaces legitimate code with malicious code during a hot reload operation. This bypasses any security checks that might be in place during normal deployment.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (If code signing is used) to High (If no security measures)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete server compromise)
    *   **Effort:** Medium (If code signing is bypassed) to Very High (If no security)
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced (Requires bypassing security mechanisms)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (If successful, the attacker has full control)
    *   **Mitigation:**  Code signing and verification for all hot-reloaded code.  Restricted execution environment (sandboxing) for hot-reloaded code.  Auditing of all hot-reloading events.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using et (Focus: Denial of Service)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_et__focus_denial_of_service_.md)

Denial of Service attacks are generally easier to execute and have a high likelihood of success.

*   **Exploit Network Communication [HIGH RISK]**
    *   This includes all the network-based attacks mentioned above (KCP, WebSocket, Protobuf), but with the goal of causing a denial of service rather than game state manipulation or code execution.  Flooding attacks are particularly relevant here.
    *   **Mitigation:** Rate limiting on network connections and message processing.  Resource limits (e.g., connection timeouts, buffer sizes).  Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS).
