## Mitigation Strategy: [Configuration Validation (et-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/configuration_validation__et-specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Configuration Validation (et-Specific)

**Description:**
1.  **Define an `et`-Specific Configuration Struct:** Create a Go struct that *specifically* represents the configuration options used by the `et` library. This might be a subset of a larger configuration struct, or it might be a separate struct entirely. Include fields for all `et`-specific parameters, such as those related to connection, TLS, authentication, and any custom options provided by `et`.
2.  **Implement `et`-Specific Validation:** Use a validation library (e.g., `go-playground/validator`) or custom validation functions to add validation tags/logic to the `et`-specific configuration struct. Focus on validating parameters that are directly passed to `et`.
    *   **Endpoint URLs:** Validate that endpoints are valid URLs (scheme, host, port).
    *   **TLS Settings:** Validate paths to certificate and key files (existence, permissions), and ensure that TLS is enabled if required.
    *   **Authentication Credentials:** Validate the format and strength of credentials (if applicable).
    *   **`et`-Specific Options:** Validate any custom configuration options provided by the `et` library, ensuring they are within acceptable ranges or formats.
3.  **Validate Before `et` Initialization:** *Before* initializing or using any `et` functions, validate the `et`-specific configuration struct.
4.  **Handle Validation Errors:** If validation fails, log the errors securely and prevent the application from using `et` with the invalid configuration.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Improper Etcd Cluster Configuration (via `et`) (Severity: High):** Prevents misconfigurations that are directly passed to the `et` library, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or insecure communication with etcd.

**Impact:**
*   **Improper Etcd Cluster Configuration:** Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring that only valid configurations are used with the `et` library.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   **[PROJECT SPECIFIC]:** e.g., "Partially implemented. Basic URL validation is done, but TLS settings and `et`-specific options are not validated."

**Missing Implementation:**
*   **[PROJECT SPECIFIC]:** e.g., "Missing validation for TLS certificate paths, key paths, and `et`-specific timeout settings within the `etConfig` struct in `etcd_client.go`."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Defaults Enforcement (et-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_defaults_enforcement__et-specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Defaults Enforcement (et-Specific)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify All `et` Configuration Options:** Thoroughly examine the `et` library's documentation and code to identify *all* configurable parameters that it uses, including those with default values.
2.  **Define Secure Defaults for `et`:** For each `et`-specific parameter, determine a secure default value. Prioritize security over convenience.  Focus on:
    *   Enabling TLS by default.
    *   Requiring client certificate authentication by default.
    *   Setting reasonable timeouts (not too long, not too short) by default.
3.  **Explicitly Set `et` Defaults:** In your application code, *before* initializing or using the `et` library, explicitly set these secure defaults for all `et`-specific parameters.  Do *not* rely on `et`'s built-in defaults without verifying them.  This overrides any potentially insecure defaults within `et`.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Improper Etcd Cluster Configuration (via `et`) (Severity: High):** Ensures that even if the user provides an incomplete configuration to the parts of the application that use `et`, secure defaults are used for the `et` library, reducing the risk of accidental misconfiguration.

**Impact:**
*   **Improper Etcd Cluster Configuration:** Significantly reduces the risk, especially if users are unaware of all the security implications of `et`'s configuration options.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   **[PROJECT SPECIFIC]:** e.g., "Not implemented. The application relies on `et`'s default settings without explicitly setting secure defaults for `et`-specific parameters."

**Missing Implementation:**
*   **[PROJECT SPECIFIC]:** e.g., "Secure defaults need to be defined and explicitly set for all relevant `et` configuration parameters before initializing the `et` client in `etcd_client.go`."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Comprehensive Error Handling (et-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/comprehensive_error_handling__et-specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Comprehensive Error Handling (et-Specific)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify All `et` Function Calls:** Identify all places in your code where you call functions from the `et` library.
2.  **Check for Errors Returned by `et`:** After *every* call to an `et` function, check the returned error value. Do not assume that `et` operations will always succeed.
3.  **Handle `et`-Specific Errors:** Use `errors.Is` or `errors.As` (in Go) to check for specific error types that might be returned by `et` or that `et` might wrap from the underlying etcd client. Handle these errors appropriately:
    *   **Connection Errors (from `et`):** Implement retry logic with exponential backoff (up to a limit) if `et` reports connection problems.
    *   **Authentication Errors (from `et`):** Log securely and take corrective action (e.g., terminate, re-authenticate if possible).
    *   **`et`-Specific Errors:** Handle any errors specific to the `et` library's functionality (e.g., errors related to its cluster management features).
4.  **Secure Logging:** Log errors securely, without exposing sensitive information.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Improper Error Handling with `et` (Severity: Medium):** Prevents application instability, information leaks, and potential denial-of-service due to unhandled errors returned by the `et` library.

**Impact:**
*   **Improper Error Handling:** Significantly improves the application's robustness and resilience to errors originating from the `et` library.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   **[PROJECT SPECIFIC]:** e.g., "Partially implemented. Basic error checking is done, but specific `et` error types are not always handled, and retry logic is missing."

**Missing Implementation:**
*   **[PROJECT SPECIFIC]:** e.g., "Need to implement specific error handling for different error types returned by `et` and implement retry logic with exponential backoff for connection errors reported by `et` in `etcd_client.go`."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Key and Value Sanitization (et Input)](./mitigation_strategies/key_and_value_sanitization__et_input_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Key and Value Sanitization (et Input)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Input to `et`:** Identify all places where data (especially user-provided data) is used to construct keys or values that are *passed to functions in the `et` library*.
2.  **Define Allowed Characters for Keys (for `et`):** Define a strict whitelist of allowed characters for etcd keys, considering any restrictions imposed by `et` or your application's key structure.
3.  **Implement Sanitization Functions (for `et` Input):** Create functions to sanitize input *before* it's used in calls to `et`. These functions should:
    *   Remove or replace disallowed characters.
    *   Enforce length limits.
    *   Validate the format of the input, if applicable.
4.  **Apply Sanitization Before `et` Calls:** *Always* call the sanitization functions before using any data as input to `et` functions that interact with etcd (e.g., setting keys, getting values).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Injection Attacks (Indirectly via `et`) (Severity: Medium):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious characters or patterns into etcd keys or values *through the `et` library*, which could lead to unauthorized access or data modification.

**Impact:**
*   **Injection Attacks:** Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring that only safe and validated data is passed as input to `et` functions.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   **[PROJECT SPECIFIC]:** e.g., "Not implemented. Data is passed directly to `et` functions without sanitization."

**Missing Implementation:**
*   **[PROJECT SPECIFIC]:** e.g., "Need to implement sanitization functions for keys and values and apply them consistently before any calls to `et` functions that take keys or values as input, specifically in `data_access.go`."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong TLS and Certificate Validation (et Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/strong_tls_and_certificate_validation__et_configuration_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Strong TLS and Certificate Validation (et Configuration)

**Description:**
1.  **Use TLS 1.3 (or Latest) with `et`:** Configure the `et` library to use TLS 1.3 (or the latest secure version supported by both `et` and the etcd server).  Ensure this is done through `et`'s configuration mechanisms.
2.  **Disable Weak Ciphers (via `et` Config):** Explicitly disable weak or outdated ciphers and protocols in the `et` library's configuration. Use a well-vetted list of strong ciphers.  This should be done through the configuration options provided by `et`.
3.  **Require Client Certificates (via `et` Config):** Configure `et` to require client certificate authentication, if supported. This adds an extra layer of security.
4.  **Validate Server Certificate (Enforced by `et`):** Ensure that the `et` library is configured to *always* validate the etcd server's TLS certificate. Do *not* disable certificate verification through any `et` settings.
5.  **Use Trusted CA (with `et`):** If possible, use a trusted CA, and configure `et` to use this CA for certificate validation.
6.  **Self-Signed Certificates (Testing, with `et`):** If using self-signed certificates for testing, configure `et` to trust the specific self-signed certificate or its CA certificate, using `et`'s configuration options.
7.  **Certificate Pinning (If Supported by `et`):** If the `et` library supports certificate pinning, consider using it for enhanced security.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from intercepting or modifying communication between the application (via `et`) and the etcd cluster.

**Impact:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring that `et` uses a secure and properly validated TLS connection.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   **[PROJECT SPECIFIC]:** e.g., "Partially implemented. TLS is enabled in the `et` configuration, but weak ciphers are not explicitly disabled, and it's unclear if certificate validation is consistently enforced by `et`."

**Missing Implementation:**
*   **[PROJECT SPECIFIC]:** e.g., "Need to explicitly disable weak ciphers in the `et` configuration.  Verify that `et` is enforcing certificate validation and consider implementing certificate pinning if supported by `et`."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Circuit Breaker (for et calls)](./mitigation_strategies/circuit_breaker__for_et_calls_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Circuit Breaker (for et calls)

**Description:**
1.  **Choose a Circuit Breaker Library:** Select a Go circuit breaker library (e.g., `gobreaker`, `handybreaker`).
2.  **Wrap `et` Function Calls:** Wrap all calls to *functions within the `et` library* that interact with etcd within the circuit breaker. This is crucial; the circuit breaker should protect against failures *originating from `et`*.
3.  **Configure Thresholds:** Configure appropriate thresholds for failure count, timeout, half-open state, and reset timeout.
4.  **Handle Circuit Open State:** Implement logic to handle the case where the circuit breaker is open (indicating that `et`'s connection to etcd is likely unavailable).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Improper Error Handling with `et` (Severity: Medium):** Prevents cascading failures if the `et` library is unable to communicate with the etcd cluster. Improves application resilience.

**Impact:**
*   **Improper Error Handling:** Significantly improves the application's ability to handle `et`-related communication failures gracefully.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   **[PROJECT SPECIFIC]:** e.g., "Not implemented. Calls to `et` are not wrapped in a circuit breaker."

**Missing Implementation:**
*   **[PROJECT SPECIFIC]:** e.g., "Need to integrate a circuit breaker library and wrap all calls to `et` functions that interact with etcd within the circuit breaker, specifically in `etcd_client.go`."
