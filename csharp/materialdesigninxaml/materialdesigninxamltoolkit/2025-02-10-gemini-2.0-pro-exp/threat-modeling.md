# Threat Model Analysis for materialdesigninxaml/materialdesigninxamltoolkit

## Threat: [Resource Dictionary Tampering Affecting Dialogs](./threats/resource_dictionary_tampering_affecting_dialogs.md)

*   **Threat:** Resource Dictionary Tampering Affecting Dialogs

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the application's resource files and modifies the Resource Dictionaries used by MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit's `DialogHost`. They alter the appearance and behavior of dialogs, potentially hiding crucial warnings, adding misleading information, or changing button actions. This directly exploits how the library handles dialog presentation.
    *   **Impact:** Users could be misled into making incorrect decisions, granting unintended permissions, or disclosing sensitive information. The attacker could bypass security checks presented in dialogs.
    *   **Affected Component:** `DialogHost` and its associated `ResourceDictionary` entries, particularly those defining the styles and templates for dialog content and buttons. The library's mechanism for loading and applying these resources is the direct attack vector.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **File System Security:**  Strongly protect the application's resource files from unauthorized access and modification.
        *   **Resource Integrity Checks:**  Implement checksums or digital signatures to verify the integrity of the Resource Dictionaries used by `DialogHost`.
        *   **Embedded Resources:**  Embed the relevant Resource Dictionaries directly into the application assembly.
        *   **Code Review:** Carefully review any code that dynamically loads or modifies Resource Dictionaries at runtime.

## Threat: [Dependency Hijacking of a MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit Dependency](./threats/dependency_hijacking_of_a_materialdesigninxamltoolkit_dependency.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Hijacking of a MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit Dependency

    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises a library that MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit depends on (either directly or transitively). They inject malicious code into the compromised dependency. Because MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit *directly* uses this dependency, the malicious code is executed when the application using the toolkit runs. This is a direct threat because the vulnerability exists within the library's dependency chain.
    *   **Impact:** Wide-ranging, potentially including arbitrary code execution, data theft, system compromise, and UI manipulation. The attacker gains control over aspects of the application's behavior, leveraging the compromised dependency *through* MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any component within MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit that relies on the compromised dependency. This is difficult to pinpoint without knowing the *specific* compromised dependency, but the attack surface is the entire library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use a package manager (like NuGet) with dependency verification features (e.g., signed packages, checksum verification).
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep *all* dependencies, including those of MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit, updated to their latest secure versions.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):** Maintain an SBOM to track all dependencies and their versions, making it easier to identify and address vulnerabilities.
        *   **Vendor Security Alerts:** Subscribe to security alerts from the vendors of all dependencies.
