## Attack Tree Path: [[[Sub-Goal 2: Exfiltrate Sensitive Data]]](./attack_tree_paths/__sub-goal_2_exfiltrate_sensitive_data__.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker's primary objective in this sub-tree is to steal sensitive information displayed or processed by the application, leveraging vulnerabilities within the MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit.
*   **Rationale:** Data exfiltration is a high-impact threat, often leading to financial loss, reputational damage, and legal consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[2.1: Data Binding Exploitation]]](./attack_tree_paths/__2_1_data_binding_exploitation__.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker targets the data binding mechanism of the library, attempting to inject malicious code or manipulate the data displayed to the user.
*   **Rationale:** Data binding is a core feature of WPF and the MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit, making it a potentially broad attack surface. Weaknesses in data binding can lead to severe vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[2.1.1: Injecting Malicious Code via Data Context]]](./attack_tree_paths/__2_1_1_injecting_malicious_code_via_data_context__.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker attempts to inject malicious code (e.g., XAML, potentially containing script) into the data context of a UI element. If the application doesn't properly sanitize data before binding it, this code could be executed.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** High (Arbitrary Code Execution)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** High (Security Expert)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   *Never* bind data from untrusted sources directly to UI elements without thorough sanitization.
    *   Use a whitelist approach for allowed data.
    *   Encode data appropriately before display.
    *   Consider sandboxing for untrusted data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[2.1.2: Manipulating Displayed Data]]](./attack_tree_paths/__2_1_2_manipulating_displayed_data__.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides crafted input that, while not directly executing code, manipulates the data binding process to reveal sensitive information or alter the displayed data in a way that benefits the attacker.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium (Experienced Developer)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Validate data *before* it is bound to the UI.
    *   Ensure data binding expressions are secure and cannot be manipulated.
    *   Use strong typing; avoid dynamic data binding where possible.

## Attack Tree Path: [[2.2: Style/Template Injection]](./attack_tree_paths/_2_2_styletemplate_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker attempts to inject malicious styles or templates to alter the appearance or behavior of the UI.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[2.2.2: Injecting Malicious XAML into Resources]]](./attack_tree_paths/__2_2_2_injecting_malicious_xaml_into_resources__.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker injects malicious XAML code into resources (e.g., resource dictionaries) loaded by the application. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code or modify the UI in unexpected ways.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** High (Arbitrary Code Execution)
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** High (Security Expert)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   *Never* load XAML resources from untrusted sources.
    *   Use a secure XAML parser and validate against a strict schema if dynamic loading is unavoidable.
    *   Consider sandboxing for untrusted XAML.
