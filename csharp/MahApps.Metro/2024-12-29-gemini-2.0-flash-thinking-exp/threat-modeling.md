Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve MahApps.Metro:

* **Threat:** Malicious Theme Injection
    * **Description:** An attacker could craft a malicious theme file containing embedded scripts or resources. When the application loads this theme (if it allows user-defined themes), the malicious code could execute, potentially gaining access to system resources or sensitive data.
    * **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code, theft of sensitive information, manipulation of the application's behavior, or even system compromise.
    * **Affected Component:** Theme loading mechanism, potentially the `ThemeManager` class or related functions responsible for loading and applying theme resources.
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Restrict theme loading to built-in or trusted sources only.
        * Implement strict validation and sanitization of theme files before loading them.
        * Consider code signing for themes to ensure their integrity and origin.
        * Run the application with the least necessary privileges.

* **Threat:** Custom Control Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:** MahApps.Metro provides custom UI controls. If these controls contain security flaws (e.g., input validation issues, logic errors), an attacker could exploit them by providing crafted input or interacting with the controls in unexpected ways.
    * **Impact:** Unexpected application behavior, crashes, potential for information disclosure, or in some cases, arbitrary code execution if vulnerabilities are severe enough.
    * **Affected Component:** Specific custom controls provided by MahApps.Metro (e.g., `MetroWindow`, `Flyout`, `Dialog`).
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly test the application's usage of MahApps.Metro's custom controls, especially when handling user input.
        * Stay updated with MahApps.Metro releases, as they may contain fixes for security vulnerabilities in these controls.
        * Consider implementing additional input validation and sanitization layers within the application logic when interacting with these controls.
