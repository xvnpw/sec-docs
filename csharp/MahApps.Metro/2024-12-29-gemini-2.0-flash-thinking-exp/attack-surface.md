* **XAML Injection through Data Binding:**
    * **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious XAML markup into UI elements by manipulating data that is bound to MahApps.Metro controls. This can lead to unexpected UI behavior, information disclosure, or even code execution if the injected XAML contains malicious markup extensions or event handlers.
    * **How MahApps.Metro Contributes:** MahApps.Metro controls often utilize data binding for dynamic content display. If developers don't properly sanitize or encode data before binding it to properties like `ToolTip`, `Header`, or custom control properties, it becomes vulnerable to XAML injection.
    * **Example:** An application displays a user's name in a `Flyout` header using data binding. If an attacker can change their username to include XAML like `<Button Click="System.Diagnostics.Process.Start('calc.exe')"/>`, opening the flyout could execute the calculator.
    * **Impact:**  Potentially critical, ranging from UI disruption and information disclosure to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * **Sanitize User Input:**  Always sanitize or encode user-provided data before using it in XAML bindings. Use appropriate encoding techniques to prevent XAML interpretation of malicious characters.
            * **Avoid Binding Untrusted Data Directly:**  Minimize direct binding of untrusted data to UI elements. If necessary, use value converters to sanitize or transform the data.

* **Malicious Resource Dictionaries:**
    * **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious XAML code by providing crafted resource dictionaries that are loaded by the application. This can be achieved if the application allows loading external or user-defined themes or styles.
    * **How MahApps.Metro Contributes:** MahApps.Metro heavily relies on resource dictionaries for theming and styling. If the application allows loading external resource dictionaries without proper validation, a malicious actor can inject XAML containing arbitrary code execution payloads.
    * **Example:** An application allows users to customize the theme by loading a `.xaml` file. A malicious user provides a file containing a resource dictionary with an event handler that executes a malicious script when the dictionary is loaded.
    * **Impact:** Critical, as it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the application.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * **Restrict Resource Dictionary Sources:**  Limit the sources from which resource dictionaries can be loaded. Ideally, only use internally bundled and trusted resources.
            * **Validate Resource Dictionary Content:** If external resource dictionaries are necessary, implement strict validation to ensure they don't contain potentially harmful XAML constructs.
            * **Code Signing:** Sign resource dictionary files to ensure their integrity and authenticity.
