# Threat Model Analysis for quartznet/quartznet

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Job Data](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_job_data.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the JobStore (database, RAM, etc.) by exploiting weak access controls, misconfigurations, or vulnerabilities in the underlying storage system. They might use SQL injection, compromised credentials, or network vulnerabilities to access the stored job data.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach of sensitive job data, including job details, trigger configurations, and potentially business-critical information.  Attackers can learn about scheduled tasks and potentially sensitive operations.
*   **Quartz.NET Component Affected:** JobStore (Database, RAM, etc.)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for JobStore access.
    *   Use principle of least privilege for database accounts.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data stored in the JobStore (if applicable and supported by the JobStore).
    *   Secure the network access to the JobStore (e.g., firewalls, network segmentation).
    *   Regularly audit JobStore access logs.

## Threat: [Job Data Tampering](./threats/job_data_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, having gained unauthorized access to the JobStore, modifies job data, trigger configurations, or job details. They could directly manipulate database records or configuration files to alter job behavior.
*   **Impact:** Integrity compromise of scheduled tasks. Jobs might execute with incorrect parameters, at wrong times, or perform unintended actions, leading to business logic errors, data corruption, or system instability.
*   **Quartz.NET Component Affected:** JobStore (Database, RAM, etc.)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for JobStore access.
    *   Use principle of least privilege for database accounts.
    *   Implement data validation and integrity checks on job data retrieved from the JobStore.
    *   Consider using digital signatures or checksums to detect data tampering.
    *   Regularly audit JobStore modification logs.

## Threat: [Job Data Injection (Deserialization Vulnerabilities)](./threats/job_data_injection__deserialization_vulnerabilities_.md)

*   **Description:** If using serialized job data in custom JobStores (especially older implementations), an attacker exploits deserialization vulnerabilities by injecting malicious serialized objects into the JobStore. When Quartz.NET deserializes this data, it executes attacker-controlled code.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application server. Arbitrary code execution allows attackers to gain full control of the system, steal data, install malware, or disrupt services.
*   **Quartz.NET Component Affected:** Custom JobStores using serialization/deserialization, potentially `AdoJobStore` if custom serialization is used.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid using serialization for job data storage if possible.
    *   If serialization is necessary, use secure serialization methods and libraries.
    *   Regularly update .NET Framework and libraries to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization for any data being deserialized.
    *   Consider using code access security or sandboxing to limit the impact of deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Malicious Job Execution](./threats/malicious_job_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious job classes or configurations into the application. This could be through dynamic job loading mechanisms, configuration file manipulation, or vulnerabilities in application logic that handles job registration. When triggered by Quartz.NET, these malicious jobs execute attacker-controlled code.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application server. Arbitrary code execution allows attackers to gain full control of the system, steal data, install malware, or disrupt services.
*   **Quartz.NET Component Affected:** Job Scheduling, Job Execution, potentially custom JobFactories.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly control and validate all sources of job definitions and configurations.
    *   Avoid dynamic loading of job classes from untrusted sources.
    *   Implement strong input validation and sanitization for job parameters and configurations.
    *   Use code reviews and security testing for job implementations.
    *   Apply principle of least privilege for job execution permissions.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Scheduler Access](./threats/unauthorized_scheduler_access.md)

*   **Description:** The Quartz.NET scheduler API or management interfaces (e.g., remoting, custom APIs) are exposed without proper authentication and authorization. Attackers can gain control over the scheduler and manipulate jobs and triggers.
*   **Impact:** Integrity and availability impact. Attackers can disrupt scheduled tasks, modify job behavior, or completely disable the scheduler, leading to service disruption and potential data manipulation.
*   **Quartz.NET Component Affected:** Scheduler API, Remoting (if enabled), Management Interfaces.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for scheduler API and management interfaces.
    *   Disable or secure Quartz.NET remoting if not needed or if exposed externally.
    *   Use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) for scheduler API access.
    *   Restrict access to scheduler management interfaces to authorized administrators only.
    *   Regularly audit scheduler access logs.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Scheduler Manipulation](./threats/denial_of_service_through_scheduler_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers with unauthorized scheduler access intentionally disrupt application functionality by pausing the scheduler, deleting critical jobs, or scheduling a large number of no-op jobs to overload the system.
*   **Impact:** Availability impact. Scheduled tasks are disrupted, critical business processes are interrupted, and the application's functionality is impaired.
*   **Quartz.NET Component Affected:** Scheduler, Job Scheduling, Trigger Management.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for scheduler access (as mentioned in "Unauthorized Scheduler Access").
    *   Monitor scheduler health and job execution status.
    *   Implement alerting for unexpected scheduler state changes or job failures.
    *   Implement backup and recovery procedures for scheduler configuration and job definitions.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Quartz.NET Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_quartz_net_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Quartz.NET relies on external libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited through Quartz.NET if not properly managed.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability. Could range from information disclosure to remote code execution, depending on the affected dependency and the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Quartz.NET Component Affected:** Dependencies (e.g., Common.Logging, System.Data).
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be High to Critical depending on the dependency vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Quartz.NET and all its dependencies to the latest versions.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for Quartz.NET dependencies.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerable dependencies.
    *   Implement a patch management process to quickly address identified vulnerabilities.
