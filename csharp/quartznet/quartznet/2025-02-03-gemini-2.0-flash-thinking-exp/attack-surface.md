# Attack Surface Analysis for quartznet/quartznet

## Attack Surface: [1. Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Job Data](./attack_surfaces/1__deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_job_data.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of insecure deserialization processes to execute arbitrary code or cause other malicious actions when Quartz.NET deserializes job data.
*   **Quartz.NET Contribution:** Quartz.NET serializes and deserializes `JobDataMap` when storing and retrieving jobs, especially when using persistent JobStores. This process becomes a vulnerability point if the serialized data originates from untrusted sources.
*   **Example:** An attacker modifies a serialized `JobDataMap` stored in a database to include malicious code. When Quartz.NET retrieves and deserializes this data to execute the job, the malicious code is executed on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data breach, denial of service, system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid deserializing untrusted data.
    *   Use secure serialization formats like JSON over binary serialization.
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization of job data.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege to Quartz.NET processes.
    *   Regularly update Quartz.NET and related libraries.

## Attack Surface: [2. SQL Injection in JobStore Queries (Database-backed JobStores)](./attack_surfaces/2__sql_injection_in_jobstore_queries__database-backed_jobstores_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities in queries generated by Quartz.NET when using database-backed JobStores.
*   **Quartz.NET Contribution:** Quartz.NET dynamically constructs SQL queries to interact with the database for job scheduling and management when using `AdoJobStore`. Improper handling of input parameters in these queries can lead to SQL injection.
*   **Example:** An attacker manipulates input parameters (e.g., job group or job name if exposed through an API) used in Quartz.NET's SQL queries. By injecting malicious SQL code, they could bypass authentication, extract sensitive data, modify job schedules, or execute database commands.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access, denial of service, potential database compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege for database access for the Quartz.NET user.
    *   Validate and sanitize any input that influences Quartz.NET's database queries.
    *   Conduct regular security audits and code reviews of database interactions.
    *   Regularly update Quartz.NET and database drivers.

## Attack Surface: [3. Malicious Job Code Execution](./attack_surfaces/3__malicious_job_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Execution of malicious code injected as part of a Quartz.NET job, leading to system compromise or unauthorized actions.
*   **Quartz.NET Contribution:** Quartz.NET is designed to execute code within Jobs. If the application allows dynamic job registration or loads job code from untrusted sources, it can be exploited to execute malicious code through Quartz.NET's scheduling mechanism.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the job registration mechanism and registers a malicious job that, when triggered by Quartz.NET, executes commands to steal data, create backdoors, or disrupt services.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), system compromise, data breach, denial of service, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict control over job registration with strong authentication and authorization.
    *   Perform thorough code review and security scanning for all job implementations.
    *   Load job code only from trusted and verified sources.
    *   Consider sandboxing or isolation for job execution environments.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege for job execution processes.

## Attack Surface: [4. Insecure Job Data Handling within Jobs leading to Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/4__insecure_job_data_handling_within_jobs_leading_to_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Injection vulnerabilities arising from insecure handling of job data *within* the job's execution logic, even if Quartz.NET itself is secure. This is a vulnerability in *how jobs are implemented* but directly uses data provided by Quartz.NET.
*   **Quartz.NET Contribution:** Quartz.NET provides `JobDataMap` to pass data to jobs. If jobs use this data to construct dynamic commands, queries, or scripts without proper sanitization, it can lead to injection vulnerabilities within the job's execution context, triggered by data passed via Quartz.NET.
*   **Example:** A job receives a filename from `JobDataMap` and uses it to construct an operating system command without sanitizing it. An attacker could manipulate the filename in the `JobDataMap` to inject malicious commands that are executed by the job's process when triggered by Quartz.NET.
*   **Impact:** Command Injection, SQL Injection (within job context), LDAP Injection, other injection vulnerabilities, leading to data breach, system compromise, or unauthorized actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Treat job data from `JobDataMap` as untrusted input.
    *   Avoid dynamic command/query construction within jobs based on job data.
    *   Implement robust input validation and output encoding within job code.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege for job execution processes.
    *   Conduct code review and security testing specifically for job logic and data handling.
