## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Job Data Serialization](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_job_data_serialization.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Restrict Job Data Serialization

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Job Data Usage:** Review all Quartz.NET jobs and identify where `JobDataMap` is used.
2.  **Analyze Data Types:** For each usage, analyze the types of objects being stored in `JobDataMap`.
3.  **Simplify Data Types:**  Refactor jobs to use simple data types (strings, numbers, enums) whenever possible instead of complex, serialized objects within `JobDataMap`.
4.  **Validate Deserialized Data:** If serialization is unavoidable within `JobDataMap`, implement robust input validation within job execution logic after retrieving data. Validate data type, format, and expected values.
5.  **Consider JSON Serialization:** If complex data needs to be passed via `JobDataMap`, evaluate using JSON serialization with a predefined schema and strict parsing instead of binary serialization.

**Threats Mitigated:**
