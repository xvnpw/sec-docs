# Attack Surface Analysis for quartznet/quartznet

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization of Job Data](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization_of_job_data.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from the deserialization of untrusted data within Quartz.NET's job data handling, potentially leading to remote code execution.
*   **Quartz.NET Contribution:** Quartz.NET serializes and deserializes `JobDataMap` when storing and retrieving job details. Using insecure serialization methods or allowing arbitrary object types in `JobDataMap` directly introduces deserialization risks within the Quartz.NET framework.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized .NET object and injects it into the `JobDataMap` of a scheduled job (e.g., through a vulnerable application endpoint that allows job data modification). When Quartz.NET deserializes this data during job execution, it triggers remote code execution on the server running the Quartz.NET scheduler.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Data Breach, System Compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Binary Formatters:**  Completely avoid using insecure binary formatters like `BinaryFormatter` for serialization within Quartz.NET job data.
    *   **Restrict Data Types in JobDataMap:** Strictly limit the types of objects stored in `JobDataMap` to simple, safe, and well-defined types (strings, numbers, primitives). Do not allow storage of complex objects or code that could be exploited during deserialization.
    *   **Use JSON or XML Serialization with Type Control:** If serialization is necessary, prefer safer alternatives like JSON.NET or XML serialization, configured with strict type handling and validation to prevent deserialization of unexpected or malicious types.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize any data before placing it into the `JobDataMap`, especially if it originates from external sources or user input, even if using safer serialization methods.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection in Database Job Stores](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_in_database_job_stores.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities within Quartz.NET's `AdoJobStore` component, allowing attackers to manipulate database queries used by Quartz.NET.
*   **Quartz.NET Contribution:** Quartz.NET's `AdoJobStore` directly executes SQL queries to manage job scheduling data in a database. If these queries are constructed without proper parameterization within the `AdoJobStore` implementation or configuration, they become vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in an application interface that indirectly influences job parameters stored in the database via Quartz.NET. If `AdoJobStore` uses these parameters in dynamically constructed SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization, the attacker can inject malicious SQL code. This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification of job schedules, or even database server compromise through Quartz.NET's database interactions.
*   **Impact:** Data Breach, Data Modification, Denial of Service, Database Server Compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Ensure Parameterized Queries in AdoJobStore Configuration:** Verify that the database provider and connection configuration for `AdoJobStore` are correctly set up to utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements by default. Consult the Quartz.NET documentation for your specific database provider to ensure secure configuration.
    *   **Database Input Validation (Defense in Depth):** While parameterization is the primary defense, implement input validation on data that is used in job parameters and eventually stored and retrieved by `AdoJobStore` as a secondary defense layer.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Database User:**  Grant the database user used by Quartz.NET's `AdoJobStore` only the minimum necessary permissions required for its operation (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` on Quartz.NET tables). Avoid granting excessive privileges that could be exploited in case of SQL injection.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Updates:** Conduct regular security audits of the database configuration and Quartz.NET setup to ensure secure database interactions. Keep Quartz.NET and database drivers updated to patch any potential vulnerabilities in these components.

## Attack Surface: [Job Trigger Manipulation via Exposed Interfaces (Indirectly via Application)](./attack_surfaces/job_trigger_manipulation_via_exposed_interfaces__indirectly_via_application_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in application interfaces that expose Quartz.NET's job trigger management functionalities, allowing unauthorized modification of job schedules. While the interface is application-specific, the underlying functionality being manipulated is within Quartz.NET.
*   **Quartz.NET Contribution:** Quartz.NET provides the core functionality for managing and modifying job triggers. If an application exposes these functionalities through its own interfaces without adequate security, it indirectly creates an attack surface related to Quartz.NET's scheduling capabilities.
*   **Example:** An administrative panel in the application allows users to modify job schedules by interacting with Quartz.NET's scheduler API. If this panel lacks proper authentication, authorization, or input validation, an attacker could gain unauthorized access and manipulate job triggers. This could lead to disruption of critical processes by delaying or deleting jobs, or by scheduling malicious jobs to execute at specific times through the exposed Quartz.NET functionality.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, Unauthorized Job Execution, Business Logic Disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (due to potential for significant business disruption)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Authentication and Authorization for Job Management Interfaces:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for all application interfaces that expose Quartz.NET's job management features. Ensure only authorized administrators or roles can access and modify job triggers.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization on Trigger Modifications:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided data used to modify job triggers through application interfaces. Prevent injection of malicious data that could manipulate scheduling logic or cause unexpected behavior in Quartz.NET.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for User Roles:** Implement role-based access control within the application and grant users only the necessary permissions to manage job triggers based on their roles and responsibilities. Restrict access to sensitive scheduling operations to the most privileged roles.
    *   **Audit Logging of Trigger Modifications:** Implement comprehensive audit logging for all modifications to job triggers performed through application interfaces. Track who made changes, when, and what changes were made to enable monitoring and detection of suspicious activities.
