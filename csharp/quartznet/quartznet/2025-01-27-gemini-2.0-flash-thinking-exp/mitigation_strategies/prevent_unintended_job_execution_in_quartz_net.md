        *   Requires a proactive and regular review process to identify and remove unused jobs.
        *   Accidental removal of necessary jobs can lead to application malfunctions.
        *   May require coordination with business stakeholders to determine job usage and necessity.
    *   **Implementation Considerations:**
        *   Establish a periodic review process for Quartz.NET jobs (e.g., quarterly or annually).
        *   Define criteria for identifying unused jobs (e.g., last execution time, business requirements).
        *   Implement a process for disabling jobs before permanently removing them to allow for potential rollback.
        *   Document the rationale for disabling or removing jobs for audit purposes.
        *   Communicate job removal plans to relevant stakeholders.
