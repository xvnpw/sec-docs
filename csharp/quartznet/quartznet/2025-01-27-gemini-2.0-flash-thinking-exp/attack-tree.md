        *   **Impact:** Critical (Full database access, compromise of job data and potentially application data)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected through failed login attempts, but may be missed if brute-force is slow or distributed)

*   **Critical Node: Insecure Connection String Storage**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Retrieve Connection String from Config Files/Environment
        *   **Action:** Attacker attempts to retrieve the database connection string from configuration files, environment variables, or other easily accessible locations where it is stored in plain text or weakly protected.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Critical (Direct access to database using retrieved credentials)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Can be detected through static code analysis and configuration reviews)

*   **Critical Node: Inject Malicious Input into JobDataMap**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Inject Malicious Input into JobDataMap
        *   **Action:** Attacker injects malicious input into the `JobDataMap` or other job parameters that are later used in job logic to construct and execute system commands.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Critical (Arbitrary command execution on the server)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Requires deep code analysis and runtime monitoring of job execution)

*   **Critical Node: Craft Input to Execute Arbitrary Commands on Server**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Craft Input to Execute Arbitrary Commands on Server
        *   **Action:** Attacker crafts specific input to exploit the command injection vulnerability, aiming to execute arbitrary commands on the server's operating system.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (If command injection vulnerability exists)
        *   **Impact:** Critical (Full system compromise, data breach, denial of service)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low

*   **Critical Node: Execute Malicious SQL Queries via Job**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Execute Malicious SQL Queries via Job
        *   **Action:** Attacker exploits the SQL injection vulnerability to execute malicious SQL queries, potentially gaining access to sensitive data, modifying data, or even taking control of the database server.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (If SQL injection vulnerability exists)
        *   **Impact:** Critical (Database compromise, data breach, data manipulation)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected through database query logs and Web Application Firewalls)

*   **Critical Node: Schedule Numerous Resource-Intensive Jobs at Short Intervals**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Schedule Numerous Resource-Intensive Jobs at Short Intervals
        *   **Action:** Attacker schedules a large number of resource-intensive jobs to run concurrently or at very short intervals, aiming to overload system resources (CPU, memory, database connections).
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (If scheduling functionality is exposed or controllable by the attacker)
        *   **Impact:** High (Application unavailability, performance degradation, service disruption)
