# Threat Model Analysis for quartznet/quartznet

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data](./threats/insecure_storage_of_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the underlying data storage (database, file system, etc.) used by Quartz.NET to persist job data. They could then read sensitive information stored within job details, such as connection strings, API keys, or business-critical data. This could be achieved through exploiting database vulnerabilities, file system access control weaknesses, or gaining access to backup files.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential for data manipulation or deletion, compromise of dependent systems if credentials are exposed.
*   **Affected Quartz.NET Component:** `AdoJobStore`, `RAMJobStore`, `Quartz.Server` (configuration), potentially custom job implementations storing data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Encrypt sensitive data within job details before storage.
    *   Utilize secure persistence mechanisms like properly secured databases with strong access controls.
    *   Implement database security best practices (least privilege, strong authentication, regular patching, network segmentation).
    *   Avoid storing highly sensitive data directly in job details; use secure configuration management or secrets vaults and reference them.
    *   Regularly audit access to the data storage used by Quartz.NET.

## Threat: [SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in Database Persistence (AdoJobStore)](./threats/sql_injection_vulnerabilities_in_database_persistence__adojobstore_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit potential SQL injection vulnerabilities within the database queries executed by Quartz.NET's `AdoJobStore`. While Quartz.NET uses parameterized queries, vulnerabilities might arise from custom extensions, misconfigurations, or undiscovered flaws. An attacker could inject malicious SQL code to read, modify, or delete data in the database, potentially gaining full control.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access to the database, potential for complete database compromise, Denial of Service.
*   **Affected Quartz.NET Component:** `AdoJobStore` module, database interaction functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure using the latest patched version of Quartz.NET.
    *   Thoroughly review and audit any custom database interactions or extensions to Quartz.NET for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Strictly use parameterized queries for all database interactions, including custom job implementations if they access the database directly.
    *   Employ database input validation and sanitization where applicable.
    *   Regularly perform static and dynamic code analysis and penetration testing to identify SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block SQL injection attempts.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Job Data](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_job_data.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could craft malicious serialized objects and inject them into job data. When Quartz.NET deserializes this data (especially when using persistent stores and custom job data types), it could trigger code execution or other unintended consequences due to deserialization vulnerabilities in the .NET framework or custom serialization logic.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), data corruption, privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Quartz.NET Component:** Job serialization/deserialization mechanisms, potentially custom job data handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid storing complex serialized objects in job data if possible. Prefer simple data types.
    *   If serialization is necessary, use secure and vetted serialization libraries and practices.
    *   Regularly update Quartz.NET and the .NET framework to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization for job data to prevent injection of malicious serialized objects.
    *   Consider using data formats like JSON instead of binary serialization where possible, as JSON deserialization is generally less prone to RCE vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Malicious Job Execution](./threats/malicious_job_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker who gains unauthorized access to Quartz.NET configuration or management interfaces could schedule or modify jobs to execute malicious code. This could involve injecting new jobs containing malicious payloads or altering existing jobs to perform harmful actions when triggered. Access could be gained through exploiting weak authentication, configuration vulnerabilities, or insider threats.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data exfiltration, system compromise, Denial of Service (DoS), privilege escalation, disruption of business operations.
*   **Affected Quartz.NET Component:** Scheduler module, job management functions, configuration loading.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing and managing the Quartz.NET scheduler and configuration.
    *   Restrict access to Quartz.NET configuration files and management interfaces to only authorized personnel.
    *   Regularly audit scheduled jobs to ensure they are legitimate and expected. Implement a job approval process if possible.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization for job parameters and configurations to prevent injection of malicious code or commands.
    *   Consider code signing or other mechanisms to verify the integrity and origin of job implementations.
    *   Employ principle of least privilege for Quartz.NET service accounts.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Job Overload](./threats/denial_of_service_through_job_overload.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, or even unintentional misconfiguration, could lead to scheduling a large number of jobs or resource-intensive jobs, overwhelming the system. This could exhaust CPU, memory, or network resources, causing the application or the Quartz.NET scheduler itself to become unresponsive or crash, leading to a Denial of Service.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation, system instability, disruption of scheduled tasks.
*   **Affected Quartz.NET Component:** Scheduler module, job scheduling and execution engine.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting and resource quotas for job scheduling.
    *   Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, network) and set up alerts for unusual resource consumption.
    *   Implement proper job prioritization and concurrency controls within Quartz.NET configuration (e.g., thread pool size, misfire policies).
    *   Regularly review and optimize job schedules to prevent accidental overload.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization for job parameters to prevent resource exhaustion attacks through malicious input (e.g., excessively large file paths, infinite loops in job logic).
    *   Implement circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures due to overloaded jobs.

## Threat: [Job Interference and Manipulation](./threats/job_interference_and_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with unauthorized access to Quartz.NET management interfaces could interfere with legitimate jobs. They could delete or unschedule critical jobs, modify job triggers to delay or prevent execution, or change job details to alter their intended behavior. This could disrupt business processes and application functionality.
*   **Impact:** Disruption of business processes, data integrity issues, application malfunction, financial loss, reputational damage.
*   **Affected Quartz.NET Component:** Scheduler module, job and trigger management functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust authentication and authorization for managing Quartz.NET jobs and triggers.
    *   Audit logging of all job management operations (scheduling, unscheduling, modification, deletion) with sufficient detail.
    *   Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict job management actions to authorized users or roles.
    *   Consider implementing mechanisms to detect and revert unauthorized changes to job schedules or configurations (e.g., configuration backups, version control).
    *   Regularly review audit logs for suspicious job management activities.

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration](./threats/insecure_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfigurations in Quartz.NET settings can create vulnerabilities. Examples include using default or weak credentials, leaving management interfaces exposed without authentication, disabling security features, or using insecure default settings. Attackers could exploit these misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access or compromise the system.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breach, system compromise, Denial of Service, privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Quartz.NET Component:** Configuration loading, scheduler initialization, management interfaces.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow Quartz.NET security best practices and configuration guidelines.
    *   Use strong, unique, and regularly rotated credentials for database connections and any management interfaces.
    *   Securely store and manage Quartz.NET configuration files, protecting them from unauthorized access.
    *   Regularly review and audit Quartz.NET configuration settings for security vulnerabilities using security checklists and automated tools.
    *   Implement the principle of least privilege when configuring access rights for Quartz.NET components and services.
    *   Disable or secure any unnecessary management interfaces or features.
