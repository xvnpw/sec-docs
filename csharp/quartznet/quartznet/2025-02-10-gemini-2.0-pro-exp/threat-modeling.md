# Threat Model Analysis for quartznet/quartznet

## Threat: [Insecure Clustering Configuration](./threats/insecure_clustering_configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Clustering Configuration

    *   **Description:** If using Quartz.NET's clustering features, an attacker exploits a misconfiguration (e.g., weak shared secrets, unencrypted communication between nodes) to join the cluster.  The attacker can then inject malicious jobs, disrupt scheduling, or steal data from the Job Store.  This is a direct threat to Quartz.NET's clustering mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** System compromise, denial of service, data exfiltration, potential for lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Affected Quartz.NET Component:** Clustering features (e.g., `StdSchedulerFactory` with clustering properties, specifically properties like `quartz.scheduler.instanceId`, `quartz.jobStore.clustered`, `quartz.jobStore.clusterCheckinInterval`, and any properties related to the chosen clustering provider), Job Store (shared between cluster nodes).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Clustering Configuration:** Follow Quartz.NET's documentation *precisely* to configure clustering securely. Use strong, randomly generated, and *unique* shared secrets (passwords, salts, etc., depending on the JobStore implementation).  Do *not* use default values.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the network segment where the cluster nodes reside, using firewalls to restrict access.
        *   **Encrypted Communication:** Ensure that communication between cluster nodes is encrypted (e.g., using TLS).  This may require specific configuration within the chosen JobStore and potentially additional libraries.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Periodically review the clustering configuration, especially after any updates or changes to the network environment.  Automated configuration checks are highly recommended.

## Threat: [Unsecured Remote Management Interface](./threats/unsecured_remote_management_interface.md)

*   **Threat:** Unsecured Remote Management Interface

    *   **Description:** If Quartz.NET's remote management features (e.g., JMX, RMI) are enabled *without* proper security, an attacker can connect to the scheduler remotely and control it. This allows the attacker to inject jobs, modify schedules, and potentially gain full control of the application. This is a direct threat to Quartz.NET's optional remote management capabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, remote code execution, data exfiltration.
    *   **Affected Quartz.NET Component:** Remote management interfaces (e.g., JMX, RMI, or any custom remote access implementations), `IScheduler` (remotely accessible methods).  Specifically, configuration properties related to enabling and configuring these interfaces (e.g., properties related to `quartz.scheduler.exporter.*`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable Remote Management (if not needed):** This is the *most secure* option and should be the default unless remote management is absolutely essential.
        *   **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** If remote management is *required*, use strong authentication (e.g., TLS with client certificates, username/password with strong password policies and account lockout mechanisms) and authorization (role-based access control, limiting which users can perform which actions).  This often requires configuration *beyond* Quartz.NET itself (e.g., configuring JMX security).
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the network segment where the remote management interface is accessible, using firewalls to restrict access.
        *   **Firewall Rules:** Restrict access to the remote management port to only authorized IP addresses and networks.  Use a "deny by default" approach.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Quartz.NET Dependency (High/Critical Impact)](./threats/vulnerable_quartz_net_dependency__highcritical_impact_.md)

* **Threat:** Vulnerable Quartz.NET Dependency (High/Critical Impact)

    * **Description:** A *high or critical* severity vulnerability is discovered in Quartz.NET itself or one of its *direct* dependencies (e.g., a logging library it uses internally, a database driver it relies on for a specific JobStore). The vulnerability allows for remote code execution, denial of service, or significant data exfiltration *directly through* the Quartz.NET component. This differs from vulnerabilities in *application-level* dependencies.
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but by definition, it's either High or Critical (e.g., RCE, significant DoS, sensitive data exposure).
    * **Affected Quartz.NET Component:** Potentially any component, depending on the vulnerability. The key is that the vulnerability exists *within* Quartz.NET or a library it *directly* includes and uses, *not* a library the application adds separately.
    * **Risk Severity:** High or Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Regular Updates:** Keep Quartz.NET and all of its *bundled* dependencies up to date with the latest security patches. This is crucial. Monitor the Quartz.NET release notes and security advisories.
        * **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use SCA tools, but be aware that they may not always distinguish between application-level dependencies and those bundled *within* Quartz.NET.  Careful review is needed.
        * **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists specifically for Quartz.NET and its *known, direct* dependencies.  This requires understanding Quartz.NET's dependency tree.
        * **Dependency Pinning (with caution):** Consider pinning specific versions of Quartz.NET's *internal* dependencies if a critical vulnerability is found and a patch is not immediately available.  However, this should be a temporary measure, as it can lead to compatibility issues. Thorough testing is essential.
