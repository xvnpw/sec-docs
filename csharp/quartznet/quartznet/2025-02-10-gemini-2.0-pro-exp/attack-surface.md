# Attack Surface Analysis for quartznet/quartznet

## Attack Surface: [1. Arbitrary Job Type Execution (RCE)](./attack_surfaces/1__arbitrary_job_type_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary .NET code by manipulating the job type that Quartz.NET instantiates and runs. This is the most severe vulnerability.
    *   **How Quartz.NET Contributes:** Quartz.NET uses reflection to create job instances based on type names stored in configuration (database, files). This mechanism, if not secured, allows for arbitrary type instantiation.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies the `QRTZ_JOB_DETAILS` table in the Quartz.NET database, changing the `JOB_CLASS` column for a scheduled job from `MyApplication.SafeJob` to `System.Diagnostics.Process`, then provides malicious arguments via job data to execute arbitrary commands.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker can execute any code with the privileges of the application running Quartz.NET.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Type Whitelisting:** Implement a *hardcoded* whitelist of allowed job types (e.g., an `enum` or a `Dictionary<string, Type>`).  Do *not* allow users to input type names directly.  Use a lookup to map user-friendly names to the whitelisted types.
        *   **Database Security:** Secure the Quartz.NET database.  Use a dedicated, low-privilege database user for Quartz.NET.  Implement strong database access controls.
        *   **Configuration File Protection:** Protect configuration files (e.g., `quartz.config`) with strict file system permissions.  Monitor for unauthorized changes.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate *all* inputs related to job creation and modification, even if using a whitelist.

## Attack Surface: [2. Malicious Job Data Injection](./attack_surfaces/2__malicious_job_data_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious data into the parameters (JobDataMap) of a legitimate, whitelisted job, causing the job's code to behave in an unintended and harmful way.
    *   **How Quartz.NET Contributes:** Quartz.NET provides a mechanism (JobDataMap) to pass data to jobs.  It does not inherently validate this data; the validation responsibility lies with the job's code.
    *   **Example:** A job named `SendEmailJob` (which is whitelisted) takes a `recipient` and `message` parameter.  An attacker injects a malicious `message` containing JavaScript code, leading to a Stored XSS vulnerability if the email content is later displayed in a web interface without proper encoding.  Or, if the `recipient` is used in a database query without parameterization, it could lead to SQL injection.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the job's logic.  Could range from data breaches (SQL injection) to XSS, command injection, or other vulnerabilities within the job's code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on the job's functionality)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Input Validation:** Implement rigorous input validation *within each job* for all data received in the JobDataMap.  Use type-specific validation and consider the context of how the data is used.
        *   **Parameterized Queries:** If the job interacts with a database, *always* use parameterized queries or a safe ORM.
        *   **Safe API Usage:** Avoid using dangerous APIs (like `Process.Start`) with unsanitized job data.
        *   **Output Encoding:** If the job produces output (e.g., for display in a UI), use appropriate contextual output encoding (HTML encoding, URL encoding, etc.).

## Attack Surface: [3. Unauthorized Scheduler Control (via Remote Interfaces)](./attack_surfaces/3__unauthorized_scheduler_control__via_remote_interfaces_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized control of the Quartz.NET scheduler through exposed remote management interfaces (RMI, TCP).
    *   **How Quartz.NET Contributes:** Quartz.NET offers optional remote management capabilities.  If enabled without proper security, these interfaces become attack vectors.
    *   **Example:** An attacker connects to the exposed Quartz.NET RMI port and uses the remote interface to trigger a malicious job, stop critical jobs, or modify job schedules.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, execution of malicious jobs, disruption of legitimate operations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable Remote Interfaces:** If remote management is not *strictly* required, disable it completely in the Quartz.NET configuration.
        *   **Strong Authentication:** If remote management is needed, implement strong authentication (e.g., mutual TLS, strong passwords with proper hashing and salting).
        *   **Authorization:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict which users/clients can perform specific actions on the scheduler.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the scheduler on a separate network segment.
        *   **Firewall Rules:** Restrict access to the remote management ports to only authorized IP addresses/networks.
        *   **TLS/SSL Encryption:** Encrypt all communication with the remote interfaces.
