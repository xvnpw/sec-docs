## Attack Tree Path: [1. Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/1__remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker aims to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Quartz.NET application. This is the most severe outcome, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Quartz.NET, especially when using remoting or certain database providers, relies on serialization and deserialization of objects. If the application doesn't properly validate or sanitize deserialized data (particularly from untrusted sources), an attacker can inject a malicious payload. This payload, when deserialized, can execute arbitrary code within the context of the application. This is a classic .NET deserialization attack, made possible by Quartz.NET's use of serialization.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (depending on configuration and the use of unsafe serialization formats like binary serialization).
*   **Impact:** Very High (Complete system compromise).
*   **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires understanding of serialization and crafting a suitable payload).
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires monitoring for unusual application behavior, crashes, or specific security events related to deserialization).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Use safe serialization formats (e.g., JSON with strict type checking) whenever possible.
    *   Implement strong type validation during deserialization. Use a whitelist of allowed types.
    *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources.
    *   Utilize a `SerializationBinder` to control which types can be deserialized.
    *   Keep Quartz.NET and any serialization libraries up-to-date.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Job Injection](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_job_injection.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker manipulates the application to execute a malicious job. This can be achieved through various means, depending on how the application interacts with Quartz.NET.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Unsafe Job Implementation](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_unsafe_job_implementation.md)

*   **Description:** This isn't a direct vulnerability in Quartz.NET itself, but rather a vulnerability in how the application *uses* Quartz.NET. If the `IJob.Execute()` method of a job implementation contains unsafe code (e.g., executing system commands based on user-supplied input, performing unsafe file operations based on user input, or accessing sensitive resources without proper authorization), an attacker who can trigger this job can achieve RCE. The attacker needs a way to trigger the job (which Quartz.NET provides), but the vulnerability lies in the application's job code.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends entirely on the security practices of the application developers).
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (Depends on the actions performed by the unsafe job).
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (If there's an easily exploitable endpoint, the effort is low; otherwise, it might require more analysis).
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring application and system logs for suspicious activity).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Strictly validate and sanitize *all* input used within `IJob.Execute()`. Never directly execute system commands or perform sensitive operations based on untrusted input.
    *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege. The user account running the Quartz.NET scheduler should have minimal permissions.
    *   Conduct thorough code reviews, specifically focusing on the security of `IJob` implementations.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/2__denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*    **Description:** The attacker aims to make the scheduled tasks, and potentially the entire application, unavailable to legitimate users.
*    **Impact:** Medium to High
*    **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker schedules a large number of resource-intensive jobs (or a single, extremely resource-intensive job) to overwhelm the server's resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network bandwidth). This prevents legitimate jobs from running and can cause the application to become unresponsive or crash.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (Relatively easy to achieve if the application doesn't have resource limits).
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (Application unavailability).
*   **Effort:** Low (Can often be achieved by simply scheduling many jobs).
*   **Skill Level:** Novice.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (High resource usage is usually easily detectable).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on job scheduling. Limit the number and frequency of jobs that can be scheduled.
    *   Monitor resource usage and set alerts for unusual activity.
    *   Use thread pool limits within Quartz.NET to control the maximum number of concurrent jobs.
    *   Consider using a dedicated, scalable infrastructure for Quartz.NET if it handles a large volume of jobs.
