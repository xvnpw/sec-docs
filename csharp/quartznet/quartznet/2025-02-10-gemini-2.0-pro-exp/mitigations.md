# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for quartznet/quartznet

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Job Type Whitelisting (via `IJobFactory`)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_job_type_whitelisting__via__ijobfactory__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create a Custom `IJobFactory`:** Implement a class that implements the `IJobFactory` interface provided by Quartz.NET. This factory will be responsible for creating instances of your `IJob` classes.
    2.  **Hardcode Allowed Job Types:** Within your custom `IJobFactory`, maintain a hardcoded list (e.g., a `Dictionary<string, Type>` or a `switch` statement) of the *only* `IJob` types that are allowed to be instantiated.
    3.  **Reject Unknown Job Types:** In the `NewJob` method of your `IJobFactory`, check if the requested job type (usually identified by a string key or the `TriggerFiredBundle`) is in your allowed list. If not, throw an exception (e.g., `SchedulerException` or a custom exception).  Do *not* attempt to load the type dynamically.
    4.  **Configure Quartz.NET to Use Your Factory:** Configure Quartz.NET to use your custom `IJobFactory`. This is typically done in your Quartz.NET configuration (e.g., `quartz.properties` or programmatically):
        ```
        quartz.scheduler.jobFactory.type = MyNamespace.MyCustomJobFactory, MyAssembly
        ```
    5.  **Remove Default Job Factory (If Necessary):** Ensure that you are *not* using the default Quartz.NET job factory (which might allow dynamic type loading).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintentional or Malicious Job Execution (RCE):** (Severity: Critical) - Prevents attackers from executing arbitrary code by injecting malicious job types *through the scheduler*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unintentional or Malicious Job Execution (RCE):** Risk reduced significantly (from Critical to Low/Negligible, assuming the whitelist is maintained correctly).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Partially implemented. A custom `IJobFactory` exists, but it loads allowed types from a configuration file.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The allowed job types should be hardcoded *within* the `IJobFactory` implementation, removing the dependency on external configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Job Concurrency Limits (via Thread Pool Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/job_concurrency_limits__via_thread_pool_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Job Resource Usage:** Determine the typical resource consumption (CPU, memory) of your different job types.
    2.  **Calculate Appropriate Thread Count:** Based on your server's resources and the resource usage of your jobs, calculate an appropriate value for `quartz.threadPool.threadCount`.  This setting controls the maximum number of jobs that can run concurrently.  Start with a conservative value.
    3.  **Configure Thread Pool:** Configure the thread pool settings in your Quartz.NET configuration (e.g., `quartz.properties` or programmatically):
        ```
        quartz.threadPool.type = Quartz.Simpl.SimpleThreadPool, Quartz
        quartz.threadPool.threadCount = 5  // Example: Limit to 5 concurrent jobs
        quartz.threadPool.threadPriority = Normal
        ```
    4.  **Monitor and Adjust:** Monitor the performance of your Quartz.NET scheduler and your server.  Adjust the `threadCount` as needed to balance performance and resource utilization.  Too low a value can lead to job delays; too high a value can lead to resource exhaustion.
    5. **Consider using [DisallowConcurrentExecution]**: If you have jobs that should never run concurrently, use the `[DisallowConcurrentExecution]` attribute on your `IJob` class. This prevents Quartz.NET from starting a new instance of the job if a previous instance is still running.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Job Scheduling:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents a single malicious job (or a large number of jobs) from consuming all available threads and starving other jobs.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduced significantly (from Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Partially implemented.  `quartz.threadPool.threadCount` is set, but it might be too high for the server's resources. `[DisallowConcurrentExecution]` is not used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The `threadCount` should be reviewed and potentially lowered.  `[DisallowConcurrentExecution]` should be added to appropriate job classes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Deserialization of Job Data (with Type Filtering in ADO.NET JobStore)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_deserialization_of_job_data__with_type_filtering_in_ado_net_jobstore_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Serialized Data:** If you are using the ADO.NET JobStore (or another persistence mechanism that serializes `JobDataMap` contents), determine if any custom objects are being stored in the `JobDataMap`.
    2.  **Prefer Primitive Types:**  Refactor your code to *only* store primitive types (string, int, bool, DateTime, etc.) in the `JobDataMap`. This is the safest approach.
    3.  **Configure Type Filtering (If Necessary):** If storing custom objects is *unavoidable*, and you are using the ADO.NET JobStore, configure Quartz.NET's `UseTypeFiltering` setting and provide a list of allowed types:
        ```
        quartz.serializer.type = json
        quartz.jobStore.type = Quartz.Impl.AdoJobStore.JobStoreTX, Quartz
        quartz.jobStore.useProperties = true
        quartz.jobStore.dataSource = default
        quartz.jobStore.tablePrefix = QRTZ_
        quartz.jobStore.driverDelegateType = Quartz.Impl.AdoJobStore.StdAdoDelegate, Quartz
        # Enable type filtering and specify allowed types
        quartz.jobStore.useTypeFiltering = true
        quartz.jobStore.typeFilter.allowedTypes = MyNamespace.MySafeType1, MyAssembly;MyNamespace.MySafeType2, MyAssembly
        ```
    4.  **Use a Secure Serializer:** Ensure you are using a serializer that supports type filtering, such as the JSON serializer (`quartz.serializer.type = json`). *Never* use `BinaryFormatter`.
    5. **Test Thoroughly:** After making these changes, thoroughly test your application to ensure that job scheduling and execution work correctly and that no unexpected deserialization errors occur.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintentional or Malicious Job Execution (RCE):** (Severity: Critical) - Prevents RCE attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in deserialization of `JobDataMap` contents.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unintentional or Malicious Job Execution (RCE):** Risk reduced significantly (from Critical to Low/Negligible, if implemented correctly).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Not implemented. Custom objects are stored in `JobDataMap`, `BinaryFormatter` is used, and no type filtering is configured.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The code should be refactored to avoid storing custom objects, or `quartz.jobStore.useTypeFiltering` and `quartz.jobStore.typeFilter.allowedTypes` must be configured, and `BinaryFormatter` must be replaced with a secure serializer like `json`.
