# Threat Model Analysis for quartznet/quartznet

## Threat: [Deserialization of Untrusted Job Data](./threats/deserialization_of_untrusted_job_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker might inject malicious serialized data into the job store (e.g., database, XML file) used by Quartz.NET. When Quartz.NET retrieves and deserializes this data to instantiate or manage jobs, the malicious code embedded within the serialized object could execute. This is a direct vulnerability stemming from Quartz.NET's deserialization process.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the application server, including the ability to execute arbitrary commands, steal sensitive data, or disrupt operations. Could lead to data breaches, financial loss, or reputational damage.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Unauthorized Modification of Cron Expressions or Trigger Schedules](./threats/unauthorized_modification_of_cron_expressions_or_trigger_schedules.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the job store or configuration and modifies cron expressions or other trigger schedules. This is a threat directly related to how Quartz.NET manages and persists scheduling information. This could be used to delay critical tasks, cause denial of service by triggering excessive job executions, or schedule malicious jobs to run at specific times.

**Impact:** Disruption of application functionality, denial of service, potential execution of malicious code if a malicious job is scheduled.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Insecure Job Type Loading](./threats/insecure_job_type_loading.md)

**Description:** If the application allows specifying job types via configuration (e.g., a string representing the fully qualified class name), an attacker might be able to manipulate this configuration to load and execute a malicious class. This is a direct consequence of Quartz.NET's mechanism for instantiating jobs based on configuration.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the application server, leading to complete compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Insecure Remote Management Configuration](./threats/insecure_remote_management_configuration.md)

**Description:** If Quartz.NET's remote management features are enabled without proper security measures (e.g., weak passwords, no authentication, unencrypted communication), an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the scheduler and perform administrative tasks. This is a vulnerability inherent in Quartz.NET's remote management functionality.

**Impact:** Complete control over the Quartz.NET scheduler, allowing the attacker to disrupt application functionality, schedule malicious jobs, or access sensitive job data.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in Job Store Interaction](./threats/sql_injection_vulnerabilities_in_job_store_interaction.md)

**Description:** If Quartz.NET is configured to use a database for job persistence, vulnerabilities in how Quartz.NET constructs and executes SQL queries could lead to SQL injection attacks. This is a direct risk arising from Quartz.NET's database interaction logic.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to and modification of job data, potential execution of arbitrary SQL commands on the database server, leading to data breaches or data corruption.

**Risk Severity:** Critical
