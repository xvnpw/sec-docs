## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Remote Management Interface (If Enabled) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_remote_management_interface__if_enabled___critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the remote management feature of Quartz.NET is enabled, attackers can attempt to gain unauthorized access to control the scheduler remotely.
**Impact:** Successful exploitation grants full control over the scheduling process, allowing the attacker to schedule, modify, or delete jobs and triggers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Remote Management [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_remote_management__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This is the crucial step to access the remote management interface.
**Impact:**  Successful unauthorized access is a prerequisite for exploiting the remote management interface.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_credentials.md)

**Attack Vector:** Many systems are deployed with default credentials that are publicly known or easily guessable. Attackers can try these default credentials to gain access.
**Impact:**  Immediate unauthorized access to the remote management interface.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Malicious Actions via Remote Management [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_malicious_actions_via_remote_management__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Once authenticated, the attacker can use the remote management interface to perform malicious actions.
**Impact:** This node represents the point where the attacker leverages their access to cause harm.

## Attack Tree Path: [Schedule Malicious Job [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/schedule_malicious_job__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Attackers use their remote access to schedule a new job containing malicious code.
**Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution within the application's context when the malicious job is triggered.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Existing Job to Execute Malicious Code [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/modify_existing_job_to_execute_malicious_code__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers modify the configuration or data of an existing legitimate job to execute malicious code when the job runs.
**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the application's context when the modified job is triggered.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Job Data [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_job_data__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If job data is serialized and then deserialized, attackers can inject malicious serialized objects that execute code upon deserialization.
**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Serialized Payload [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_serialized_payload__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts and injects a malicious serialized payload into the job data.
**Impact:** This action triggers the deserialization vulnerability, potentially leading to code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Job Executes External Commands without Proper Sanitization [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/job_executes_external_commands_without_proper_sanitization__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** A job's code executes external operating system commands based on input without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary commands.
**Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the server hosting the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection in AdoJobStore (if direct SQL queries are vulnerable) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection_in_adojobstore__if_direct_sql_queries_are_vulnerable___critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application uses a database for job persistence (AdoJobStore) and doesn't use parameterized queries, attackers can inject malicious SQL code to manipulate the database.
**Impact:**  Database compromise, potential data breach, and in some cases, the ability to execute operating system commands via database features.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unauthorized Access to Underlying Database [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/unauthorized_access_to_underlying_database__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the database used by Quartz.NET.
**Impact:** Full control over the job data, allowing attackers to modify, delete, or inject malicious jobs directly into the persistent store.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Injection in Listener/Trigger Logic [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection_in_listenertrigger_logic__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If custom job listeners or triggers are implemented without proper input validation, attackers can inject malicious code that gets executed when the listener or trigger is invoked.
**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the context of the custom listener or trigger.
