# Attack Surface Analysis for quartznet/quartznet

## Attack Surface: [Job Data Map Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/job_data_map_manipulation.md)

* **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious data into the `JobDataMap` associated with a job.
* **How Quartz.NET Contributes:** Quartz.NET provides the `JobDataMap` as a mechanism to pass data to job executions. If the application allows external influence over this data without proper validation, it becomes an attack vector.
* **Example:** An application allows users to configure a job that sends emails. A malicious user could inject a crafted string into the `JobDataMap` representing the recipient's email address, potentially leading to spam or phishing attacks originating from the application.
* **Impact:** Can lead to unintended behavior of jobs, data corruption, information disclosure, or even code execution if the job implementation improperly handles the injected data.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any data that populates the `JobDataMap`.
    * Avoid directly using user-provided input to populate the `JobDataMap` without thorough checks.
    * Design job implementations to be resilient to unexpected data types or values in the `JobDataMap`.
    * Consider using immutable data structures for the `JobDataMap` where appropriate.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Job and Trigger Configuration](./attack_surfaces/malicious_job_and_trigger_configuration.md)

* **Description:** Attackers gain the ability to create, modify, or delete jobs and triggers within the Quartz.NET scheduler.
* **How Quartz.NET Contributes:** Quartz.NET provides APIs for managing jobs and triggers. If access to these APIs is not properly secured, attackers can manipulate the scheduling logic.
* **Example:** An attacker gains access to an administrative interface that uses Quartz.NET's scheduling API. They create a new job that executes a malicious script on the server at a specific time.
* **Impact:** Can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, denial of service by scheduling resource-intensive tasks, or disruption of legitimate scheduled operations.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for any interfaces that interact with Quartz.NET's scheduling APIs.
    * Follow the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to manage jobs and triggers.
    * Audit job and trigger configurations regularly for unauthorized changes.
    * Consider using a separate, isolated environment for managing critical scheduled tasks.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure AdoJobStore Configuration (If Used)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_adojobstore_configuration__if_used_.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities related to the configuration and security of the underlying database used by `AdoJobStore` for persistent job storage.
* **How Quartz.NET Contributes:** When using `AdoJobStore`, Quartz.NET relies on an external database. Insecure configuration of this database directly impacts the security of the scheduled tasks.
* **Example:** The database connection string used by `AdoJobStore` is stored in plain text in a configuration file, allowing an attacker with access to the file system to retrieve the credentials and potentially compromise the database.
* **Impact:** Database compromise can lead to the ability to manipulate job definitions, steal sensitive data related to scheduled tasks, or even gain control of the server if the database server is compromised.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Securely store database connection strings using encryption or dedicated secrets management solutions.
    * Apply appropriate database security measures, such as strong passwords, network segmentation, and regular security patching.
    * Follow the principle of least privilege when granting database access to the application.
    * Regularly review and audit database access logs.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Job Data (If Applicable)](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_job_data__if_applicable_.md)

* **Description:** If job data involves serialized objects, attackers can exploit deserialization vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code.
* **How Quartz.NET Contributes:** While Quartz.NET itself doesn't enforce serialization, if job implementations serialize and deserialize data within the `JobDataMap` or during job execution, it introduces this risk.
* **Example:** A job implementation retrieves a serialized object from the `JobDataMap` and deserializes it without proper validation. An attacker injects a malicious serialized object into the `JobDataMap` that, upon deserialization, executes arbitrary code.
* **Impact:** Can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Avoid deserializing untrusted data within job implementations.
    * If deserialization is necessary, use secure deserialization techniques and libraries that prevent common vulnerabilities.
    * Implement strict input validation before deserializing any data.
    * Consider using alternative data serialization formats that are less prone to deserialization vulnerabilities (e.g., JSON).

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Remoting/Clustering Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_remotingclustering_configuration.md)

* **Description:** If Quartz.NET is configured for remoting or clustering, vulnerabilities in the communication or authentication mechanisms can be exploited.
* **How Quartz.NET Contributes:** Quartz.NET provides features for distributed scheduling. Insecure configuration of these features can expose the scheduler to unauthorized access or manipulation.
* **Example:**  Quartz.NET remoting is configured without proper authentication, allowing an attacker on the network to connect to the scheduler and execute administrative commands.
* **Impact:** Can lead to unauthorized control over the scheduler, disruption of scheduled tasks, or information disclosure.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement strong authentication and authorization for remoting and clustering connections.
    * Use secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL) to encrypt network traffic between scheduler instances.
    * Restrict network access to the scheduler to authorized machines only.
    * Regularly review and update the remoting/clustering configuration.
