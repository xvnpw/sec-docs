## High and Critical Quartz.NET Threats

This table outlines high and critical threats that directly involve the Quartz.NET library.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected Quartz.NET Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Malicious Job Scheduling (Unauthorized)** | An attacker gains unauthorized access to the scheduler (e.g., through exposed management endpoints, application vulnerabilities, or compromised credentials) and schedules malicious jobs. These jobs could execute arbitrary code, manipulate data, or cause denial of service. | Execution of arbitrary code with application privileges, data corruption, resource exhaustion, service disruption. | `IScheduler` interface, `SchedulerBuilder`, potentially custom application code interacting with the scheduler. | **Critical** | Implement strong authentication and authorization for any interface interacting with the scheduler. Follow the principle of least privilege. Secure any management endpoints. Regularly audit scheduled jobs. |
| **Malicious Job Modification (Unauthorized)** | An attacker gains unauthorized access to the scheduler and modifies existing job definitions. This could involve changing the job's implementation, data, or trigger. | Execution of unintended code, data corruption, disruption of scheduled workflows, potential privilege escalation. | `IJobDetail`, `IMutableTrigger`, `IScheduler` interface, potentially custom application code. | **High** | Implement strong authentication and authorization for scheduler access. Implement auditing of job and trigger modifications. Use immutable job details where possible. |
| **Job Data Manipulation (Direct JobStore Access)** | An attacker gains direct access to the underlying `IJobStore` (e.g., through database vulnerabilities, weak database credentials, or file system access for `RAMJobStore`) and manipulates the stored job data, triggers, or scheduler state. | Corruption of job logic, execution of jobs with unintended parameters, disruption of scheduling, potential for privilege escalation if job data influences access control. | `IJobStore` implementations (e.g., `AdoJobStore`, `RAMJobStore`), underlying database or file system. | **High** | Secure the underlying `IJobStore` persistence mechanism (database, file system). Use strong authentication and authorization for database access. Encrypt sensitive data within the JobStore. For `RAMJobStore`, limit access to the application's memory space. |
| **Trigger Manipulation (Direct JobStore Access)** | An attacker gains direct access to the `IJobStore` and modifies trigger configurations to execute jobs at unintended times or with incorrect frequencies. | Denial of service (by scheduling excessive executions), execution of sensitive jobs at inappropriate times, disruption of scheduled workflows. | `IJobStore` implementations, underlying database or file system. | **High** | Secure the underlying `IJobStore` persistence mechanism. Implement auditing of trigger modifications. |
| **Information Disclosure via Job Data** | Sensitive information (e.g., database credentials, API keys) is stored insecurely within the `JobDataMap` of a job. An attacker with access to the scheduler or JobStore can retrieve this information. | Leakage of sensitive credentials, potential for unauthorized access to external systems. | `JobDataMap`, `IJobDetail`, `IJobStore`. | **High** | Avoid storing sensitive information directly in `JobDataMap`. Use secure configuration management techniques (e.g., environment variables, secrets management systems). Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit. |
| **Elevation of Privilege via Malicious Job Implementation** | If the application allows dynamic loading or configuration of job implementations, an attacker could provide malicious code that will be executed with the application's privileges when the job is triggered. | Full compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system. | `IJob` interface, potentially custom job factories or class loading mechanisms. | **Critical** | Restrict the sources from which job implementations can be loaded. Implement strict validation and sanitization of any user-provided code or configuration related to job implementations. Consider using a sandboxed environment for job execution if feasible. |
| **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Quartz.NET or Dependencies** | Unpatched vulnerabilities in the Quartz.NET library itself or its dependencies could be exploited to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code. | Full compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system. | Core Quartz.NET libraries and their dependencies. | **Critical** | Regularly update Quartz.NET and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions. Monitor security advisories for Quartz.NET and its dependencies. |
| **JobStore Corruption or Failure** | Due to software bugs, hardware failures, or malicious actions, the `IJobStore` becomes corrupted or unavailable. | Disruption of scheduled workflows, potential loss of scheduled job information. | `IJobStore` implementations, underlying persistence mechanisms. | **High** | Choose an appropriate `IJobStore` based on the application's requirements and reliability needs. Implement proper backup and recovery procedures for the JobStore. Monitor the health of the JobStore. |
