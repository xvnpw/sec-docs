# Attack Surface Analysis for autofixture/autofixture

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Custom Generators](./attack_surfaces/malicious_custom_generators.md)

**Description:** Developers can extend AutoFixture by creating custom `ISpecimenBuilder` implementations to control object creation. If these custom generators are sourced from untrusted locations or built without proper security considerations, they can introduce malicious logic.

**How AutoFixture Contributes:** AutoFixture's design encourages extensibility through custom generators, making it a potential entry point for injecting malicious code during object creation.

**Example:** A custom generator could be designed to write sensitive data to a log file, establish a network connection to an external server, or manipulate system resources during test execution.

**Impact:** Data exfiltration, remote code execution (if the generated objects are processed unsafely), denial of service (through resource exhaustion).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review and audit all custom `ISpecimenBuilder` implementations.
*   Restrict the sources from which custom generators are loaded.
*   Implement code signing or other mechanisms to verify the integrity of custom generators.
*   Avoid dynamic loading of custom generators based on external input.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to custom generator code.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in AutoFixture Dependency](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_autofixture_dependency.md)

**Description:** Like any third-party library, AutoFixture itself might contain security vulnerabilities. Using an outdated or vulnerable version of AutoFixture can expose the application to known exploits.

**How AutoFixture Contributes:** AutoFixture is a dependency that, if compromised, can introduce vulnerabilities into the application.

**Example:** A hypothetical vulnerability in AutoFixture could allow an attacker to inject malicious code during the object creation process.

**Impact:**  Potentially complete compromise of the application, depending on the severity of the vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep AutoFixture updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
*   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk.
*   Monitor security advisories related to AutoFixture and its dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Accidental Use of AutoFixture in Production Code](./attack_surfaces/accidental_use_of_autofixture_in_production_code.md)

**Description:** While primarily intended for testing, if AutoFixture code or configurations are inadvertently included in production builds, the ability to generate arbitrary objects could be misused or expose internal application details.

**How AutoFixture Contributes:** AutoFixture provides functionalities for dynamic object creation, which could be exploited if exposed in production.

**Example:** A debugging endpoint might mistakenly use AutoFixture to generate objects based on user input, potentially allowing an attacker to create arbitrary application objects.

**Impact:** Unpredictable application behavior, potential for unauthorized data manipulation or access, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement clear separation between test and production code during the build process.
*   Utilize build tools and configurations to ensure that AutoFixture dependencies and related code are not included in production builds.
*   Conduct thorough code reviews to identify and remove any accidental usage of AutoFixture in production code.
*   Employ static analysis tools to detect potential instances of AutoFixture usage in production.
