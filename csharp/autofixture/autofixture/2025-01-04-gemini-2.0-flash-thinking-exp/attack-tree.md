## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data via Customizations [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_via_customizations__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This represents the overarching risk of using AutoFixture's customization features to inject harmful data or logic. The flexibility of customizations, while beneficial for testing, can be a significant attack vector if not properly controlled.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   **Introduce Code Execution via Custom Generator [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a custom generator that, when invoked by AutoFixture, executes arbitrary code within the application's context. This is often achieved by exploiting reflection capabilities within the custom generator to instantiate malicious objects or call dangerous system functions.
        *   **Example:** A custom generator for a `FileLogger` class could be designed to write malicious scripts to a publicly accessible directory.
    *   **Generate Data Causing Resource Exhaustion [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** A malicious custom generator is created to produce an extremely large amount of data or enter an infinite loop. When AutoFixture attempts to use this generator, it can lead to excessive consumption of CPU, memory, or other resources, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
        *   **Example:** A custom generator for a `List<string>` could be designed to continuously add elements, consuming all available memory.
    *   **Target Specific Types with Malicious Customizations [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Attackers focus on customizing data generation for specific data types that are critical to the application's security or functionality.
        *   **Attack Steps within this path:**
            *   **Target Security-Sensitive Types (e.g., User Credentials) [CRITICAL]:**
                *   **Description:** Customizations are used to generate predictable or known values for fields representing user credentials (usernames, passwords, API keys, etc.). If this generated data inadvertently ends up in a non-testing environment or is used in security decisions, it can lead to authentication bypass or other security breaches.
                *   **Example:** A custom generator for a `Password` field always returns "password123".

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Extensibility Mechanisms [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_extensibility_mechanisms__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This focuses on the risks associated with how AutoFixture's extensibility features are managed and secured, particularly when customizations are shared or loaded from external sources.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   **Introduce Malicious Customizations via Shared Libraries (if applicable) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** If the application uses shared libraries or repositories to manage AutoFixture customizations, an attacker could compromise these repositories to inject malicious customizations. Once deployed, these malicious customizations will be used by the application, potentially leading to code execution, data manipulation, or denial of service.
        *   **Attack Steps within this path:**
            *   **Compromise Shared Customization Repository:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the repository where AutoFixture customizations are stored and modifies or adds malicious customizations. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the repository itself, social engineering, or insider threats.
