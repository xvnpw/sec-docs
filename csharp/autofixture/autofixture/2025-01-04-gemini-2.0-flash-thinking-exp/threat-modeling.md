# Threat Model Analysis for autofixture/autofixture

## Threat: [Generation of Unexpected Special Characters Bypassing Input Validation](./threats/generation_of_unexpected_special_characters_bypassing_input_validation.md)

* **Threat:** Generation of Unexpected Special Characters Bypassing Input Validation
    * **Description:** An attacker might exploit the fact that AutoFixture, by default, can generate strings containing various special characters. If the application under test has insufficient input validation, these generated characters could bypass filters, potentially leading to injection vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, command injection if the generated data is used in constructing queries or commands). This threat directly involves AutoFixture's default string and character generation capabilities.
    * **Impact:** Potential for data breaches, unauthorized access, or remote code execution depending on the vulnerability in the application.
    * **Affected Component:** `Fixture` class, default string and character generation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Customize AutoFixture to restrict the character set used for string generation to a safe subset (e.g., alphanumeric only) for sensitive inputs in tests.
        * Ensure the application under test has strong input sanitization and parameterized queries/commands.
        * Include specific test cases with known problematic special characters, even when using AutoFixture for general data generation.

## Threat: [Insecure Custom `ISpecimenBuilder` Implementations](./threats/insecure_custom__ispecimenbuilder__implementations.md)

* **Threat:** Insecure Custom `ISpecimenBuilder` Implementations
    * **Description:** Developers might create custom `ISpecimenBuilder` implementations, a core feature of AutoFixture's customization, that introduce security vulnerabilities. For example, a custom builder might hardcode credentials directly into generated test data, generate predictable "random" values that could be reverse-engineered, or introduce unintended side effects during test execution that could mask real vulnerabilities or even create temporary attack vectors in the test environment. This directly involves the `ISpecimenBuilder` component of AutoFixture.
    * **Impact:** Potential for exposing sensitive information within the development or test environment, introducing weaknesses that could be mirrored in production if patterns are repeated, or instability in the testing process. If hardcoded credentials are used in tests that interact with external systems, it could have broader security implications.
    * **Affected Component:** Custom `ISpecimenBuilder` implementations.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (if sensitive data is involved)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Review custom `ISpecimenBuilder` implementations with security in mind, just as with any other code.
        * Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in custom builders. Use environment variables or secure configuration mechanisms even for test data where possible.
        * Ensure custom builders are well-tested and don't introduce unexpected or insecure behavior.
        * Treat custom builders as part of the codebase and apply code review processes.
