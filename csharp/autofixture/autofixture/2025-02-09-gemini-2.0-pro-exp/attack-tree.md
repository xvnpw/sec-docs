## Attack Tree Path: [1. Manipulate AutoFixture Configuration/Customization [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__manipulate_autofixture_configurationcustomization__high_risk_.md)

**Overall Description:** This is the most significant attack surface.  If an attacker can modify how AutoFixture creates objects, they can potentially inject malicious code or cause a denial of service.  The key vulnerability is *exposure* of the `Fixture` configuration to untrusted input.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Inject Malicious `ISpecimenBuilder`](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_inject_malicious__ispecimenbuilder_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 (If exposed) Modify Global `AutoFixture.Fixture` Configuration [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__if_exposed__modify_global__autofixture_fixture__configuration__critical_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1.1 Returns malicious objects](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1_1_returns_malicious_objects.md)

**Description:** The attacker registers a custom `ISpecimenBuilder` that, when asked to create an object, returns an instance designed to execute malicious code. This could be achieved by overriding methods, injecting dependencies, or using other techniques to control the object's behavior.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (if configuration is properly protected), Very Low (if not exposed at all)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Remote Code Execution)
*   **Effort:** Low (if configuration is exposed), High (if not exposed)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (if exposed), Advanced (if not exposed)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires code review or runtime monitoring)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 (If exposed) Inject `ISpecimenBuilder` into specific `Fixture` instances. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2__if_exposed__inject__ispecimenbuilder__into_specific__fixture__instances___critical_.md)

**1.1.2.1 (Same sub-goals as 1.1.1.1):** This is identical in concept to 1.1.1.1, but the malicious `ISpecimenBuilder` is added to a specific `Fixture` instance rather than the global configuration.  The estimations are the same, but the scope of the attack is limited to objects created by that specific `Fixture`.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3 Exploit vulnerabilities in existing custom `ISpecimenBuilder` implementations. [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_existing_custom__ispecimenbuilder__implementations___high_risk_.md)

**1.1.3.1 Identify and exploit logic flaws... [CRITICAL]**
*   **Description:** The application itself provides custom `ISpecimenBuilder` implementations.  The attacker analyzes these implementations for vulnerabilities, such as injection flaws, logic errors, or other weaknesses that could be exploited to control object creation or cause a denial of service.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on the quality of the custom builder code)
*   **Impact:** Medium to Very High (depends on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Effort:** Medium to High (requires code analysis and potentially reverse engineering)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (requires code review and potentially dynamic analysis)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Influence Object Creation via `ICustomization`](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_influence_object_creation_via__icustomization_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 (If exposed) Modify Global `AutoFixture.Fixture` Customizations [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1__if_exposed__modify_global__autofixture_fixture__customizations__critical_.md)

**1.2.1.1.1 Configures builders to return malicious objects (indirectly). [HIGH RISK]**
*   **Description:**  Similar to injecting a malicious `ISpecimenBuilder`, but the attacker uses an `ICustomization` to *configure* existing builders to behave maliciously. This is an indirect attack, but can still lead to RCE.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (if configuration is properly protected), Very Low (if not exposed)
*   **Impact:** High (Potential for Remote Code Execution)
*   **Effort:** Medium (if configuration is exposed), High (if not exposed)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (if exposed), Advanced (if not exposed)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2 (If exposed) Inject `ICustomization` into specific `Fixture` instances. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2__if_exposed__inject__icustomization__into_specific__fixture__instances___critical_.md)

**1.2.2.1 (Same sub-goals as 1.2.1.1):**  Identical to 1.2.1.1, but scoped to a specific `Fixture` instance.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.3 Exploit vulnerabilities in existing custom `ICustomization` implementations. [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_3_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_existing_custom__icustomization__implementations___high_risk_.md)

**1.2.3.1 Identify and exploit logic flaws... [CRITICAL]**
*   **Description:** The application provides custom `ICustomization` implementations. The attacker analyzes these for vulnerabilities.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on the quality of the custom customization code)
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (depends on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Abuse `Freeze` or `Inject` [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_abuse__freeze__or__inject___high_risk_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1 `Freeze` a malicious instance. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1__freeze__a_malicious_instance___critical_.md)

**1.3.1.1 If the application allows external control... [HIGH RISK]**
*   **Description:** The attacker provides a malicious object to be "frozen" by AutoFixture.  This means that subsequent requests for objects of that type will return the *same* malicious instance.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (if `Freeze` is used securely), Very Low (if not exposed)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Remote Code Execution)
*   **Effort:** Low (if `Freeze` is exposed), High (if not exposed)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (if exposed), Advanced (if not exposed)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.2 `Inject` a malicious instance. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_2__inject__a_malicious_instance___critical_.md)

**1.3.2.1 Similar to `Freeze`:**  `Inject` is similar to `Freeze`, but often used for specific instances rather than freezing an entire type.  The estimations and risk are the same as 1.3.1.1.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4 Exploit AutoFixture's behavior with specific types](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_exploit_autofixture's_behavior_with_specific_types.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.4.1 Types with unsafe deserialization... [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_1_types_with_unsafe_deserialization_____high_risk_.md)

**1.4.1.1 Craft input that triggers malicious code execution... [CRITICAL]**
*   **Description:** This attack combines AutoFixture with unsafe deserialization.  The attacker crafts input that, when AutoFixture creates an object and that object is *later* deserialized, triggers malicious code execution. This is *not* a vulnerability in AutoFixture itself, but a combination of AutoFixture and insecure deserialization practices.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on the application's deserialization practices)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Remote Code Execution)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
