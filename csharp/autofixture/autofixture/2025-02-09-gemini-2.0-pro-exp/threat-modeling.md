# Threat Model Analysis for autofixture/autofixture

## Threat: [Configuration Injection Leading to Malicious Object Generation](./threats/configuration_injection_leading_to_malicious_object_generation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates configuration files, environment variables, or exposed API endpoints that control AutoFixture's behavior. They register custom `ISpecimenBuilder` implementations, `ICustomization` instances, or modify `Fixture` settings to generate objects with malicious data or altered behavior.  For example, they might inject a builder that sets an "isAdmin" flag to `true` on a user object, or sets a password field to a known weak value. This is particularly dangerous if AutoFixture configurations are loaded from external, untrusted sources.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromised application logic, unauthorized access, data breaches, potential for remote code execution (if the generated objects influence code execution paths).
    *   **Affected AutoFixture Component:** `Fixture` class (specifically, its customization mechanisms: `Customizations`, `Behaviors`), `ISpecimenBuilder` interface, `ICustomization` interface, any custom implementations of these.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if AutoFixture is used in production) / High (if used only in testing, but tests influence production behavior).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Harden Configuration:** Treat AutoFixture configuration as security-sensitive.  Store configurations securely, validate and sanitize any external input that influences configuration, and use strong access controls.
        *   **Avoid External Configuration:** If possible, avoid loading AutoFixture configurations from external sources.  Hardcode configurations within the test project.
        *   **Code Reviews:**  Mandatory code reviews for *any* code that customizes AutoFixture, focusing on potential injection points and malicious builder logic.
        *   **Restrict Production Use:**  Ideally, completely avoid using AutoFixture in production code. If unavoidable, apply *all* mitigations with extreme diligence.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary permissions.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Deep Object Graphs](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_deep_object_graphs.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts input (if any input influences object creation) or manipulates AutoFixture customizations to trigger the generation of deeply nested object graphs.  This could involve recursive types or large collections.  The attacker aims to consume excessive memory or CPU, leading to a denial-of-service condition. This is a direct attack on AutoFixture's object generation capabilities.
    *   **Impact:**  Application crash, service unavailability, potential for resource exhaustion on shared infrastructure.
    *   **Affected AutoFixture Component:** `Fixture` class (default object creation behavior), `RecursionGuard`, `ISpecimenBuilder` implementations (especially those handling recursive types).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Limit Recursion Depth:**  Use `fixture.Behaviors.OfType<ThrowingRecursionBehavior>().ToList().ForEach(b => fixture.Behaviors.Remove(b)); fixture.Behaviors.Add(new OmitOnRecursionBehavior());` or set a low `fixture.RecursionDepth`.
        *   **Control Collection Sizes:** Use `fixture.RepeatCount = [small_number];` or custom builders to limit the size of generated collections (lists, arrays, etc.).  Avoid unbounded `Repeat.Any<T>()`.
        *   **Input Validation (Indirect):** If user input *indirectly* influences the types used by AutoFixture, strictly validate that input to prevent malicious type specifications.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:** Implement monitoring to detect excessive memory or CPU usage, and automatically mitigate (e.g., by terminating requests or scaling resources).

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure via Default Values](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_via_default_values.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages AutoFixture's default behavior to generate objects containing sensitive properties (passwords, API keys, PII).  If the application doesn't explicitly handle these properties, AutoFixture might populate them with default, predictable, or even empty values.  The attacker then exploits a vulnerability (e.g., logging, serialization, insecure direct object references) to access these values. This directly exploits AutoFixture's default specimen building.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breach, unauthorized access, privacy violations.
    *   **Affected AutoFixture Component:** `Fixture` class (default object creation behavior), `ISpecimenBuilder` implementations (especially the default ones).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Omit Sensitive Properties:** Use `fixture.Build<MyType>().Without(x => x.SensitiveProperty).Create()` to explicitly exclude sensitive properties from automatic generation.
        *   **Custom Builders for Sensitive Types:** Create custom `ISpecimenBuilder` implementations for types containing sensitive data.  These builders should *always* either:
            *   Set sensitive properties to safe, non-revealing values (e.g., empty strings, placeholders).
            *   Throw an exception if the sensitive property isn't explicitly provided by the caller.
        *   **Secure Logging and Serialization:**  Review and configure logging and serialization mechanisms to ensure sensitive properties are masked or excluded.  Use secure serialization formats.

## Threat: [Type Confusion via Custom Builders](./threats/type_confusion_via_custom_builders.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker registers a custom `ISpecimenBuilder` that returns an object of an unexpected type.  For example, if the application expects a `User` object, the malicious builder might return a `MaliciousUser` object that inherits from `User` but overrides methods with malicious behavior. This relies on the application not performing strict type checking and directly exploits AutoFixture's customization mechanism.
    *   **Impact:**  Unexpected application behavior, potential for code injection or privilege escalation if the malicious object's methods are called.
    *   **Affected AutoFixture Component:** `ISpecimenBuilder` interface, custom implementations of `ISpecimenBuilder`, `Fixture.Create<T>()` (when `T` is an interface or abstract class).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Type Checking:**  When receiving objects from AutoFixture (or any external source), perform strict type checking using `is` and `as` operators, and validate that the object is of the *exact* expected type, not just a compatible type.
        *   **Code Reviews:**  Thoroughly review all custom `ISpecimenBuilder` implementations, looking for potential type confusion vulnerabilities.
        *   **Avoid Polymorphic Creation (if possible):** If you don't need polymorphic behavior, use `fixture.Create<ConcreteType>()` instead of `fixture.Create<InterfaceType>()` to ensure you get the exact type you expect.
