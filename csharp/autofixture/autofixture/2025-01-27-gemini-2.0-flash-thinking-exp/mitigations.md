# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for autofixture/autofixture

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicitly Define Data Generation for Sensitive Properties](./mitigation_strategies/explicitly_define_data_generation_for_sensitive_properties.md)

**Description:**
    1.  Identify sensitive properties in your classes.
    2.  Use `Fixture.Customize<T>` or `Fixture.Build<T>().With()` when creating objects of type `T`.
    3.  For each sensitive property, use `.Without(x => x.SensitiveProperty)` to prevent automatic generation, or `.With(x => x.SensitiveProperty, "safe-placeholder")` to set a safe value, or `.With(x => x.SensitiveProperty, () => GenerateSafeValue())` for custom safe generation.
    4.  Apply these customizations in test setup or wherever AutoFixture generates objects with potential sensitive data.
**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Generation of Unintended or Sensitive Data - Severity: High
