### 7. Implementation Analysis: Currently Implemented and Missing Implementation

*   **Currently Implemented: Partially - Periodic updates, but not a strictly enforced security practice.**
    *   **Analysis:**  "Periodic updates" indicate some level of awareness and effort towards updating dependencies. However, "not strictly enforced" suggests a lack of formal process, consistency, and potentially insufficient frequency. This partial implementation provides some level of protection but leaves room for vulnerabilities to persist due to inconsistent or delayed updates.
*   **Missing Implementation: Formalize as regular security maintenance, automate with dependency scanning in CI/CD.**
    *   **Formalize as regular security maintenance:** This highlights the need to transition from ad-hoc updates to a structured and documented process. This includes:
        *   **Defining Update Frequency:** Establish a clear schedule for dependency updates (e.g., monthly, quarterly, triggered by vulnerability alerts).
        *   **Documenting the Process:** Create a documented procedure outlining the steps for checking, updating, and testing dependencies.
        *   **Assigning Responsibility:** Clearly assign roles and responsibilities for managing dependency updates.
