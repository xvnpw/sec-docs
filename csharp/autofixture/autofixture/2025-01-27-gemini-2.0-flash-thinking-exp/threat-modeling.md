# Threat Model Analysis for autofixture/autofixture

## Threat: [Malicious Custom Generator Code Execution](./threats/malicious_custom_generator_code_execution.md)

Description: An attacker with control over the development process or code repository could inject malicious code into a custom generator for AutoFixture. When tests are executed using this malicious generator, the injected code is executed within the test environment. This could allow the attacker to perform actions such as stealing sensitive data from the test environment, compromising the test system itself, or using the test environment as a stepping stone to attack other systems. The attacker leverages the custom generator functionality of AutoFixture to execute arbitrary code.
Impact: Compromise of development/testing environment, potential for data theft, system compromise, or denial of service in development/testing infrastructure. This could lead to significant delays in development, exposure of internal systems, and reputational damage.
Affected AutoFixture Component: Customization API (specifically the ability to create and register custom generators).
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement mandatory and rigorous code review processes for **all** custom generators before they are integrated into the project and used in tests. Reviews should specifically focus on security aspects and potential malicious code injection.
    * Adhere to secure coding practices when developing custom generators. Keep them simple, focused solely on data generation, and avoid complex logic or interactions with external systems.
    * Apply the principle of least privilege to custom generators. Ensure they only have the necessary permissions and capabilities required for their intended purpose. Avoid granting them broad access to system resources or sensitive data.
    * Restrict access to code repositories and development environments to authorized personnel only. Implement strong access controls and authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized modification of custom generators or other test code.
    * Consider using static analysis tools to scan custom generator code for potential security vulnerabilities or malicious patterns.
    * Regularly audit custom generators to ensure they remain secure and are still necessary. Remove or disable any custom generators that are no longer actively used or maintained.
