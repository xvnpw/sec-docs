# Threat Model Analysis for autofixture/autofixture

## Threat: [Generation of Insecure or Predictable Data by Custom Generators](./threats/generation_of_insecure_or_predictable_data_by_custom_generators.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might exploit vulnerabilities arising from custom `ISpecimenBuilder` implementations that generate predictable or insecure values. For example, a custom generator for passwords might use a weak algorithm or a predictable seed, allowing an attacker to guess or easily crack generated credentials if they are inadvertently used in a non-testing context or leaked.
    *   **Impact:** If generated data is used outside of testing (e.g., in development environments that mirror production), it could lead to unauthorized access, account compromise, or data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** Custom Generators (`ISpecimenBuilder` implementations).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement secure coding practices when developing custom generators.
        *   Avoid generating sensitive data like passwords or API keys with custom generators unless specifically designed for secure generation.
        *   Conduct thorough code reviews of custom generators.
        *   Restrict the use of custom generators to testing environments only.
        *   If generating sensitive data is necessary for testing, use specific, secure generation methods and avoid using the generated values in non-test environments.

## Threat: [Overly Permissive Fixture Configuration Leading to Unexpected Data](./threats/overly_permissive_fixture_configuration_leading_to_unexpected_data.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might leverage overly permissive global or context-specific fixture configurations that allow the generation of data violating application invariants or security policies. This could lead to unexpected application behavior, bypass security checks, or expose vulnerabilities. For instance, a configuration might disable constraints on string lengths, allowing the generation of excessively long strings that could cause buffer overflows or denial-of-service conditions.
    *   **Impact:** Application instability, security bypasses, potential for denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Fixture Configuration (e.g., `Fixture` class, `Customize` methods).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium  *(Note: While previously marked Medium, the potential for security bypasses elevates this to High in many contexts. Consider this a High threat)*
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review and restrict global fixture customizations.
        *   Use context-specific customizations where possible to limit the scope of changes.
        *   Ensure that fixture configurations align with application security policies and data validation rules.
        *   Regularly review and audit fixture configurations.
