# Attack Surface Analysis for autofixture/autofixture

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Custom Generators](./attack_surfaces/malicious_custom_generators.md)

* **Description:** Developers can create custom `ISpecimenBuilder` implementations to control how AutoFixture generates specific types. If these implementations are not secure, they can introduce vulnerabilities.
    * **How AutoFixture Contributes:** AutoFixture provides the extensibility mechanism (`ISpecimenBuilder`) that allows developers to inject custom logic into the object creation process. This trust in user-provided code is the core of this attack surface.
    * **Example:** A custom builder for a `User` object could, instead of generating random data, connect to a database and exfiltrate sensitive information or execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, resource exhaustion, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Code Review:** Thoroughly review all custom `ISpecimenBuilder` implementations for potential security flaws.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure custom builders only have the necessary permissions and access to perform their intended function. Avoid granting broad access.
        * **Sandboxing/Isolation:** If possible, execute custom builders in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of malicious code.
        * **Input Validation:** If custom builders rely on external input, rigorously validate and sanitize that input.
        * **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in custom builder code.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration of Customizations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_of_customizations.md)

* **Description:** AutoFixture allows customization through various methods (e.g., `Fixture.Customize`). Improper or insecure configurations can lead to unexpected and potentially harmful object states.
    * **How AutoFixture Contributes:** AutoFixture's flexibility in customization allows developers to override default generation behavior. If these overrides are not carefully considered, they can introduce vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** Customizing the generation of a `Password` property to always be a weak, default value, bypassing intended security measures.
    * **Impact:** Creation of objects violating security constraints, bypassing authentication or authorization mechanisms, data integrity issues.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Defaults:**  Favor secure default configurations and only deviate when absolutely necessary with careful consideration.
        * **Configuration Review:** Regularly review AutoFixture customizations to ensure they align with security requirements.
        * **Testing of Customizations:** Thoroughly test all customizations to ensure they don't introduce unintended security vulnerabilities.
        * **Centralized Configuration:**  Manage AutoFixture configurations centrally to ensure consistency and easier review.
