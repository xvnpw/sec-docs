## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Redis Commands (via Insufficient Input Sanitization)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_redis_commands__via_insufficient_input_sanitization_.md)

**Critical Nodes:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** When the application constructs Redis commands using user-provided input without proper sanitization or escaping, an attacker can inject arbitrary Redis commands. These injected commands are then executed by the Redis server with the application's privileges.
    *   **Impact:**  Data manipulation (reading, modifying, deleting data), denial of service by executing resource-intensive commands, or even potential for executing Lua scripts with malicious intent if scripting is enabled.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Connection Settings (Plaintext Communication)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_connection_settings__plaintext_communication_.md)

**Critical Nodes:**

*   **Plaintext Communication:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If the communication between the application and the Redis server is not encrypted using TLS/SSL, an attacker on the network path can intercept the traffic. This allows them to read the commands being sent and the responses being received, potentially exposing sensitive data and even Redis authentication credentials.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data, including application data and Redis credentials. This can lead to further compromise of the Redis server and the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Connection Settings (Weak Authentication Credentials)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_connection_settings__weak_authentication_credentials_.md)

**Critical Nodes:**

*   **Weak Authentication Credentials:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If the application uses weak, default, or easily guessable passwords for authenticating with the Redis server, an attacker can attempt to brute-force or guess these credentials.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the Redis server, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete any data stored in Redis.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Data Handling (Storing Sensitive Data in Redis without Encryption)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_data_handling__storing_sensitive_data_in_redis_without_encryption_.md)

**Critical Nodes:**

*   **Storing Sensitive Data in Redis without Encryption:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If the application stores sensitive data directly in Redis without encrypting it first, and the Redis server is compromised through any means (e.g., weak authentication, exposed instance), the attacker can directly access and read this sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive application data, potentially leading to identity theft, financial loss, or other privacy breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Network Communication between Application and Redis (Man-in-the-Middle Attack)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_network_communication_between_application_and_redis__man-in-the-middle_attack_.md)

**Critical Nodes:**

*   **Intercept and Modify Redis Commands/Responses:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** In a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, if the communication is not encrypted, an attacker can not only read the commands and responses but also modify them in transit. This allows them to alter the application's interaction with Redis, potentially leading to data corruption, unauthorized actions, or bypassing security checks.
    *   **Impact:**  Data manipulation, application logic bypass, potential for injecting malicious commands that are different from what the application intended.
