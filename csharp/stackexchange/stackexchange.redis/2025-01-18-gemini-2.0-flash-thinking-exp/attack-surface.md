# Attack Surface Analysis for stackexchange/stackexchange.redis

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Connection to Redis](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_connection_to_redis.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between the application and the Redis server occurs over a plain TCP connection without TLS/SSL encryption.
*   **How stackexchange.redis contributes:** The library establishes the connection based on the provided connection string. If the connection string doesn't specify TLS/SSL, the connection will be unencrypted.
*   **Example:** A connection string like `"localhost:6379"` will establish an unencrypted connection using `stackexchange.redis`.
*   **Impact:** Sensitive data transmitted between the application and Redis (e.g., session data, cached information) can be intercepted and read by attackers monitoring network traffic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Configure the connection string used by `stackexchange.redis` to use TLS/SSL. This typically involves adding `ssl=true` and potentially specifying certificate details in the connection string.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Unsanitized Input](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_unsanitized_input.md)

*   **Description:** User-provided input is directly incorporated into Redis commands without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **How stackexchange.redis contributes:** The library provides methods like `Execute`, `StringGetSet`, etc., to execute arbitrary Redis commands. If the application constructs these commands by concatenating user input before passing it to these methods, it becomes vulnerable.
*   **Example:**  Code using `db.Execute("SET user:" + userId + ":name " + userName)` where `userName` comes directly from user input and `db` is an `IDatabase` obtained from `stackexchange.redis`. An attacker could input `; FLUSHALL` in `userName`.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can execute arbitrary Redis commands via `stackexchange.redis`, potentially leading to data manipulation, deletion, information disclosure, or even denial of service on the Redis server.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  **Crucially, avoid string concatenation for building commands with user input when using `stackexchange.redis`.** Utilize parameterized commands or the library's higher-level abstractions that handle escaping and quoting.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Hardcoded Redis Credentials](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_hardcoded_redis_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Redis connection credentials (password, username) are directly embedded in the application's source code or configuration files without proper encryption or secure storage.
*   **How stackexchange.redis contributes:** The `ConnectionMultiplexer` in `stackexchange.redis` uses the provided credentials in the connection string to authenticate with the Redis server. If these credentials are exposed, attackers can use them to connect directly.
*   **Example:** A connection string like `"localhost:6379,password=MySecretPassword"` being directly passed to `ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect()` in the application code.
*   **Impact:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the Redis server, allowing them to read, modify, or delete data.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  **Never hardcode credentials used by `stackexchange.redis`.** Utilize secure configuration management techniques such as environment variables or secrets management services.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data via Pub/Sub without Authorization](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_via_pubsub_without_authorization.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses Redis Pub/Sub to transmit sensitive information without implementing proper authorization or encryption on the channels.
*   **How stackexchange.redis contributes:** The library provides methods like `GetSubscriber()` to access the Pub/Sub functionality and methods like `Subscribe` and `Publish` to interact with channels. If these channels are not secured, anyone can subscribe and receive messages via `stackexchange.redis`.
*   **Example:** An application using `stackexchange.redis` to publish user activity data to a public Redis channel without any access control.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized parties can eavesdrop on sensitive data being transmitted through the Pub/Sub channels using `stackexchange.redis`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement application-level authorization to control who can subscribe to specific Pub/Sub channels when using `stackexchange.redis`. Consider encrypting messages before publishing them using the library.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Lua Scripts (if used)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_lua_scripts__if_used_.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses `stackexchange.redis` to execute custom Lua scripts on the Redis server, and these scripts contain vulnerabilities.
*   **How stackexchange.redis contributes:** The library provides methods like `ScriptEvaluateAsync` to execute Lua scripts on the Redis server. If these scripts are poorly written or handle user input insecurely, they can introduce vulnerabilities exploitable through `stackexchange.redis`.
*   **Example:** A Lua script executed via `stackexchange.redis` that directly uses user-provided input in a way that allows command injection within the script's execution context on Redis.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can leverage vulnerabilities in Lua scripts executed via `stackexchange.redis` to execute arbitrary commands within the Redis server's context, potentially leading to data manipulation or server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Thoroughly review and test all custom Lua scripts executed via `stackexchange.redis` for potential vulnerabilities, especially when handling external input. Avoid constructing scripts dynamically based on untrusted input without proper sanitization within the script.
