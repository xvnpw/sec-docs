# Threat Model Analysis for stackexchange/stackexchange.redis

## Threat: [Insecure Default Connection Settings](./threats/insecure_default_connection_settings.md)

**Description:** If the application relies on default connection settings of `stackexchange.redis` without explicit configuration, an attacker on the network could potentially connect to the Redis instance if it's exposed and authentication is not enabled by default within the library's configuration. This allows them to directly interact with the Redis data.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, denial of service by deleting critical data.

**Affected Component:** `ConnectionMultiplexer` class, specifically the default values for connection configuration options like `Password`, `Ssl`, and `AllowAdmin`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**  Explicitly configure connection options when instantiating the `ConnectionMultiplexer`, including setting a strong password or using ACLs via the `Password` option, and enabling TLS encryption for communication using the `Ssl` option set to `true`. Ensure `AllowAdmin` is set to `false` unless absolutely necessary and understood.

## Threat: [Connection String Injection](./threats/connection_string_injection.md)

**Description:** If the application dynamically constructs the Redis connection string and uses untrusted input without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious connection parameters. This could lead `stackexchange.redis` to connect to an unintended Redis instance controlled by the attacker, potentially leaking data intended for the legitimate server or allowing the attacker to influence application behavior.

**Impact:** The application might send sensitive data to an attacker's Redis instance. The attacker could potentially manipulate data within the legitimate Redis instance if the application proceeds with operations after the connection.

**Affected Component:** The `ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect` method and the parsing logic within the `ConnectionMultiplexer` that interprets the connection string.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Avoid dynamic construction of connection strings based on untrusted input. If absolutely necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization using allow-lists and escaping techniques *before* passing the string to `ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect`.

## Threat: [Data Injection through Redis Commands](./threats/data_injection_through_redis_commands.md)

**Description:** If the application constructs Redis commands dynamically using string concatenation with untrusted input and then executes these commands using `stackexchange.redis`, an attacker could inject malicious Redis commands. This allows them to bypass intended application logic, access or modify unauthorized data within Redis, or even execute administrative commands if Redis is not properly secured.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, privilege escalation within the Redis instance, potential denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Methods within the `IDatabase` interface used for executing commands, such as `Execute`, `StringGet`, `StringSet`, `ScriptEvaluate`, etc., when used with dynamically constructed command strings.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**  **Crucially, use parameterized commands or command builders provided by `stackexchange.redis` where available.** This prevents direct string concatenation of user input into Redis commands. Implement strict input validation and sanitization on any user-provided data used in Redis commands, even when using command builders as a defense-in-depth measure. Follow the principle of least privilege for Redis user permissions.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `stackexchange.redis` Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in__stackexchange_redis__dependencies.md)

**Description:**  `stackexchange.redis` relies on other libraries. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, and the application uses a vulnerable version of `stackexchange.redis` that includes these dependencies, an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, potentially leading to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.

**Affected Component:** The specific vulnerable dependency library used by `stackexchange.redis`.

**Risk Severity:** High (potential for Critical depending on the dependency vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:** Regularly update the `stackexchange.redis` library to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes in its dependencies. Monitor security advisories for any vulnerabilities in the dependencies of `stackexchange.redis` and upgrade promptly.

## Threat: [Lua Scripting Vulnerabilities (if used)](./threats/lua_scripting_vulnerabilities__if_used_.md)

**Description:** If the application utilizes Lua scripting through `stackexchange.redis` and constructs scripts dynamically using untrusted input, or if the scripts themselves contain vulnerabilities, an attacker could inject malicious Lua code. This could allow them to bypass security controls, access sensitive data, or perform unauthorized actions directly within the Redis server.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, privilege escalation within the Redis instance, potentially leading to full control over Redis data and execution of arbitrary Redis commands.

**Affected Component:** Methods within the `IDatabase` interface related to script execution, such as `ScriptEvaluate`, `ScriptLoad`, and `ScriptRun`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**  Avoid constructing Lua scripts dynamically based on untrusted input. If dynamic script generation is necessary, implement rigorous input validation and sanitization. Carefully review and audit all Lua scripts for potential vulnerabilities. Follow the principle of least privilege when defining script capabilities within Redis. Consider alternative approaches if scripting introduces significant risk.
