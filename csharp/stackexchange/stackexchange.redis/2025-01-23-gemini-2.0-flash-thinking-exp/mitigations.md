## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Redis Authentication via Connection String](./mitigation_strategies/implement_redis_authentication_via_connection_string.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Authentication on Redis Server:** Configure your Redis server to require authentication (e.g., `requirepass` or Redis ACLs). This is a prerequisite for this mitigation.
    2.  **Configure Connection String:**  Modify your `stackexchange.redis` connection string in your application's configuration to include the authentication credentials. Use the `password` parameter for `requirepass` or username/password for ACLs *as supported by `stackexchange.redis` connection string format*.
    3.  **Test Authenticated Connection:** Verify that your application can successfully connect to Redis using the *configured `stackexchange.redis` connection string with authentication* in a testing environment.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Redis via StackExchange.Redis (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized applications or users from connecting to Redis *through `stackexchange.redis`* if they lack the correct credentials in the connection string.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Redis via StackExchange.Redis:** Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access *originating from applications using this library*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Redis authentication using `requirepass` is enabled on all Redis instances.
    *   `stackexchange.redis` connection strings in production applications are configured with the `password` parameter, retrieving the password from Azure Key Vault.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Migration to Redis ACLs for more granular permission control *within `stackexchange.redis` connection configuration* is planned but not yet implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize TLS/SSL Encryption for Redis Connections via Connection String](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_tlsssl_encryption_for_redis_connections_via_connection_string.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable TLS on Redis Server:** Configure your Redis server to enable TLS/SSL encryption. This is a prerequisite.
    2.  **Configure Connection String for TLS:**  Modify your `stackexchange.redis` connection string in your application to enable TLS. This is typically done by adding `ssl=true` to the connection string *as supported by `stackexchange.redis` connection string parameters*.
    3.  **Verify TLS Connection:** Test the TLS connection in a non-production environment to ensure that `stackexchange.redis` is successfully connecting to Redis over an encrypted channel *using the configured connection string*.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Eavesdropping/Sniffing of Redis Traffic via StackExchange.Redis Connection (High Severity):** Prevents eavesdropping on data transmitted between the application and Redis *specifically through the `stackexchange.redis` connection*.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on StackExchange.Redis Connection (High Severity):** Protects against MitM attacks targeting the communication channel *established by `stackexchange.redis`*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Eavesdropping/Sniffing of Redis Traffic via StackExchange.Redis Connection:** Significantly reduces the risk of data interception *during communication managed by the library*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Apply Principle of Least Privilege via Redis ACLs and Connection String User](./mitigation_strategies/apply_principle_of_least_privilege_via_redis_acls_and_connection_string_user.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Redis ACLs:** Ensure your Redis server version supports ACLs and they are enabled.
    2.  **Create Dedicated Redis Users with ACLs:** For each application or service connecting to Redis, create a dedicated Redis user with ACLs granting minimal permissions.
    3.  **Configure Connection String with ACL User:** Modify your `stackexchange.redis` connection string to use the dedicated ACL user credentials. *Ensure `stackexchange.redis` connection string format supports specifying username and password for ACLs*.
    4.  **Test with Limited Permissions:** Thoroughly test the application with the newly configured `stackexchange.redis` connection using the ACL user in a non-production environment to verify functionality and permission restrictions.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Lateral Movement after Application Compromise via StackExchange.Redis (Medium to High Severity):** Limits the attacker's ability to perform actions beyond the application's intended scope within Redis *if the application using `stackexchange.redis` is compromised*.
    *   **Accidental Data Corruption due to Application Bugs via StackExchange.Redis (Medium Severity):** Restricting permissions limits the potential damage from application bugs that might inadvertently execute destructive Redis commands *through `stackexchange.redis`*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Lateral Movement after Application Compromise via StackExchange.Redis:** Partially reduces the risk by limiting attacker capabilities *accessible through the library's connection*.
    *   **Accidental Data Corruption due to Application Bugs via StackExchange.Redis:** Partially reduces the risk by limiting the scope of potential damage *originating from application code using the library*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not currently implemented. Redis ACLs are not yet in use. All applications currently use the same `requirepass` password via `stackexchange.redis` connection strings.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Redis ACLs need to be enabled and configured on all Redis instances.
    *   Dedicated Redis users with least privilege permissions need to be created for each application or service using `stackexchange.redis`.
    *   Application connection strings using `stackexchange.redis` need to be updated to use the new ACL users.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Carefully Manage Redis Connection Strings and Credentials Used by StackExchange.Redis](./mitigation_strategies/carefully_manage_redis_connection_strings_and_credentials_used_by_stackexchange_redis.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Externalize Connection Strings:**  Do not hardcode Redis connection strings *used by `stackexchange.redis`* directly in application source code.
    2.  **Secure Credential Storage:** Use secure methods to store and retrieve credentials *used in `stackexchange.redis` connection strings*, such as environment variables or secrets management systems.
    3.  **Restrict Access to Configuration:** Limit access to configuration files or systems where *`stackexchange.redis` connection strings* are stored to authorized personnel and processes.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Credential Exposure in Source Code/Version Control (High Severity):** Prevents accidental or malicious exposure of Redis credentials *used by `stackexchange.redis`* if connection strings are hardcoded.
    *   **Credential Exposure via Configuration Files (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of credential leaks if configuration files containing *`stackexchange.redis` connection strings* are compromised.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Credential Exposure in Source Code/Version Control:** Significantly reduces the risk of easily discoverable credentials *related to `stackexchange.redis` connections*.
    *   **Credential Exposure via Configuration Files:** Partially reduces the risk of credential leaks *associated with library connections*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Redis passwords for `stackexchange.redis` connections are not hardcoded in application code. They are retrieved from Azure Key Vault in production.
    *   Environment variables are used for `stackexchange.redis` connection strings in development and staging environments.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Secrets management system (Azure Key Vault) is not consistently used across all environments *for storing `stackexchange.redis` connection credentials*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Input Validation and Sanitization in Application Logic *Using* StackExchange.Redis](./mitigation_strategies/implement_input_validation_and_sanitization_in_application_logic_using_stackexchange_redis.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify User Inputs in Redis Operations:** Analyze your application code to identify all places where user-provided input is used to construct Redis commands, keys, or values *via `stackexchange.redis`*.
    2.  **Validate User Inputs Before Redis Operations:** Implement robust input validation to ensure user-provided data conforms to expected formats before using it in Redis operations *through `stackexchange.redis`*.
    3.  **Use Parameterized Commands:**  Always leverage the parameterized query capabilities of `stackexchange.redis` when executing commands with user input. *This is the primary defense against Redis injection when using this library*. Avoid string concatenation to build commands.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Redis Injection Vulnerabilities via StackExchange.Redis (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious Redis commands *through application code that uses `stackexchange.redis`* by ensuring proper input handling and using parameterized commands.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Redis Injection Vulnerabilities via StackExchange.Redis:** Significantly reduces the risk of injection attacks *when interacting with Redis through this library*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Parameterized commands are generally used with `stackexchange.redis`, but there might be instances of string concatenation for command construction in older code.
    *   Basic input validation exists but is not consistently applied to all user inputs interacting with Redis *via `stackexchange.redis`*.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive review and hardening of all user input validation related to Redis operations *performed using `stackexchange.redis`* is needed.
    *   Code review to identify and eliminate any instances of non-parameterized Redis command construction using user input *when using `stackexchange.redis`*.
