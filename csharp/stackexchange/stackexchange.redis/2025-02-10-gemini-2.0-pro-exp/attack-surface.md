# Attack Surface Analysis for stackexchange/stackexchange.redis

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Connections](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_connections.md)

*   **Description:** Data transmitted between the application and the Redis server is sent in plain text, vulnerable to interception.
*   **StackExchange.Redis Contribution:** The library *supports* TLS/SSL but doesn't enforce it.  It's the developer's responsibility to configure it correctly.  Incorrect configuration (e.g., ignoring certificate errors) is a direct misuse of the library.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses a network sniffer to capture Redis commands and data, including sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive information.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if sensitive data is involved).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Always enable TLS/SSL in the `StackExchange.Redis` connection string (`ssl=true`).  Configure `SslProtocols` and `CertificateSelection` correctly.  Validate server certificates properly.  *Never* disable certificate validation in production.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/command_injection.md)

*   **Description:** User-supplied data is directly incorporated into Redis commands without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary Redis commands.
*   **StackExchange.Redis Contribution:** While the library's API *encourages* safe usage, it's still possible to construct raw commands unsafely using `Execute` or `ExecuteAsync`. This is a direct misuse of the library's features.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects `FLUSHALL` into a key name, causing all data in the Redis instance to be deleted.
*   **Impact:** Data loss, data corruption, denial of service, potential for server compromise (depending on injected command).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  *Never* concatenate user input directly into Redis commands.  Use the provided API methods (e.g., `StringSet`, `HashGet`, etc.) which handle escaping automatically.  Validate and sanitize all user input before using it in *any* Redis operation.  Avoid constructing raw command strings and using `Execute` with unsanitized input.

## Attack Surface: [Lua Script Injection](./attack_surfaces/lua_script_injection.md)

*   **Description:** User-supplied data is used to construct Lua scripts executed on the Redis server, allowing attackers to inject malicious Lua code.
*   **StackExchange.Redis Contribution:** The library provides methods for executing Lua scripts (`ScriptEvaluate`).  If user input is used unsafely within these scripts (passed directly to `ScriptEvaluate` without sanitization), it creates a direct injection vulnerability *through the library*.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects Lua code that iterates through all keys and exfiltrates their values.
*   **Impact:** Data exfiltration, data modification, denial of service, potential for server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Avoid using user input directly in Lua scripts.  If unavoidable, treat it as completely untrusted and sanitize it rigorously.  Prefer pre-compiled Lua scripts.  Use parameterized inputs with `ScriptEvaluate` whenever possible.  *Never* pass unsanitized user input directly to `ScriptEvaluate`.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The application stores serialized objects in Redis, and the deserialization process is vulnerable to injection attacks.
*   **StackExchange.Redis Contribution:** While the library doesn't handle serialization itself, it *facilitates* storing and retrieving the serialized data. The vulnerability arises from how the application *uses* the library to store potentially unsafe data.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized object that, when retrieved using `StringGet` and then deserialized, executes arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution (RCE) on the application server.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Use secure serialization libraries. Avoid deserializing untrusted data retrieved from Redis. If possible, use a format with schema validation. Implement a whitelist of allowed types for deserialization.

## Attack Surface: [Connection Pool Exhaustion (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/connection_pool_exhaustion__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** The application fails to properly manage Redis connections, leading to exhaustion of the connection pool and a denial-of-service condition.
*   **StackExchange.Redis Contribution:** The library uses a connection pool, but improper usage (e.g., not disposing of `ConnectionMultiplexer` instances, or creating too many instances) *directly* leads to this vulnerability. This is a direct consequence of misusing the library's connection management.
*   **Example:** A bug causes the application to repeatedly create new `ConnectionMultiplexer` instances without disposing of them.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service; the application becomes unable to interact with Redis.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Ensure proper disposal of `ConnectionMultiplexer` instances (use `using` statements or explicit `Dispose()` calls).  Follow the recommended singleton pattern for `ConnectionMultiplexer`. Monitor connection pool usage and set appropriate limits. Implement robust error handling and retry logic.
