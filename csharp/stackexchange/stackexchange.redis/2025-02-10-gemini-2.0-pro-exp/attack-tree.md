## Attack Tree Path: [Data Exfiltration Branch](./attack_tree_paths/data_exfiltration_branch.md)

*   **1. Read Arbitrary Keys [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **Description:** An attacker can read any key in the Redis database, regardless of intended access controls.
    *   **Underlying Cause (Critical):** Lack of input validation and authorization. The application does not properly check if the user is allowed to access the requested key. User-supplied data is used directly to construct the key to be read.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if the critical vulnerability exists).
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High. Can lead to exposure of sensitive data (API keys, user data, session tokens).
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium.
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High.

*   **2. Scan Keys w/o Auth [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **Description:** An attacker can use the `SCAN` command (or similar) to discover keys in the Redis database without proper authorization.
    *   **Underlying Cause (Critical):** Lack of input validation and authorization. The application does not restrict the use of `SCAN` or similar commands to authorized users.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if the critical vulnerability exists).
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High. Allows attackers to map the Redis keyspace, potentially revealing sensitive information.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium.
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High.

*   **3. Lua Script (Read) [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious code into a Lua script executed by the Redis server, allowing them to read arbitrary data.
    *   **Underlying Cause (Critical):** Lack of input sanitization for Lua scripts. User-supplied data is used directly within Lua scripts without proper escaping or validation.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if Lua scripts are used and not properly secured).
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High. Similar to (1), but potentially more powerful due to Lua's scripting capabilities.
    *   **Effort:** Medium.
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** High.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Modification Branch](./attack_tree_paths/data_modification_branch.md)

*   **4. Write Arbitrary Data [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **Description:** An attacker can write data to any key in the Redis database, potentially overwriting existing data or injecting malicious content.
    *   **Underlying Cause (Critical):** Lack of input validation and authorization. Similar to (1), but for write operations.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if the critical vulnerability exists).
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High. Can lead to data corruption, injection of malicious data, or disruption of application logic.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium.
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High.

*   **5. Delete Arbitrary Data [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **Description:** An attacker can delete any key in the Redis database.
    *   **Underlying Cause (Critical):** Lack of input validation and authorization. Similar to (1), but for delete operations.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if the critical vulnerability exists).
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High. Can cause data loss, application errors, or denial of service.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium.
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High.

*   **6. Lua Script (Write/Delete) [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious code into a Lua script to write or delete arbitrary data in the Redis database.
    *   **Underlying Cause (Critical):** Lack of input sanitization for Lua scripts. Similar to (3), but for write/delete operations.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if Lua scripts are used and not properly secured).
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High. Similar to (4) and (5), but potentially more powerful.
    *   **Effort:** Medium.
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** High.

## Attack Tree Path: [DoS Branch (part)](./attack_tree_paths/dos_branch__part_.md)

* **11. High CPU Usage (DoS)**
    * **Description:** The attacker sends computationally expensive commands to the Redis server.
    * **Underlying Cause:** Lack of restrictions on expensive commands (e.g., `KEYS *` on a large dataset, complex Lua scripts) or lack of rate limiting.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Medium to High
    * **Effort:** Low to Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Configuration Issues (Implicitly Critical)](./attack_tree_paths/configuration_issues__implicitly_critical_.md)

*   This entire category represents fundamental security flaws. Examples include:
    *   Weak or default Redis passwords.
    *   Lack of authentication.
    *   Exposing Redis on an insecure port (e.g., directly to the internet).
    *   Insufficient resource limits (memory, connections).
    *   Running Redis as a privileged user.
