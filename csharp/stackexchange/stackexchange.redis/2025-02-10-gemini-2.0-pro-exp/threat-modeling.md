# Threat Model Analysis for stackexchange/stackexchange.redis

## Threat: [Data Exposure via Unencrypted Connection](./threats/data_exposure_via_unencrypted_connection.md)

*   **Threat:**  Data Exposure via Unencrypted Connection

    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the Redis server.  They use a network sniffer to capture unencrypted data transmitted, including sensitive keys and values, because the application did not configure TLS.
    *   **Impact:**  Confidentiality breach.  Sensitive data (PII, credentials, session data) is exposed.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ConnectionMultiplexer` (specifically, the connection establishment and communication).  The `ConfigurationOptions` used to create the `ConnectionMultiplexer` are crucial.  Failure to set `Ssl = true` is the direct cause.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable TLS:** Configure the `ConnectionMultiplexer` to use TLS encryption.  Set `ConfigurationOptions.Ssl = true;` and ensure the Redis server is configured for TLS.
        *   **Validate Certificate:** Ensure the application properly validates the Redis server's TLS certificate to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Use `ConfigurationOptions.CertificateValidation` event.

## Threat: [Race Condition Data Corruption (Counter Example)](./threats/race_condition_data_corruption__counter_example_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Race Condition Data Corruption (Counter Example)

    *   **Description:**  Multiple application threads concurrently attempt to increment a counter stored in Redis using `StringGet` followed by `StringSet`.  The application's incorrect use of non-atomic operations leads to incorrect results.
    *   **Impact:**  Integrity violation.  The counter value is incorrect, leading to inaccurate data.
    *   **Affected Component:** `IDatabase.StringGet` and `IDatabase.StringSet` (when used *without* proper synchronization).  The issue is the *combination* of these operations without atomicity, a direct misuse of the library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use `IDatabase.StringIncrement`:**  Use the atomic `StringIncrement` (or `StringDecrement`) method.
        *   **Lua Scripting:** For more complex operations, use Lua scripting (`IDatabase.ScriptEvaluate`) to perform the read-modify-write cycle atomically.
        *   **Optimistic Locking:** Use `IDatabase.LockTake` and related methods to implement optimistic locking.

## Threat: [Connection Pool Exhaustion](./threats/connection_pool_exhaustion.md)

*   **Threat:**  Connection Pool Exhaustion

    *   **Description:** The application creates too many `ConnectionMultiplexer` instances or fails to properly dispose of `IDatabase` objects. This exhausts available connections, preventing interaction with Redis. This is a direct result of improper use of the `StackExchange.Redis` API.
    *   **Impact:**  Denial of Service (DoS) for the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ConnectionMultiplexer` (specifically, the connection pool management).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Singleton `ConnectionMultiplexer`:**  Use a single, shared `ConnectionMultiplexer` instance.
        *   **Proper Disposal:**  Always dispose of `IDatabase` objects (and other disposable resources) using `using` statements.
        *   **Connection Pool Configuration:**  Tune the connection pool settings in the `ConfigurationOptions`.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Slow Operations (KEYS *)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_slow_operations__keys__.md)

*   **Threat:**  Denial of Service via Slow Operations (KEYS *)

    *   **Description:** The application uses the `KEYS *` command (or other slow, blocking commands) through `StackExchange.Redis`, blocking the Redis server and the application thread. While the command itself is a Redis feature, the *misuse* through `StackExchange.Redis` is the direct threat.
    *   **Impact:**  Denial of Service (DoS) for both the Redis server and the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** `IDatabase.Execute` (when used with blocking commands like `KEYS *`), or `IServer.Keys` if misused with a large or unbounded `pageSize`. The *choice* to use these methods incorrectly is the direct threat.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid `KEYS *`:**  Never use `KEYS *` in production. Use `IServer.Keys` with a small `pageSize` and iterate, or use `IDatabase.Execute("SCAN", ...)` with the `SCAN` command.
        *   **Asynchronous Operations:** Use asynchronous methods (e.g., `ExecuteAsync`, `StringGetAsync`).
        *   **Timeouts:**  Set appropriate timeouts.

## Threat: [Weak or Missing Redis Authentication](./threats/weak_or_missing_redis_authentication.md)

* **Threat:** Weak or Missing Redis Authentication

    * **Description:** The application fails to provide credentials when connecting to a Redis instance that requires authentication, or provides weak/easily guessable credentials. While the server *enforces* authentication, the application's failure to *use* it correctly through `StackExchange.Redis` is the direct threat.
    * **Impact:** Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability compromise.
    * **Affected Component:** `ConnectionMultiplexer` (configuration). The `ConfigurationOptions.Password` property is crucial. The *failure* to set this correctly, or setting it to a weak value, is the direct threat.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Password:** Always enable authentication on the Redis server.
        *   **Configure Password:** Configure the `ConnectionMultiplexer` to use the correct password using `ConfigurationOptions.Password`.
