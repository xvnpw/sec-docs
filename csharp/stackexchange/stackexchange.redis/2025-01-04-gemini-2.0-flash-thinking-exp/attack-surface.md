# Attack Surface Analysis for stackexchange/stackexchange.redis

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Connection Configuration (Lack of Encryption)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_connection_configuration__lack_of_encryption_.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Connection Configuration (Lack of Encryption)
    *   **Description:** Communication between the application and the Redis server is not encrypted, allowing attackers to eavesdrop on network traffic and potentially intercept sensitive data.
    *   **How stackexchange.redis Contributes:** The library allows for both encrypted (TLS/SSL) and unencrypted connections. If TLS/SSL is not explicitly configured *within the `stackexchange.redis` connection options*, the connection defaults to unencrypted, creating the vulnerability. The library is the direct mechanism for establishing this connection.
    *   **Example:** An application using `stackexchange.redis` connects to a Redis server over a public network without configuring the `ssl=true` option in the connection string. An attacker on the same network intercepts the traffic and reads data being exchanged.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data, potential for session hijacking or data manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Configure `stackexchange.redis` connection options to enforce TLS/SSL by setting `ssl=true` in the connection string or using the appropriate configuration settings.**
        *   Ensure the Redis server is configured to accept TLS/SSL connections.
        *   Verify the Redis server's certificate using `sslHost` or similar options in the connection string to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Redis Command Injection (Indirect)](./attack_surfaces/redis_command_injection__indirect_.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Redis Command Injection (Indirect)
    *   **Description:** User-supplied input is directly incorporated into Redis commands without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary Redis commands.
    *   **How stackexchange.redis Contributes:** The library provides methods like `Database.Execute()` or direct string command construction that, if used improperly, become the direct mechanism for sending maliciously crafted commands to the Redis server. The vulnerability lies in how the application *uses* the library's features.
    *   **Example:** An application uses string concatenation with user input to build a Redis command executed via `db.Execute(command)`. A malicious user inputs data that, when concatenated, forms a destructive Redis command.
    *   **Impact:** Data manipulation, unauthorized access to data, potential for denial of service by executing resource-intensive or dangerous commands (e.g., `FLUSHALL`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Utilize `stackexchange.redis`'s methods that support parameterized commands or safe command construction to avoid direct string manipulation of commands.**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all user-provided data before using it to interact with Redis through `stackexchange.redis`.
        *   Prefer using specific `stackexchange.redis` methods for common operations (e.g., `StringSet`, `HashGet`) instead of raw command execution where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Lua Script Injection (If Used)](./attack_surfaces/lua_script_injection__if_used_.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Lua Script Injection (If Used)
    *   **Description:** User-supplied input is incorporated into Lua scripts executed on the Redis server without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary Lua code.
    *   **How stackexchange.redis Contributes:** The library's `Database.ScriptEvaluate()` and related methods provide the direct interface for executing Lua scripts on the Redis server. If the application constructs these scripts with unsanitized input, `stackexchange.redis` is the tool that carries out the malicious execution.
    *   **Example:** An application uses string concatenation to build a Lua script executed via `db.ScriptEvaluate(script)`. A malicious user injects Lua code into the script, potentially gaining control over the Redis server's data or execution environment.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Redis server, data manipulation, potential for denial of service, and potentially compromising the integrity of the Redis data and operations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid incorporating user input directly into Lua scripts executed via `stackexchange.redis`.**
        *   If user input is absolutely necessary, sanitize it rigorously using Lua-specific sanitization techniques to prevent the injection of malicious code.
        *   Prefer using parameterized scripts or pre-defined scripts with input parameters passed through `stackexchange.redis`'s parameter handling mechanisms to limit the scope of user influence.
