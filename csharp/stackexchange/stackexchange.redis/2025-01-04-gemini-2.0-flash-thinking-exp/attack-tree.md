## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Connection Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_connection_vulnerabilities.md)

This node represents a critical point where vulnerabilities in how the application connects to the Redis server can be exploited. Successful exploitation here often grants the attacker significant control over the communication or access to the Redis instance.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Redis Connection](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_redis_connection.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker intercepts communication between the application and the Redis server, allowing them to eavesdrop, modify, or inject data.
*   **THEN:** Intercept and modify communication between application and Redis, potentially stealing data or injecting commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Lack of TLS/SSL Encryption](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__lack_of_tlsssl_encryption.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The connection between the application and Redis is not encrypted, making it vulnerable to interception.
*   **THEN:** Intercept and modify communication between application and Redis, potentially stealing data or injecting commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Compromised Redis Credentials in Connection String](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__compromised_redis_credentials_in_connection_string.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The Redis credentials (password, username if applicable) are exposed in the application's configuration or environment variables.
*   **THEN:** Obtain Redis credentials from the application's configuration or environment variables and directly access Redis.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Command Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_command_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

This node highlights the risks associated with how the application handles Redis commands, particularly concerning data serialization and command construction. Exploiting vulnerabilities here can lead to severe consequences like remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if using object serialization with Redis)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__deserialization_vulnerabilities__if_using_object_serialization_with_redis_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application serializes objects before storing them in Redis and deserializes them upon retrieval. If insecure deserialization methods are used, a malicious serialized object can be crafted to execute arbitrary code upon deserialization.
*   **THEN:** Store malicious serialized objects in Redis, which when retrieved and deserialized by the application, execute arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure Deserialization of Data Retrieved from Redis](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__insecure_deserialization_of_data_retrieved_from_redis.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application retrieves serialized data from Redis and deserializes it without proper validation, allowing for the execution of malicious code embedded in the serialized data.
*   **THEN:** Store malicious serialized objects in Redis, which when retrieved and deserialized by the application, execute arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Command Injection via Application Logic (Indirectly related to stackexchange.redis)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__command_injection_via_application_logic__indirectly_related_to_stackexchange_redis_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** While `stackexchange.redis` parameterizes commands, the application's logic might construct Redis commands by concatenating user-controlled input without proper sanitization, leading to the execution of arbitrary Redis commands.
*   **THEN:** While `stackexchange.redis` parameterizes commands, vulnerabilities in the application's logic that constructs Redis commands could lead to injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks Specific to stackexchange.redis](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__denial_of_service__dos__attacks_specific_to_stackexchange_redis.md)

This node represents attack vectors that can disrupt the application's availability by overwhelming the Redis server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Connection Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__connection_exhaustion.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker rapidly establishes and closes connections to the Redis server, exhausting its resources and preventing legitimate connections.
*   **THEN:** Rapidly establish and close connections to the Redis server, potentially exhausting server resources and preventing legitimate connections.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Sending Large or Complex Commands](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__sending_large_or_complex_commands.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker sends excessively large or computationally expensive Redis commands that overwhelm the server, leading to performance degradation or failure.
*   **THEN:** Send excessively large or computationally expensive Redis commands that overwhelm the server.
