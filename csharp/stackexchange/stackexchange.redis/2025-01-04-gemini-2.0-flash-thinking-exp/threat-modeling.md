# Threat Model Analysis for stackexchange/stackexchange.redis

## Threat: [Connection String Exposure](./threats/connection_string_exposure.md)

**Description:** An attacker might gain access to the application's configuration files, environment variables, or logs where the Redis connection string is stored. This allows them to obtain sensitive information like the Redis server address, port, password, and potentially SSL/TLS settings. This directly involves how the application configures and uses the `ConnectionMultiplexer` from `stackexchange.redis`.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Redis database, leading to data breaches (reading sensitive data), data manipulation (modifying or deleting data), or denial of service (e.g., flushing the database).

**Affected Component:** `ConnectionMultiplexer` (configuration during initialization).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store connection strings securely using environment variables or dedicated secret management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault).
*   Avoid hardcoding connection strings directly in the application code.
*   Implement proper access controls on configuration files and environment variables.
*   Encrypt sensitive configuration data at rest.
*   Regularly review and rotate Redis passwords.

## Threat: [Insecure Connection Configuration](./threats/insecure_connection_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker could intercept communication between the application and the Redis server if the `ConnectionMultiplexer` is configured to connect without proper encryption (TLS/SSL) or without verifying the server's certificate. This directly relates to the configuration options provided by `stackexchange.redis`.

**Impact:** Information disclosure (sensitive data transmitted to Redis is exposed), command injection (attacker can send their own Redis commands), and potential compromise of both the application and the Redis server.

**Affected Component:** `ConnectionMultiplexer` (configuration options related to SSL/TLS: `ssl`, `SslHost`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always enable TLS/SSL encryption for the Redis connection by setting the appropriate options in the `ConnectionMultiplexer` configuration.
*   Configure the `ConnectionMultiplexer` to verify the Redis server's certificate to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   Ensure the Redis server itself is configured to enforce TLS/SSL connections.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Unsanitized Input](./threats/command_injection_via_unsanitized_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate user-provided or external data that is directly incorporated into Redis commands without proper sanitization or parameterization when using methods from `stackexchange.redis` to execute commands.

**Impact:** Data manipulation (modifying or deleting data), potential for arbitrary code execution on the Redis server (if dangerous commands are enabled), and denial of service (e.g., using `FLUSHALL`).

**Affected Component:** Methods used to execute Redis commands (e.g., `Database.StringSet`, `Database.StringGet`, `Database.Execute`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Never** directly concatenate user input into Redis command strings.
*   Utilize the parameterized command execution features provided by `stackexchange.redis` (e.g., using placeholders and passing parameters separately).
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all user-provided data before using it in Redis commands.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege for the Redis user, limiting the available commands.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service_through_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit the application's interaction with Redis, potentially leveraging features of `stackexchange.redis` to send a large number of requests or commands, overwhelming the Redis server or the application's connection pool managed by the library.

**Impact:** Application downtime, slow response times, and potentially impacting other applications sharing the same Redis instance.

**Affected Component:** `ConnectionMultiplexer` (connection management, sending commands), methods for executing commands.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement rate limiting on API endpoints or application features that interact with Redis.
*   Set appropriate timeouts for Redis operations within the `stackexchange.redis` configuration to prevent indefinite blocking.
*   Monitor Redis server performance and resource utilization.
*   Implement connection pooling and ensure it is configured appropriately within `stackexchange.redis` to handle expected load.
*   Consider using Redis Cluster for horizontal scaling and improved resilience.

## Threat: [Improper Handling of Redis Authentication](./threats/improper_handling_of_redis_authentication.md)

**Description:** The application might not be correctly authenticating with the Redis server when initializing the `ConnectionMultiplexer`, using weak passwords, or storing authentication credentials insecurely, directly impacting how `stackexchange.redis` connects.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Redis database, leading to data breaches, manipulation, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `ConnectionMultiplexer` (configuration of the `password` option).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always configure strong and unique passwords for Redis authentication within the `ConnectionMultiplexer` configuration.
*   Store Redis passwords securely using environment variables or secret management systems.
*   Avoid hardcoding passwords in the application code.
*   Consider using Redis ACLs (Access Control Lists) for more granular permission management if your Redis version supports it.
