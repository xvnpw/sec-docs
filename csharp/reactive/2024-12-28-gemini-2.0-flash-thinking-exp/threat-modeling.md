*   **Threat:** Malicious Data Injection via Subject
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit a publicly exposed or insufficiently protected `Subject` by calling its `OnNext()` method with malicious data. This bypasses intended data sources and validation logic, injecting arbitrary data into the observable stream.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unexpected application behavior, potential execution of unintended code if the injected data is processed without proper sanitization downstream.
    *   **Affected Component:** `System.Reactive.Subjects.Subject<T>` (specifically the `OnNext`, `OnError`, `OnCompleted` methods).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to `Subject` instances and their `OnNext` methods to authorized components only.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization before data is pushed onto a `Subject`.
        *   Consider using alternative patterns (e.g., dedicated producer/consumer interfaces) if the dual nature of a `Subject` is not strictly necessary.

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Observation of Sensitive Data Streams
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains the ability to subscribe to an observable stream containing sensitive information without proper authorization. This could be due to insecure access control mechanisms or the stream being inadvertently exposed.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data.
    *   **Affected Component:** `System.Reactive.Linq.Observable` (any method that creates or exposes an observable, e.g., `Create`, `Return`, custom observable implementations).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authorization checks before allowing subscriptions to sensitive observable streams.
        *   Avoid directly exposing internal observable streams to external or untrusted components.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data within the stream if necessary, decrypting it only when authorized.

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion via Unbounded Observable
    *   **Description:** An attacker could trigger or exploit an observable stream that emits an unbounded number of items without completion. If subscribers do not handle this properly, it can lead to memory leaks or excessive CPU usage, causing a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, application instability.
    *   **Affected Component:** `System.Reactive.Linq.Observable` (specifically observables created without a natural completion or those that can be externally influenced to emit indefinitely).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Design observable streams to have a defined completion or use operators like `Take`, `TakeUntil`, or `Timeout` to limit their duration.
        *   Implement resource management within subscribers to handle potentially large or infinite streams gracefully.
        *   Monitor resource consumption related to reactive streams.

*   **Threat:** Observer Hijacking
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains control over an observer instance, potentially allowing them to intercept or manipulate data intended for the original subscriber or to trigger unintended side effects through the observer's `OnNext`, `OnError`, or `OnCompleted` methods.
    *   **Impact:** Data compromise, manipulation of application logic, potential execution of unintended code.
    *   **Affected Component:** `System.IObserver<T>` (observer implementations).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that observer instances are properly secured and not accessible to untrusted components.
        *   Avoid sharing observer instances across different security contexts.
        *   If observers perform sensitive actions, implement authorization checks within the observer methods.
