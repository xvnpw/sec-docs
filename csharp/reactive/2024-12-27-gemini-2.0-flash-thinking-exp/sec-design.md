## Project Design Document: Reactive Extensions for .NET (`dotnet/reactive`)

**1. Introduction**

This document provides a detailed architectural design of the Reactive Extensions for .NET (`dotnet/reactive`) project. It outlines the key components, their interactions, and the overall structure of the library. This document is intended to serve as a foundation for subsequent threat modeling activities, providing a clear understanding of the system's boundaries, data flow, and potential attack surfaces.

**1.1. Purpose**

The primary purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive and well-structured description of the `dotnet/reactive` library's architecture. This will enable security professionals and developers to effectively identify and analyze potential security threats within the project.

**1.2. Scope**

This document covers the core architectural components and concepts of the `dotnet/reactive` library. It focuses on the logical structure and interactions of the main building blocks, including Observables, Observers, Schedulers, and Operators. It does not delve into the specific implementation details of individual operators or the internal workings of the .NET runtime, nor does it cover specific usage patterns within consuming applications.

**1.3. Target Audience**

This document is intended for:

* Security architects and engineers responsible for threat modeling and security assessments.
* Developers contributing to or using the `dotnet/reactive` library.
* Anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the library's architecture.

**2. Overview**

The Reactive Extensions for .NET (`dotnet/reactive`), often referred to as Rx.NET, is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences. It extends the observer pattern to support sequences of data/events over time, adding query operators that allow you to compose sequences declaratively. This paradigm allows developers to treat streams of data as collections, enabling powerful and flexible data manipulation.

Key concepts within Rx.NET include:

* **Observable:** Represents a stream of data or events over time. It's the source of data, emitting values, errors, or a completion signal.
* **Observer:**  Consumes the data emitted by an Observable. It defines how to react to new data (`OnNext`), errors (`OnError`), and completion signals (`OnCompleted`).
* **Operator:** Functions that transform, filter, combine, or otherwise manipulate observable sequences. Operators are the building blocks for creating complex reactive pipelines.
* **Scheduler:** Controls the concurrency and timing of notifications within an observable sequence. Schedulers abstract away the underlying mechanisms for executing tasks, allowing for control over where and when work is performed.

The library provides a powerful and flexible way to handle asynchronous operations, event streams, and data processing in a composable and manageable manner. It promotes a declarative style of programming for asynchronous tasks.

**3. Architectural Design**

The `dotnet/reactive` library can be conceptually divided into several key interacting components:

* **Observable Base Types:**  The core interfaces and abstract classes that define the fundamental behavior of observables (`IObservable<T>`). This includes the contract for subscription and notification.
* **Observer Base Types:** The core interfaces and abstract classes that define how observers consume data (`IObserver<T>`). This defines the methods for receiving data, errors, and completion signals.
* **Operators:** A rich set of extension methods that operate on observables, enabling complex data transformations and manipulations. These are typically implemented as static methods or internal classes that return new observable instances with modified behavior.
* **Schedulers:**  Abstractions for managing concurrency and timing. Predefined schedulers (e.g., `ThreadPoolScheduler`, `TaskPoolScheduler`, `ImmediateScheduler`, `CurrentThreadScheduler`) are provided, allowing developers to control the execution context of observable sequences.
* **Subjects:**  Objects that act as both an observable and an observer, allowing for multicasting and bridging between different parts of the system. Subjects can be used to fan out a single data stream to multiple subscribers or to inject data into an observable pipeline.
* **Connectable Observables:** Observables that do not start emitting items until their `Connect()` method is called, allowing for shared subscriptions and controlled activation of the data stream.
* **Disposables:**  Objects that represent the lifetime of a subscription and allow for unsubscribing from an observable, releasing resources and preventing further notifications.

**3.2. Component Descriptions**

* **`IObservable<T>`:** The central interface representing a push-based data stream. It has a single method, `Subscribe(IObserver<T> observer)`, which establishes a connection between the observable and an observer. The `Subscribe` method returns an `IDisposable` that represents the active subscription.
* **`IObserver<T>`:**  An interface defining the methods an observer must implement to receive notifications from an observable:
    * `OnNext(T value)`: Called when the observable emits a new data item.
    * `OnError(Exception error)`: Called when an error occurs within the observable sequence.
    * `OnCompleted()`: Called when the observable has finished emitting data successfully.
* **Operators:**  A vast collection of extension methods that extend `IObservable<T>`. Examples include `Where`, `Select`, `Merge`, `Throttle`, `Debounce`, `Retry`, and many more. They take an observable as input and return a new observable with transformed behavior. Operators are often implemented by creating intermediate observer implementations that handle the specific transformation logic and subscribe to the source observable.
* **`Scheduler`:** An abstract class responsible for determining where and when work associated with an observable sequence is executed. This allows for controlling concurrency and asynchronicity. Different schedulers target different execution contexts (e.g., thread pool, UI thread, immediate execution).
* **`Subject<T>`:** A concrete implementation of both `IObservable<T>` and `IObserver<T>`. It can receive data (acting as an observer) and then multicast that data to multiple subscribers (acting as an observable). Different types of subjects exist, such as `BehaviorSubject`, `ReplaySubject`, and `PublishSubject`, each with different behaviors regarding the caching and delivery of emitted values.
* **`ConnectableObservable<T>`:** An observable that requires an explicit call to `Connect()` to begin emitting items. This is useful for scenarios where multiple observers need to subscribe before the data stream starts, ensuring that all subscribers receive the same sequence of data.
* **`IDisposable`:** An interface with a single method, `Dispose()`, used to release resources or cancel an ongoing subscription to an observable. Calling `Dispose()` on the `IDisposable` returned by `Subscribe()` typically stops the flow of data and releases any resources held by the subscription.

**3.3. Key Interactions**

1. **Subscription:** An observer subscribes to an observable by calling the `Subscribe()` method. This establishes a connection and returns an `IDisposable` that represents the active subscription. The observable then typically creates an internal subscription object to manage the relationship with the observer.
2. **Data Emission:** The observable emits data items by calling the `OnNext()` method of the subscribed observer(s). This notification propagates through any applied operators in the observable pipeline.
3. **Error Handling:** If an error occurs during the observable's execution (or within an operator), it calls the `OnError()` method of the subscribed observer(s). This signals a terminal state, and no further `OnNext` calls will occur.
4. **Completion:** When the observable has finished emitting data, it calls the `OnCompleted()` method of the subscribed observer(s). This also signals a terminal state.
5. **Operator Application:** Operators are applied to observables to create new observables with modified behavior. This often involves creating intermediate observer implementations that subscribe to the source observable and transform the notifications before passing them on to the subscriber of the new observable.
6. **Scheduling:** Schedulers influence when and where notifications are delivered to observers. Operators often utilize schedulers to manage concurrency, for example, by delaying notifications or executing work on a background thread. The scheduler is often specified when creating or operating on an observable.
7. **Unsubscription:** Observers can stop receiving notifications by calling the `Dispose()` method on the `IDisposable` returned during subscription. This breaks the connection between the observable and the observer, allowing for resource cleanup.

**4. Data Flow**

The typical data flow within Rx.NET involves the following steps:

1. A data source (e.g., an event, a timer, a collection, a network request) is wrapped or adapted into an `IObservable<T>`. This can be done using factory methods like `Observable.FromEvent`, `Observable.Interval`, `Observable.FromArray`, or `Observable.Create`.
2. Operators are chained together using method chaining or query syntax to transform or manipulate the data stream emitted by the source observable. Each operator subscribes to the previous observable in the chain and creates a new observable with modified behavior. This creates a pipeline of data transformations.
3. One or more `IObserver<T>` instances subscribe to the final observable in the chain. This initiates the flow of data.
4. The source observable begins emitting data according to its defined behavior.
5. As data is emitted, it flows through the chain of operators. Each operator intercepts the notifications and applies its specific transformation logic before passing the (potentially modified) notification to the next operator in the chain.
6. The transformed data is eventually delivered to the subscribed observers via their `OnNext()` method.
7. If an error occurs at any point in the observable pipeline, the `OnError()` method of the observers is called, and the sequence typically terminates.
8. When the data stream completes (if it is a finite sequence), the `OnCompleted()` method of the observers is called.
9. Observers can unsubscribe from the observable using the `IDisposable` returned during subscription, stopping the flow of data and releasing resources associated with the subscription.

**5. Security Considerations (Initial Thoughts for Threat Modeling)**

While Rx.NET is primarily a library for asynchronous programming, several security considerations are relevant for threat modeling:

* **Resource Exhaustion:**
    * **Unbounded Streams:** Observables that continuously emit data without completion can lead to unbounded resource consumption (memory, CPU) if not handled carefully by subscribers.
    * **Operator Abuse:** Certain operators, if used improperly (e.g., accumulating data without limits), can contribute to resource exhaustion.
* **Unhandled Exceptions:** Exceptions occurring within observable sequences or operator implementations can propagate up the chain. If not handled by a `catch` operator or within the observer's `OnError` handler, they can crash the application or expose sensitive information in error logs.
* **Concurrency Issues:**
    * **Race Conditions:** Improper use of shared state within custom operators or observers, especially when combined with asynchronous operations managed by schedulers, can lead to race conditions and unpredictable behavior.
    * **Deadlocks:** While less common, complex scenarios involving multiple interacting observables and schedulers could potentially lead to deadlocks.
* **Data Exposure:**
    * **Sensitive Data in Streams:** If sensitive data is processed within observable sequences, ensuring proper handling and preventing unintended data leaks (e.g., through logging or unencrypted transmission) is crucial.
    * **Information Disclosure through Timing:** In specific scenarios, the timing of events within observable sequences could potentially be exploited to infer sensitive information (timing attacks).
* **Supply Chain Security:**  Vulnerabilities in the `dotnet/reactive` library itself or its dependencies could introduce security risks to applications using it. Regular updates and vulnerability scanning are important.
* **Malicious Observables/Observers:** In scenarios where external code can provide observables or observers (e.g., through plugin architectures), there's a risk of malicious actors injecting code that could compromise the application by emitting harmful data or performing malicious actions within the observer's handlers.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A malicious observable could be designed to emit a large volume of data or trigger computationally expensive operations, potentially overwhelming the subscriber and leading to a denial of service.
* **Injection Attacks:** While less direct, if data from external sources is incorporated into observable sequences without proper sanitization, it could potentially be exploited in downstream operations.
