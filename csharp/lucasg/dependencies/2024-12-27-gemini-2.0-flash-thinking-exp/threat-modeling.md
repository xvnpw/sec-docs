## High and Critical Threats Directly Involving `lucasg/Dependencies`

This table outlines high and critical threats that directly involve the `lucasg/Dependencies` library.

| Threat | Description | Impact | Affected Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `Dependencies` Itself** | An attacker identifies and exploits a security vulnerability within the `lucasg/Dependencies` library code itself. This could lead to arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service. | Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system. | Core modules and functions of the `Dependencies` library. | **Critical** | - **Keep `Dependencies` Updated:** Regularly update the `Dependencies` library to the latest version to benefit from security patches. - **Monitor for Vulnerabilities:** Subscribe to security advisories and monitor for reported vulnerabilities in the `Dependencies` library. - **Static Analysis:** Consider using static analysis tools to scan the `Dependencies` library's code for potential vulnerabilities. - **Sandboxing:** Run the dependency analysis process in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges. |
| **Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion** | An attacker provides input (e.g., a project with an extremely large number of dependencies or complex dependency relationships) that causes `Dependencies` to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory), leading to a denial of service for the application. | Application unavailability, performance degradation. | Dependency resolution and analysis modules. | **High** | - **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits (e.g., memory, CPU time) for the dependency analysis process. - **Timeouts:** Set timeouts for dependency analysis operations to prevent indefinite execution. - **Asynchronous Processing:** Consider running dependency analysis asynchronously to avoid blocking the main application thread. - **Input Size Limits:**  If applicable, limit the size or complexity of the input (e.g., the number of files or dependencies). |
