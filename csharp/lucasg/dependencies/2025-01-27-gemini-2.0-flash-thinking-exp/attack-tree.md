Objective: Compromise Application via Dependencies (RCE or Data Breach)

## Attack Tree Visualization

*   **2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies of `lucasg/dependencies` [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   (OR)
        *   **2.1. Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs) in Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            *   (AND)
                *   2.1.1. Identify Outdated/Vulnerable Dependencies
                    *   Attack Vector: Use automated tools or manual checks to identify dependencies of `lucasg/dependencies` that have publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs). Sources include vulnerability databases, `pip audit`, and security advisories.
                *   2.1.2. Exploit Known Vulnerabilities
                    *   Attack Vector: Leverage publicly available exploits or techniques associated with the identified CVEs. Adapt these exploits to the specific context of the target application using `lucasg/dependencies`.
        *   **2.2. Transitive Dependencies Vulnerabilities [MEDIUM-HIGH RISK PATH]**
            *   (AND)
                *   2.2.1. Deep Dependency Tree Analysis
                    *   Attack Vector: Analyze the complete dependency tree of `lucasg/dependencies`, including dependencies of dependencies (transitive dependencies). Tools for dependency tree visualization and analysis can be used.
                *   2.2.2. Vulnerabilities in Transitive Dependencies
                    *   Attack Vector: Identify vulnerabilities within these transitive dependencies. Vulnerability scanners that perform deep dependency analysis are needed to detect these less obvious vulnerabilities.

*   **4. Misconfiguration or Misuse of `lucasg/dependencies` by the Application [CRITICAL NODE, MEDIUM-HIGH RISK PATH]**
    *   (OR)
        *   **4.1. Running `dependencies` with Elevated Privileges [CRITICAL NODE, MEDIUM-HIGH RISK PATH]**
            *   (AND)
                *   4.1.1. Application Runs as Root/Admin
                    *   Attack Vector: Exploit the common misconfiguration where the application or the part executing `dependencies` runs with elevated privileges (e.g., root or Administrator). This is often due to poor container configurations, development practices leaking into production, or lack of least privilege principles.
                *   4.1.2. Exploit Any Vulnerability in `dependencies` or its Dependencies
                    *   Attack Vector:  Leverage *any* vulnerability, even seemingly minor ones (like file write issues or path traversal in dependencies), within `lucasg/dependencies` or its dependencies. Running with elevated privileges escalates the impact of these vulnerabilities to full system compromise.
        *   **4.3. Using Outdated Version of `lucasg/dependencies` [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            *   (AND)
                *   4.3.1. Failure to Update `dependencies`
                    *   Attack Vector: Target applications that fail to regularly update `lucasg/dependencies`. This is a common maintenance oversight, leaving applications vulnerable to known issues in older versions.
                *   4.3.2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Outdated Version
                    *   Attack Vector: Exploit publicly known vulnerabilities that exist in the outdated version of `lucasg/dependencies` being used by the application. Public exploit databases and security advisories are key resources for this attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies of `lucasg/dependencies` (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_dependencies_of__lucasgdependencies___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector Category:** Exploiting known security flaws in third-party libraries that `lucasg/dependencies` relies upon.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Known CVEs in Dependencies (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
        *   Attackers target publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in direct dependencies of `lucasg/dependencies`.
        *   Tools like `pip audit` and vulnerability databases are used to identify vulnerable dependencies.
        *   Publicly available exploits or exploit techniques are then used to compromise the application.
        *   This is a common and effective attack vector due to the prevalence of vulnerabilities in software dependencies and the availability of exploit information.
    *   **Transitive Dependencies Vulnerabilities (Medium-High Risk Path):**
        *   Attackers target vulnerabilities in dependencies of dependencies (transitive dependencies), which are often overlooked in security assessments.
        *   Deep dependency tree analysis is required to identify these vulnerabilities.
        *   Exploitation is similar to CVE exploitation, but requires identifying vulnerabilities in a potentially larger and less scrutinized set of libraries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfiguration or Misuse of `lucasg/dependencies` by the Application (Critical Node, Medium-High Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/misconfiguration_or_misuse_of__lucasgdependencies__by_the_application__critical_node__medium-high_ri_1134d89e.md)

**Attack Vector Category:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from how the application is configured to use `lucasg/dependencies` or from misconfigurations in the application's environment.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Running `dependencies` with Elevated Privileges (Critical Node, Medium-High Risk Path):**
        *   Attackers rely on the application running with excessive permissions (e.g., root/Administrator).
        *   This misconfiguration amplifies the impact of any vulnerability in `lucasg/dependencies` or its dependencies.
        *   Even minor vulnerabilities can lead to full system compromise due to the elevated privileges.
    *   **Using Outdated Version of `lucasg/dependencies` (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
        *   Attackers target applications using outdated versions of `lucasg/dependencies` that contain known vulnerabilities.
        *   This is a result of poor patch management and failure to keep dependencies updated.
        *   Exploitation involves leveraging publicly known vulnerabilities in the specific outdated version of `lucasg/dependencies` being used.
