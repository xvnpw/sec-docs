# Threat Model Analysis for lucasg/dependencies

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependency Exploitation](./threats/vulnerable_dependency_exploitation.md)

Description: An attacker exploits a known security vulnerability in a third-party dependency used by the application. Exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Data Breach.
Impact:
* Critical: Remote Code Execution (RCE) allowing the attacker to gain full control of the server.
* High: Data Breach, exposing sensitive application data or user information.
Affected Component: Specific vulnerable dependency library or package.
Risk Severity: Critical (can be critical if RCE is possible).
Mitigation Strategies:
* Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities using automated tools.
* Prioritize and apply security updates for vulnerable dependencies promptly.
* Implement a dependency vulnerability management process.

## Threat: [Malicious Dependency Injection (Dependency Poisoning)](./threats/malicious_dependency_injection__dependency_poisoning_.md)

Description: An attacker injects malicious code into the application by compromising a dependency. This can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Backdoor creation, or Data Exfiltration.
Impact:
* Critical: Remote Code Execution (RCE) allowing the attacker to gain full control of the server.
* Critical: Backdoor creation, allowing persistent unauthorized access to the application and server.
* High: Data Exfiltration, stealing sensitive application data or user information.
Affected Component: The entire application codebase, build process, and dependency installation scripts.
Risk Severity: Critical.
Mitigation Strategies:
* Use dependency pinning and lock files to ensure consistent dependency versions.
* Verify package integrity using checksums or signatures.
* Monitor dependency sources and security advisories related to package repositories.
* Consider using private package repositories for internal dependencies and carefully vet external ones.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attack](./threats/dependency_confusionsubstitution_attack.md)

Description: An attacker substitutes a legitimate private dependency with a malicious public one, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Data Exfiltration.
Impact:
* Critical: Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the malicious package contains code that executes upon installation or usage.
* High: Data Exfiltration, if the malicious package is designed to steal data.
Affected Component: Dependency resolution process, package manager configuration.
Risk Severity: High (can be critical if RCE is possible).
Mitigation Strategies:
* Use namespace prefixes or unique naming conventions for private packages.
* Configure package managers to prioritize private repositories or explicitly define dependency sources.
* Monitor dependency resolution logs for unexpected public package installations.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Compromise of Dependency Sources](./threats/supply_chain_compromise_of_dependency_sources.md)

Description: An attacker compromises a dependency source (package repository, mirror, CDN) and injects malicious code into legitimate packages, leading to widespread Remote Code Execution (RCE) and Data Breaches.
Impact:
* Critical: Widespread distribution of malicious code, potentially affecting numerous applications and systems.
* Critical: Remote Code Execution (RCE) on systems that use the compromised packages.
* High: Massive data breaches and system compromises across multiple organizations.
Affected Component: Package repositories, mirrors, CDNs, and any system relying on packages from these sources.
Risk Severity: Critical.
Mitigation Strategies:
* Use trusted and reputable package repositories and mirrors.
* Implement integrity checks for downloaded packages using checksums or signatures.
* Consider using dependency proxy caches or internal mirrors to control and inspect downloaded packages.

## Threat: [Outdated Transitive Dependencies](./threats/outdated_transitive_dependencies.md)

Description: The application uses direct dependencies that rely on outdated transitive dependencies with known vulnerabilities, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
Impact:
* Critical: Remote Code Execution (RCE) depending on the vulnerability in the transitive dependency.
* High: Increased attack surface due to known vulnerabilities.
Affected Component: Transitive dependencies, dependency management system.
Risk Severity: High (can be critical if RCE is possible).
Mitigation Strategies:
* Regularly audit and update both direct and transitive dependencies.
* Use dependency scanning tools that identify vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies.
* Employ dependency management tools that provide insights into the dependency tree.
