# Threat Model Analysis for lucasg/dependencies

## Threat: [Malicious Dependency Specified via `lucasg/dependencies` Configuration](./threats/malicious_dependency_specified_via__lucasgdependencies__configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Dependency Specified via `lucasg/dependencies` Configuration
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains control over the configuration files used by `lucasg/dependencies` (e.g., requirements.txt, setup.py) or the input provided to its functions. They can then insert malicious dependency specifications, causing the library to install compromised packages. This could happen through vulnerabilities in the application that allow modification of these files or input.
    *   **Impact:**  Installation of malicious dependencies leading to arbitrary code execution within the application's context, data breaches, or system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `lucasg/dependencies`'s core functionality of parsing and acting upon dependency specifications.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the configuration files and input mechanisms used by `lucasg/dependencies` against unauthorized modification.
        *   Implement strict input validation for dependency specifications.
        *   Use checksums or other integrity checks for dependency files.
        *   Regularly audit the dependency specifications managed by `lucasg/dependencies`.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `lucasg/dependencies` Itself Leading to Arbitrary Execution](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__lucasgdependencies__itself_leading_to_arbitrary_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in `lucasg/dependencies` Itself Leading to Arbitrary Execution
    *   **Description:**  The `lucasg/dependencies` library itself might contain vulnerabilities (e.g., in its parsing logic, handling of external data, or interaction with the underlying package manager) that could be exploited by an attacker. By providing crafted input or manipulating the environment, an attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution within the process running `lucasg/dependencies`.
    *   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the system running the application, as the attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application.
    *   **Affected Component:**  The core modules and functions of the `lucasg/dependencies` library itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `lucasg/dependencies` updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Monitor the `lucasg/dependencies` project for reported security vulnerabilities.
        *   If contributing to or modifying `lucasg/dependencies`, follow secure coding practices and perform thorough security testing.
        *   Isolate the environment where `lucasg/dependencies` is executed to limit the impact of a potential compromise.
