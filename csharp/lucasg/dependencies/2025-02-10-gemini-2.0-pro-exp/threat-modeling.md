# Threat Model Analysis for lucasg/dependencies

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion/Substitution](./threats/dependency_confusionsubstitution.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Confusion/Substitution

    *   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious package with the same name as a private or internal dependency to a public repository. `lucasg/dependencies`, if misconfigured or due to a vulnerability in its resolution logic that affects how it *chooses* between sources, might prioritize the malicious public package. The malicious package executes arbitrary code upon installation or import.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. Attacker gains remote code execution (RCE) with the application's privileges. Data exfiltration, system manipulation, and lateral movement are possible.
    *   **Affected Component:** Dependency resolution logic within `lucasg/dependencies` *specifically related to source prioritization and conflict resolution*. User configuration of `lucasg/dependencies` regarding trusted sources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer (of `lucasg/dependencies`):** Implement robust dependency resolution that *strictly* prioritizes trusted sources (private repositories) and verifies package integrity (hashes, signatures). Provide clear warnings and *prevent* resolution from untrusted sources if a trusted source is configured.
        *   **User:** Configure `lucasg/dependencies` to *exclusively* use trusted, private repositories for internal dependencies. *Never* rely on public repositories for private dependencies. Pin dependencies to specific, verified versions and hashes. Regularly audit dependency sources.

## Threat: [Compromised Upstream Dependency](./threats/compromised_upstream_dependency.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Upstream Dependency

    *   **Description:** A legitimate dependency that `lucasg/dependencies` manages is itself compromised (e.g., maintainer account hacked, vulnerability introduced). `lucasg/dependencies` downloads and installs the compromised version. The compromised dependency contains malicious code.
    *   **Impact:** RCE, data breach, system compromise. The impact depends on the compromised dependency's role and the nature of the malicious code.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any dependency managed by `lucasg/dependencies`. `lucasg/dependencies` acts as the conduit for the compromised code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer (of `lucasg/dependencies`):** Implement robust integrity checks (hashes, signatures) for *all* downloaded dependencies. Provide mechanisms for users to pin dependencies to specific, known-good versions and *enforce* those pins.
        *   **User:** Pin dependencies to specific, verified versions and hashes. Regularly update dependencies (after careful review and testing). Monitor security advisories for the dependencies you use. Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools.

## Threat: [Tampering with Cached Dependencies (if `lucasg/dependencies` doesn't re-verify)](./threats/tampering_with_cached_dependencies__if__lucasgdependencies__doesn't_re-verify_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Tampering with Cached Dependencies (if `lucasg/dependencies` doesn't re-verify)

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the system where `lucasg/dependencies` caches downloaded dependencies. The attacker modifies the cached files, injecting malicious code. `lucasg/dependencies`, *if it does not re-verify integrity on each load*, subsequently loads the tampered dependency.
    *   **Impact:** RCE, system compromise. The attacker's code runs with the application's privileges.
    *   **Affected Component:** The dependency caching mechanism within `lucasg/dependencies`, *specifically its handling of cached dependency integrity*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer (of `lucasg/dependencies`):** *Mandatory* re-verification of the integrity of cached dependencies (using hashes) *every time* they are loaded. Store cached dependencies securely (read-only for most users).
        *   **User:** Ensure proper file system permissions. Regularly audit the cache. Consider a read-only file system for the cache.

## Threat: [Weak or Missing Dependency Signature Verification](./threats/weak_or_missing_dependency_signature_verification.md)

* **Threat:** Weak or Missing Dependency Signature Verification

    *   **Description:** `lucasg/dependencies` either does not verify digital signatures of downloaded dependencies, or uses a weak mechanism. An attacker can provide a malicious package that appears legitimate (e.g., a compromised or typosquatted package).
    *   **Impact:** RCE, system compromise, as the attacker can execute arbitrary code via a malicious dependency.
    *   **Affected Component:** The dependency download and verification process within `lucasg/dependencies`, *specifically the signature verification logic*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer (of `lucasg/dependencies`):** Implement *mandatory* strong signature verification (e.g., GPG, trusted key server) for *all* downloaded dependencies. *Reject* dependencies without valid signatures.
        *   **User:** *Ensure* signature verification is enabled and configured correctly. Use only trusted key servers. Regularly update trusted keys.
