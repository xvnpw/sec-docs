# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for lucasg/dependencies

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Selection and Vetting](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_selection_and_vetting.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Choose Reputable Dependencies and Minimize Dependency Count

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Research:** Before adding a dependency, research its reputation. Check its GitHub repository (stars, forks, issues, pull requests, last commit date). Look for signs of active maintenance and community engagement.
    2.  **Security Advisories:** Search for known vulnerabilities in the dependency using resources like Snyk, OSV, and GitHub's security advisories.
    3.  **Alternatives:** Consider alternative dependencies that might be more secure or better maintained.
    4.  **Necessity:** Critically evaluate if the dependency is *absolutely* necessary.  Could a small, in-house function achieve the same result?
    5.  **Documentation:** Document the rationale for choosing a specific dependency, including the security considerations.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (Severity: High to Critical):** Reduces the likelihood of introducing known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Malicious Dependencies (Severity: Critical):** Reduces the chance of intentionally malicious code being included.
    *   **Outdated Dependencies (Severity: Medium to High):** By favoring actively maintained dependencies, reduces the risk of using outdated versions.
    *   **Dependency Bloat (Severity: Medium):** Reduces the overall attack surface.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Dependencies:** Significantly reduces risk (e.g., 70-80% reduction).
    *   **Malicious Dependencies:** Significantly reduces risk (e.g., 90% reduction).
    *   **Outdated Dependencies:** Moderately reduces risk (e.g., 50% reduction).
    *   **Dependency Bloat:** Directly reduces the attack surface.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic research is performed before adding new dependencies (documented in pull request comments).
    *   A list of preferred, commonly used dependencies is maintained.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No systematic search for security advisories is performed *before* adding a dependency.
    *   No documentation of the security rationale for choosing a dependency.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Updates and Patching](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_updates_and_patching.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Dependency Audits and Automated Updates (with Review)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Automated Scanning:** Integrate a dependency scanning tool (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot, Renovate) into the CI/CD pipeline. Configure it to run on every build and pull request.
    2.  **Update Tool:** Use a tool like Dependabot or Renovate to automatically generate pull requests for dependency updates.
    3.  **Changelog Review:** Review the changelog and release notes for the updated dependency to understand the changes and potential security fixes.
    4.  **Testing:** Run the full test suite (unit, integration, end-to-end) after applying any dependency update.
    5.  **Emergency Patching:** Define a documented procedure for quickly applying critical security patches, even if it means temporarily overriding dependency versions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (Severity: High to Critical):** Ensures timely patching of known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Outdated Dependencies (Severity: Medium to High):** Keeps dependencies up-to-date.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Dependencies:** Significantly reduces risk (e.g., 80-90% reduction).
    *   **Outdated Dependencies:** Almost eliminates the risk (e.g., 95% reduction).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Dependabot is enabled and generates pull requests for updates.
    *   Basic unit tests are run after dependency updates.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Integration and end-to-end tests are not consistently run after dependency updates.
    *   No documented emergency patching procedure.
        *   Snyk integration is not present in CI/CD.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Integrity and Supply Chain Security](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_integrity_and_supply_chain_security.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Verify Dependency Integrity and Use a Private Dependency Proxy

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Checksum Verification:** Ensure that the dependency management tool (and `go.sum` in the case of Go) automatically verifies checksums or signatures of downloaded dependencies.
    2.  **Proxy Setup:** Set up a private dependency proxy (e.g., JFrog Artifactory, Sonatype Nexus). Configure the build system to use this proxy instead of public repositories.
    3.  **Proxy Configuration:** Configure the proxy to:
        *   Cache dependencies for faster and more reliable builds.
        *   Allow only approved dependencies (whitelist).
        *   Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities.
    4.  **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit the proxy's configuration and logs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Severity: Critical):** Protects against compromised repositories or man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Dependency Confusion/Substitution (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from tricking the build system.
    *   **Malicious Dependencies (Severity: Critical):** Adds an extra layer of defense.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Significantly reduces risk (e.g., 90-95% reduction).
    *   **Dependency Confusion/Substitution:** Almost eliminates the risk (e.g., 99% reduction).
    *   **Malicious Dependencies:** Moderately reduces risk (e.g., 50% reduction).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `go.sum` is used, ensuring basic checksum verification for Go dependencies.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No private dependency proxy is used.
    *   No regular audits of dependency sources.

## Mitigation Strategy: [License Compliance](./mitigation_strategies/license_compliance.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Automated License Scanning and Policy Enforcement

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Tool Selection:** Choose a license scanning tool (e.g., FOSSA, ScanCode, LicenseFinder).
    2.  **Integration:** Integrate the tool into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan dependencies on every build.
    3.  **Policy Definition:** Define a clear license compliance policy, specifying allowed and disallowed licenses.
    4.  **Configuration:** Configure the scanning tool to enforce the defined policy.
    5.  **Remediation:** Establish a process for addressing license violations (e.g., replacing the dependency).
    6.  **Documentation:** Document the license compliance policy and the process.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **License Compliance Violations (Severity: Medium to High):** Prevents the use of dependencies with incompatible licenses.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **License Compliance Violations:** Significantly reduces risk (e.g., 90-95% reduction).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   None.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No automated license scanning.
    *   No defined license compliance policy.
    *   No process for handling license violations.
