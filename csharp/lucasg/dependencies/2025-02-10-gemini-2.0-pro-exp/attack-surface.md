# Attack Surface Analysis for lucasg/dependencies

## Attack Surface: [1. Dependency-Based Code Injection (Supply Chain Attack)](./attack_surfaces/1__dependency-based_code_injection__supply_chain_attack_.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious code is injected into the application through a compromised or malicious dependency (either direct or transitive). This is the most direct and severe threat related to dependency management.
    *   **How Dependencies Contribute:** The library's primary function is to manage dependencies, making it the *direct* pathway for this type of attack. The attack surface increases with the number and complexity of dependencies.
    *   **Example:** An attacker compromises a widely-used utility library that is a transitive dependency of `dependencies`. The attacker injects code that steals environment variables containing API keys.
    *   **Impact:** Complete application compromise, data exfiltration, remote code execution (RCE), system takeover, potential for lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Mandatory:** Use a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to identify *all* dependencies (including transitive ones) and their known vulnerabilities.  This should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
            *   **Mandatory:** Regularly update dependencies to the latest *patched* versions. Prioritize security updates *immediately*.
            *   Implement code signing and verification to ensure only trusted code executes. This helps prevent the execution of tampered-with dependencies.
            *   Use a reputable package repository (e.g., the official Go module proxy) and *always* verify checksums (Go modules do this automatically, but ensure it's enabled).
            *   Generate and maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track all dependencies and their origins.
            *   *Strongly Consider:* Dependency pinning (with careful evaluation of the trade-offs between security and maintainability).  Pinning can prevent unexpected updates to vulnerable versions, but it also requires more manual maintenance.
            *   Employ least privilege principles: the application should only have the necessary permissions to perform its functions. This limits the damage an attacker can do if they gain control.
            *   Implement runtime application self-protection (RASP) capabilities if feasible.
        *   **Users:**
            *   If deploying a pre-built binary, verify its integrity (e.g., using checksums provided by the developers).  Do not trust binaries from untrusted sources.
            *   Monitor for security advisories related to the application and its dependencies.  Subscribe to relevant security mailing lists.
            *   Deploy the application in a sandboxed or isolated environment (e.g., a container with limited privileges).

## Attack Surface: [2. Dependency Confusion/Substitution](./attack_surfaces/2__dependency_confusionsubstitution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious package with the same name as a private or internal dependency, tricking the build system into using the malicious version instead of the legitimate internal one.
    *   **How Dependencies Contribute:** The library's dependency resolution process is directly involved. If the build system is misconfigured, it might prioritize public repositories over private ones.
    *   **Example:** Your organization uses a private Go module named `internal-auth`. An attacker publishes a malicious package with the same name on the public Go module proxy. Your build system, due to misconfiguration, downloads and uses the malicious package.
    *   **Impact:** Application compromise, data exfiltration, RCE, potential for full system control.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Mandatory:** Configure the build system (e.g., Go modules) to *explicitly* prioritize your private repository.  This is the primary defense.
            *   Use explicit versioning for *all* dependencies, including private ones.  This helps prevent accidental upgrades to malicious versions.
            *   *Strongly Consider:* Using a private package repository that supports scoped packages (e.g., `@myorg/internal-auth`). Scoping makes it much harder for attackers to successfully perform a dependency confusion attack.
            *   Regularly audit build configurations and dependency management practices to ensure they are secure and follow best practices.
        *   **Users:** (Limited direct control, relies heavily on developer practices)
            *   Ensure the application is built and distributed by a trusted source.  Avoid downloading binaries from unofficial sources.

## Attack Surface: [3. Vulnerabilities in Transitive Dependencies (Known and Unknown)](./attack_surfaces/3__vulnerabilities_in_transitive_dependencies__known_and_unknown_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitable vulnerabilities (both known and unknown/0-day) exist in the libraries that `github.com/lucasg/dependencies` uses transitively.  This is a broad category encompassing a wide range of potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Dependencies Contribute:** The library inherently introduces a potentially large number of transitive dependencies.  Each transitive dependency is a potential attack vector.
    *   **Example:** A transitive dependency used for parsing YAML files has a known vulnerability that allows for remote code execution when processing a maliciously crafted YAML input.
    *   **Impact:** Varies widely depending on the specific vulnerability, ranging from denial-of-service (DoS) to RCE, data breaches, and complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the specific vulnerability and its exploitability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Mandatory:** Use an SCA tool to *continuously* monitor for known vulnerabilities in *all* dependencies (including transitive ones).  This should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline and trigger alerts for high/critical vulnerabilities.
            *   **Mandatory:** Regularly update dependencies to their latest patched versions.  Establish a process for rapid updates in response to newly discovered vulnerabilities.
            *   Use tools like `go mod graph` and `go mod why` to understand the dependency tree and identify potentially problematic dependencies (e.g., those with a history of vulnerabilities).
            *   Consider using a minimal base image for containerized deployments to reduce the overall attack surface.
            *   If possible, evaluate and potentially replace transitive dependencies that have a poor security track record.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Monitor for security advisories related to the application and its dependencies.
            *   Apply updates promptly, especially security patches.
