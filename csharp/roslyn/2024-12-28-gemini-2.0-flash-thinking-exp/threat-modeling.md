### High and Critical Roslyn Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the Roslyn library:

*   **Threat:** Malicious Code Injection via User-Provided Code
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides malicious code snippets as input to the application, which are then *compiled and executed by Roslyn*. The attacker might craft code that performs unauthorized actions, accesses sensitive data, or compromises the application's environment. This directly involves Roslyn's compilation and execution capabilities.
    *   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the application, data breaches, unauthorized access to resources, denial of service, or even host system compromise depending on the execution context.
    *   **Affected Roslyn Component:** Roslyn Compiler API (SyntaxTree, Compilation objects), Scripting API (if used).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly avoid compiling arbitrary user-provided code if possible.
        *   If compiling user code is necessary, implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent the inclusion of malicious constructs.
        *   Run the compilation process in a highly sandboxed environment with minimal privileges.
        *   Utilize Roslyn's diagnostic analyzers to detect potentially dangerous code patterns before execution.
        *   Consider using a safe subset of the language or a domain-specific language (DSL) instead of allowing full C# or VB.NET.

*   **Threat:** Manipulation of Compiler Options
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains control over the compiler options *used by Roslyn*. They might enable unsafe flags, disable security checks, or alter the compilation process to introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors into the compiled code. This directly involves Roslyn's configuration.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities in the application, bypassing security measures, potential for code injection or arbitrary code execution in the compiled output.
    *   **Affected Roslyn Component:** Roslyn Compiler API (CompilationOptions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Hardcode compiler options within the application to prevent external modification.
        *   If external configuration of compiler options is required, implement strict validation and sanitization to ensure only safe and expected values are used.
        *   Document and enforce secure compiler option configurations.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Code Generation Bugs for Privilege Escalation
    *   **Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a vulnerability *in Roslyn's code generation logic* to produce compiled code that bypasses security checks or grants unintended access. This directly involves a flaw within Roslyn's code generation process.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to resources, potential for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Affected Roslyn Component:** Roslyn Compiler API (Code generation phase).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Roslyn updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Conduct thorough security testing and code reviews of any code generated by Roslyn, especially if it handles sensitive operations.
        *   Run the compiled code with the least necessary privileges.
