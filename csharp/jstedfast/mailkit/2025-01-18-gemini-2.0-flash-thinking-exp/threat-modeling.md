# Threat Model Analysis for jstedfast/mailkit

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on SMTP Connection](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_smtp_connection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between the application and the SMTP server. If TLS/SSL is not enforced by the application *when using MailKit* or if certificate validation *within MailKit's connection handling* is not performed correctly, the attacker can eavesdrop on the communication, potentially stealing credentials or modifying the email content being sent.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of SMTP credentials, modification of outgoing emails (e.g., changing recipients or content), and potential injection of malicious content.
    *   **Affected MailKit Component:** `MailKit.Net.Smtp.SmtpClient` (specifically the connection establishment and security layer).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always enforce TLS/SSL for SMTP connections using `SmtpClient.Connect(host, port, SecureSocketOptions.SslOnConnect)` or `SecureSocketOptions.StartTls`.
        *   Ensure proper certificate validation is enabled and that the application handles certificate errors appropriately (e.g., by not proceeding with the connection if validation fails).
        *   Regularly update MailKit to benefit from any security fixes related to TLS/SSL handling.

## Threat: [Header Injection Vulnerability (SMTP)](./threats/header_injection_vulnerability__smtp_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can inject arbitrary email headers by manipulating input fields that are used to construct email headers in the application. If MailKit's API is used incorrectly, allowing user-provided data to be directly incorporated into email headers without proper sanitization *before being passed to MailKit*, attackers can inject malicious headers.
    *   **Impact:** Email spoofing (changing the "From" address), adding unintended recipients (BCC/CC), manipulating email routing, or injecting malicious content through unexpected header fields.
    *   **Affected MailKit Component:** `MailKit.BodyBuilder`, `MailKit.Mime.MimeMessage` (specifically when adding headers through these components).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all user-provided data *before* using it to construct email headers with MailKit.
        *   Avoid directly using user input to set header values. Instead, use MailKit's API to set standard headers with validated data.
        *   If custom headers are necessary, carefully validate and sanitize the input to prevent injection attacks (e.g., by disallowing newline characters) *before passing it to MailKit*.

## Threat: [Malicious Email Processing (IMAP/POP3) - Parsing Vulnerabilities](./threats/malicious_email_processing__imappop3__-_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted email with malformed MIME structures or excessively large attachments that exploit vulnerabilities *within MailKit's parsing logic*.
    *   **Impact:**  Denial of Service (application crash or resource exhaustion), potential remote code execution if a critical parsing vulnerability exists within MailKit.
    *   **Affected MailKit Component:** `MailKit.Net.Imap.ImapClient`, `MailKit.Net.Pop3.Pop3Client`, `MimeKit.MimeParser`, `MimeKit.Tnef.TnefReader`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the severity of the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep MailKit updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that address parsing vulnerabilities.**
        *   Implement appropriate error handling when processing emails to prevent crashes from propagating.
        *   Consider setting limits on the size of attachments or the complexity of MIME structures that the application will process *before passing them to MailKit for parsing*.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on IMAP/POP3 Connection](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_imappop3_connection.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to SMTP, an attacker intercepts the communication between the application and the IMAP/POP3 server. If TLS/SSL is not enforced by the application *when using MailKit* or certificate validation *within MailKit's connection handling* is insufficient, the attacker can steal credentials or read email content.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of IMAP/POP3 credentials, unauthorized access to the mailbox and its contents, potential modification or deletion of emails.
    *   **Affected MailKit Component:** `MailKit.Net.Imap.ImapClient`, `MailKit.Net.Pop3.Pop3Client` (specifically the connection establishment and security layer).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always enforce TLS/SSL for IMAP/POP3 connections using `ImapClient.Connect(host, port, SecureSocketOptions.SslOnConnect)` or `SecureSocketOptions.StartTls`, and similarly for `Pop3Client`.
        *   Ensure proper certificate validation is enabled and that the application handles certificate errors appropriately.
        *   Regularly update MailKit.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in MailKit](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_mailkit.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities might exist within the MailKit library itself or its direct dependencies. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities if the application uses an outdated or vulnerable version of MailKit.
    *   **Impact:**  Depending on the nature of the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, or other security breaches *within the MailKit library's execution context*.
    *   **Affected MailKit Component:**  Any part of the MailKit library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep MailKit updated to the latest stable version.** Regularly check for updates and apply them promptly.
        *   Use a dependency management tool (e.g., NuGet in .NET) to track and manage dependencies.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for known issues in MailKit and its direct dependencies.
