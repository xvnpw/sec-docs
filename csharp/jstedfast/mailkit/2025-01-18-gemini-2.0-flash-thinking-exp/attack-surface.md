# Attack Surface Analysis for jstedfast/mailkit

## Attack Surface: [Malformed Email Header Parsing](./attack_surfaces/malformed_email_header_parsing.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from flaws in MailKit's internal logic when parsing and interpreting email headers that are intentionally crafted to be malformed or contain unexpected data.
    *   **How MailKit Contributes:** MailKit's core functionality includes parsing email headers to extract essential information. Vulnerabilities in this parsing logic can be directly exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends an email with an excessively long header field or a header containing special characters that trigger a buffer overflow or other parsing error *within MailKit itself*.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (application crash due to MailKit error), potential for remote code execution if the parsing vulnerability within MailKit is severe enough to allow control of execution flow.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep MailKit updated to the latest version, as updates often include critical fixes for parsing vulnerabilities.
        *   While developers can't directly modify MailKit's internal parsing, they should be aware of this potential and implement robust error handling around email processing to prevent application crashes if MailKit encounters a parsing error.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Attachment Exposure via MailKit](./attack_surfaces/malicious_attachment_exposure_via_mailkit.md)

*   **Description:** Risks associated with MailKit providing access to email attachments that contain malicious content, even if the *handling* of the attachment is primarily the application's responsibility.
    *   **How MailKit Contributes:** MailKit provides the necessary functionality to retrieve and make email attachments available to the application. This act of making the attachment accessible is the point where MailKit directly contributes to this attack surface.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends an email with a seemingly innocuous attachment that contains embedded malware. MailKit successfully retrieves this attachment, making it available for the application to process (and potentially execute or expose).
    *   **Impact:** Malware infection, data breach, compromise of the application or the user's system *after* the application interacts with the attachment provided by MailKit.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust antivirus and anti-malware scanning of all attachments *immediately* after they are retrieved by MailKit and before any further processing by the application.
        *   Restrict the types of attachments that are allowed to be processed by the application.
        *   Consider processing attachments in a sandboxed environment to limit the potential damage if a malicious attachment is encountered.

## Attack Surface: [SMTP Injection via MailKit's Sending Functionality](./attack_surfaces/smtp_injection_via_mailkit's_sending_functionality.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting the application's use of MailKit's SMTP client to send emails by injecting malicious commands into the SMTP protocol through improperly constructed email parameters.
    *   **How MailKit Contributes:** MailKit provides the API for constructing and sending emails. If the application uses this API without properly sanitizing or validating input that influences email construction (e.g., recipient addresses, headers, body), attackers can inject arbitrary SMTP commands.
    *   **Example:** An attacker manipulates an input field that is used to set a recipient address, injecting additional recipients or SMTP commands that cause MailKit to send emails to unintended targets or modify email content in a malicious way.
    *   **Impact:** Sending unauthorized emails (spam, phishing) appearing to originate from the application, potentially using the application as an open relay, reputational damage, and potential blacklisting of the application's sending infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly validate and sanitize all user inputs that are used to construct email messages *before* passing them to MailKit's sending functions.
        *   Utilize MailKit's API in a way that minimizes the risk of command injection. For example, use separate methods for adding recipients instead of concatenating strings.
        *   Implement rate limiting on email sending to mitigate the impact of successful injection attacks.
        *   Carefully review and test all code that uses MailKit to send emails to ensure proper input handling.
