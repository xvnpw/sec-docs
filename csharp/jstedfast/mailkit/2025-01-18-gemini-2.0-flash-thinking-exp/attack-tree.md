## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via MailKit Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_mailkit_exploitation.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this level means the attacker has gained unauthorized access or control over the application by exploiting weaknesses related to its email handling capabilities through MailKit.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Sending Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sending_functionality.md)

Attackers target the application's ability to send emails. By compromising this functionality, they can leverage the application as a platform for malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Content into Emails](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_content_into_emails.md)

Attackers aim to insert harmful content into emails sent by the application. This can be achieved through various methods.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious HTML/JavaScript in Email Body](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_htmljavascript_in_email_body.md)

Attackers inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the body of outgoing emails. If the recipient's email client renders this content without proper sanitization, it can lead to various attacks on the recipient, such as phishing, session hijacking, or drive-by downloads.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Attachments](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_attachments.md)

Attackers manipulate the application to send emails with malicious attachments. These attachments can contain malware, viruses, or other harmful software that can compromise the recipient's system when opened.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Receiving Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_receiving_functionality.md)

Attackers target how the application processes incoming emails. By exploiting vulnerabilities in this area, they can directly impact the application's security and functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Vulnerabilities in Email Parsing](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_vulnerabilities_in_email_parsing.md)

Attackers craft malicious emails designed to exploit weaknesses in how MailKit or the application parses email content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Body Parsing Bugs](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_body_parsing_bugs.md)

Attackers leverage vulnerabilities in how MailKit or the application handles the email body content. This can involve exploiting flaws in parsing HTML, MIME types, or other formatting elements.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious HTML/JavaScript in received email body](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_htmljavascript_in_received_email_body.md)

Similar to the sending side, attackers send emails with malicious HTML or JavaScript in the body. If the application renders this content without proper sanitization (e.g., in a web interface for viewing emails), it can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks within the application itself, potentially compromising user sessions or data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Attachment Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_attachment_handling.md)

Attackers focus on vulnerabilities related to how the application handles email attachments.

## Attack Tree Path: [Deliver Malicious Attachments](./attack_tree_paths/deliver_malicious_attachments.md)

Attackers send emails with malicious attachments, hoping the application will automatically process or save them without proper security checks. This can lead to malware infection or other system compromises on the application server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal via Attachment Filenames](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_via_attachment_filenames.md)

Attackers craft emails with attachment filenames that include path traversal characters (e.g., "..", "/") . If the application uses these unsanitized filenames when saving attachments, it can allow attackers to overwrite arbitrary files on the application's file system, potentially leading to code execution or data breaches.
