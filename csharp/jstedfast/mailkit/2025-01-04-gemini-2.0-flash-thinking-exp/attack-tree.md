## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Email Content -> Leverage Phishing/Social Engineering](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_email_content_-_leverage_phishingsocial_engineering.md)

* Attack Vector:
    * Attacker sends deceptive emails crafted to appear legitimate.
    * These emails aim to trick users into revealing sensitive information (credentials, personal data) or performing actions that compromise security (clicking malicious links, downloading malware).
    * MailKit is the transport mechanism for these phishing emails.
* Why High-Risk:
    * Likelihood: Very High (Phishing is a prevalent and often successful attack method).
    * Impact: Critical (Successful phishing can lead to credential compromise, data breaches, and further malicious activities).

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse MailKit Configuration -> Exploit Hardcoded Credentials -> Use compromised credentials](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_mailkit_configuration_-_exploit_hardcoded_credentials_-_use_compromised_credentials.md)

* Attack Vector:
    * Developers mistakenly embed email server credentials directly in the application code or configuration.
    * Attackers discover these hardcoded credentials through static analysis, reverse engineering, or accessing configuration files.
    * Using the compromised credentials, attackers gain direct access to the mail server.
* Why High-Risk:
    * Likelihood: Medium (Hardcoding credentials is a common developer error).
    * Impact: Critical (Full access to the email account allows attackers to send/receive emails, potentially access sensitive information, and pivot to other systems).

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse MailKit Configuration -> Use compromised credentials to access the mail server](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_mailkit_configuration_-_use_compromised_credentials_to_access_the_mail_server.md)

* Attack Vector:
    * Attackers obtain valid credentials for the mail server used by the application through various means (e.g., phishing, data breaches, insider threats).
    * They then directly use these compromised credentials to access the mail server, bypassing the application itself.
* Why High-Risk:
    * Likelihood: Medium (Depends on the security of the mail server credentials).
    * Impact: Critical (Full access to the email account, same as above).

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse MailKit Configuration -> Abuse Application's Email Sending Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_mailkit_configuration_-_abuse_application's_email_sending_functionality.md)

* Attack Vector:
    * The application's email sending functionality lacks proper authentication, authorization, or rate limiting.
    * Attackers exploit this to send spam, phishing emails, or other malicious content using the application's email infrastructure.
* Why High-Risk:
    * Likelihood: Medium (Depends on the security of the email sending implementation).
    * Impact: Moderate (Reputation damage, blacklisting of the application's email server, potential legal repercussions).

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse MailKit Configuration -> Exploit Insufficient Input Validation](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_mailkit_configuration_-_exploit_insufficient_input_validation.md)

* Attack Vector:
    * The application processes data extracted from emails without proper sanitization or validation.
    * Attackers craft malicious emails containing payloads that exploit these vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, command injection) when the application processes the email data.
* Why High-Risk:
    * Likelihood: Medium (Insufficient input validation is a common vulnerability).
    * Impact: Critical (Successful exploitation can lead to data breaches, arbitrary code execution on the application server, and complete system compromise).

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Buffer Overflow in Mail Parsing](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_buffer_overflow_in_mail_parsing.md)

* Attack Vector: Sending specially crafted emails with oversized headers or content to overflow internal buffers in MailKit during parsing.
    * Impact: Critical (Can lead to application crashes or, more severely, arbitrary code execution on the server).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Format String Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_format_string_vulnerability.md)

* Attack Vector: Sending emails with malicious format specifiers in headers or body that are processed by MailKit in a way that allows reading from or writing to arbitrary memory locations.
    * Impact: Critical (Can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerability (If applicable)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerability__if_applicable_.md)

* Attack Vector: Sending emails containing malicious serialized objects that MailKit attempts to deserialize.
    * Impact: Critical (Can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit implementation flaws in secure connection handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_implementation_flaws_in_secure_connection_handling.md)

* Attack Vector: Exploiting vulnerabilities in MailKit's TLS/SSL implementation to eavesdrop on or manipulate communication with the mail server.
    * Impact: Critical (Exposure of sensitive data like email credentials and email content).

## Attack Tree Path: [Deliver Malicious Attachments](./attack_tree_paths/deliver_malicious_attachments.md)

* Attack Vector: Sending emails with malicious attachments (executables, documents with macros) that exploit vulnerabilities on the recipient's machine when opened.
    * Impact: Critical (Can lead to code execution on the user's machine, data theft, and system compromise).

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Phishing/Social Engineering via MailKit](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_phishingsocial_engineering_via_mailkit.md)

* Attack Vector: Using MailKit to send deceptive emails to trick users.
    * Impact: Critical (Credential compromise, leading to further attacks).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Hardcoded Credentials in Application](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_hardcoded_credentials_in_application.md)

* Attack Vector: Discovering and using hardcoded email server credentials.
    * Impact: Critical (Full access to the email account).

## Attack Tree Path: [Perform Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on Mail Server connection](./attack_tree_paths/perform_man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_mail_server_connection.md)

* Attack Vector: Intercepting communication between the application and the mail server to steal credentials or manipulate data.
    * Impact: Critical (Exposure of credentials and communication).

## Attack Tree Path: [Use compromised credentials to access the mail server](./attack_tree_paths/use_compromised_credentials_to_access_the_mail_server.md)

* Attack Vector: Directly accessing the mail server using stolen credentials.
    * Impact: Critical (Full access to the email account).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insufficient Input Validation When Using Email Data](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insufficient_input_validation_when_using_email_data.md)

* Attack Vector: Injecting malicious code into emails that is then executed due to lack of sanitization when processed by the application.
    * Impact: Critical (Data breach, arbitrary code execution on the server).
