# Attack Surface Analysis for jstedfast/mailkit

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tlsssl_configuration.md)

**Description:** The application configures MailKit to use insecure TLS/SSL settings, such as disabling certificate validation or allowing outdated protocols (SSLv3, TLS 1.0/1.1).

**How MailKit Contributes:** MailKit provides options to configure `SslProtocols` and `ServerCertificateValidationCallback`, allowing developers to potentially weaken the security of the connection.

**Example:** An application sets `client.SslProtocols = SslProtocols.Ssl3;` or uses a `ServerCertificateValidationCallback` that always returns `true`.

**Impact:** Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks become possible, allowing attackers to eavesdrop on or modify email traffic, including credentials.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Enforce strong TLS/SSL protocols:**  Use `SslProtocols.Tls12` or higher.
*   **Enable and properly implement certificate validation:** Avoid custom `ServerCertificateValidationCallback` unless absolutely necessary and ensure it performs robust validation.
*   **Use secure connection options:**  Utilize `ConnectAsync(host, port, SecureSocketOptions.SslOnConnect)` or `SecureSocketOptions.StartTls` where appropriate.

## Attack Surface: [Email Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/email_header_injection.md)

**Description:** The application allows user-controlled data to be directly included in email headers (e.g., `To`, `Cc`, `Subject`) when constructing emails using MailKit.

**How MailKit Contributes:** MailKit's API allows setting header values directly. If these values are not sanitized, attackers can inject arbitrary headers.

**Example:** An application uses user input for the recipient's email address without validation: `message.To.Add(MailboxAddress.Parse(userInput));`. An attacker could input `attacker@example.com\nBcc: another@example.com` to send a hidden copy.

**Impact:** Spamming, phishing attacks, bypassing security filters, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Sanitize user input:**  Validate and sanitize all user-provided data before including it in email headers.
*   **Use structured methods:** Utilize MailKit's `MailboxAddress` class and other dedicated methods for adding recipients instead of directly manipulating header strings.

## Attack Surface: [HTML/Script Injection in Email Body](./attack_surfaces/htmlscript_injection_in_email_body.md)

**Description:** The application includes unsanitized user-provided content in the HTML body of outgoing emails sent via MailKit.

**How MailKit Contributes:** MailKit allows setting the `HtmlBody` property of a `MimeKit.MimeMessage`. If this content isn't sanitized, it can contain malicious scripts.

**Example:** An application includes user-generated comments directly in the email body: `message.HtmlBody = $"<p>{userInput}</p>";`. An attacker could input `<script>stealCookies();</script>`.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks within email clients, potentially leading to information theft or account compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Sanitize HTML content:**  Use a robust HTML sanitization library to remove potentially malicious scripts and tags before setting the `HtmlBody`.

## Attack Surface: [Attachment Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/attachment_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The application processes or saves attachments received via MailKit without proper validation or sanitization.

**How MailKit Contributes:** MailKit provides access to email attachments through the `Attachments` property of a `MimeKit.MimeMessage`. If the application blindly trusts and processes these attachments, vulnerabilities can arise.

**Example:** An application saves attachments to disk using the filename provided in the attachment header without sanitization: `attachment.Content.WriteTo(Path.Combine(uploadDir, attachment.FileName));`. An attacker could provide a filename like `../../malicious.exe`.

**Impact:** Malware distribution, path traversal vulnerabilities leading to unauthorized file access or overwriting.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Validate attachment types and content:**  Check the MIME type and potentially scan attachments for malware before processing them.
*   **Sanitize filenames:**  Do not directly use filenames from attachments when saving files. Generate unique and safe filenames.

## Attack Surface: [Credential Exposure](./attack_surfaces/credential_exposure.md)

**Description:** The application stores email credentials (usernames, passwords, OAuth tokens) insecurely, making them vulnerable to compromise when used with MailKit.

**How MailKit Contributes:** MailKit requires credentials to connect to mail servers. If these credentials are compromised, attackers can use MailKit (or any email client) to access the associated email account.

**Example:** Storing email passwords in plaintext in configuration files, which are then used to authenticate with MailKit.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of email accounts, allowing attackers to send and receive emails on behalf of the user.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Never store passwords in plaintext:** Use strong, one-way hashing algorithms with salts for password storage if direct password authentication is necessary.
*   **Utilize secure credential storage:** Leverage secure storage mechanisms provided by the operating system or cloud platform (e.g., Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault).
*   **Prefer OAuth 2.0:**  Use OAuth 2.0 for authentication whenever possible, avoiding the need to store user passwords directly.

## Attack Surface: [Connection String Injection](./attack_surfaces/connection_string_injection.md)

**Description:** The application dynamically constructs connection strings for MailKit based on user input or external data without proper sanitization.

**How MailKit Contributes:** MailKit's connection methods accept hostnames and ports. If these are built dynamically from untrusted sources, attackers can inject malicious server details, which MailKit will then attempt to connect to.

**Example:** An application takes a server name from user input: `client.Connect(userInput, port, SecureSocketOptions.SslOnConnect);`. An attacker could input a malicious server address.

**Impact:**  Redirecting email traffic to attacker-controlled servers, potentially capturing credentials or sensitive information.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid dynamic connection string construction from untrusted sources:**  Hardcode or securely configure allowed server addresses.
*   **Validate and sanitize input:** If dynamic construction is unavoidable, rigorously validate and sanitize any input used to build connection parameters.
