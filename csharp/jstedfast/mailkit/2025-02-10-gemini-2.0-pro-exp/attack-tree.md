            *   Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA).
            *   Avoiding storing credentials directly in the code; using secure credential storage.
            *   Monitoring for failed login attempts and implementing account lockout policies.

* **1.3 Injection:**
    *   **[1.3.2 Header Injection]:**
        *   **Description:** Injecting malicious email headers to conduct phishing attacks, spam, or email spoofing.

            *   Validate and sanitize all user-supplied header values.
            *   Encode header values properly.
            *   Consider using a whitelist of allowed headers.
