# Threat Model Analysis for jstedfast/mailkit

## Threat: [Header Injection (Email Spoofing)](./threats/header_injection__email_spoofing_.md)

*   **Threat:** Header Injection (Email Spoofing)

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when used to construct email headers *using MailKit's API*, injects additional headers or modifies existing ones. The attacker might try to spoof the sender's address ("From" header), add malicious "Bcc" recipients, or inject other headers to manipulate email routing or filtering. This is specifically about injecting headers within the email itself, leveraging how the application uses MailKit to build the message.

    *   **Impact:** Email Spoofing, Phishing, Data Exfiltration. Attackers can impersonate legitimate senders, trick users into revealing sensitive information, or redirect email traffic. Recipients may be added without their knowledge, leading to privacy violations.

    *   **Affected Component:** `MailKit.MimeMessage.From`, `MailKit.MimeMessage.To`, `MailKit.MimeMessage.Cc`, `MailKit.MimeMessage.Bcc`, `MailKit.MimeMessage.Headers.Add()`, and any methods used to set header values. The construction of `InternetAddressList` and `HeaderList` objects is critical. The vulnerability arises from how the application *uses* these MailKit components with untrusted input.

    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use MailKit's API Correctly:** *Always* use MailKit's API to construct headers programmatically. Avoid direct string concatenation or manipulation of raw header strings. Use `InternetAddress` and `MailboxAddress` objects for email addresses. This is paramount.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user input before using it to populate email headers *even when using MailKit's API*. Reject input containing newline characters (`\r`, `\n`) or other control characters. This is a defense-in-depth measure.
        *   **Whitelisting:** If possible, use a whitelist to restrict the set of allowed headers and header values, further limiting the attack surface.
        *   **Encoding:** Ensure that header values are properly encoded according to RFC specifications (e.g., using `MimeUtils.EncodePhrase` and `MimeUtils.EncodeAddress`) *through MailKit's API*.
        *   **Server-Side (SPF, DKIM, DMARC):** While not a MailKit-specific mitigation, implementing these email authentication mechanisms at the mail server level is crucial for preventing email spoofing.

## Threat: [MIME Bomb Denial of Service](./threats/mime_bomb_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Threat:** MIME Bomb Denial of Service

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted email with deeply nested MIME parts (a "MIME bomb"). The attacker aims to exhaust server resources (CPU, memory) during the parsing process *performed by MailKit*, causing the application to become unresponsive or crash. The attacker crafts the email with many layers of multipart content, potentially using compression to further amplify the effect. This threat directly targets MailKit's parsing capabilities.

    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). The application becomes unavailable to legitimate users. This can lead to service disruption, data loss (if unsaved data is present), and potential financial losses.

    *   **Affected Component:** `MimeKit.MimeParser`, `MimeKit.MimeMessage.Load()`, and related parsing functions within the `MimeKit` namespace (which MailKit depends on and directly utilizes). The core parsing logic is the primary target.

    *   **Risk Severity:** High

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Limit MIME Depth (MailKit Configuration):** Implement a maximum depth limit for MIME parsing. *Use MailKit's `MimeParser` and configure its `MaxMimeDepth` property*. Set this to a reasonable value (e.g., 10-20). This is a direct MailKit-level mitigation.
        *   **Resource Limits (Application Level):** Implement overall resource limits (memory, CPU time) for email processing. This can be done at the application level or using containerization.
        *   **Timeout (MailKit Usage):** Set a reasonable timeout for email processing *within your MailKit code*. If parsing takes too long, terminate the operation. Use asynchronous operations with cancellation tokens provided by MailKit.
        *   **Input Validation (Defense in Depth):** While not a complete solution, basic input validation (e.g., checking the size of the incoming email data) can help mitigate some attacks.
        *   **Dedicated Processing:** Consider using a separate process or queue for email processing to isolate the impact of a DoS attack.

## Threat: [Attachment Size Denial of Service](./threats/attachment_size_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Threat:** Attachment Size Denial of Service

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends an email with an extremely large attachment (or multiple large attachments). The attacker's goal is to consume excessive disk space, memory, or network bandwidth, leading to a denial-of-service condition. This directly impacts how MailKit handles attachment data.

    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). The application becomes unavailable, potentially due to disk space exhaustion, memory exhaustion, or network congestion.

    *   **Affected Component:** `MimeKit.MimeMessage.Attachments`, `MimeKit.MimePart.Content`, and functions related to accessing and processing attachment data *within MailKit*. The handling of `Stream` objects associated with attachments is crucial.

    *   **Risk Severity:** High

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Attachment Size Limits (MailKit Usage):** Implement strict limits on the maximum size of individual attachments and the total size of all attachments in an email. Check the `Content-Length` header (if available) *before processing the attachment using MailKit*.
        *   **Stream Processing (MailKit API):** *Process attachments as streams using MailKit's API rather than loading the entire content into memory at once*. Use `MimePart.Content.Open()` to obtain a stream and process it incrementally. This is a key MailKit-specific mitigation.
        *   **Temporary Storage:** If attachments need to be saved temporarily, use a designated temporary directory with limited storage capacity and appropriate permissions.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor disk space, memory usage, and network bandwidth during email processing. Implement alerts for unusual activity.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the rate at which emails with attachments are processed.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack during STARTTLS (Due to Improper MailKit Configuration)](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_during_starttls__due_to_improper_mailkit_configuration_.md)

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack during STARTTLS (Due to Improper MailKit Configuration)

    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the network connection between the MailKit client and the mail server. If STARTTLS is used *and MailKit is not configured to enforce strict security*, the attacker prevents the connection from being upgraded to TLS/SSL, forcing it to remain in plaintext. The attacker can then eavesdrop on the communication and potentially steal credentials or modify email content. The vulnerability stems from *incorrect usage of MailKit's security options*.

    *   **Impact:** Credential Theft, Data Breach, Email Tampering. The attacker can gain access to sensitive information and potentially manipulate email traffic.

    *   **Affected Component:** `MailKit.Net.Smtp.SmtpClient.Connect()`, `MailKit.Net.Imap.ImapClient.Connect()`, `MailKit.Security.SecureSocketOptions`. The handling of the `SecureSocketOptions` enum and the underlying TLS/SSL negotiation process *within MailKit* are critical. The *misconfiguration of MailKit* is the direct cause.

    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Prefer `SslOnConnect` (MailKit Configuration):** Whenever possible, *use `SecureSocketOptions.SslOnConnect` with MailKit* to establish a secure connection from the start. This avoids the STARTTLS handshake and the associated downgrade risk. This is the preferred and most secure approach using MailKit.
        *   **Require STARTTLS (with Strict Validation - MailKit Configuration):** If STARTTLS *must* be used, configure MailKit to *require* it and enforce strict certificate validation:
            *   Set `client.ServerCertificateValidationCallback` to a custom validation function that performs thorough checks (e.g., verifying the certificate chain, checking for revocation, validating the hostname). *This is a critical MailKit configuration step*.
            *   Do *not* accept self-signed certificates in production environments.
        *   **Monitor for Downgrades:** Implement monitoring to detect unexpected plaintext communication after a STARTTLS command. This is a more advanced technique.
        *   **Network Security:** Use secure network infrastructure (e.g., VPNs, firewalls) to protect the communication channel. This is a general mitigation, but important.
