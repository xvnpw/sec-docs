# Threat Model Analysis for jbogard/mediatr

## Threat: [Handler Bypass via Type Spoofing](./threats/handler_bypass_via_type_spoofing.md)

*   **Threat:** Handler Bypass via Type Spoofing

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious request object that *implements* the `IRequest<T>` or `INotification` interface (or a custom interface used with MediatR) but is *not* the expected type for a registered handler. The attacker sends this crafted request. Because MediatR uses the interface for dispatch, it might route the request to an unintended handler, or a less secure handler that inadvertently accepts the malformed type, bypassing intended security checks. This exploits MediatR's dynamic dispatch mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized execution of code, potential data breaches, bypassing security checks, or denial of service if the unintended handler is resource-intensive.
    *   **Affected Component:** MediatR's `Mediator` class (specifically, the `Send` and `Publish` methods, which handle request dispatch), and potentially any `IRequestHandler<TRequest, TResponse>` or `INotificationHandler<TNotification>` implementations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the application's security context).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Type Validation:** Implement robust validation *within* the request/command objects themselves (using data annotations, FluentValidation, or custom validation logic) to ensure the object's properties conform to the expected schema *before* MediatR processes it. This validates the *content* and *structure*.
        *   **Input Validation in Handlers:** Even with pre-MediatR validation, handlers should *always* validate the incoming request object as a first step. This acts as a second layer of defense. Never assume the request is valid.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic or `object` Types:** Do not use `dynamic` or `object` as the request type in handlers. Always use strongly-typed requests.
        *   **Sealed Request Classes (Recommended):** Consider making request/command classes `sealed` to prevent inheritance. This limits the possibility of unexpected subtypes being used.

## Threat: [Request Data Tampering within Pipeline](./threats/request_data_tampering_within_pipeline.md)

*   **Threat:** Request Data Tampering within Pipeline

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a custom `IPipelineBehavior` implementation. The malicious pipeline behavior modifies the request object *after* it has been dispatched by MediatR (using `Mediator.Send` or `Mediator.Publish`) but *before* it reaches the intended handler. This could involve changing sensitive data within the request, directly impacting the data MediatR passes to the handler.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized actions, bypassing security controls, potential elevation of privilege if the tampered data influences authorization decisions.
    *   **Affected Component:** Custom `IPipelineBehavior` implementations. The `Mediator` itself facilitates the pipeline execution, making it indirectly involved.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immutable Request Objects (Essential):** Make request/command objects immutable (read-only after creation). This is the *primary* defense against this threat. Use `record` types in C# or other techniques to enforce immutability.
        *   **Pipeline Behavior Auditing:** Thoroughly review and audit all custom `IPipelineBehavior` implementations. Look for any code that modifies the request object.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Pipeline Behaviors):** Ensure pipeline behaviors have only the necessary permissions. Avoid giving them broad access to system resources or sensitive data.
        *   **Unit and Integration Testing (Pipeline Behaviors):** Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for all pipeline behaviors, specifically testing for unintended side effects and data modification.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure via Exceptions within MediatR Pipeline](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_via_exceptions_within_mediatr_pipeline.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure via Exceptions within MediatR Pipeline

    *   **Description:** An exception is thrown within a handler (`IRequestHandler` or `INotificationHandler`) or a custom `IPipelineBehavior` *during MediatR's processing*. This exception contains sensitive data (e.g., database connection strings, API keys, user details) in its message or stack trace. If this exception is not handled properly *within the MediatR pipeline*, the sensitive data could be exposed.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential compromise of sensitive systems or data.
    *   **Affected Component:** `IRequestHandler<TRequest, TResponse>`, `INotificationHandler<TNotification>`, and custom `IPipelineBehavior` implementations (where exceptions might be thrown or handled). The `Mediator` is involved as it orchestrates the execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the exposed data).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Global Exception Handling (Pipeline Behavior):** Implement a custom `IPipelineBehavior` that acts as a global exception handler *within the MediatR pipeline*. This behavior should catch *all* exceptions originating from handlers or other behaviors, log them securely (without exposing sensitive data), and return a generic error message. This prevents the exception from propagating outside of MediatR's control.
        *   **Custom Exception Types:** Define custom exception types for different error scenarios. Avoid including sensitive data in the default exception message. Control what information is exposed in each exception type.
        *   **Secure Logging Practices:** Configure logging to avoid capturing sensitive data. Use redaction or masking techniques if necessary.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Handler Execution (through MediatR)](./threats/unauthorized_handler_execution__through_mediatr_.md)

*    **Threat:** Unauthorized Handler Execution (through MediatR)

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a request that, *through MediatR's dispatch mechanism*, is routed to a handler that they should not have access to, based on their authorization level. This bypasses intended security controls because MediatR is the component performing the routing.
    *   **Impact:** Elevation of privilege, unauthorized access to data or functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:** `IRequestHandler<TRequest, TResponse>` (the handler itself), `Mediator` (as the dispatcher), and potentially `IPipelineBehavior` if authorization is implemented there (but this is less recommended).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Authorization within Handlers (Strongly Recommended):** Perform authorization checks *within* each handler, *before* executing any sensitive operations. Use the application's existing authorization mechanisms (e.g., claims-based authorization, role-based access control). This ensures that even if MediatR routes the request, the handler itself enforces authorization.
        *   **Authorization Pipeline Behavior (Less Preferred):** If using a pipeline behavior for authorization, ensure it's placed *before* any other behaviors that might perform sensitive operations and is thoroughly tested. Handler-level authorization is generally more secure and easier to reason about.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Handlers):** Ensure handlers have only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
