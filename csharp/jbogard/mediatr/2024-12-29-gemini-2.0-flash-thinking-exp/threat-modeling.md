### High and Critical MediatR Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the MediatR library:

*   **Threat:** Unintended Handler Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a request that, due to vulnerabilities in **MediatR's** request routing logic or loose matching criteria, is processed by a handler not intended for that specific request. This could involve manipulating request parameters or exploiting weaknesses in how the **mediator** resolves handlers.
    *   **Impact:**  Data corruption if the unintended handler modifies data in an unexpected way, unauthorized access if the handler performs actions the attacker shouldn't have access to, or unexpected application behavior leading to instability.
    *   **Affected MediatR Component:** `IMediator` interface (specifically the `Send` or `Publish` methods), and the underlying handler resolution mechanism within **MediatR**.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strongly typed request objects to enforce strict matching between requests and handlers.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization *before* the request reaches the handler.
        *   Carefully design the request and handler structure to minimize ambiguity in routing.
        *   Implement authorization checks within handlers to ensure the user has the necessary permissions, even if a request is misrouted.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Handler Logic
    *   **Description:** A compromised or poorly written handler, registered with **MediatR**, contains malicious code that performs unauthorized actions, manipulates data incorrectly, or introduces further vulnerabilities. An attacker might exploit this by triggering the vulnerable handler through a legitimate or crafted request processed by **MediatR**.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, privilege escalation if the handler operates with elevated permissions, or denial of service if the handler consumes excessive resources.
    *   **Affected MediatR Component:** `IRequestHandler<TRequest, TResponse>` and `INotificationHandler<TNotification>` interfaces (the handler implementations themselves registered with **MediatR**).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement thorough code reviews for all handlers.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing handlers, including input validation, output encoding, and proper error handling.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege to handler permissions.
        *   Implement robust logging and auditing within handlers to track actions.

*   **Threat:** Data Injection into Handlers
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious data into a request object that is then passed through **MediatR** and processed by a handler without proper validation. This could involve manipulating request parameters or exploiting vulnerabilities in how data is passed to the handler via **MediatR**.
    *   **Impact:**  Similar to SQL injection or command injection, but within the application's internal logic. Could lead to data corruption, unauthorized actions, or even remote code execution if the handler processes the injected data unsafely.
    *   **Affected MediatR Component:** Request objects (classes implementing `IRequest<TResponse>` or used as notification payloads) used with **MediatR**, and the `IRequestHandler<TRequest, TResponse>` and `INotificationHandler<TNotification>` interfaces invoked by **MediatR**.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong input validation and sanitization at the application entry point *before* creating MediatR requests.
        *   Validate data within the request objects themselves using validation attributes or custom logic.
        *   Avoid directly using raw input within handlers without proper validation.

*   **Threat:** Pipeline Manipulation/Bypass
    *   **Description:** An attacker finds a way to manipulate the order of execution of pipeline behaviors registered with **MediatR** or bypass certain behaviors entirely. This could be due to vulnerabilities in the pipeline configuration or registration process within **MediatR**.
    *   **Impact:** Circumvention of security controls implemented in pipeline behaviors (e.g., authorization checks, logging), leading to unauthorized access or undetected malicious activity.
    *   **Affected MediatR Component:** `IPipelineBehavior<TRequest, TResponse>` interface and the mechanism for registering and ordering pipeline behaviors within **MediatR**.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the configuration and registration of **MediatR** pipelines.
        *   Ensure that critical pipeline behaviors are registered in a way that prevents easy manipulation or bypassing.
        *   Avoid dynamic or user-controlled pipeline configuration if possible.

*   **Threat:** Dynamic Handler Registration Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** If handler registration within **MediatR** is dynamic and based on external input or configuration that can be manipulated by an attacker, it could lead to the registration of malicious handlers or the hijacking of existing handlers.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution if a malicious handler is registered and executed by **MediatR**, or disruption of application functionality by replacing legitimate handlers.
    *   **Affected MediatR Component:** The mechanism used for registering handlers with the `IMediator` within **MediatR**, which might involve dependency injection containers or custom registration logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid dynamic handler registration based on untrusted input.
        *   If dynamic registration is necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization of the registration source.
        *   Use a secure and trusted mechanism for managing handler registrations within **MediatR**.

*   **Threat:** Potential for Deserialization Vulnerabilities (Indirect)
    *   **Description:** While **MediatR** itself doesn't directly handle deserialization of external input, if request objects or messages passed through **MediatR** are deserialized from untrusted sources, they could be vulnerable to deserialization attacks. An attacker could craft malicious serialized data to exploit this when it's processed by **MediatR**.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, or other security breaches depending on the deserialization vulnerability.
    *   **Affected MediatR Component:** Request objects (classes implementing `IRequest<TResponse>`) and notification objects used with `IMediator` within **MediatR**, particularly if they are populated through deserialization.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources into **MediatR** request objects or messages.
        *   If deserialization is necessary, use secure deserialization techniques and libraries.
        *   Implement input validation *before* deserialization.
