### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Request Manipulation -> Command/Query Injection & Authorization Bypass

This attack path focuses on how an attacker can manipulate requests to exploit vulnerabilities in MediatR applications, specifically leading to Command/Query Injection and Authorization Bypass.

#### 4.1. Request Manipulation

This is the starting point of the attack path. Attackers aim to manipulate various parts of an HTTP request to achieve their malicious goals. This can include:

*   **Query String Parameters:** Modifying values in the URL query string.
*   **Form Data:** Altering data submitted through HTML forms (e.g., POST requests).
*   **JSON/XML Request Bodies:** Manipulating data within structured request bodies commonly used in APIs.
*   **HTTP Headers:**  Less common for direct injection in this path, but headers can sometimes influence application behavior and be part of authorization bypass scenarios.

The success of request manipulation depends on how the MediatR application processes and validates these request components within its handlers.

#### 4.2. Command/Query Injection & Authorization Bypass

This node represents the two primary outcomes of successful request manipulation in this specific attack path. We will analyze each sub-node in detail.

##### 4.2.1. 1.1.2.1. Inject Malicious Code/Commands via Request Parameters [CRITICAL NODE: SQL/Command Injection]

*   **Threat:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities arising from the **unsafe use of request parameters** within MediatR handlers.  If handlers directly incorporate user-supplied input from request parameters into:
    *   **SQL Queries:** Constructing dynamic SQL queries without proper parameterization. This leads to **SQL Injection**.
    *   **Operating System Commands:** Executing system commands by concatenating user input. This leads to **Command Injection**.
    *   **Other Interpreted Languages/Engines:**  In less common scenarios, similar injection vulnerabilities could arise in other contexts if handlers dynamically construct code for other interpreters (e.g., LDAP queries, XPath queries, etc.).

    The core issue is the **lack of proper sanitization and parameterization** of user-controlled input before it is used in sensitive operations.  MediatR handlers, by design, are the components responsible for processing requests and interacting with backend systems. If these handlers are not coded securely, they become prime targets for injection attacks.

*   **Impact:** The impact of successful injection attacks can be devastating:
    *   **Data Breach (Confidentiality):**
        *   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries to extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, personal information, financial records, and proprietary business data. They can bypass application-level access controls and directly query the database.
        *   **Command Injection:** Attackers might gain access to configuration files, application code, or other sensitive files stored on the server's file system.
    *   **Data Manipulation (Integrity):**
        *   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database, leading to data corruption, business disruption, and potentially financial losses. They could alter user accounts, product information, or transaction records.
        *   **Command Injection:** Attackers could modify system configurations, application files, or even deploy malware on the server, leading to persistent compromise.
    *   **System Compromise (Availability & Integrity & Confidentiality):**
        *   **SQL Injection & Command Injection:** In severe cases, attackers can achieve **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**. This allows them to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the application process. This can lead to:
            *   **Full System Takeover:**  Gaining complete control of the server, installing backdoors, and using it for further attacks.
            *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Crashing the application or the server.
            *   **Lateral Movement:** Using the compromised server as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the network.

*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements (Strongest Mitigation for SQL Injection):**
        *   **Explanation:**  Instead of directly embedding user input into SQL query strings, use parameterized queries or prepared statements. These techniques separate the SQL code from the user-provided data. Placeholders are used in the SQL query, and the user input is passed as parameters to the database driver. The database driver then handles the proper escaping and quoting of the parameters, preventing SQL injection.
        *   **MediatR Context:** When handlers interact with databases (e.g., using Entity Framework Core, Dapper, or raw ADO.NET), ensure all database interactions utilize parameterized queries. Frameworks like EF Core often encourage or default to parameterized queries, but developers must be vigilant to avoid constructing raw SQL strings with string concatenation.
    *   **Input Sanitization/Validation (Defense in Depth):**
        *   **Explanation:**  Validate and sanitize all user inputs *before* they are used in any dynamic operations.
            *   **Validation:**  Ensure input conforms to expected formats, data types, lengths, and business rules. Reject invalid input.
            *   **Sanitization (Encoding/Escaping):**  Encode or escape special characters in user input that could be interpreted as code in the target context (e.g., SQL, shell commands). However, sanitization alone is often insufficient and error-prone as a primary defense against injection. **Parameterization is preferred for SQL injection.** Sanitization can be more relevant for preventing command injection if parameterization is not feasible for certain command execution scenarios (though parameterization is generally recommended even for command execution where possible).
        *   **MediatR Context:** Implement input validation within MediatR handlers or in a preceding pipeline behavior. Validation should occur as early as possible in the request processing pipeline. Libraries like FluentValidation can be integrated with MediatR for robust input validation.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Defense in Depth):**
        *   **Explanation:** Run database accounts and application processes with the minimum necessary permissions required for their operation.
            *   **Database Accounts:** Database accounts used by the application should only have permissions to access and modify the specific tables and columns they need. Avoid granting `db_owner` or `sysadmin` privileges.
            *   **Application Processes:**  The application server process should run with minimal operating system privileges. This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they achieve command injection.
        *   **MediatR Context:** Ensure the application's deployment environment adheres to the principle of least privilege. This is a general security best practice but is crucial in mitigating the impact of successful injection attacks in MediatR applications.

##### 4.2.2. 1.1.2.2. Manipulate Request Data to Bypass Authorization/Validation in Handlers [CRITICAL NODE: Authorization/Validation Bypass]

*   **Threat:** Attackers craft requests with specific data values designed to **circumvent authorization or validation logic** implemented within MediatR handlers. This exploits **logic flaws** in the handler's code, rather than injection vulnerabilities.  Common scenarios include:
    *   **Parameter Tampering:** Modifying request parameters (e.g., IDs, roles, flags) to gain unauthorized access to resources or functionalities. For example, changing a user ID in a request to access another user's profile.
    *   **Bypassing Validation Checks:**  Crafting input that bypasses validation rules due to incomplete or flawed validation logic. For example, submitting data that is technically valid but violates business rules that were not properly implemented in validation.
    *   **Exploiting Logic Errors in Authorization:**  Finding flaws in the authorization logic that allow unauthorized actions. For example, incorrect role checks, missing authorization checks for specific actions, or vulnerabilities in custom authorization implementations.
    *   **Race Conditions or Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Issues:** In complex scenarios, attackers might exploit race conditions where authorization checks are performed at one point, but the actual operation is performed later, and the authorization context might have changed in between. (Less common in typical MediatR handlers but possible in complex asynchronous scenarios).

    The vulnerability lies in **inadequate or flawed implementation of authorization and validation logic** within the MediatR handlers. Handlers are responsible for enforcing business rules and access controls. If these are not implemented correctly, attackers can manipulate requests to bypass these controls.

*   **Impact:** Successful authorization and validation bypass can lead to:
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Confidentiality & Integrity):**
        *   Gaining access to resources or functionalities that should be restricted to authorized users or roles. This could include viewing sensitive data, accessing administrative panels, or performing actions on behalf of other users.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Integrity & Confidentiality):**
        *   Performing actions with higher privileges than intended. For example, a regular user gaining administrative privileges or accessing data they are not supposed to see.
    *   **Data Manipulation (Integrity):**
        *   Modifying data without proper authorization. This could include altering other users' data, changing system configurations, or performing unauthorized transactions.
    *   **Business Logic Abuse (Integrity & Availability):**
        *   Circumventing business rules to gain unfair advantages, manipulate system behavior in unintended ways, or disrupt normal operations.

*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Robust Authorization Logic (Essential Mitigation):**
        *   **Explanation:** Implement comprehensive and well-tested authorization checks within MediatR handlers.
            *   **Centralized Authorization:**  Consider using a centralized authorization mechanism (e.g., policy-based authorization frameworks, dedicated authorization services) rather than scattering authorization checks throughout the handlers. This promotes consistency and maintainability.
            *   **Access Control Models:**  Choose an appropriate access control model (e.g., Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)) that aligns with the application's requirements.
            *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Authorization):** Grant users and roles only the minimum necessary permissions required to perform their tasks.
            *   **Consistent Enforcement:** Ensure authorization is consistently enforced across all relevant handlers and functionalities.
        *   **MediatR Context:** Implement authorization checks within MediatR handlers or using pipeline behaviors. Pipeline behaviors are particularly well-suited for cross-cutting concerns like authorization, allowing you to apply authorization logic before handlers are executed. .NET's built-in authorization framework can be effectively integrated with MediatR.
    *   **Thorough Input Validation (Defense in Depth):**
        *   **Explanation:** Validate all inputs against expected formats, ranges, and **business rules**. Validation should go beyond just data type and format checks.
            *   **Business Rule Validation:**  Validate input against application-specific business rules and constraints. For example, if a product ID must exist in the database, validate that the provided ID is valid.
            *   **Edge Case Handling:**  Consider edge cases and boundary conditions during validation to prevent unexpected data from bypassing validation logic.
            *   **Whitelisting (Preferred):**  Prefer whitelisting valid input values or formats over blacklisting invalid ones. Whitelisting is generally more secure as it explicitly defines what is allowed, rather than trying to anticipate all possible invalid inputs.
        *   **MediatR Context:** Implement comprehensive input validation within MediatR handlers or pipeline behaviors. Utilize validation libraries like FluentValidation to define and enforce validation rules effectively.
    *   **Security Testing (Verification & Continuous Improvement):**
        *   **Explanation:** Conduct thorough security testing to identify and fix logic flaws in handlers and authorization/validation logic.
            *   **Penetration Testing:**  Simulate real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities in authorization and validation.
            *   **Code Reviews:**  Have security experts or experienced developers review the code to identify potential logic flaws and security weaknesses.
            *   **Unit and Integration Tests (Security Focused):**  Write unit and integration tests specifically designed to test authorization and validation logic under various scenarios, including boundary conditions and malicious inputs.
            *   **Static and Dynamic Analysis Security Tools:** Utilize automated security scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
        *   **MediatR Context:** Integrate security testing into the development lifecycle of MediatR applications. Focus testing efforts on handlers and pipeline behaviors that handle sensitive operations and user input.
