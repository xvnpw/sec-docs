# Attack Surface Analysis for jbogard/mediatr

## Attack Surface: [1. Handler Implementation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/1__handler_implementation_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws within request handler code (e.g., injection flaws, business logic errors) that can be directly exploited.
*   **How MediatR contributes to the attack surface:** MediatR dispatches requests directly to handlers. Vulnerable handlers become easily accessible attack vectors through MediatR's dispatch mechanism.
*   **Example:** A handler vulnerable to SQL injection allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries by sending crafted requests through MediatR, leading to data breaches.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access, data manipulation, privilege escalation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Secure Coding:** Enforce secure coding practices in all handlers (input validation, parameterized queries, output encoding).
    *   **Rigorous Security Testing:** Implement comprehensive security testing (SAST, DAST, penetration testing) specifically targeting handlers.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant handlers only necessary permissions to minimize impact of compromise.

## Attack Surface: [2. Pipeline Interception and Manipulation (Custom Pipelines)](./attack_surfaces/2__pipeline_interception_and_manipulation__custom_pipelines_.md)

*   **Description:**  Custom pipeline behaviors, if insecurely designed, can bypass security controls, introduce new vulnerabilities, or modify requests/responses maliciously.
*   **How MediatR contributes to the attack surface:** MediatR's pipeline feature allows injecting custom logic into request processing. Insecure pipelines become part of the attack surface exposed via MediatR's request flow.
*   **Example:** A poorly written authorization pipeline behavior might incorrectly bypass intended authorization checks, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive handlers and data.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, security control bypass, data manipulation, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Pipeline Design Principles:** Design custom pipelines with security as a primary concern. Follow secure coding guidelines.
    *   **Mandatory Pipeline Review:**  Require thorough security reviews for all custom pipeline behaviors before deployment.
    *   **Minimize Pipeline Complexity:** Keep pipeline logic simple and focused to reduce potential for errors and vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [3. Information Disclosure through Error Handling (Potentially Escalating to High Risk)](./attack_surfaces/3__information_disclosure_through_error_handling__potentially_escalating_to_high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  Improper error handling in MediatR pipelines or handlers can leak sensitive information (stack traces, internal paths) to attackers.
*   **How MediatR contributes to the attack surface:** MediatR's error propagation can expose internal error details if not configured securely, providing valuable reconnaissance information to attackers.
*   **Example:** An exception in a handler reveals database connection strings or internal server paths in the error response propagated through MediatR, aiding attackers in further exploitation.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, aiding attacker reconnaissance, potential for privilege escalation or further exploitation based on revealed information.
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium, escalating to High in scenarios where disclosed information facilitates further critical attacks.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Generic Error Responses:** Configure MediatR and application to return generic, non-revealing error messages to clients.
    *   **Secure Error Logging:** Log detailed errors securely for debugging, but prevent exposure to users or external systems.
    *   **Centralized Exception Handling:** Implement robust, centralized exception handling to sanitize error responses and prevent information leakage.

## Attack Surface: [4. Notification Handling Misuse for Security-Sensitive Events (Potentially Escalating to High Risk)](./attack_surfaces/4__notification_handling_misuse_for_security-sensitive_events__potentially_escalating_to_high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Misuse of MediatR's notification system for security-critical events can lead to unauthorized access or actions if handlers are compromised or notifications are not secured.
*   **How MediatR contributes to the attack surface:** MediatR's notification system broadcasts events. If used for security-sensitive events without proper controls, it can become a channel for unauthorized access or information leakage.
*   **Example:** A notification for successful user login containing user roles is published. A malicious or compromised handler subscribes and intercepts this notification to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, privilege escalation, information disclosure, data manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium, escalating to High in scenarios where misuse leads to privilege escalation or unauthorized actions on sensitive data.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Sensitive Data in Notifications:** Minimize or eliminate sensitive data in notification payloads. Use identifiers and retrieve details securely within handlers.
    *   **Restrict Notification Handlers:** Strictly control which handlers can subscribe to security-sensitive notifications using authorization mechanisms.
    *   **Secure Notification Handlers:** Apply secure coding practices to all notification handlers, especially those handling security-sensitive events.
    *   **Consider Alternatives:** Evaluate if notifications are the most secure pattern for security-critical actions; consider direct command/query patterns for better control.
