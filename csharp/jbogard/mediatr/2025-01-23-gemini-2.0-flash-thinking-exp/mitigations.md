## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement robust input validation within each handler.](./mitigation_strategies/implement_robust_input_validation_within_each_handler.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify all MediatR request objects:** For every command and query handled by MediatR in your application, pinpoint the corresponding request object classes.
2.  **Define validation rules *specific to handler logic*:**  Establish validation rules for each property within these request objects, considering the *business logic* executed within the handlers. This goes beyond basic model validation and focuses on rules relevant to the handler's operation.
3.  **Implement validation logic *inside the Handle method*:**  Within the `Handle` method (or equivalent) of each MediatR handler, insert validation logic at the beginning to scrutinize the incoming request object against the defined rules *before* any business logic execution.
4.  **Utilize validation libraries *within handlers* (recommended):** Employ validation libraries like FluentValidation or DataAnnotations directly within the handlers to streamline and standardize validation logic *at the handler level*.
5.  **Return informative error responses *from handlers*:** If validation fails within a handler, ensure the handler returns clear and informative error responses, indicating validation failures. These responses should be handled appropriately within the application's response pipeline.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Input Validation Vulnerabilities *exploitable through MediatR requests* (High Severity):**  Prevents injection attacks (SQL, XSS, Command Injection) and other input-based exploits that could be triggered by crafting malicious MediatR requests.
*   **Data Integrity Issues *arising from handler processing of invalid data* (Medium Severity):**  Reduces errors and data corruption caused by handlers processing invalid or unexpected data received via MediatR requests.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) *via malformed MediatR requests* (Medium Severity):**  Mitigates DoS attempts that exploit handlers by sending excessively large or malformed MediatR requests.

**Impact:**
*   **Input Validation Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction - Directly reduces the risk of injection attacks and input-based exploits targeting MediatR handlers.
*   **Data Integrity Issues:** High Risk Reduction - Significantly improves data integrity by ensuring handlers operate on valid data.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via malformed MediatR requests:** Medium Risk Reduction - Mitigates DoS vectors specifically targeting handler input processing.

**Currently Implemented:** Partial - Input validation is present in API controllers, but not consistently and explicitly implemented *within MediatR handlers* to validate business logic constraints.

**Missing Implementation:**  Input validation needs to be systematically implemented *inside all MediatR handlers*, focusing on business logic validation and not just relying on controller-level checks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce authorization checks within handlers.](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_authorization_checks_within_handlers.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Define authorization requirements *per MediatR request*:** For each MediatR command and query, clearly define the authorization level or permissions needed to execute the corresponding handler.
2.  **Implement authorization logic *directly in the Handle method*:**  Within each handler's `Handle` method, implement authorization checks *before* any business logic or data access is performed. This ensures authorization is enforced at the point of execution within MediatR.
3.  **Utilize authorization services *from within handlers*:** Integrate your application's authorization framework (e.g., ASP.NET Core Authorization Policies, custom services) and invoke these services *directly from within the handlers* to perform authorization checks.
4.  **Check user permissions *based on the MediatR request context*:**  Verify if the current user (or system context associated with the MediatR request) has the necessary permissions to execute the specific handler and operation.
5.  **Return authorization error responses *from handlers*:** If authorization fails within a handler, ensure the handler returns appropriate error responses (e.g., exceptions or specific result objects) that can be translated into 403 Forbidden or 401 Unauthorized responses at the API level.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Access *to functionalities exposed through MediatR* (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from executing commands or queries and accessing functionalities managed by MediatR handlers.
*   **Privilege Escalation *via MediatR request manipulation* (High Severity):**  Reduces the risk of attackers manipulating MediatR requests to bypass authorization checks and gain elevated privileges within the application's business logic.
*   **Data Breaches *due to unauthorized handler execution* (High Severity):** Protects sensitive data by ensuring only authorized handlers can access and manipulate data through MediatR.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** High Risk Reduction - Directly prevents unauthorized access to functionalities orchestrated by MediatR.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** High Risk Reduction - Makes privilege escalation attempts via MediatR much harder by enforcing handler-level authorization.
*   **Data Breaches due to unauthorized handler execution:** High Risk Reduction - Substantially lowers the risk of data breaches resulting from unauthorized access to data through MediatR handlers.

**Currently Implemented:** Partial - Authorization is primarily at the API controller level.  Authorization checks within MediatR handlers are inconsistent and not systematically enforced.

**Missing Implementation:**  Authorization checks need to be consistently and thoroughly implemented *within all MediatR handlers*, especially those handling sensitive operations or data access.  Shift authorization focus from controllers to handlers for MediatR driven logic.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement handler timeouts.](./mitigation_strategies/implement_handler_timeouts.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify potentially long-running MediatR handlers:** Analyze your MediatR handlers and pinpoint those that might take a long time to execute due to complex operations, external API calls initiated *within handlers*, or database queries performed *by handlers*.
2.  **Configure timeouts *within asynchronous handlers*:** For asynchronous MediatR handlers (`IRequestHandler<TRequest, Task<TResponse>>`), implement timeout mechanisms *directly within the handler's logic*. Use `CancellationTokenSource` and `Task.Delay` or similar techniques to enforce timeouts on asynchronous operations performed by the handler.
3.  **Implement circuit breaker pattern *for external dependencies called by handlers* (optional but recommended):** For handlers that rely on external services or databases, implement a circuit breaker pattern *around the external calls made within the handler*. This prevents cascading failures and stops handlers from hanging indefinitely when external dependencies are unavailable.
4.  **Monitor *MediatR handler* execution times:** Implement monitoring to specifically track the execution times of MediatR handlers. Set up alerts for handlers that exceed predefined time thresholds, indicating potential performance issues or DoS attempts targeting specific handlers.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) *through long-running MediatR requests* (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from causing DoS by sending requests that trigger handlers designed to take an excessively long time, thus exhausting server resources through MediatR.
*   **Resource Exhaustion *due to runaway MediatR handlers* (High Severity):**  Limits resource consumption by preventing handlers from running indefinitely and consuming excessive server resources (CPU, memory, threads) when triggered via MediatR.

**Impact:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) through long-running MediatR requests:** High Risk Reduction - Timeouts directly prevent DoS attacks that exploit long-running handlers initiated through MediatR.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** High Risk Reduction - Reduces resource exhaustion caused by poorly performing or maliciously designed MediatR handlers.

**Currently Implemented:** No - Handler timeouts are not explicitly implemented *within MediatR handlers*.  Asynchronous handlers are used, but no timeout mechanisms are in place *inside the handler logic*.

**Missing Implementation:**  Implement timeout mechanisms *within potentially long-running asynchronous MediatR handlers*. Explore circuit breaker patterns for handlers interacting with external dependencies *from within their Handle methods*.  Implement monitoring specifically for MediatR handler execution times.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) in handlers.](./mitigation_strategies/adhere_to_the_single_responsibility_principle__srp__in_handlers.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Analyze *MediatR handler* responsibilities:** Review each MediatR handler and ensure it has a single, well-defined responsibility *within the context of MediatR request processing*. Handlers should focus on a specific business operation triggered by a MediatR request.
2.  **Break down complex *MediatR handlers*:** If a handler performs multiple unrelated operations *in response to a single MediatR request*, refactor it into smaller, more focused handlers. Consider if these operations should be separate MediatR requests or coordinated through other means.
3.  **Utilize MediatR pipelines for cross-cutting concerns *related to handler execution*:**  Move cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, validation, authorization, transaction management) *that are relevant to MediatR request handling* out of individual handlers and into MediatR pipeline behaviors. This keeps handlers focused on their core business logic triggered by MediatR.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Logic Errors and Vulnerabilities *within complex MediatR handlers* (Medium Severity):** Complex handlers are harder to understand, test, and secure, increasing the risk of logic errors and security vulnerabilities *within the MediatR processing flow*.
*   **Reduced Auditability *of complex MediatR handlers* (Medium Severity):**  Complex handlers are harder to audit and review for security vulnerabilities, making it more difficult to ensure the security of the MediatR request handling logic.

**Impact:**
*   **Logic Errors and Vulnerabilities within complex MediatR handlers:** Medium Risk Reduction - Simplifies handler logic, making it easier to identify and prevent vulnerabilities *in the MediatR processing*.
*   **Reduced Auditability:** Medium Risk Reduction - Improves code readability and maintainability of handlers, making security audits of MediatR logic more effective.

**Currently Implemented:** Partial - Handlers generally follow SRP principles, but some MediatR handlers might still be more complex than ideal and could benefit from refactoring to further simplify their responsibilities *within the MediatR context*.

**Missing Implementation:**  Conduct a code review specifically focused on *MediatR handler* complexity and SRP adherence. Refactor overly complex handlers into smaller, more focused units *within the MediatR command/query structure*. Ensure cross-cutting concerns *related to MediatR handling* are consistently managed through pipelines.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly review and audit handler code.](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_review_and_audit_handler_code.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Establish a regular code review process *for MediatR handlers*:**  Incorporate security considerations into your code review process specifically for all MediatR handlers.
2.  **Include security experts in *MediatR handler* code reviews:**  Involve security experts or developers with security expertise in code reviews of MediatR handlers to identify potential vulnerabilities and security flaws *within the handler logic*.
3.  **Use static analysis tools *on MediatR handler code*:**  Employ static analysis security testing (SAST) tools to automatically scan *MediatR handler code* for common security weaknesses, such as injection vulnerabilities, insecure data handling, and authorization issues *within the handler implementations*.
4.  **Perform periodic security audits *of MediatR handlers*:**  Conduct periodic security audits specifically targeting MediatR handler code, especially after significant changes or updates to the MediatR request handling logic.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unidentified Vulnerabilities *in MediatR Handlers* (High Severity):**  Code reviews and audits help identify and remediate security vulnerabilities that might be present in MediatR handlers and missed during development.
*   **Logic Errors *in MediatR Handlers* leading to security issues (Medium Severity):**  Reviews can catch logic errors within handlers that could be exploited for security breaches through MediatR request manipulation.
*   **Compliance Violations *related to MediatR handler security* (Medium Severity):**  Audits can help ensure MediatR handlers comply with security policies and regulatory requirements related to data handling and access control within the MediatR processing flow.

**Impact:**
*   **Unidentified Vulnerabilities in MediatR Handlers:** High Risk Reduction - Proactively identifies and fixes vulnerabilities in MediatR handlers before they can be exploited.
*   **Logic Errors in MediatR Handlers leading to security issues:** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk of security issues arising from logic errors within MediatR handlers.
*   **Compliance Violations related to MediatR handler security:** Medium Risk Reduction - Helps ensure compliance with security standards specifically within the MediatR handler implementations.

**Currently Implemented:** Partial - Code reviews are conducted for all code changes, including MediatR handlers, but security is not always a primary focus *specifically for handler code*. Static analysis tools are not regularly used *for MediatR handler code*.

**Missing Implementation:**  Enhance code review process to explicitly include security checklists and security-focused reviews *specifically for MediatR handlers*. Integrate static analysis tools into the development pipeline to automatically scan *MediatR handler code* for vulnerabilities. Establish a schedule for periodic security audits *specifically of MediatR handlers*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Carefully configure MediatR pipelines.](./mitigation_strategies/carefully_configure_mediatr_pipelines.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Review *MediatR pipeline* behaviors:**  Carefully examine all MediatR pipeline behaviors (if used) and thoroughly understand their functionality and potential security implications *within the MediatR request processing pipeline*.
2.  **Ensure *pipeline* behaviors are secure:**  Verify that pipeline behaviors themselves are implemented securely and do not introduce new vulnerabilities *into the MediatR pipeline*. Pay close attention to input validation, authorization, and error handling *within the behaviors*.
3.  **Control *MediatR pipeline* behavior order:**  Be mindful of the order in which pipeline behaviors are configured in the MediatR pipeline, as the order can significantly affect the execution flow and security of MediatR requests. Ensure behaviors are ordered logically and securely, e.g., authorization before validation.
4.  **Limit *pipeline* behavior scope (if possible):**  If certain behaviors are only needed for specific types of MediatR requests, configure them to apply only to those requests to minimize their potential impact and attack surface *within the MediatR pipeline*.
5.  **Audit *MediatR pipeline* configuration:**  Regularly audit the MediatR pipeline configuration to ensure it remains secure and aligned with security requirements *for MediatR request processing*.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Vulnerabilities introduced by *MediatR pipeline* behaviors (Medium Severity):**  Insecurely implemented pipeline behaviors can introduce new vulnerabilities into the application's MediatR request processing flow.
*   **Bypass of security checks due to incorrect *MediatR pipeline* order (Medium Severity):**  Incorrect behavior order in the MediatR pipeline can lead to security checks being bypassed or performed in an ineffective sequence for MediatR requests.
*   **Performance issues due to inefficient *MediatR pipelines* (Low Severity):**  Inefficient MediatR pipeline configurations can impact application performance and potentially contribute to DoS scenarios by slowing down MediatR request handling.

**Impact:**
*   **Vulnerabilities introduced by MediatR pipeline behaviors:** Medium Risk Reduction - Ensures MediatR pipeline behaviors are secure and do not introduce new weaknesses into the MediatR processing flow.
*   **Bypass of security checks due to incorrect MediatR pipeline order:** Medium Risk Reduction - Prevents security checks from being bypassed due to misconfiguration of the MediatR pipeline.
*   **Performance issues due to inefficient MediatR pipelines:** Low Risk Reduction - Optimizes MediatR pipeline performance and reduces potential performance-related security risks within MediatR request handling.

**Currently Implemented:** Partial - MediatR pipelines are used for logging and validation, but the security of pipeline behaviors and the pipeline configuration itself has not been explicitly reviewed from a security perspective *specifically for MediatR*.

**Missing Implementation:**  Conduct a security review of all MediatR pipeline behaviors and the MediatR pipeline configuration. Document the intended behavior order and security considerations for the MediatR pipeline. Implement unit tests for pipeline behaviors to ensure their security and functionality *within the MediatR context*.
