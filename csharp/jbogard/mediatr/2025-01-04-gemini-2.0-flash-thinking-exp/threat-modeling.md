# Threat Model Analysis for jbogard/mediatr

## Threat: [Unintended Handler Execution](./threats/unintended_handler_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a request with the intent of triggering a handler that they are not authorized to execute or that performs actions outside the intended scope of the request. This could be achieved by manipulating request parameters or exploiting vulnerabilities in the request routing logic *within MediatR's handling process*.

**Impact:**  The attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data, modify data they shouldn't, or trigger unintended application behavior *due to the execution of the wrong handler via MediatR*.

**Affected MediatR Component:** `IMediator.Send` or `IMediator.Publish`, specifically the internal logic that maps requests to handlers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong input validation and sanitization on all request parameters *before they are used by MediatR to determine the target handler*.
*   Use explicit and well-defined request-to-handler mappings, avoiding dynamic or overly flexible routing logic based on user-controlled input *that could influence MediatR's handler selection*.
*   Implement authorization checks within handlers to ensure the user has the necessary permissions to execute the requested operation *once the handler is invoked by MediatR*.
*   Thoroughly test request routing logic *within the MediatR configuration* to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Handler Denial of Service](./threats/handler_denial_of_service.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests targeting a specific handler known to be resource-intensive. This overwhelms the application's resources, making it unresponsive to legitimate users *by overloading MediatR's processing pipeline*.

**Impact:**  Application unavailability, degraded performance for other users, potential infrastructure instability *due to excessive handler execution orchestrated by MediatR*.

**Affected MediatR Component:** The specific `IRequestHandler` or `INotificationHandler` implementation *that is invoked by MediatR* and is resource-intensive.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement rate limiting on API endpoints or specific handlers *that are accessed via MediatR*.
*   Implement timeouts for handler execution to prevent indefinite blocking *within MediatR's processing*.
*   Optimize resource-intensive handlers or offload them to background processes or dedicated services *to reduce the load on MediatR's main processing thread*.
*   Monitor handler execution times and resource consumption to identify potential bottlenecks *within the MediatR flow*.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Handler Response](./threats/information_disclosure_via_handler_response.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a request that, when processed by a handler *invoked by MediatR*, returns sensitive information that the attacker is not authorized to access. This could be due to insufficient access controls within the handler or the handler inadvertently including sensitive data in its response.

**Impact:** Exposure of confidential data, potentially leading to compliance violations, reputational damage, or further attacks *as a result of information returned through MediatR*.

**Affected MediatR Component:** The specific `IRequestHandler` implementation *that is executed by MediatR* and the data it returns.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust authorization checks within handlers to ensure the user has the necessary permissions to access the requested data *before MediatR returns the handler's response*.
*   Carefully review handler logic to prevent the inclusion of sensitive information in responses that the user is not authorized to see *when the response is delivered via MediatR*.
*   Filter and sanitize handler responses to remove any unnecessary or sensitive data *before MediatR completes the request processing*.

## Threat: [Malicious Pipeline Behavior](./threats/malicious_pipeline_behavior.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control over or introduces a malicious `IPipelineBehavior` into the MediatR pipeline. This behavior can intercept and manipulate requests or responses, potentially logging sensitive information, altering data, or even preventing requests from reaching their intended handlers *within MediatR's processing flow*.

**Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized access, information disclosure, denial of service, or complete compromise of application functionality *due to malicious code executing within the MediatR pipeline*.

**Affected MediatR Component:** `IPipelineBehavior` implementations and the mechanism for registering and executing them *within MediatR*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review and audit all pipeline behaviors.
*   Implement strong access control for modifying or adding pipeline behaviors *to the MediatR configuration*.
*   Consider using signed or verified behaviors if feasible.
*   Avoid dynamically loading or registering pipeline behaviors based on external or untrusted input *that could influence MediatR's pipeline*.

## Threat: [Bypass of Security Behaviors in Pipeline](./threats/bypass_of_security_behaviors_in_pipeline.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits misconfiguration or vulnerabilities in the order of execution of pipeline behaviors to bypass security-related behaviors (e.g., authorization, validation). This allows malicious requests to reach handlers without proper scrutiny *within MediatR's processing*.

**Impact:**  Security vulnerabilities remain unchecked, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other security breaches *as a result of MediatR skipping security checks*.

**Affected MediatR Component:** The `IPipelineBehavior` implementations and the order in which they are registered and executed *by MediatR*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully design and test the order of pipeline behaviors, ensuring security behaviors are executed early in the pipeline *within MediatR's configuration*.
*   Implement unit and integration tests to verify the correct execution order and functionality of the pipeline *as defined for MediatR*.
*   Establish clear guidelines and documentation for adding and modifying pipeline behaviors *within the MediatR setup*.

## Threat: [Malicious Notification Handler](./threats/malicious_notification_handler.md)

**Description:** A compromised or malicious notification handler performs unintended or harmful actions upon receiving a notification *published via MediatR*. This could include modifying data, triggering external processes, or leaking information.

**Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized actions, information disclosure, or potential compromise of other systems *as a consequence of a malicious handler reacting to a MediatR notification*.

**Affected MediatR Component:** `INotificationHandler` implementations *that are invoked by MediatR*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review and audit all notification handlers.
*   Implement strong authorization checks within notification handlers before performing sensitive actions *upon receiving a MediatR notification*.
*   Isolate notification handlers and limit their access to sensitive resources.

## Threat: [Dependency Injection Container Compromise Leading to Malicious Handlers/Behaviors](./threats/dependency_injection_container_compromise_leading_to_malicious_handlersbehaviors.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control over the application's dependency injection container and registers malicious implementations of `IRequestHandler`, `INotificationHandler`, or `IPipelineBehavior` *that are then used by MediatR*.

**Impact:**  Complete compromise of application functionality, data breaches, and the ability to execute arbitrary code within the application context *through MediatR's execution of the malicious components*.

**Affected MediatR Component:** The integration point between MediatR and the application's dependency injection container (e.g., `services.AddMediatR(...)`) *which allows MediatR to resolve its dependencies*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the dependency injection container and ensure only trusted components can register dependencies.
*   Implement integrity checks on the dependency injection configuration.
*   Regularly audit registered dependencies for unexpected or malicious entries *that MediatR might be using*.
