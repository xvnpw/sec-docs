# Attack Surface Analysis for jbogard/mediatr

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Request Handler Execution](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_request_handler_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can directly trigger request handlers without proper authorization or input validation.
    *   **How MediatR Contributes:** MediatR facilitates the direct mapping of requests to handlers. If the mechanism for receiving and dispatching requests lacks security checks, it becomes easier to target specific handlers.
    *   **Example:** An API endpoint directly correlates to a `CreateUserRequest`. Without authentication, an attacker can send a crafted request to this endpoint, bypassing intended UI flows or authorization logic.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data modification, creation, or deletion; access to sensitive information managed by the handler.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization checks *before* dispatching requests through MediatR.
        *   Avoid directly exposing internal request types as API endpoints without proper security layers.
        *   Enforce input validation within the handlers themselves to prevent malformed or malicious data from being processed.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Notification Broadcast](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_notification_broadcast.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information is included in notifications and inadvertently broadcast to handlers that shouldn't have access.
    *   **How MediatR Contributes:** MediatR's publish/subscribe nature means notifications are sent to all registered handlers. If not carefully designed, sensitive data might be included in notifications intended for a subset of handlers.
    *   **Example:** A `UserCreatedNotification` includes the user's password hash (even if it's hashed). A logging handler, intended for general events, now has access to this sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Leakage of confidential information to unauthorized components or potential attackers if logs are compromised.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully design notification payloads to only include necessary information for the intended recipients.
        *   Avoid including highly sensitive data directly in notifications. Consider using identifiers and fetching details within the specific handler.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Side Effects through Crafted Notifications](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_side_effects_through_crafted_notifications.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers publish crafted notifications to trigger unintended actions or side effects in other parts of the application.
    *   **How MediatR Contributes:** MediatR allows any component with access to the `IMediator` instance to publish notifications. If not properly controlled, this can be abused.
    *   **Example:** An attacker publishes a `PaymentProcessedNotification` with manipulated data, causing a handler to incorrectly update an account balance.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized actions, business logic violations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement authorization checks before allowing the publication of certain notifications.
        *   Validate the data within notification handlers to ensure it's within expected parameters.
        *   Design notification handlers to be idempotent where possible to mitigate the impact of repeated or malicious notifications.

## Attack Surface: [Bypassing Security Pipelines](./attack_surfaces/bypassing_security_pipelines.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers find ways to circumvent security checks implemented as MediatR pipeline behaviors.
    *   **How MediatR Contributes:** While pipelines offer a centralized way to handle cross-cutting concerns like security, vulnerabilities in the pipeline configuration or execution flow can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A pipeline behavior checks for a specific user role. An attacker finds a way to send a request that bypasses this behavior (e.g., through a different entry point that doesn't use the pipeline or by manipulating the request in a way the pipeline doesn't recognize).
    *   **Impact:** Failure to enforce security policies, leading to unauthorized access or actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure all relevant entry points for requests go through the defined MediatR pipeline.
        *   Carefully design pipeline behavior ordering and ensure all critical security checks are executed.
        *   Avoid relying solely on pipeline behaviors for security; implement defense-in-depth with checks in handlers as well.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Pipeline Behavior Injection (if dynamically loaded)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_pipeline_behavior_injection__if_dynamically_loaded_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows dynamic loading or registration of pipeline behaviors, attackers could inject malicious code.
    *   **How MediatR Contributes:** While not inherent to MediatR itself, if the application's architecture allows for dynamic registration of `IPipelineBehavior` implementations, this becomes an attack vector.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability to upload a malicious DLL containing a `MaliciousLoggingBehavior` that logs sensitive data to an external server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application, including data exfiltration, code execution, and denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid dynamic loading of pipeline behaviors unless absolutely necessary and with extremely strict controls.
        *   Implement strong code signing and verification for any dynamically loaded components.
        *   Restrict access to the mechanism for registering pipeline behaviors.
