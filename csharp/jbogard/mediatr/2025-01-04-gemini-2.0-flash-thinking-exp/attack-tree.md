## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Vulnerable Message Handlers (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vulnerable_message_handlers__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers target message handlers that have security vulnerabilities due to improper handling of input data or flawed logic.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, denial of service, or other significant compromises.
*   **Why it's Critical:** This is a common and often easily exploitable entry point if handlers are not developed with security in mind. It directly aligns with the core functionality of MediatR, making it a prime target.

## Attack Tree Path: [Crafting Malicious Message Payloads (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/crafting_malicious_message_payloads__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers construct message payloads specifically designed to exploit vulnerabilities in message handlers. This involves crafting data that triggers unintended behavior.
*   **Impact:** The impact depends on the vulnerability being exploited, ranging from data manipulation to complete system compromise.
*   **Why it's Critical:** This is a necessary step for many attacks targeting message handlers. Preventing the crafting of malicious payloads is a fundamental security control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Injecting Malicious Data (e.g., SQL, Command) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/injecting_malicious_data__e_g___sql__command___high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Steps:**
    *   The attacker crafts a message payload containing malicious data.
    *   This malicious data is intended to be interpreted as code or commands by the vulnerable message handler (e.g., in a database query or system call).
    *   The application executes the malicious data, leading to unauthorized actions.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on the presence of vulnerable handlers that directly use message data in sensitive operations without proper sanitization.
*   **Impact:** High - Can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or arbitrary command execution on the server.
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Readily available tools and techniques exist for crafting injection payloads.
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium - Basic understanding of injection vulnerabilities is sufficient for many common cases.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Can be detected with proper input validation and security monitoring, but might require specific rules.

## Attack Tree Path: [Injecting Malicious Handlers (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/injecting_malicious_handlers__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Steps:**
    *   The attacker exploits weaknesses in the application's handler registration process. This could involve insecure dependency injection configurations or flaws in dynamic handler registration mechanisms.
    *   The attacker manages to register their own malicious handler with the MediatR pipeline.
    *   When a specific message type is published, the attacker's malicious handler is invoked instead of, or in addition to, the intended handler.
    *   The malicious handler can then perform arbitrary actions within the application's context.
*   **Likelihood:** Low - Exploiting DI or dynamic registration often requires a deeper understanding of the application's internal workings.
*   **Impact:** High - Successful injection of a malicious handler allows for complete control over message processing, potentially leading to full application compromise.
*   **Effort:** Medium to High - Requires a good understanding of the application's architecture and potentially advanced techniques to manipulate the registration process.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High - Requires expertise in dependency injection and application internals.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High - Detecting malicious handler injection can be difficult without specific monitoring of the registration process and code integrity checks.
