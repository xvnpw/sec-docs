# Threat Model Analysis for jbogard/mediatr

## Threat: [Malicious Handler Implementation](./threats/malicious_handler_implementation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit a vulnerability or intentionally introduce malicious code within a registered request or notification handler. This could happen if the development team doesn't follow secure coding practices, uses vulnerable dependencies within handlers, or if an attacker gains unauthorized access to modify the codebase. The attacker might craft specific requests or trigger notifications *processed by these MediatR handlers* to execute this malicious code.

**Impact:**  The impact can range from data breaches, data manipulation, to denial of service. In severe cases, it could lead to remote code execution on the server.

**Affected MediatR Component:** `IRequestHandler<TRequest, TResponse>`, `IRequestHandler<TRequest>`, `IStreamRequestHandler<TRequest, TResponse>`, `INotificationHandler<TNotification>`

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement secure coding practices for all handlers.
*   Regularly review and audit handler code.
*   Employ static and dynamic code analysis tools.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege within handlers.
*   Keep dependencies used within handlers up-to-date.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion in Handlers](./threats/resource_exhaustion_in_handlers.md)

**Description:** An attacker could send requests or trigger notifications that cause a specific *MediatR handler* to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, I/O). This could be due to inefficient algorithms within the handler, unbounded loops, or excessive external calls. The attacker might repeatedly send these resource-intensive requests to cause a denial of service.

**Impact:** Application slowdown, temporary unavailability of specific features, or complete application crash due to resource exhaustion.

**Affected MediatR Component:** `IRequestHandler<TRequest, TResponse>`, `IRequestHandler<TRequest>`, `IStreamRequestHandler<TRequest, TResponse>`, `INotificationHandler<TNotification>`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement performance testing and profiling for handlers.
*   Set appropriate timeouts for external calls within handlers.
*   Implement pagination or other mechanisms to handle large datasets efficiently.
*   Consider using asynchronous operations.
*   Implement rate limiting or request throttling.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Handlers](./threats/information_disclosure_via_handlers.md)

**Description:** *MediatR handlers* might inadvertently expose sensitive information through error messages, logging, or the response data. An attacker could craft specific requests or trigger scenarios that lead to the disclosure of this information.

**Impact:** Leakage of sensitive data such as user credentials, personal information, or internal system details.

**Affected MediatR Component:** `IRequestHandler<TRequest, TResponse>`, `IRequestHandler<TRequest>`, `IStreamRequestHandler<TRequest, TResponse>`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid logging sensitive information.
*   Implement proper error handling and avoid exposing detailed error messages.
*   Carefully review the response data returned by handlers.
*   Implement appropriate authorization and access control.

## Threat: [Malicious Pipeline Behavior](./threats/malicious_pipeline_behavior.md)

**Description:** An attacker with the ability to register *MediatR pipeline behaviors* (e.g., through a compromised dependency or insecure configuration) could inject a behavior that intercepts requests or responses. This behavior could log sensitive data, modify the request before it reaches the handler, or alter the response before it's returned.

**Impact:** Data breaches, manipulation of application logic, or injection of malicious content into responses.

**Affected MediatR Component:** `IPipelineBehavior<TRequest, TResponse>`, `IRequestPreProcessor<TRequest>`, `IRequestPostProcessor<TRequest, TResponse>`

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the process of registering pipeline behaviors.
*   Thoroughly review and audit all registered pipeline behaviors.
*   Implement strong access controls to prevent unauthorized modification of the MediatR configuration.
*   Consider using signed or verified components for pipeline behaviors.

## Threat: [Sensitive Information Disclosure via Notifications](./threats/sensitive_information_disclosure_via_notifications.md)

**Description:** *MediatR notifications* might broadcast sensitive information that unauthorized components or even external observers (if not properly secured) can access. This is especially a risk if the notification infrastructure is not properly secured or if handlers subscribe to notifications they shouldn't have access to.

**Impact:** Leakage of sensitive data to unauthorized parties.

**Affected MediatR Component:** `INotification`, `INotificationHandler<TNotification>`, `IPublisher`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid including sensitive information directly in notification payloads.
*   Implement proper authorization and access control for notification handlers.
*   If sensitive information is necessary, consider encrypting the notification payload.
*   Secure the underlying notification infrastructure if it involves external systems.

## Threat: [Malicious Notification Handlers](./threats/malicious_notification_handlers.md)

**Description:** Similar to malicious request handlers, a registered *MediatR notification handler* could contain vulnerabilities or malicious logic that is triggered when a specific notification is published.

**Impact:**  Similar to malicious request handlers, ranging from data breaches and manipulation to denial of service or remote code execution.

**Affected MediatR Component:** `INotificationHandler<TNotification>`

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Apply the same secure coding practices and review processes as for request handlers.
*   Implement proper authorization to control which components can register as notification handlers.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Notifications](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_notifications.md)

**Description:** A large volume of *MediatR notifications* or inefficient notification handlers can consume excessive resources, potentially leading to a denial of service. An attacker could intentionally trigger a flood of notifications to overwhelm the system.

**Impact:** Application slowdown, temporary unavailability of notification-dependent features, or complete application crash.

**Affected MediatR Component:** `INotification`, `INotificationHandler<TNotification>`, `IPublisher`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement rate limiting or throttling for notification publishing.
*   Optimize notification handlers for performance.
*   Consider using asynchronous processing for notification handling.
*   Implement circuit breakers.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Handler/Behavior Registration](./threats/unauthorized_handlerbehavior_registration.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains the ability to register their own malicious *MediatR handlers or pipeline behaviors*. This could be due to vulnerabilities in the registration mechanism or insecure configuration.

**Impact:** Allows the attacker to inject malicious code into the application's request processing pipeline.

**Affected MediatR Component:**  The registration mechanism used in conjunction with MediatR (e.g., dependency injection container configuration).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the configuration of the dependency injection container used with MediatR.
*   Implement strong access controls to prevent unauthorized modification of the registration configuration.
*   Regularly audit the registered handlers and behaviors.

## Threat: [Handler/Behavior Replacement](./threats/handlerbehavior_replacement.md)

**Description:** An attacker replaces legitimate *MediatR handlers or behaviors* with malicious ones. This could happen if the registration mechanism is vulnerable or if the attacker gains access to the configuration.

**Impact:**  Allows the attacker to control the processing of requests and notifications.

**Affected MediatR Component:** The registration mechanism used in conjunction with MediatR (e.g., dependency injection container configuration).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong integrity checks for the registration configuration.
*   Use secure storage for configuration data.
*   Implement access controls to restrict who can modify the registration configuration.
