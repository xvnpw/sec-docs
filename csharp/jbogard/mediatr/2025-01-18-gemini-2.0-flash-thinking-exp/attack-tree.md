## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Exploit Weaknesses in Request/Command/Notification Handling (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_exploit_weaknesses_in_requestcommandnotification_handling__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers target vulnerabilities arising from how the application handles incoming requests, commands, and notifications processed by MediatR. This includes flaws in data validation, business logic within handlers, and the handling of serialized data.
* **Potential Impact:** Can lead to data breaches, system compromise, unauthorized access, data manipulation, and remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Malicious Payload Injection in Request/Command Data (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_malicious_payload_injection_in_requestcommand_data__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft malicious input within the data of requests, commands, or notifications. If handlers don't properly sanitize or validate this data, it can lead to injection vulnerabilities.
* **Potential Impact:**
    * **SQL Injection:**  Malicious SQL code injected into database queries, allowing attackers to read, modify, or delete data.
    * **Command Injection:**  Malicious commands injected into system calls, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    * **Path Traversal:**  Manipulation of file paths to access unauthorized files or directories.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Handler Logic Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_handler_logic_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Flaws in the business logic implemented within individual handlers can be exploited. This could involve bypassing authorization checks or manipulating data in unintended ways.
* **Potential Impact:**
    * **Bypassing Authorization:** Gaining access to resources or functionalities without proper authorization.
    * **Data Manipulation:** Modifying data in a way that benefits the attacker or harms the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if applicable) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_deserialization_vulnerabilities__if_applicable___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** If requests or commands are serialized before being passed through MediatR, and then deserialized by handlers, vulnerabilities in the deserialization process can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code.
* **Potential Impact:** Remote Code Execution - Attackers can gain complete control over the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Manipulate the MediatR Pipeline](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_manipulate_the_mediatr_pipeline.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to interfere with the sequence of operations performed on requests and commands by manipulating the MediatR pipeline.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Inject Malicious Pipeline Behaviors](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_inject_malicious_pipeline_behaviors.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers find ways to register their own custom pipeline behaviors that intercept requests/commands. These malicious behaviors can introduce malicious logic.
* **Potential Impact:**
    * **Credential Theft:** Logging sensitive data like passwords or API keys.
    * **Data Modification:** Altering request data before it reaches the intended handler.
    * **Denial of Service:** Preventing legitimate handlers from executing.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Weaknesses in Handler Registration/Discovery](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_weaknesses_in_handler_registrationdiscovery.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers target the mechanism by which MediatR identifies and registers handlers.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Register Malicious Handlers (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_register_malicious_handlers__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers find ways to register their own malicious handlers that will be invoked for specific request/command types.
* **Potential Impact:** Arbitrary Code Execution - Attackers can execute any code they want when a specific request or command is processed. This grants them significant control over the application's functionality.
