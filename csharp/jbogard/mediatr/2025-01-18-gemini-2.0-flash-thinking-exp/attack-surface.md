# Attack Surface Analysis for jbogard/mediatr

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Request/Command/Query Payloads](./attack_surfaces/malicious_requestcommandquery_payloads.md)

**Description:** Attackers craft malicious data within requests, commands, or queries intended for specific handlers. This data aims to exploit vulnerabilities in the handler's logic.

**How MediatR Contributes:** MediatR acts as the dispatcher, routing these potentially malicious payloads to the designated handlers. It doesn't inherently sanitize or validate the data.

**Example:** An attacker sends a command to update a user's email address with a script tag as the new email. If the handler doesn't sanitize this input and it's later displayed on a web page, it could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact:**  Can lead to various issues depending on the handler's functionality, including data manipulation, unauthorized actions, code execution (if the handler interacts with external systems unsafely), or denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Input Validation in Handlers:** Implement robust input validation within each handler to ensure data conforms to expected types, formats, and ranges.
* **Data Sanitization:** Sanitize input data within handlers before processing or storing it, especially when dealing with user-provided content.
* **Consider Using Strongly Typed Requests/Commands/Queries:** This can help enforce data types at compile time and reduce the risk of unexpected data.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Access to Handlers](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_access_to_handlers.md)

**Description:** Attackers attempt to trigger handlers they are not authorized to execute, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or functionality.

**How MediatR Contributes:** MediatR facilitates the execution of handlers based on the dispatched request. If authorization checks are not implemented *before* dispatching, MediatR will blindly execute the handler.

**Example:** An attacker directly calls the `Send` method with a command to delete a user account, bypassing any intended UI or business logic authorization checks.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion; privilege escalation; circumvention of business rules.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Implement Authorization Checks Before Dispatch:**  Integrate authorization logic *before* calling `Send` or `Publish`. This can be done in a central location or within pipeline behaviors.
* **Use Authorization Attributes or Policies:** Leverage framework-provided authorization mechanisms (e.g., ASP.NET Core Authorization) and apply them to the handlers or the request types.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure handlers only have access to the resources they absolutely need.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Pipeline Behaviors](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_pipeline_behaviors.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities within custom pipeline behaviors that are executed before or after handlers.

**How MediatR Contributes:** MediatR's pipeline mechanism allows developers to inject custom logic. If this logic is flawed, it can introduce vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A logging pipeline behavior that logs request data without sanitization could be exploited to inject malicious scripts into log files, potentially compromising systems that process those logs.

**Impact:**  Information disclosure, code execution (if the behavior interacts with external systems unsafely), denial of service, or manipulation of the request/response flow.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Secure Coding Practices in Behaviors:**  Apply the same security principles to pipeline behaviors as to any other application code, including input validation and output encoding.
* **Thoroughly Review Custom Behaviors:**  Conduct code reviews and security testing of all custom pipeline behaviors.
* **Limit the Scope of Behaviors:** Ensure behaviors have a clear and limited responsibility to reduce the potential impact of vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Event Publishing Mechanism](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_event_publishing_mechanism.md)

**Description:** Attackers trigger the publishing of malicious or unexpected events, leading to unintended consequences in other parts of the application that subscribe to these events.

**How MediatR Contributes:** MediatR's `Publish` method allows for decoupled communication through events. If not secured, this mechanism can be abused.

**Example:** An attacker triggers an event indicating a successful payment, even though no actual payment occurred, potentially leading to the premature release of goods or services.

**Impact:**  Data inconsistencies, unauthorized actions in other parts of the system, business logic violations.

**Risk Severity:** Medium

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Authorization for Event Publishing:** Implement checks to ensure only authorized components or users can publish specific types of events.
* **Event Validation:**  Subscribers should validate the data within received events to ensure it's legitimate and expected.
* **Consider Event Signing:**  Use cryptographic signatures to verify the authenticity and integrity of published events.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure through Error Handling in Pipelines](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_through_error_handling_in_pipelines.md)

**Description:**  Detailed error messages or stack traces generated during MediatR pipeline execution are exposed to the client, revealing sensitive information.

**How MediatR Contributes:**  The default error handling in MediatR might propagate exceptions and their details. If not handled properly, this information can leak.

**Example:** An exception in a pipeline behavior reveals the database connection string or internal file paths in the error message returned to the user.

**Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive application details, aiding attackers in understanding the system's architecture and potential vulnerabilities.

**Risk Severity:** Medium

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Centralized Exception Handling:** Implement global exception handling mechanisms that log detailed errors securely but return generic error messages to the client.
* **Avoid Exposing Stack Traces:**  Ensure stack traces are not included in error responses sent to the client in production environments.
* **Careful Logging:** Log detailed error information securely and ensure access to logs is restricted.
