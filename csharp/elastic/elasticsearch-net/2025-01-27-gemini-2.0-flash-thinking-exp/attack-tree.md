## Attack Tree Path: [2. Abuse Insecure Configuration/Usage of Elasticsearch-net (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/2__abuse_insecure_configurationusage_of_elasticsearch-net__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This high-risk path encompasses vulnerabilities arising from how the application is configured to use Elasticsearch-net and how the library is used in the application code. Misconfigurations and insecure coding practices are common and easily exploitable.

    *   **2.1. Connection String Manipulation/Exposure**
        *   **Threat:**  Vulnerabilities related to the Elasticsearch connection string, including manipulation and exposure of sensitive information within it.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **2.1.1. Connection String Injection:**
                *   **2.1.1.1. Redirect to Malicious Elasticsearch Instance:**
                    *   **Threat:** If the connection string is dynamically constructed using user input without proper validation, an attacker can inject malicious parameters to redirect the application to a rogue Elasticsearch instance.
                    *   **Attack Scenario:** Attacker manipulates input fields to inject connection string parameters, causing the application to connect to an attacker-controlled Elasticsearch server.
                    *   **Actionable Insights:** Parameterize connection string construction, validate all input used in connection string building, avoid dynamic construction if possible.
                *   **2.1.1.2. Credential Theft via Logging/Error Messages:**
                    *   **Threat:**  Sensitive credentials within the connection string might be unintentionally logged or exposed in error messages.
                    *   **Attack Scenario:** Application logs or error pages inadvertently reveal the connection string, including credentials, allowing attackers to steal them.
                    *   **Actionable Insights:**  Sanitize logs to remove sensitive information, implement secure error handling that doesn't expose internal details, avoid logging connection strings directly.
            *   **2.1.2. Hardcoded Credentials in Connection String:**
                *   **2.1.2.1. Credential Exposure via Code Review/Reverse Engineering:**
                    *   **Threat:** Hardcoding credentials directly in the code or configuration files makes them easily discoverable.
                    *   **Attack Scenario:** Attackers gain access to source code or compiled application (via code review, reverse engineering, or repository access) and extract hardcoded credentials.
                    *   **Actionable Insights:** Never hardcode credentials. Use secure credential management systems (environment variables, secrets vaults).
                *   **2.1.2.2. Credential Exposure via Configuration File Access:**
                    *   **Threat:**  Storing credentials in configuration files without proper access controls can lead to exposure.
                    *   **Attack Scenario:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to configuration files (e.g., via web server misconfiguration, file inclusion vulnerabilities) and retrieve credentials.
                    *   **Actionable Insights:** Secure configuration files with appropriate file system permissions, use encrypted configuration where possible, avoid storing sensitive data in plain text configuration files.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2. Insecure Query Construction (Elasticsearch Query Language Injection) (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/2_2__insecure_query_construction__elasticsearch_query_language_injection___high-risk_path_&_critical_ee953b6c.md)

*   **Description:** This is a critical vulnerability where user input is directly incorporated into Elasticsearch queries without proper sanitization, leading to Elasticsearch Query Language Injection.
        *   **Critical Node:** **2.2.1. Unsanitized User Input in Queries**
        *   **Threat:** Attackers can inject malicious Elasticsearch query clauses, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, deletion, or denial of service.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **2.2.1.1. Data Exfiltration via Query Injection:**
                *   **Threat:** Attackers can craft queries to extract sensitive data they are not authorized to access.
                *   **Attack Scenario:** Attacker injects query clauses to bypass access controls and retrieve data from Elasticsearch.
                *   **Actionable Insights:** Use parameterized queries, sanitize user input rigorously, implement allow-lists for query parameters, apply principle of least privilege for Elasticsearch user.
            *   **2.2.1.2. Data Modification/Deletion via Query Injection:**
                *   **Threat:** Attackers can inject queries to modify or delete data in Elasticsearch, compromising data integrity.
                *   **Attack Scenario:** Attacker injects query clauses to update or delete documents in Elasticsearch.
                *   **Actionable Insights:** Use parameterized queries, sanitize user input, implement strict access controls on data modification operations, enable audit logging for data changes.
            *   **2.2.1.3. Denial of Service via Resource Intensive Queries:**
                *   **Threat:** Attackers can inject queries that consume excessive Elasticsearch resources, leading to denial of service.
                *   **Attack Scenario:** Attacker crafts complex or resource-intensive queries that overload the Elasticsearch server.
                *   **Actionable Insights:** Implement query complexity limits, set timeouts for queries, monitor Elasticsearch performance, sanitize user input to prevent injection of resource-intensive clauses.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3. Excessive Permissions for Elasticsearch-net User (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/2_3__excessive_permissions_for_elasticsearch-net_user__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  Granting overly broad permissions to the Elasticsearch user used by the application amplifies the impact of other vulnerabilities.
        *   **Critical Node:** **2.3.1. Elasticsearch User with Broad Privileges**
        *   **Threat:** If the Elasticsearch user has excessive privileges, attackers can leverage these permissions to cause significant damage if they compromise the application or exploit query injection.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **2.3.1.1. Unauthorized Data Access due to Excessive Permissions:**
                *   **Threat:**  User can access data beyond their intended scope due to overly permissive roles.
                *   **Attack Scenario:**  Compromised application or query injection allows access to sensitive data because the Elasticsearch user has broad read permissions.
                *   **Actionable Insights:** Apply principle of least privilege, grant only necessary permissions to the Elasticsearch user, use role-based access control in Elasticsearch.
            *   **2.3.1.2. Unauthorized Data Modification/Deletion due to Excessive Permissions:**
                *   **Threat:** User can modify or delete data due to overly permissive roles, leading to data integrity issues.
                *   **Attack Scenario:** Compromised application or query injection allows data modification or deletion because the Elasticsearch user has write/delete permissions.
                *   **Actionable Insights:** Apply principle of least privilege, grant only necessary permissions, strictly control write/delete permissions, implement audit logging.
            *   **2.3.1.3. Cluster Instability due to Excessive Permissions:**
                *   **Threat:**  In extreme cases (e.g., granting cluster admin rights to application user - less likely but possible misconfiguration), excessive permissions could lead to cluster-wide instability.
                *   **Attack Scenario:** Compromised application or malicious actions via application user could destabilize the entire Elasticsearch cluster.
                *   **Actionable Insights:** Never grant cluster admin rights to application users unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution, strictly limit permissions, monitor cluster health.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.4. Insecure Data Handling/Serialization in Application Code (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/2_4__insecure_data_handlingserialization_in_application_code__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how the application handles data before sending it to Elasticsearch or after retrieving it can lead to security issues, especially concerning sensitive data.
        *   **Critical Node:** **2.4.1. Exposing Sensitive Data in Elasticsearch Documents**
        *   **Threat:**  Storing sensitive data in Elasticsearch without proper protection (masking, encryption) makes it vulnerable to data breaches.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **2.4.1.1. Data Breach via Elasticsearch Data Access:**
                *   **Threat:** Sensitive data stored in Elasticsearch documents is exposed if Elasticsearch is compromised or accessed without proper authorization.
                *   **Attack Scenario:** Attackers gain access to Elasticsearch data (via application vulnerability, Elasticsearch server vulnerability, or misconfiguration) and retrieve sensitive information.
                *   **Actionable Insights:** Minimize sensitive data indexed, mask or encrypt sensitive data before indexing, implement access controls within Elasticsearch to restrict data access.
            *   **2.4.2. Improper Sanitization of Data Before Indexing:**
                *   **2.4.2.1. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
                    *   **Threat:** Indexing unsanitized user input can lead to Stored XSS if this data is later displayed in the web application.
                    *   **Attack Scenario:** Attacker injects malicious scripts into user input, which is indexed into Elasticsearch. When the application retrieves and displays this data, the XSS payload is executed in users' browsers.
                    *   **Actionable Insights:** Sanitize user input before indexing, especially if it will be displayed in a web context, use output encoding when displaying data retrieved from Elasticsearch.
