# Attack Surface Analysis for elastic/elasticsearch-net

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection through Query Parameters](./attack_surfaces/data_injection_through_query_parameters.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious code or commands into Elasticsearch queries by manipulating user-controlled input that is used to construct queries via `elasticsearch-net`. This occurs when application code fails to properly sanitize or parameterize user input before incorporating it into Elasticsearch queries built using `elasticsearch-net`'s query building features.
**elasticsearch-net Contribution:** `elasticsearch-net` provides flexible query building methods (e.g., `QueryStringQuery`, `MatchQuery`) that, if misused by directly embedding unsanitized user input, create injection points.
**Example:** Application code uses `elasticsearch-net` to build a search query based on user input for product names:
```csharp
var userInputProductName = GetUserInput(); // User input from request
var searchResponse = client.Search<Product>(s => s
    .Query(q => q
        .QueryString(qs => qs
            .Query(userInputProductName) // Unsanitized user input directly in query
        )
    )
);
```
An attacker could input a malicious string like `Laptop OR _exists_:sensitive_field` into `userInputProductName`.  `elasticsearch-net` will execute this crafted query against Elasticsearch, potentially bypassing intended search logic and exposing sensitive data (`sensitive_field`) that should not be accessible.
**Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, data modification, data deletion within Elasticsearch. In some configurations, it could potentially lead to limited command execution on the Elasticsearch server.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strict Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs *before* they are used to construct Elasticsearch queries within `elasticsearch-net`. Use allow-lists and escape special characters relevant to Elasticsearch query syntax.
*   **Utilize Parameterized Queries and Query Builders:** Leverage `elasticsearch-net`'s query builder methods (e.g., `MatchQuery`, `TermQuery`, `BoolQuery`) which inherently handle input more safely than directly constructing query strings. Avoid using `QueryStringQuery` with unsanitized user input.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege (Elasticsearch User):** Configure the Elasticsearch user used by `elasticsearch-net` with the minimum necessary permissions to limit the potential damage from a successful injection attack.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Connection Configuration (HTTP)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_connection_configuration__http_.md)

**Description:**  `elasticsearch-net` is configured to communicate with the Elasticsearch cluster over unencrypted HTTP. This exposes all communication, including potentially sensitive query data and Elasticsearch credentials, to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
**elasticsearch-net Contribution:** `elasticsearch-net`'s `ConnectionSettings` allows specifying the Elasticsearch endpoint URI. If the URI scheme is `http://` instead of `https://`, `elasticsearch-net` will establish an unencrypted connection.
**Example:**  `elasticsearch-net` client is initialized with an HTTP endpoint:
```csharp
var settings = new ConnectionSettings(new Uri("http://elasticsearch.example.com:9200")); // HTTP - Insecure
var client = new ElasticClient(settings);
```
All data transmitted between the application (using `elasticsearch-net`) and the Elasticsearch server, including query parameters, request bodies, and response data, is sent in plaintext over the network.
**Impact:** Confidentiality breach - sensitive data transmitted to and from Elasticsearch can be intercepted. Credentials used for Elasticsearch authentication (if passed in the URI or headers) can be exposed. Potential for man-in-the-middle attacks to modify data in transit.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Enforce HTTPS for Elasticsearch Connections:**  Always configure `elasticsearch-net` to use `https://` in the Elasticsearch endpoint URI within `ConnectionSettings`.
*   **Enable TLS/SSL on Elasticsearch:** Ensure the Elasticsearch cluster itself is configured to enforce TLS/SSL encryption for all incoming connections.
*   **Network Security Best Practices:** Implement network security measures like firewalls and network segmentation to further protect the communication channel between the application and Elasticsearch.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Elasticsearch Credentials](./attack_surfaces/exposed_elasticsearch_credentials.md)

**Description:** Elasticsearch credentials required by `elasticsearch-net` for authentication are stored insecurely, making them easily accessible to attackers. This compromises the security of the Elasticsearch cluster.
**elasticsearch-net Contribution:** `elasticsearch-net`'s `ConnectionSettings` allows various methods for providing authentication credentials (e.g., `BasicAuthentication`, API keys). If these credentials are hardcoded directly in the application code or stored in easily accessible configuration files in plaintext, it creates a critical vulnerability.
**Example:** Credentials hardcoded directly in the `elasticsearch-net` initialization:
```csharp
var settings = new ConnectionSettings(new Uri("https://elasticsearch.example.com:9200"))
    .BasicAuthentication("elastic", "P@$$wOrd"); // Hardcoded credentials - Highly Insecure!
var client = new ElasticClient(settings);
```
Or credentials stored in a plain text configuration file committed to source control or accessible via web server misconfiguration.
**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Elasticsearch cluster. Attackers can gain full administrative access, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, deletion, denial of service, and potentially further lateral movement within the infrastructure.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Never Hardcode Credentials:**  Absolutely avoid hardcoding credentials directly in application code.
*   **Secure Credential Storage:** Utilize secure methods for storing and retrieving Elasticsearch credentials:
    *   **Environment Variables:** Store credentials as environment variables, accessed at runtime by the application.
    *   **Secrets Management Systems:** Employ dedicated secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to securely store, manage, and rotate credentials.
    *   **Encrypted Configuration:** If configuration files are used, encrypt them and ensure secure decryption mechanisms are in place.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege (Credentials):** Use dedicated service accounts with minimal necessary permissions for `elasticsearch-net` connections to Elasticsearch.
*   **Regular Credential Rotation:** Implement a policy for regular rotation of Elasticsearch credentials.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** `elasticsearch-net` relies on third-party libraries (dependencies). Known vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited through applications using `elasticsearch-net`, even if the application code itself is secure.
**elasticsearch-net Contribution:** `elasticsearch-net`, like most .NET libraries, depends on NuGet packages. If these dependencies contain security vulnerabilities, they become part of the attack surface of any application using `elasticsearch-net`.
**Example:**  `elasticsearch-net` might depend on a specific version of a JSON serialization library that has a known deserialization vulnerability. If an attacker can control or influence data processed by `elasticsearch-net` that utilizes this vulnerable dependency (e.g., through crafted Elasticsearch responses or requests), they could potentially exploit the vulnerability.
**Impact:**  Impact varies depending on the specific dependency vulnerability. It can range from denial of service and information disclosure to remote code execution.
**Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability)
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Regular Dependency Scanning:** Implement automated dependency scanning as part of the development and deployment pipeline. Use tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, or GitHub Dependabot to identify known vulnerabilities in `elasticsearch-net`'s dependencies.
*   **Keep Dependencies Updated:**  Proactively update `elasticsearch-net` and all its dependencies to the latest versions. Regularly monitor for security updates and patch releases for NuGet packages used by `elasticsearch-net`.
*   **Vulnerability Monitoring and Alerts:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to .NET and NuGet packages to stay informed about potential risks affecting `elasticsearch-net`'s dependency chain.
*   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Integrate SCA tools into the development process to continuously monitor and manage the security risks associated with open-source dependencies.
