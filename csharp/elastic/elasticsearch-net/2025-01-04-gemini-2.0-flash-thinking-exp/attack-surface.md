# Attack Surface Analysis for elastic/elasticsearch-net

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Connection String Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_connection_string_handling.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Insecure Connection String Handling**
    *   **Description:** Storing Elasticsearch connection strings, including sensitive credentials, in plaintext or easily accessible locations.
    *   **How elasticsearch-net contributes:** The library requires a connection string to connect to Elasticsearch. If this string is handled insecurely, it directly exposes credentials necessary for the library to function.
    *   **Example:**  Storing the connection string with username and password directly in the `appsettings.json` file without encryption, which `elasticsearch-net` will then use to connect.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Elasticsearch cluster, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store connection strings in secure configuration providers like Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or HashiCorp Vault.
        *   Use environment variables for connection strings, ensuring proper access controls on the environment.
        *   Avoid hardcoding connection strings directly in the application code.
        *   Encrypt sensitive parts of the connection string if stored in configuration files.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL)](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_transport_layer_security__tlsssl_.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Lack of Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL)**
    *   **Description:** Communicating with the Elasticsearch server over an unencrypted HTTP connection.
    *   **How elasticsearch-net contributes:** The library's configuration dictates whether it connects over HTTP or HTTPS. If not explicitly configured for HTTPS, it will default to HTTP if that's the provided scheme.
    *   **Example:**  Using a connection string that starts with `http://` instead of `https://` when configuring the `ElasticClient` in `elasticsearch-net`.
    *   **Impact:**  Data transmitted between the application and Elasticsearch (including queries, data, and potentially credentials) can be intercepted and read by attackers (man-in-the-middle attacks).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce HTTPS:** Ensure the Elasticsearch server is configured to use HTTPS.
        *   **Configure elasticsearch-net for HTTPS:** Use connection strings starting with `https://`.
        *   **Validate Server Certificates:** Configure `elasticsearch-net` to validate the Elasticsearch server's SSL/TLS certificate to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Certificate Validation](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_certificate_validation.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Insufficient Certificate Validation**
    *   **Description:** Not properly validating the Elasticsearch server's SSL/TLS certificate when using HTTPS.
    *   **How elasticsearch-net contributes:** The library's `ConnectionSettings` determine whether and how server certificates are validated. Disabling or improperly configuring this directly weakens the security of the connection established by the library.
    *   **Example:**  Disabling certificate validation in the `ConnectionSettings` of `elasticsearch-net` using `.ServerCertificateValidationCallback(...)` and not implementing proper validation logic.
    *   **Impact:** Susceptibility to man-in-the-middle attacks, where attackers can intercept and potentially modify communication by presenting a fake certificate.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable Certificate Validation:** Ensure `elasticsearch-net` is configured to validate server certificates (default behavior is usually secure, but explicit configuration is recommended).
        *   **Use Trusted Certificates:** Ensure the Elasticsearch server uses a valid certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
        *   **Pin Certificates (Advanced):** For enhanced security, consider certificate pinning within the `elasticsearch-net` configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Elasticsearch Query Injection](./attack_surfaces/elasticsearch_query_injection.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Elasticsearch Query Injection**
    *   **Description:** Constructing Elasticsearch queries by directly concatenating user-provided input without proper sanitization or using parameterized queries.
    *   **How elasticsearch-net contributes:** While the library offers safe ways to build queries, developers might bypass these and construct queries using string concatenation, directly leading to injection vulnerabilities within the queries sent by `elasticsearch-net`.
    *   **Example:**  Building a search query using string interpolation with unsanitized user input: `client.Search<MyDocument>(s => s.QueryRawJson($"{{ \"match\": {{ \"title\": \"{userInput}\" }} }}"));`
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can inject malicious Elasticsearch queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or denial of service on the Elasticsearch cluster.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Parameterized Queries (Query DSL):** Utilize the strongly-typed query DSL provided by `elasticsearch-net`, which inherently prevents injection by parameterizing values.
        *   **Avoid Raw Query Construction with User Input:**  Minimize or eliminate the use of methods like `QueryRawJson` or manually constructing JSON queries with user-provided data.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data During Serialization](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_during_serialization.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Exposure of Sensitive Data During Serialization**
    *   **Description:** Serializing sensitive application data that is not intended to be stored or indexed in Elasticsearch.
    *   **How elasticsearch-net contributes:** The library handles the serialization of .NET objects into JSON for Elasticsearch. If developers serialize objects containing sensitive information without proper filtering or using appropriate DTOs, this data will be sent to and stored in Elasticsearch via `elasticsearch-net`.
    *   **Example:**  Directly indexing an entire user object, including sensitive fields like password hashes or social security numbers, using `client.IndexDocument(userObject)`.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data within the Elasticsearch index, potentially leading to data breaches if the index is compromised.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Serialize Only Necessary Data:** Carefully select the properties to be serialized and indexed in Elasticsearch.
        *   **Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** Create specific DTOs that contain only the data required for Elasticsearch, avoiding the serialization of sensitive information.
        *   **Implement Ignore Attributes:** Use attributes like `[JsonIgnore]` (from `System.Text.Json` or Newtonsoft.Json) on sensitive properties to prevent them from being serialized by `elasticsearch-net`.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Dependency Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities present in the `elasticsearch-net` library itself or its dependent libraries.
    *   **How elasticsearch-net contributes:** The application directly depends on `elasticsearch-net`. Vulnerabilities within the library's code can be exploited by attackers targeting the application.
    *   **Example:** A known remote code execution vulnerability in a specific version of `elasticsearch-net` that an attacker could leverage by sending crafted requests.
    *   **Impact:**  A wide range of potential impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, including remote code execution, denial of service, or data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Libraries Updated:** Regularly update `elasticsearch-net` to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use tools to scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities and receive alerts for updates.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories related to `elasticsearch-net` and its dependencies.
