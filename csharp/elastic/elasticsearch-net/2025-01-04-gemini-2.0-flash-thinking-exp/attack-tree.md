# Attack Tree Analysis for elastic/elasticsearch-net

Objective: Compromise application by exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses introduced by the `elasticsearch-net` library.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   **Compromise Application via Elasticsearch.Net (Critical Node)**
    *   OR: **Exploit Configuration Issues (High-Risk Path)**
        *   AND: **Expose Elasticsearch Credentials (Critical Node)**
            *   Access Stored Credentials
                *   **Read from Configuration Files (Critical Node)**
                *   **Read from Environment Variables (Critical Node)**
    *   OR: **Manipulate Data Sent to Elasticsearch (High-Risk Path)**
        *   AND: **Perform Elasticsearch Injection Attacks (Critical Node)**
            *   **Inject Malicious Queries via String Concatenation (Critical Node)**
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Issues](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_issues.md)

This path represents the danger of insecurely managing Elasticsearch connection details. If an attacker can gain access to these credentials, they can bypass application-level security and interact directly with the Elasticsearch instance.

*   **Critical Node: Expose Elasticsearch Credentials**
    *   This is a critical point because valid Elasticsearch credentials grant significant power to an attacker.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Access Stored Credentials
        *   **Critical Node: Read from Configuration Files**
            *   **Attack Description:** Attackers target configuration files where connection strings, including usernames and passwords, might be stored. This could involve accessing files on the server, exploiting file inclusion vulnerabilities, or gaining access through compromised accounts.
            *   **Impact:** Full access to the Elasticsearch instance, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete any data.
        *   **Critical Node: Read from Environment Variables**
            *   **Attack Description:** Attackers attempt to read environment variables where sensitive information, including Elasticsearch credentials, might be stored. This could be achieved through techniques like process inspection, exploiting vulnerabilities that expose environment variables (e.g., certain logging configurations), or gaining access to the server's environment.
            *   **Impact:** Similar to accessing configuration files, this provides full access to the Elasticsearch instance.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Data Sent to Elasticsearch](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_data_sent_to_elasticsearch.md)

This path highlights the risks associated with dynamically constructing Elasticsearch queries based on user input without proper sanitization.

*   **Critical Node: Perform Elasticsearch Injection Attacks**
    *   This is critical because successful injection can lead to unauthorized data access or manipulation within Elasticsearch.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Inject Malicious Queries via String Concatenation
        *   **Critical Node: Inject Malicious Queries via String Concatenation**
            *   **Attack Description:** When the application constructs Elasticsearch queries by directly concatenating user-provided input (e.g., search terms, filters) into the query string, attackers can inject malicious Elasticsearch clauses. This can allow them to bypass intended access controls, retrieve sensitive data they shouldn't have access to, modify existing data, or even delete data. For example, an attacker could inject clauses to retrieve all documents instead of a filtered subset, or inject update or delete queries if the application's logic allows such operations based on user input.
            *   **Impact:** Potential for significant data breaches, unauthorized data modification, or data deletion within the Elasticsearch instance.
