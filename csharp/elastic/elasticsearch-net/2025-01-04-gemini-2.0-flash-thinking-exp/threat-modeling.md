# Threat Model Analysis for elastic/elasticsearch-net

## Threat: [Insecure Connection Configuration - Plaintext Communication](./threats/insecure_connection_configuration_-_plaintext_communication.md)

**Description:** An attacker could eavesdrop on network traffic between the application and the Elasticsearch cluster if HTTPS is not enforced in the `elasticsearch-net` configuration. They could intercept sensitive data like queries, data being indexed, and potentially even authentication credentials if not handled correctly by Elasticsearch itself.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data.

**Affected Component:** `ElasticClient`, `ElasticLowLevelClient`, `ConnectionSettings` (specifically the `Uri` and related transport settings).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Enforce HTTPS:** Configure the `ConnectionSettings` to use `https://` for the Elasticsearch cluster URLs.
*   **Transport Layer Security (TLS):** Ensure TLS/SSL is properly configured on the Elasticsearch cluster and that the `elasticsearch-net` client is configured to validate the server's certificate. Use `CertificateFingerprint` or `CertificateValidation` in `ConnectionSettings`.

## Threat: [Insecure Connection Configuration - Weak or Default Credentials](./threats/insecure_connection_configuration_-_weak_or_default_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains access to the application's configuration or code could discover weak or default Elasticsearch credentials used by `elasticsearch-net`. They could then use these credentials via `elasticsearch-net` to directly access and manipulate the Elasticsearch cluster.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the Elasticsearch cluster, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `ConnectionSettings` (specifically `BasicAuthentication` or `ApiKeyAuthentication`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Strong Credentials:** Use strong, unique passwords or API keys for Elasticsearch authentication.
*   **Secure Credential Storage:** Store Elasticsearch credentials securely using environment variables, secrets management systems, or encrypted configuration files. Avoid hardcoding credentials in the application code.

## Threat: [Elasticsearch Injection via Dynamic Query Construction](./threats/elasticsearch_injection_via_dynamic_query_construction.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate user input that is directly incorporated into Elasticsearch queries constructed using string concatenation or similar methods within the `elasticsearch-net` API. This could allow them to inject malicious Elasticsearch queries, potentially leading to data extraction, modification, or denial of service.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, potential execution of arbitrary Elasticsearch scripts (depending on Elasticsearch configuration).

**Affected Component:** `QueryContainer` (when manually constructed), methods like `Search()` or `Count()` when using string interpolation or concatenation for query parameters.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Use Parameterized Queries/Query DSL:** Utilize the strongly-typed query DSL provided by `elasticsearch-net` to construct queries. This prevents direct injection of raw strings.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Sanitize and validate all user-provided input before using it in Elasticsearch queries, even when using the query DSL.
*   **Avoid String Concatenation:**  Do not construct Elasticsearch queries by concatenating strings with user input when using the `elasticsearch-net` API.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Queries](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_malicious_queries.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft overly complex or resource-intensive queries using the `elasticsearch-net` API that consume excessive resources on the Elasticsearch cluster, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users and applications.

**Impact:** Denial of service, performance degradation.

**Affected Component:** Any method that allows query construction and execution within `elasticsearch-net`, such as `Search()`, `Aggregations()`, `Scroll()`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Query Complexity Limits:** Implement safeguards in the application to limit the complexity of queries that can be executed through `elasticsearch-net` (e.g., limiting the number of aggregations, clauses, or the size of the result set).
*   **Timeouts:** Configure appropriate timeouts for Elasticsearch requests in `elasticsearch-net` to prevent long-running queries from tying up resources indefinitely.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on requests sent to Elasticsearch from the application using `elasticsearch-net`.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `elasticsearch-net` Library Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__elasticsearch-net__library_dependencies.md)

**Description:** The `elasticsearch-net` library relies on other libraries (dependencies). If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, they could be exploited through the application's use of `elasticsearch-net`.

**Impact:** Various impacts depending on the vulnerability, potentially including remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** The entire `elasticsearch-net` library and its dependency chain.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical to High).

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep the `elasticsearch-net` library and all its dependencies updated to the latest stable versions.
*   **Dependency Scanning:** Use dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities in the dependencies of `elasticsearch-net`.
