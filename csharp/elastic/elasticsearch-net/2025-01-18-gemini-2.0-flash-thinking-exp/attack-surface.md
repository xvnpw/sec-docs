# Attack Surface Analysis for elastic/elasticsearch-net

## Attack Surface: [Elasticsearch Query Injection](./attack_surfaces/elasticsearch_query_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious Elasticsearch query syntax into application queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
    *   **How Elasticsearch.Net Contributes:** If the application uses `elasticsearch-net` to construct queries by directly concatenating user input or without proper parameterization, it becomes vulnerable. The library itself provides methods for building queries, but it's the developer's responsibility to use them securely.
    *   **Example:** An e-commerce site allows users to search for products. The application constructs an Elasticsearch query like: `client.Search<Product>(s => s.Query(q => q.Match(m => m.Field(f => f.Name).Query(userInput))));`. If `userInput` is not sanitized and contains malicious Elasticsearch syntax (e.g., `"}} OR _exists_:password {{"`), it can alter the query's intent.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Can lead to complete data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service on the Elasticsearch cluster, and potentially even remote code execution if Elasticsearch ingest pipelines are misused.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use parameterized queries or the strongly-typed query DSL provided by `elasticsearch-net`:** This ensures user input is treated as data, not executable code.
        *   **Implement strict input validation and sanitization:**  Validate user input against expected patterns and sanitize any potentially harmful characters before incorporating it into queries.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the Elasticsearch user used by the application has only the necessary permissions to perform its intended tasks. Avoid using administrative or overly permissive accounts.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Connection String Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_connection_string_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive connection details (including credentials) for the Elasticsearch cluster are stored insecurely, making them accessible to attackers.
    *   **How Elasticsearch.Net Contributes:** The library requires a connection string or configuration to connect to Elasticsearch. If this configuration is stored in plain text in code, configuration files, or version control, it becomes a target.
    *   **Example:** A connection string like `http://user:password@localhost:9200` is hardcoded directly in the application's source code or stored in an unencrypted configuration file.
    *   **Impact:** High. Attackers gaining access to the connection string can directly access and manipulate the Elasticsearch cluster, bypassing application-level security.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use environment variables or secure secret management solutions (e.g., Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault) to store connection strings.**
        *   **Avoid hardcoding connection strings in the application code.**
        *   **Encrypt configuration files containing connection details.**
        *   **Implement proper access controls on configuration files and environment variables.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient TLS Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_tls_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between the application and the Elasticsearch cluster is not properly encrypted, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **How Elasticsearch.Net Contributes:**  `elasticsearch-net` allows configuring TLS settings. If these settings are not correctly configured (e.g., TLS verification is disabled, outdated protocols are used), the connection is insecure.
    *   **Example:** The application connects to Elasticsearch using `http://` instead of `https://`, or TLS certificate verification is explicitly disabled in the `ConnectionSettings`.
    *   **Impact:** High. Sensitive data transmitted between the application and Elasticsearch can be intercepted, potentially exposing user data, application secrets, or other confidential information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use `https://` for Elasticsearch connections.**
        *   **Ensure TLS certificate verification is enabled and configured correctly.**
        *   **Use strong and up-to-date TLS protocols.**
        *   **Properly configure and validate the Elasticsearch server's TLS certificate.
