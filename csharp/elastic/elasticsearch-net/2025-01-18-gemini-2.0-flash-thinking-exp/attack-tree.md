## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Connection Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_connection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This node represents a broad category of attacks targeting the connection between the application and the Elasticsearch cluster. Success here often grants significant access.
    *   **Steal Elasticsearch Credentials (Critical Node):**  The attacker aims to obtain the credentials used by the application to authenticate with Elasticsearch.
        *   **Obtain Credentials from Application Configuration (e.g., hardcoded, environment variables) (Critical Node):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker gains access to the application's configuration files (e.g., `appsettings.json`, `.env` files) or environment variables where Elasticsearch credentials might be stored insecurely. This could be through exploiting other vulnerabilities in the application or infrastructure, or simply due to misconfigurations.
            *   **Impact:**  Direct access to Elasticsearch with the application's privileges, allowing data breaches, manipulation, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This node focuses on attacks that manipulate data as it's being processed by the `elasticsearch-net` library.
    *   **Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Elasticsearch.Net (if present) (Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** If the `elasticsearch-net` library has a deserialization vulnerability, an attacker can craft malicious data that, when deserialized by the library, leads to arbitrary code execution on the application server. This often involves manipulating data sent to or received from Elasticsearch.
        *   **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the application server, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the server and potentially pivot to other systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Query Construction Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_query_construction_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This node centers on attacks that manipulate how the application constructs and sends queries to Elasticsearch.
    *   **Perform Elasticsearch Injection (Critical Node):** The attacker aims to inject malicious code or commands into the Elasticsearch query.
        *   **Inject Malicious Elasticsearch Query Syntax via User Input (Critical Node):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** If the application directly incorporates user-provided input into Elasticsearch queries without proper sanitization or parameterization, an attacker can inject malicious Elasticsearch query syntax. This could involve adding clauses to retrieve unauthorized data, modify existing data, or even execute scripts within Elasticsearch.
            *   **Impact:** Bypassing intended data access restrictions, retrieving sensitive information, modifying or deleting data, or potentially executing arbitrary code within the Elasticsearch context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities in Elasticsearch.Net](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities_in_elasticsearch_net.md)

*   This node focuses on vulnerabilities arising from insecure configuration of the `elasticsearch-net` library.
    *   **Exploit Exposed Configuration Data (Critical Node):** The attacker aims to access sensitive configuration details of the `elasticsearch-net` library.
        *   **Access Configuration Files Containing Sensitive Elasticsearch Settings (Critical Node):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Similar to obtaining credentials from application configuration, the attacker targets configuration files specifically related to `elasticsearch-net`. These files might contain connection strings, credentials, or other sensitive information.
            *   **Impact:** Obtaining credentials or connection details for the Elasticsearch cluster, enabling further attacks like data breaches or manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities within Elasticsearch.Net Library Itself](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_within_elasticsearch_net_library_itself.md)

*   This node focuses on exploiting inherent vulnerabilities within the `elasticsearch-net` library's code.
    *   **Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in Elasticsearch.Net (Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker discovers and exploits a previously unknown vulnerability (a zero-day) within the `elasticsearch-net` library. This requires significant reverse engineering skills and deep understanding of the library's internals.
        *   **Impact:**  Potentially severe, ranging from information disclosure to Remote Code Execution on the application server, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
