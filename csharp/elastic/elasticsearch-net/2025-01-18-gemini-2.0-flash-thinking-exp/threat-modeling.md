# Threat Model Analysis for elastic/elasticsearch-net

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Elasticsearch Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_elasticsearch_communication.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the Elasticsearch cluster. They might eavesdrop on sensitive data being transmitted (credentials, query data, search results) or even modify requests before they reach Elasticsearch, potentially leading to data manipulation or unauthorized actions. This directly involves `elasticsearch-net`'s communication mechanisms.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access to Elasticsearch data.

**Affected Component:** `Transport` module within `elasticsearch-net`, responsible for handling communication with the Elasticsearch server. This includes the underlying `HttpClient` or socket connections used by the library.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Enforce TLS/SSL:** Ensure that all communication between the application and Elasticsearch is encrypted using HTTPS. Configure `elasticsearch-net`'s `ConnectionSettings` to require TLS/SSL and verify the server's certificate.
*   **Secure Network Infrastructure:** Utilize secure network infrastructure and avoid transmitting sensitive data over untrusted networks.

## Threat: [Credential Exposure in `elasticsearch-net` Configuration](./threats/credential_exposure_in__elasticsearch-net__configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to Elasticsearch credentials (username/password, API keys) that are stored insecurely within the application's configuration or during the initialization of `elasticsearch-net` components. This could happen through access to source code repositories, configuration files, or memory dumps where `elasticsearch-net` connection settings are exposed.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Elasticsearch cluster, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `ConnectionSettings` or `ElasticClient` initialization within `elasticsearch-net`, where connection details are configured. The way the application uses `elasticsearch-net` to manage these settings is the direct involvement.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure Credential Management:** Avoid storing credentials directly in code or configuration files used by `elasticsearch-net`. Utilize secure credential management solutions like environment variables, dedicated secrets management services (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault), or the operating system's credential store, and configure `elasticsearch-net` to retrieve credentials from these secure sources.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant the application only the necessary permissions to the Elasticsearch cluster, configured through the credentials used by `elasticsearch-net`.

## Threat: [Elasticsearch Injection via `elasticsearch-net`](./threats/elasticsearch_injection_via__elasticsearch-net_.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates input fields or parameters that are used to construct Elasticsearch queries within the application *using* the `elasticsearch-net` library. If the application bypasses the strongly-typed Query DSL and uses string concatenation or insufficient sanitization when building queries with `elasticsearch-net`'s methods, the attacker can inject malicious Elasticsearch query syntax.

**Impact:** Data breaches (attacker can query sensitive data they shouldn't have access to), data manipulation (attacker can modify or delete data), denial of service (attacker can craft resource-intensive queries), potentially remote code execution if scripting is enabled in Elasticsearch and the application allows for its execution (less common but possible). The vulnerability lies in how the application *uses* `elasticsearch-net`'s query building features.

**Affected Component:** Query DSL (Domain Specific Language) methods within `elasticsearch-net` used for building queries. The vulnerability arises from the *misuse* of these components by the application developer.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Always Use the Strongly-Typed Query DSL:** Utilize the built-in query builder methods provided by `elasticsearch-net` to construct queries. This is the primary way `elasticsearch-net` helps prevent injection.
*   **Avoid String Concatenation for Query Building with `elasticsearch-net`:** Never directly concatenate user input into query strings when using `elasticsearch-net`'s API.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Custom Serializers Used with `elasticsearch-net`](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_custom_serializers_used_with__elasticsearch-net_.md)

**Description:** If the application configures `elasticsearch-net` to use custom serialization/deserialization logic and doesn't properly sanitize or validate data received from Elasticsearch, an attacker could send specially crafted responses from a malicious Elasticsearch instance that, when deserialized by the application *through* `elasticsearch-net`'s configured serializer, could lead to arbitrary code execution or other malicious outcomes. This directly involves how `elasticsearch-net` handles data conversion.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `Serializer` implementations configured within `elasticsearch-net` to convert data between .NET objects and JSON.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Prefer Default Serializers:** Rely on the well-vetted default serializers provided by `elasticsearch-net`.
*   **Secure Custom Serialization:** If custom serialization is absolutely necessary and configured within `elasticsearch-net`, implement rigorous input validation and sanitization of data received from Elasticsearch. Be aware of known deserialization vulnerabilities in the underlying serialization libraries.
*   **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep the `elasticsearch-net` library and its dependencies (including serialization libraries) updated to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in `elasticsearch-net`'s Direct Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in__elasticsearch-net_'s_direct_dependencies.md)

**Description:** The `elasticsearch-net` library depends on other NuGet packages. Vulnerabilities in these *direct* dependencies could be exploited through the application's use of `elasticsearch-net`. This is a direct consequence of using the library and its included components.

**Impact:**  Depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but could range from denial of service to remote code execution.

**Affected Component:** The direct dependencies of the `elasticsearch-net` NuGet package.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be High or Critical).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep the `elasticsearch-net` library updated to the latest versions, as updates often include fixes for vulnerabilities in its dependencies.
*   **Dependency Scanning:** Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify and alert on known vulnerabilities in the project's direct dependencies.
