# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for elastic/elasticsearch-net

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce HTTPS](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_https.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce HTTPS

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **`ConnectionSettings` Configuration:**  Ensure all connections are configured with `https://` in the URI provided to the `ConnectionSettings` object.  This is the primary mechanism within `elasticsearch-net` to enforce HTTPS.
        2.  **Certificate Validation (Default):**  By default, `elasticsearch-net` validates the server's certificate.  Do *not* disable this unless you have a very specific and controlled reason (e.g., a development environment with self-signed certificates).  Disabling validation is done via `.DisableAutomaticProxyDetection()` and `.ServerCertificateValidationCallback(null)` which should be avoided.
        3.  **Custom Validation (`ServerCertificateValidationCallback`):** If using self-signed certificates or a private CA, provide a custom `ServerCertificateValidationCallback` to the `ConnectionSettings`.  This callback allows you to implement your own certificate validation logic (e.g., checking thumbprints). This is a feature *within* `elasticsearch-net`.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** (Severity: **Critical**)
        *   **Data Eavesdropping:** (Severity: **High**)
        *   **Credential Theft:** (Severity: **Critical**)

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **MITM Attacks:** Risk reduced to near zero (with proper validation).
        *   **Data Eavesdropping:** Risk reduced to near zero.
        *   **Credential Theft:** Risk significantly reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `SearchService.cs` (Line 42): `ConnectionSettings` uses `https://`.
        *   `IndexService.cs` (Line 25): `ConnectionSettings` uses `https://`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `BulkIngestService.cs`:  Confirm HTTPS and validation.
        *   Integration tests: Verify HTTPS and validation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong Authentication (Using `elasticsearch-net` Methods)](./mitigation_strategies/strong_authentication__using__elasticsearch-net__methods_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strong Authentication (Using `elasticsearch-net` Methods)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **`ConnectionSettings` Authentication Methods:** Use the appropriate `ConnectionSettings` methods to configure authentication:
            *   `.ApiKeyAuthentication()`:  For API keys (preferred).
            *   `.ServiceAccountAuthentication()`: For service tokens (preferred).
            *   `.BasicAuthentication()`: For basic authentication (use only with HTTPS and when necessary).
            *   `.ClientCertificate()`: For client certificate authentication.
        2.  **Avoid Hardcoding:**  Do *not* hardcode credentials directly within the `ConnectionSettings` initialization.  Use environment variables or a secrets manager, but the *method* of authentication is configured via `elasticsearch-net`.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** (Severity: **Critical**)
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** (Severity: **High**)
        *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** (Severity: **Medium**)

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced (with least privilege).
        *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk reduced (with API keys/tokens).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `SearchService.cs`: Uses `.BasicAuthentication()`.
        *   `IndexService.cs`: Uses `.BasicAuthentication()`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   All services: Migrate to `.ApiKeyAuthentication()` or `.ServiceAccountAuthentication()`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Dynamic Query Construction (Using NEST/`elasticsearch-net` Features)](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_dynamic_query_construction__using_nest_elasticsearch-net__features_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Avoid Dynamic Query Construction (Using NEST/`elasticsearch-net` Features)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **NEST Fluent API/Query Containers:**  *Always* prefer using NEST's strongly-typed fluent API or query containers.  These methods are designed to prevent injection vulnerabilities by handling escaping and parameterization *internally*. This is a core feature of how NEST interacts with `elasticsearch-net`.
        2.  **Low-Level Client (If Necessary):** If using the low-level client, use the request builders provided by `elasticsearch-net` and *always* use `PostData.Serializable()` to serialize the request body.  Avoid string concatenation.  `PostData.Serializable()` is the `elasticsearch-net` mechanism for safe serialization.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Elasticsearch Injection:** (Severity: **Critical**)
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** (Severity: **High**)
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** (Severity: **Medium**)

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Elasticsearch Injection:** Risk reduced to near zero.
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `SearchService.cs`: Uses NEST's fluent API mostly.
        *   `ReportService.cs`: Uses low-level client; needs refactoring.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `ReportService.cs`: Refactor to use `PostData.Serializable`.
        *   `AdminService.cs`: Review and refactor.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Log `DebugInformation` (Using `elasticsearch-net` Property)](./mitigation_strategies/log__debuginformation___using__elasticsearch-net__property_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Log `DebugInformation` (Using `elasticsearch-net` Property)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Access `DebugInformation`:**  The `DebugInformation` property of the response object (both in NEST and the low-level client) provides detailed information about the request and response, including the raw request and response bodies, timing information, and any exceptions that occurred. This is a *specific* property provided by `elasticsearch-net`.
        2.  **Log Selectively:** Log the `DebugInformation` (or parts of it) in your application's logs.  Be mindful of sensitive data and redact or omit it as needed.  This provides valuable context for debugging and security auditing.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Intrusion Detection:** (Severity: **Medium**)
        *   **Incident Response:** (Severity: **Medium**)
        *   **Debugging:** (Severity: **Low**)

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Intrusion Detection:** Improved detection.
        *   **Incident Response:** Faster response.
        *   **Debugging:** Easier debugging.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Not implemented.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Add logging of `DebugInformation` (with redaction) to all services.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unused Features (Using `ConnectionSettings`)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unused_features__using__connectionsettings__.md)

* **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Unused Features (Using `ConnectionSettings`)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **`ConnectionSettings` Options:** Use methods on `ConnectionSettings` to disable features you don't need:
            *   `.DisableSniffing()`: Disables cluster sniffing.
            *   `.DisablePing()`: Disables pinging nodes before use.
        2. **Review and Disable:** Identify which features are not required and disable them explicitly.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unnecessary Network Traffic:** (Severity: **Low**)
        *   **Potential Vulnerabilities in Unused Code:** (Severity: **Low**)

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unnecessary Network Traffic:** Reduced traffic.
        *   **Potential Vulnerabilities:** Reduced risk.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Not implemented.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Review `ConnectionSettings` and disable unused features.
