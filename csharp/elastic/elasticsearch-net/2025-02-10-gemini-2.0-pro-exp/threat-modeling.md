# Threat Model Analysis for elastic/elasticsearch-net

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack with Spoofed Elasticsearch Response](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_with_spoofed_elasticsearch_response.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the network traffic between the application and the Elasticsearch cluster. They present a fake TLS certificate (or bypass TLS entirely if misconfigured) and return forged responses to the application.
    *   **Impact:** The application receives and processes incorrect data, potentially leading to incorrect decisions, data corruption, or even execution of malicious logic if the response is used to control application flow.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Connection`, `Transport`, underlying .NET networking stack (if TLS is misconfigured at the OS level).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict HTTPS Enforcement:** Configure `elasticsearch-net` to *only* use HTTPS. Do not allow any fallback to HTTP.
        *   **Robust Certificate Validation:** Implement rigorous certificate validation. This includes:
            *   Checking the certificate's validity period.
            *   Verifying the certificate's signature chain up to a trusted root CA.
            *   Checking for certificate revocation (using OCSP or CRLs).
            *   Potentially using certificate pinning (though this can be brittle).
        *   **Client Certificate Authentication (mTLS):** If the Elasticsearch cluster supports it, use mutual TLS (mTLS) to provide an additional layer of authentication and prevent spoofing.

## Threat: [DNS Spoofing/Hijacking](./threats/dns_spoofinghijacking.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the DNS resolution process, causing the application to connect to a malicious server controlled by the attacker instead of the legitimate Elasticsearch cluster.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to MITM, the application receives and processes incorrect data, leading to data corruption, incorrect decisions, or potential code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Connection`, `Transport`, `SniffingConnectionPool` (if sniffing is enabled and relies on DNS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **DNSSEC:** Use DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions) to ensure the integrity and authenticity of DNS responses.
        *   **Secure DNS Servers:** Use trusted and secure DNS servers.
        *   **Monitor DNS Resolution:** Monitor DNS resolution for the Elasticsearch cluster to detect any anomalies.
        * **Hardcoded IP Addresses (If Feasible):** In highly controlled environments, consider using hardcoded IP addresses for the Elasticsearch nodes.

## Threat: [Custom Serializer Tampering](./threats/custom_serializer_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** If a custom serializer/deserializer is used with `elasticsearch-net`, an attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in that custom component to inject malicious data or manipulate the serialization/deserialization process.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially arbitrary code execution, data corruption, or other security issues, depending on the vulnerability in the custom serializer.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Custom serializer/deserializer implementation used with `IElasticsearchSerializer`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if the custom serializer has vulnerabilities)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thoroughly Secure Custom Serializer:** If using a custom serializer, ensure it is rigorously tested and secured against common serialization vulnerabilities (e.g., deserialization attacks).
        *   **Prefer Built-in Serializer:**  Whenever possible, use the built-in serializer provided by `elasticsearch-net`, as it is generally well-tested and maintained.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Error Messages](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_error_messages.md)

*   **Description:** `elasticsearch-net` exceptions or error messages (if not handled properly) might reveal sensitive information about the Elasticsearch cluster, such as internal IP addresses, index names, or even query details.
    *   **Impact:** Leakage of sensitive information that could be used by an attacker to further compromise the system.
    *   **Affected Component:** `IConnection`, `Transport`, exception handling in application code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Careful Exception Handling:** Implement robust exception handling. Catch `ElasticsearchClientException` and other relevant exceptions. Log detailed error information *internally* for debugging, but return *generic* error messages to the user. *Never* expose raw Elasticsearch error details to end-users.
        *   **Custom Error Messages:** Create custom error messages that provide user-friendly information without revealing sensitive details.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access via Misconfigured Credentials](./threats/unauthorized_access_via_misconfigured_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses overly permissive Elasticsearch credentials, or the credentials are leaked or compromised.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Elasticsearch cluster with elevated privileges.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ConnectionSettings`, application configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Use credentials with the *minimum* necessary permissions.
        *   **Secure Credential Storage:** Store credentials securely (e.g., using environment variables, a secrets management system, or secure configuration files). Do *not* hardcode credentials in the application code.
        *   **Regular Credential Rotation:** Rotate Elasticsearch credentials regularly.
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** If supported by your Elasticsearch setup, use multi-factor authentication for access.
