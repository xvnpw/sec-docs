## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Insecure Connection](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_insecure_connection.md)

*   **2.1 Insecure Connection:** The application connects to the Elasticsearch cluster without using encryption (HTTPS) or disables certificate validation.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

*   **2.1.1 Use HTTP instead of HTTPS or disable certificate validation:** The application is configured to use an insecure connection protocol or bypasses necessary security checks.

*   **2.1.1.a Data Leak via unencrypted traffic:** An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle attack can intercept and read all data transmitted between the application and Elasticsearch, including sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Excessive Permissions](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_excessive_permissions.md)

* **2.2 Excessive Permissions:** The application connects to Elasticsearch with a user that has more permissions than necessary.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
* **2.2.1 Grant application user overly permissive role to access ES:** The Elasticsearch user account used by the application has been granted roles that allow it to perform actions beyond its required functionality (e.g., write access when only read access is needed).
* **2.2.1.a DoS via resource exhaustion or overly complex queries:** If an attacker compromises the application, they can leverage the excessive permissions to launch denial-of-service attacks by consuming excessive resources or executing overly complex queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3 (and Critical Nodes): Unvalidated Input (Query Injection)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3__and_critical_nodes__unvalidated_input__query_injection_.md)

*   **2.3 Unvalidated Input to ES (Critical Node):** The application takes user-provided input and uses it directly, or with insufficient sanitization/validation, to construct Elasticsearch queries. This is the most critical vulnerability.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **2.3.1 Bypass client-side validation and inject malicious queries or data (Critical Node):** The attacker crafts input that bypasses any client-side security checks and is then used to construct a malicious Elasticsearch query.

*   **2.3.1.a Construct queries that bypass expected data formats or access control logic (Critical Node):** The attacker creates a query that violates the intended structure or security rules of the application, allowing them to access unauthorized data or perform unauthorized actions.

*   **2.3.1.a.i Data Exfiltration via crafted queries (Critical Node):** The attacker uses query injection to retrieve data they should not have access to.  Examples:
    *   Using wildcard queries to retrieve all documents.
    *   Accessing fields that should be hidden or restricted.
    *   Exploiting Elasticsearch query features to circumvent access controls.

*   **2.3.1.a.ii DoS via Query Complexity (Critical Node):** The attacker crafts a query that is intentionally complex or resource-intensive, causing the Elasticsearch cluster to become overloaded and unresponsive. Examples:
    *   Using deeply nested aggregations.
    *   Specifying extremely large `from` and `size` parameters.
    *   Executing expensive scripts.
    *   Using regular expressions that cause excessive backtracking.
