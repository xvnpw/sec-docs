# Threat Model Analysis for nuget/nuget.client

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion / Namespace Hijacking](./threats/dependency_confusion__namespace_hijacking.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious NuGet package to a public repository with a name similar to a private package. When `nuget.client` resolves dependencies, it might download and install the attacker's package if package source precedence is misconfigured. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the application's context.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Execution of malicious code
    *   Data breaches
    *   Service disruption
    *   Compromised build pipeline
*   **Affected nuget.client component:**
    *   Package resolution logic within `NuGetPackageManager` and related classes.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Prioritize private package sources in `nuget.config` or programmatically when using `nuget.client`.
    *   Utilize unique package name prefixes or namespaces for internal packages.
    *   Implement and enforce package hash verification during installation using `nuget.client` features.
    *   Regularly audit project dependencies to identify unexpected packages.

## Threat: [Compromised Package Source](./threats/compromised_package_source.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a NuGet package source (private or public). They inject malicious packages or modify existing legitimate packages. `nuget.client` downloads and installs these compromised packages when requested, leading to application compromise. Attackers might exploit source vulnerabilities or use stolen credentials.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Execution of malicious code
    *   Data breaches
    *   Service disruption
    *   Compromised build pipeline
*   **Affected nuget.client component:**
    *   Package download and installation mechanisms within `NuGetPackageManager` and `HttpSource` components.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Mandatory use of HTTPS for all package sources configured in `nuget.client`.
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for private package sources.
    *   Conduct regular security audits of package sources and their infrastructure.
    *   Enforce NuGet package signing and rigorously verify package signatures using `nuget.client`'s verification features.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `nuget.client` Library](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__nuget_client__library.md)

*   **Description:** The `nuget.client` library itself contains security vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, injection flaws). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by crafting malicious NuGet packages or manipulating package source responses that are processed by `nuget.client`. This could lead to remote code execution or denial of service.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote code execution
    *   Denial of service
    *   Information disclosure
    *   Local privilege escalation
*   **Affected nuget.client component:**
    *   Various components depending on the vulnerability, including package parsing (`PackageReader`), network communication (`HttpSource`), and installation logic (`PackageInstaller`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep `nuget.client` updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Ensure robust input validation and sanitization when using `nuget.client` APIs in your application.
    *   Adhere to secure coding practices when integrating and using `nuget.client`.
    *   Include `nuget.client` and its integration points in regular security audits and penetration testing.

## Threat: [Insecure Package Source Configuration (HTTP Sources)](./threats/insecure_package_source_configuration__http_sources_.md)

*   **Description:** Configuring `nuget.client` to use insecure HTTP package sources instead of HTTPS. This allows man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks where attackers can intercept package downloads and inject malicious packages or modify legitimate ones during transit. `nuget.client` will unknowingly install the compromised package.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Installation of malicious packages
    *   Data breaches
    *   Compromised build pipeline
*   **Affected nuget.client component:**
    *   Network communication components (`HttpSource`) when handling package source URLs and download protocols.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly enforce HTTPS for all package sources configured for `nuget.client`.
    *   Disable or remove any HTTP-based package sources from `nuget.config` and programmatic configurations.
    *   Ensure proper TLS configuration for HTTPS connections used by `nuget.client`.

## Threat: [Weak or Default Credentials for Authenticated Package Sources](./threats/weak_or_default_credentials_for_authenticated_package_sources.md)

*   **Description:** Using weak or default credentials for accessing authenticated private NuGet package sources, or storing credentials insecurely where `nuget.client` can access them. An attacker gaining access to these credentials can access, modify, or inject packages into the private feed, potentially compromising applications using `nuget.client` to consume these packages.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Compromised package source integrity
    *   Injection of malicious packages
    *   Data breaches (disclosure of internal packages)
    *   Unauthorized access to internal packages
*   **Affected nuget.client component:**
    *   Authentication mechanisms within `HttpSource` and credential handling within `nuget.client`'s configuration and API usage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (can be critical depending on the sensitivity of packages and access level)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize strong, unique passwords or API keys for authenticating to private package sources used by `nuget.client`.
    *   Store credentials securely using dedicated secrets management solutions and ensure `nuget.client` accesses them securely (e.g., environment variables, secure configuration providers).
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege when granting access to credentials used by `nuget.client`.
    *   Implement regular credential rotation for package source authentication.
