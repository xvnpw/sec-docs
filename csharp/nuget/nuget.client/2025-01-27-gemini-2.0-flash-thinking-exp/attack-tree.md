## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using NuGet.Client [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_nuget_client__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access or control over the application utilizing `nuget.client`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit NuGet.Client Functionality [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_nuget_client_functionality__critical_node_.md)

*   Attackers aim to leverage the features and functionalities of `nuget.client` itself to compromise the application. This focuses on attacks that are directly related to how `nuget.client` operates.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Package Injection [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_package_injection__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Injecting malicious code into NuGet packages that the application downloads and installs.
    *   This is a primary attack vector because `nuget.client` is designed to fetch and integrate external packages, creating a natural entry point for malicious code.
    *   Success leads to code execution within the application's context upon package installation or usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Package Source [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_package_source__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Gaining control over a NuGet package source to distribute malicious packages.
    *   This is a critical step for successful malicious package injection.
    *   Compromised sources can be public (though less likely for widespread impact) or private (more targeted and often less secured).

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Private Feed [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_private_feed__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Targeting private NuGet feeds used by organizations to host internal or proprietary packages.
    *   Private feeds are often less rigorously secured than public registries like NuGet.org.
    *   Compromise can be achieved through:
        *   **Credential Theft (Weak Credentials, Phishing, Insider Threat) [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Stealing authentication credentials (usernames, passwords, API keys) for the private feed through:
            *   Exploiting weak or default credentials.
            *   Phishing attacks targeting developers or administrators.
            *   Insider threats from malicious or negligent employees.
        *   **Vulnerability in Private Feed Server:** Exploiting security vulnerabilities in the software or infrastructure hosting the private NuGet feed server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Confusion Attack [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_confusion_attack__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploiting the NuGet package resolution mechanism to trick the application into downloading a malicious package from a public feed (like NuGet.org) instead of a legitimate internal package from a private feed.
    *   Attackers upload a package to a public registry with the same name as an internal dependency used by the target application.
    *   If the application's configuration or NuGet resolution logic is not properly set up, it might prioritize the public package, leading to the installation of the attacker's malicious package.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Application's Misuse of NuGet.Client [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_application's_misuse_of_nuget_client__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Compromising the application due to insecure practices in how it utilizes `nuget.client`, even if `nuget.client` itself is secure.
    *   This highlights that security is not just about the library itself, but also how it's integrated and used within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Package Installation Practices [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_package_installation_practices__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Developers or automated processes within the application adopting insecure habits when installing NuGet packages.
    *   This is a common source of vulnerabilities due to human error or lack of awareness.
    *   Includes:
        *   **Installing Packages from Untrusted Sources without Verification [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Installing packages from unknown or untrusted NuGet feeds without verifying their authenticity or integrity (e.g., package signatures).
        *   **Running Package Scripts without Scrutiny (Init.ps1, Install.ps1) [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Allowing NuGet packages to execute PowerShell scripts (like `init.ps1`, `install.ps1`) during installation without reviewing and understanding their contents. These scripts can contain malicious code that executes with elevated privileges during package installation.
