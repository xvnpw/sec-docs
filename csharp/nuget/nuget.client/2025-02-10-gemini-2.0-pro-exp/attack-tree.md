## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_{critical}.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker; gaining the ability to run any code they choose on the target system (server or client).
*   **Impact:** Very High - Complete system compromise, data breaches, potential for lateral movement within the network.
*    Why Critical: This is the end goal, representing the worst-case scenario.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Package Source](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_package_source.md)

    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) on NuGet Feed / Intercept & Modify Traffic [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker positions themselves between the client/server and the NuGet feed (e.g., nuget.org, a private feed). They intercept the communication and replace a legitimate package with a malicious one. This relies on the absence of, or failure of, HTTPS and certificate validation.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (if HTTPS and certificate validation are properly enforced); Medium-High (if not).
        *   **Impact:** Very High - The attacker can inject arbitrary code.
        *   **Effort:** Medium - Requires network access and tools to perform the interception and modification.
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires understanding of network protocols and MitM techniques.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Network monitoring can detect unusual traffic patterns, but sophisticated attacks can be stealthy.
        *   Why High-Risk: The combination of potentially high likelihood (if security is weak) and very high impact makes this a significant risk.

    *   **Typosquatting / Dependency Confusion / Register package with similar name [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:**
            *   **Typosquatting:** The attacker publishes a malicious package with a name very similar to a legitimate, popular package (e.g., `Newtonsoft.Json` vs. `Newt0nsoft.Json`).  They rely on developers making typos or not carefully checking package names.
            *   **Dependency Confusion:** The attacker exploits misconfigured package sources.  They publish a malicious package with the *same name* as an internal (private) package, but to a public feed.  If the client is misconfigured to prioritize the public feed, it will download the malicious package instead of the internal one.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Requires finding a suitable name (typosquatting) or exploiting misconfigurations (dependency confusion).
        *   **Impact:** Very High - The attacker can inject arbitrary code.
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Relatively easy to register a package; exploiting dependency confusion requires some reconnaissance.
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires understanding of package management and naming conventions.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires careful package name review, vulnerability scanning, and proper package source configuration.
        *   Why High-Risk: High impact and relatively low effort/skill make this a common and dangerous attack vector.

    *   **Compromise Official/Private Feed Account / Gain access to credentials/API keys {CRITICAL}**
        *   **Description:** The attacker obtains the credentials (username/password, API keys) that allow publishing packages to a trusted NuGet feed. This could be through phishing, password cracking, social engineering, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the feed's authentication system.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (if strong security practices are in place); Medium-High (if not).
        *   **Impact:** Very High - The attacker can directly publish malicious packages, bypassing many other defenses.
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High - Depends on the target's security posture and the methods used.
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced - Depends on the attack method (e.g., phishing vs. exploiting a web vulnerability).
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard - Requires robust audit logging, intrusion detection, and monitoring of account activity.
        *   Why Critical: This is a single point of failure.  Compromising these credentials gives the attacker direct control over the package supply.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit NuGet.Client Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_nuget_client_vulnerabilities.md)

    * **Vulnerability in Package Signature Verification / Bypass/Disable Signature Validation {CRITICAL}**
        * **Description:** A flaw in the `NuGet.Client`'s signature verification logic that allows an attacker to bypass the checks and install a package with an invalid or missing signature. This would allow an attacker to install a malicious package even if package signing is enforced.
        * **Likelihood:** Very Low - Requires finding a critical, and likely zero-day, vulnerability in the signature verification code.
        * **Impact:** Very High - Bypasses a major security control.
        * **Effort:** Very High - Requires deep expertise in cryptography and reverse engineering.
        * **Skill Level:** Expert - Requires advanced vulnerability research skills.
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard - Requires advanced code analysis and intrusion detection.
        * Why Critical: Signature verification is a cornerstone of NuGet security. Bypassing it undermines the entire trust model.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Client-Side Misconfigurations](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_client-side_misconfigurations.md)

    *   **Package Source Priority Misconfiguration [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:** The `NuGet.config` file (or equivalent configuration) is set up incorrectly, causing the client to prioritize untrusted or public package sources *before* trusted internal sources. This is a key enabler for dependency confusion attacks.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Requires a mistake in the configuration, but such mistakes are not uncommon.
        *   **Impact:** High - Can lead directly to the installation of malicious packages via dependency confusion.
        *   **Effort:** Low - Only requires modifying a configuration file.
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires understanding of NuGet configuration.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires careful review of `NuGet.config` and package source settings.
        *   Why High-Risk: This misconfiguration directly facilitates dependency confusion, a high-impact attack.
