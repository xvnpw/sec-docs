# Attack Surface Analysis for nuget/nuget.client

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Package Source](./attack_surfaces/malicious_package_source.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises or manipulates the configured NuGet package sources, causing `NuGet.Client` to download packages from a malicious repository.
    *   **NuGet.Client Contribution:** `NuGet.Client` is the *direct* component responsible for fetching packages from the configured sources. Its handling of source URLs and the fetching process are the core vulnerability points.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies environment variables used by `NuGet.Client` to point to a malicious NuGet feed.  `NuGet.Client` then unknowingly downloads and installs compromised packages.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. Malicious code within a downloaded package can execute with the application's privileges.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Source Control:** Use *only* trusted, official, or internally controlled and vetted private feeds.  Do not allow arbitrary or user-controlled sources.
        *   **Source Verification:** Implement a mechanism (e.g., a whitelist, checksum verification, or signed configuration) to ensure that only approved sources are used by `NuGet.Client`.
        *   **HTTPS Enforcement:**  Mandate HTTPS for all package sources and enforce strict certificate validation within `NuGet.Client`'s configuration.  Disable any HTTP fallback.
        *   **Secure Configuration:** Protect `NuGet.Config` and any environment variables or in-code configurations used by `NuGet.Client` using OS-level security or secure configuration stores.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run any process using `NuGet.Client` with the absolute minimum necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Package Typosquatting/Brandjacking](./attack_surfaces/package_typosquattingbrandjacking.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious package to a legitimate repository, and `NuGet.Client` downloads and installs it because a developer makes a mistake or is tricked.
    *   **NuGet.Client Contribution:** `NuGet.Client` performs the download and installation based on the provided package name. It does *not* inherently differentiate between a legitimate package and a malicious one with a similar name. The act of downloading is the direct contribution.
    *   **Example:** A developer intends to install `AWSSDK.Core` but accidentally types `AWSSDK.C0re` (a malicious package). `NuGet.Client` downloads and installs the malicious package from `nuget.org`.
    *   **Impact:** System compromise, as the malicious package's code executes within the application's context.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Package Signature Verification:**  Enable and *strictly enforce* package signature verification within `NuGet.Client`. Configure it to trust only packages signed by specific, known authors or organizations.
        *   **Careful Package Selection:** Developers must *meticulously* review package names, descriptions, author information, and download counts before instructing `NuGet.Client` to install them.
        *   **Internal Package Naming Conventions:** Use very clear and distinct naming conventions for internal packages to minimize the risk of typos and confusion with public packages.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Confusion](./attack_surfaces/dependency_confusion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious package to a public repository with the same name as a private package, and `NuGet.Client` downloads the malicious public version.
    *   **NuGet.Client Contribution:** `NuGet.Client`'s package resolution logic is *directly* responsible for choosing which package to download.  If misconfigured or if naming conventions are poor, it will make the wrong choice.
    *   **Example:** An organization has an internal package named `InternalUtils`. An attacker publishes a malicious `InternalUtils` to `nuget.org`. If the build configuration prioritizes `nuget.org`, `NuGet.Client` will download the attacker's package.
    *   **Impact:** System compromise, as the malicious package's code is executed.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Scoped Packages:** Use scoped package names (e.g., `@mycompany/InternalUtils`) for *all* private packages to *guarantee* no naming collisions with public packages. This is the most robust solution.
        *   **Explicit Source Mapping:** Configure `NuGet.Client` (via `NuGet.Config` or programmatically) to *explicitly* map package names to specific sources. This prevents `NuGet.Client` from searching other sources for a given package name.  This is crucial.
        *   **Private Feeds:** Use private NuGet feeds for *all* internal packages, and ensure that these feeds are properly secured and *always* prioritized in `NuGet.Client`'s configuration.
