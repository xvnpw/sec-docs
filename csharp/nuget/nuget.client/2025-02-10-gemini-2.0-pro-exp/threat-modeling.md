# Threat Model Analysis for nuget/nuget.client

## Threat: [Malicious Package Masquerading as Legitimate](./threats/malicious_package_masquerading_as_legitimate.md)

*   **Threat:**  Malicious Package Masquerading as Legitimate

    *   **Description:** An attacker creates a package with a name similar to a popular, legitimate package or uses a legitimate name but a compromised version.  The attacker uploads this to a public or compromised private feed, using techniques like typosquatting to trick developers. `NuGet.Client` is then used to install this malicious package.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code, data exfiltration, system compromise, installation of malware, denial of service.
    *   **Affected NuGet.Client Component:** `PackageSource`, `PackageRepository`, `InstallPackageAsync` (and related installation methods). The core package resolution and installation logic is affected.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Package Source Mapping:** Use Package Source Mapping.
        *   **Package Signing:** Enforce package signature verification.
        *   **Package ID and Version Pinning:** Explicitly specify the exact package ID and version.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanners.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion Attack](./threats/dependency_confusion_attack.md)

*   **Threat:**  Dependency Confusion Attack

    *   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious package to a public feed with the same name as an internal, private package.  If `NuGet.Client` is misconfigured or prioritizes the public feed, it downloads the malicious package instead of the internal one.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code, data exfiltration, system compromise, supply chain attack.
    *   **Affected NuGet.Client Component:** `PackageSource`, `PackageRepository`, `SourceRepositoryProvider`, package resolution logic. The way sources are prioritized and packages are resolved is exploited.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Package Source Mapping:** *Crucially*, use Package Source Mapping.
        *   **Private Feed Configuration:** Ensure correct configuration and prioritization.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Package Download](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_package_download.md)

*   **Threat:**  Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Package Download

    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between `NuGet.Client` and the feed. Even with HTTPS, this is possible with a compromised proxy, network control, or a trusted (compromised) certificate. The attacker modifies the downloaded package, injecting malicious code.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code, system compromise, supply chain attack.
    *   **Affected NuGet.Client Component:** `HttpSource`, `DownloadResource`, `PackageDownloader`. Components responsible for downloading package content are targeted.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict HTTPS Enforcement:** Ensure `https://` and *never* disable certificate validation.
        *   **Package Hash Verification:** `NuGet.Client` *must* verify the downloaded package's hash.
        *   **Strong TLS Configuration:** Use strong TLS cipher suites and protocols.

## Threat: [Tampering with Local Package Cache](./threats/tampering_with_local_package_cache.md)

*   **Threat:**  Tampering with Local Package Cache

    *   **Description:** An attacker with access to the machine modifies cached packages in the NuGet cache, injecting malicious code. Subsequent installations/restores use the compromised packages.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code, system compromise, supply chain attack (affecting subsequent builds).
    *   **Affected NuGet.Client Component:** `LocalPackageSource`, `GlobalPackagesFolder`, `FallbackPackagePathResolver`. Components managing the local package cache are affected.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **File System Permissions:** Restrict access to the NuGet package cache directory.
        *   **Regular Cache Clearing:** Periodically clear the NuGet package cache.

## Threat: [Exposure of API Keys in `NuGet.config`](./threats/exposure_of_api_keys_in__nuget_config_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Exposure of API Keys in `NuGet.config`

    *   **Description:** `NuGet.config` files contain API keys/credentials for private feeds. An attacker gains access to these files (source code leaks, compromised machines, insecure CI/CD).
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to private feeds, potential for publishing malicious packages, data exfiltration.
    *   **Affected NuGet.Client Component:** `Settings`, `ConfigurationDefaults`, `NuGet.Configuration` (the configuration system).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Credential Management:** *Never* store credentials directly in `NuGet.config`.
        *   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables for API keys.
        *   **Secrets Management Solutions:** Use a dedicated secrets management solution.

## Threat: [Outdated NuGet.Client version](./threats/outdated_nuget_client_version.md)

* **Threat:** Outdated NuGet.Client version

    * **Description:** The application is using an outdated version of the `NuGet.Client` library that contains known security vulnerabilities.
    * **Impact:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the `NuGet.Client` itself, potentially leading to any of the other impacts listed above.
    * **Affected NuGet.Client Component:** The entire `NuGet.Client` library.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the `NuGet.Client` library up to date.
        *   **Dependency Management Tools:** Use dependency management tools.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Scan for known vulnerabilities.
