# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for nuget/nuget.client

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicitly Configure Trusted Package Sources](./mitigation_strategies/explicitly_configure_trusted_package_sources.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Trusted Sources:** Determine which NuGet feeds are absolutely necessary and trustworthy. This likely includes a private internal feed and *may* include `nuget.org` or other public feeds, but only after careful vetting.
    2.  **Modify `NuGet.Config`:** Edit the `NuGet.Config` file (typically located at `%AppData%\NuGet\NuGet.Config` for user-level, or in the solution/project directory).
    3.  **Clear Default Sources:** Remove or disable the default `nuget.org` entry if it's not explicitly trusted for *all* packages.
    4.  **Add Trusted Sources:** Add `<add key="MyPrivateFeed" value="https://mycompany.pkgs.visualstudio.com/_packaging/MyFeed/nuget/v3/index.json" />` entries for each trusted source, providing the correct URL.
    5.  **Configure Credentials (if needed):** If your private feed requires authentication, configure the necessary credentials within the `NuGet.Config` file or using environment variables, following secure credential management practices.
    6.  **Test Configuration:** Run `dotnet restore` (or the equivalent in your build process) to ensure that packages are being restored from the expected sources.  This uses `NuGet.Client` under the hood.
    7. **Regular Review:** Schedule periodic reviews (e.g., quarterly) of the `NuGet.Config` to ensure it remains up-to-date and reflects the current trust model.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attacks:** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from publishing malicious packages with the same name as internal packages on a public feed, tricking the build system into downloading the malicious version.
    *   **Typosquatting Attacks:** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces the risk of accidentally installing a package from a malicious source due to a typo in the package name or source URL.
    *   **Compromised Public Feed:** (Severity: High) - Limits the impact if a public feed (like `nuget.org`) is compromised, as you're only using it for a limited, vetted set of packages (if at all).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Dependency Confusion:** Risk significantly reduced (almost eliminated if using Package Source Mapping in conjunction).
    *   **Typosquatting:** Risk reduced, but not eliminated (human error is still possible).
    *   **Compromised Public Feed:** Impact significantly reduced; only packages explicitly allowed from that source are affected.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially.  `NuGet.Config` exists at the solution level and specifies our internal feed.  `nuget.org` is also included, but not restricted.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  `nuget.org` is not restricted via Package Source Mapping.  We need to implement Package Source Mapping to fully mitigate dependency confusion.  We also need a documented, regular review process for `NuGet.Config`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Package Source Mapping](./mitigation_strategies/package_source_mapping.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Dependencies:** Identify which packages come from which sources. Use `dotnet list package --include-transitive` to understand the full dependency graph.
    2.  **Edit `NuGet.Config`:** Within the `<packageSourceMapping>` section of your `NuGet.Config` file, define mappings.
    3.  **Define Patterns:** Use `<packageSource>` elements to specify patterns. For example:
        ```xml
        <packageSourceMapping>
          <packageSource key="nuget.org">
            <package pattern="Newtonsoft.Json" />
            <package pattern="Microsoft.*" />
          </packageSource>
          <packageSource key="MyPrivateFeed">
            <package pattern="*" />
          </packageSource>
        </packageSourceMapping>
        ```
        This example states that `Newtonsoft.Json` and packages starting with `Microsoft.` *must* come from `nuget.org`, while all other packages *must* come from `MyPrivateFeed`.
    4.  **Test Thoroughly:** After implementing Package Source Mapping, *thoroughly* test the build and application to ensure that all dependencies are resolved correctly.  Incorrect mappings can break the build. This testing directly exercises `NuGet.Client`'s resolution logic.
    5.  **Regular Review:**  Review and update the mappings as dependencies change.  This should be part of the dependency update process.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attacks:** (Severity: High) - This is the *primary* mitigation for dependency confusion. It ensures that packages are *only* downloaded from their designated sources.
    *   **Compromised Public Feed:** (Severity: High) - Further limits the impact of a compromised public feed by strictly controlling which packages can be sourced from it.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Dependency Confusion:** Risk almost eliminated when implemented correctly.
    *   **Compromised Public Feed:** Impact significantly reduced; only explicitly mapped packages are at risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:** No.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  This is entirely missing and needs to be implemented in the solution-level `NuGet.Config`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Require Signed Packages](./mitigation_strategies/require_signed_packages.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Trusted Signers:** Determine which authors or repositories you trust to sign packages. This might involve using a company-internal CA or trusting specific public certificates.
    2.  **Configure `NuGet.Config`:** Add a `<trustedSigners>` section to your `NuGet.Config` file.
    3.  **Add Signers:**  Add entries for each trusted signer, specifying their certificate details (e.g., fingerprint, subject name).  You can trust authors or repositories.
    4.  **Set Verification Mode:** Set the `signatureValidationMode` to `require` in the `<config>` section of `NuGet.Config`. This *forces* signature verification by `NuGet.Client`.
    5.  **Test:** Attempt to install an unsigned package or a package signed by an untrusted signer.  The installation should fail, confirming that `NuGet.Client` is enforcing the policy.
    6. **Establish Signing Process:** If you publish your own packages, establish a secure process for signing them using a trusted certificate.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Package Tampering:** (Severity: High) - Prevents the installation of packages that have been modified after being signed.
    *   **Compromised Package Source (Partial Mitigation):** (Severity: High) - Even if a package source is compromised, an attacker cannot inject a modified package without a valid signature.  However, they could still serve an *older*, signed, vulnerable version (see rollback protection below).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Package Tampering:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Compromised Package Source:** Provides a strong layer of defense, but doesn't fully mitigate all risks.

*   **Currently Implemented:** No.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Needs to be implemented in the solution-level `NuGet.Config`.  We also need to define our trusted signers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep NuGet.Client Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_nuget_client_updated.md)

* **Description:**
    1.  **Check for Updates:** Regularly check for updates to the NuGet client tools (e.g., `dotnet`, Visual Studio, NuGet Package Manager). These tools embed and use `NuGet.Client`.
    2.  **Update Tools:** Install the latest stable versions of these tools.
    3.  **Automate (if possible):** Consider automating the update process for build agents and developer machines.
* **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Vulnerabilities in NuGet.Client:** (Severity: Variable, from Low to Critical) - Reduces the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities in the NuGet client itself.
* **Impact:**
    * **Vulnerabilities in NuGet.Client:** Reduces the risk, depending on the specific vulnerabilities patched in each update.
* **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Developers are responsible for updating their own tools.
* **Missing Implementation:** We need a more consistent process for ensuring build agents and developer machines are using up-to-date NuGet client tools. We could consider using a centralized package management system for developer tools.
