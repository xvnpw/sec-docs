# Threat Model Analysis for nuget/nuget.client

## Threat: [Compromised NuGet Feed](./threats/compromised_nuget_feed.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control of a NuGet feed that the application relies on. `nuget.client` is then used to download malicious packages from this compromised feed, believing them to be legitimate. The attacker might inject malicious packages with legitimate names or modify existing packages, which `nuget.client` will retrieve and potentially install.

**Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the application's server or client machines, data breaches, denial of service, and supply chain compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack on NuGet Feed Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_on_nuget_feed_communication.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between the application (using `nuget.client`) and a NuGet feed. The attacker can then manipulate the responses from the feed, potentially modifying package metadata or replacing the actual package content with a malicious one before `nuget.client` receives and processes it.

**Impact:** Installation of compromised packages via `nuget.client`, leading to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attacks](./threats/dependency_confusionsubstitution_attacks.md)

**Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious package with the same name as an internal or private package on a public NuGet feed. `nuget.client`, if not configured correctly, might prioritize or inadvertently select the malicious public package over the intended private one during dependency resolution and installation.

**Impact:** Introduction of malicious code into the application through `nuget.client`'s package resolution mechanism, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or unauthorized access.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Execution of Malicious Code within Packages (via `nuget.client` installation)](./threats/execution_of_malicious_code_within_packages__via__nuget_client__installation_.md)

**Description:** A NuGet package, either intentionally malicious or compromised, contains code (e.g., in installation scripts) that is executed by `nuget.client` during the package installation process. This code could perform actions like downloading malware, modifying system files, or exfiltrating data.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the application's server or client machines as a direct result of `nuget.client` executing malicious scripts, leading to data breaches, system compromise, and denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Downgrade Attacks (exploiting `nuget.client`'s version resolution)](./threats/downgrade_attacks__exploiting__nuget_client_'s_version_resolution_.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the package resolution process or feed content in a way that coerces `nuget.client` to install an older, vulnerable version of a NuGet package, even if a newer, patched version is available. This could exploit weaknesses in `nuget.client`'s version selection logic or vulnerabilities in how it handles feed responses.

**Impact:** Reintroduction of known vulnerabilities into the application due to `nuget.client` installing a vulnerable version, making it susceptible to exploits that were previously addressed.

**Risk Severity:** High
