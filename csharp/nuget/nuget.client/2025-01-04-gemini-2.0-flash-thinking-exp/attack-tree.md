## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via NuGet.Client [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_nuget_client__critical_.md)

This is the overarching goal of the attacker. It represents the successful exploitation of vulnerabilities related to `nuget.client` to gain control over the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in NuGet Package Acquisition/Installation [CRITICAL PATH START, CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_nuget_package_acquisitioninstallation__critical_path_start__critical_.md)

This category focuses on manipulating the process of fetching and installing NuGet packages, allowing the attacker to introduce malicious packages into the application's dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Feed Hijacking/Package Source Poisoning [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/feed_hijackingpackage_source_poisoning__critical_.md)

The attacker aims to control the source from which the application retrieves packages. This allows them to inject malicious packages that the application trusts and installs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Feed Communication [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_feed_communication__high-risk_path_.md)

The attacker intercepts communication between the application and the NuGet feed server. By intercepting and modifying requests and responses, the attacker can trick the application into downloading and installing malicious packages instead of legitimate ones. This requires the attacker to be in a position to intercept network traffic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Add Malicious Package Source to Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/add_malicious_package_source_to_configuration__high-risk_path_.md)

The attacker manipulates the application's NuGet configuration to include a malicious feed source. This can be achieved by compromising configuration files directly or by tricking an administrator into adding the malicious source. Once added, the application will trust and potentially install packages from this malicious source.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Confusion/Substitution [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_confusionsubstitution__high-risk_path__critical_.md)

The attacker exploits the possibility of internal and public packages having the same name. They upload a malicious package with the same name as an internal dependency to a public NuGet feed. If the application is not configured to prioritize internal feeds correctly, the NuGet client might download and install the malicious public package instead of the intended internal one.

## Attack Tree Path: [Typosquatting [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/typosquatting__high-risk_path_.md)

The attacker registers a package on a public feed with a name that is very similar to a legitimate and commonly used dependency (e.g., a slight misspelling). Developers might accidentally install the typosquatted malicious package due to a simple typing error or oversight.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in NuGet Package Content [CRITICAL PATH START, CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_nuget_package_content__critical_path_start__critical_.md)

This category focuses on the malicious content that can be embedded within NuGet packages themselves, leading to direct compromise upon installation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Code in Package Install Scripts (.ps1, .targets) [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_code_in_package_install_scripts___ps1___targets___high-risk_path__critical_.md)

NuGet packages can contain PowerShell scripts (`.ps1`) or MSBuild targets (`.targets`) that are executed during the installation or update process. Attackers can inject malicious code into these scripts to execute arbitrary commands on the system where the package is installed. This is a direct and potent method of gaining control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Package Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_package_dependencies__high-risk_path_.md)

A malicious package might include legitimate but vulnerable third-party dependencies. When the application installs the malicious package, it also pulls in these vulnerable dependencies. The attacker can then exploit these vulnerabilities within the application's environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `nuget.client` Library Itself [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in__nuget_client__library_itself__critical_.md)

This category involves exploiting inherent security flaws within the `nuget.client` library code itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Known Vulnerabilities in `nuget.client` [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/known_vulnerabilities_in__nuget_client___high-risk_path_.md)

If the application uses an outdated version of `nuget.client`, it might be vulnerable to publicly disclosed security flaws. Attackers can leverage readily available exploit code to target these known vulnerabilities and potentially gain control of the application or the system it runs on.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting NuGet API Key Management [CRITICAL PATH START, CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_nuget_api_key_management__critical_path_start__critical_.md)

This category focuses on compromising the API keys used for publishing NuGet packages, allowing attackers to inject malicious packages into trusted feeds.

## Attack Tree Path: [Stealing NuGet API Keys [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/stealing_nuget_api_keys__high-risk_path__critical_.md)

Attackers attempt to obtain valid NuGet API keys. This can be achieved through various methods, including:
    *   Compromising developer machines where keys might be stored in configuration files or environment variables.
    *   Compromising CI/CD pipelines that use API keys for automated package publishing.
    *   Intercepting API keys during transmission (though less likely if HTTPS is enforced).

## Attack Tree Path: [Using Stolen API Keys for Malicious Purposes [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/using_stolen_api_keys_for_malicious_purposes__high-risk_path_.md)

Once an attacker has obtained valid NuGet API keys, they can use them to publish malicious packages to internal or public NuGet feeds. These malicious packages can then be installed by unsuspecting applications, leading to compromise.
