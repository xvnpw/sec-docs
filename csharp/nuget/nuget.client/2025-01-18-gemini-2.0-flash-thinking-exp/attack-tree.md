## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Package Management Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_package_management_vulnerabilities.md)

This category represents the core weakness of relying on external packages. Attackers can exploit the trust placed in the package management system to introduce malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Package](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_package.md)

Attackers aim to introduce a malicious package into the application's dependency chain. This can be achieved through various methods.

## Attack Tree Path: [Typosquatting/Name Confusion](./attack_tree_paths/typosquattingname_confusion.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers register a new NuGet package with a name that is very similar to a legitimate and popular dependency. Developers, making a typo or not paying close attention, might accidentally include the malicious package in their project. When the application builds and downloads dependencies, it will fetch the attacker's malicious package instead of the intended one. The malicious package can then execute arbitrary code within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Confusion Attack](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_confusion_attack.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Organizations often use private NuGet feeds for internal packages. Attackers can upload a malicious package to the public NuGet Gallery with the same name and version as an internal dependency. When the application's build process attempts to resolve dependencies, NuGet might prioritize the public repository over the private one (depending on configuration), leading to the download and inclusion of the attacker's malicious package.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Package Source](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_package_source.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to a NuGet package source, either the official NuGet Gallery or a private/internal feed.
    *   **Compromise Official NuGet Gallery Account:** Attackers compromise the credentials of a legitimate package maintainer on the official NuGet Gallery. This allows them to upload malicious versions of existing, trusted packages, which will then be downloaded by applications using those packages.
    *   **Compromise Private/Internal Feed:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the private NuGet feed server or compromise the credentials used to access it. This allows them to upload malicious packages directly to the internal feed, which are then trusted and used by internal applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [Package Takeover](./attack_tree_paths/package_takeover.md)

Attackers aim to gain control over an existing, legitimate NuGet package.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Existing Package Maintainer Account](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_existing_package_maintainer_account.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers use techniques like phishing, credential stuffing, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the maintainer's accounts to gain access to their NuGet Gallery account. Once in control, they can push malicious updates to the existing package. Applications that automatically update their dependencies will then download and incorporate the compromised version, leading to potential code execution within the application's context.
