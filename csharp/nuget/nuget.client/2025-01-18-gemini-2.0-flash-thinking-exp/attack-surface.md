# Attack Surface Analysis for nuget/nuget.client

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Package Injection via Compromised Sources](./attack_surfaces/malicious_package_injection_via_compromised_sources.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Malicious Package Injection via Compromised Sources**
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious NuGet packages into repositories that the application trusts or is configured to use.
    *   **How NuGet.Client Contributes:** `nuget.client` is responsible for fetching and installing packages from configured sources. It will download and install packages without inherently verifying their safety beyond signature checks (if enabled and trusted).
    *   **Example:** An attacker compromises a private NuGet feed and uploads a package with the same name as an internal library but containing malware. When the application tries to update or install this library, `nuget.client` downloads and installs the malicious version.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breach, supply chain compromise, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use only trusted and reputable NuGet package sources.
        *   Implement strong access controls and security measures for private NuGet feeds.
        *   Enable and enforce NuGet package signing and verify signatures.
        *   Regularly audit configured package sources.
        *   Consider using a package manager that supports dependency scanning and vulnerability analysis.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attacks](./attack_surfaces/dependency_confusionsubstitution_attacks.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attacks**
    *   **Description:** Attackers upload malicious packages to public repositories with names that match or are similar to internal or private packages used by the application.
    *   **How NuGet.Client Contributes:** `nuget.client` resolves package dependencies based on configured sources. If public sources are checked before private ones (or if private sources are not explicitly configured), `nuget.client` might download the attacker's malicious package from the public repository.
    *   **Example:** An internal project uses a package named `Internal.Utilities`. An attacker uploads a package with the same name to NuGet.org. If the application's NuGet configuration isn't properly set up, `nuget.client` might download the malicious `Internal.Utilities` from NuGet.org instead of the legitimate internal one.
    *   **Impact:** Installation of malicious code, potential for remote code execution, data exfiltration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Explicitly configure private NuGet feeds and prioritize them in the NuGet configuration.
        *   Use unique and namespaced package names for internal packages.
        *   Implement a process for verifying the origin of dependencies.
        *   Consider using a tool that helps detect and prevent dependency confusion attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Code Execution via Package Content](./attack_surfaces/malicious_code_execution_via_package_content.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Malicious Code Execution via Package Content**
    *   **Description:** Downloaded NuGet packages contain malicious code that is executed during installation, build processes, or runtime.
    *   **How NuGet.Client Contributes:** `nuget.client` downloads the raw package content. While it doesn't directly execute the code, it places the files on the system, making them available for execution by other processes (e.g., build scripts, application runtime).
    *   **Example:** A malicious package contains an `install.ps1` script that executes arbitrary commands with elevated privileges when the package is installed.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, system compromise, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use only trusted package sources.
        *   Enable and enforce package signing and verify signatures.
        *   Implement static and dynamic analysis of NuGet packages before deployment.
        *   Restrict the permissions of processes that install and use NuGet packages.
        *   Monitor system activity for suspicious behavior after package installations.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Transitive Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_transitive_dependencies.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Vulnerabilities in Transitive Dependencies**
    *   **Description:**  A directly used NuGet package is secure, but it depends on another package that contains known vulnerabilities.
    *   **How NuGet.Client Contributes:** `nuget.client` automatically resolves and downloads transitive dependencies. If a vulnerable transitive dependency is included, the application becomes vulnerable even if the directly referenced package is safe.
    *   **Example:** Your application uses Package A, which is secure. However, Package A depends on Package B, which has a known remote code execution vulnerability. `nuget.client` downloads both, and your application is now vulnerable due to Package B.
    *   **Impact:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities, potential for remote code execution, data breach.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly scan projects for known vulnerabilities in direct and transitive dependencies.
        *   Use tools that provide dependency vulnerability scanning and reporting.
        *   Keep dependencies up-to-date with security patches.
        *   Consider using a dependency management tool that allows for policy enforcement regarding vulnerable dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of NuGet Credentials](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_nuget_credentials.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Insecure Storage of NuGet Credentials**
    *   **Description:** Credentials used to authenticate with private NuGet feeds are stored insecurely, making them accessible to attackers.
    *   **How NuGet.Client Contributes:** `nuget.client` needs credentials to access authenticated feeds. If these credentials are stored in plain text configuration files or in easily accessible locations, they can be compromised.
    *   **Example:** NuGet API keys are stored in a `nuget.config` file within the project repository without proper encryption. An attacker gains access to the repository and steals the API keys, allowing them to push malicious packages to the private feed.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to private feeds, potential for malicious package injection, compromise of internal resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use secure credential management solutions (e.g., Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault).
        *   Avoid storing credentials directly in configuration files.
        *   Utilize environment variables or secure configuration providers for storing sensitive information.
        *   Implement proper access controls for systems and files containing NuGet credentials.
