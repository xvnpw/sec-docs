    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Strictly avoid hardcoding credentials.**
        *   Implement code reviews and static analysis tools to detect hardcoded secrets.
        *   Utilize secure configuration mechanisms instead.

*   **Attack Vector:**  Vulnerabilities in the application code that allow an attacker to read sensitive information from memory where the connection string might be temporarily stored.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Moderate, depending on the complexity of the application and the presence of memory-related vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Critical, as it allows direct access to the active connection string.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement secure coding practices to prevent memory leaks and buffer overflows.
        *   Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using memory protection techniques.

**4.4. Logging and Monitoring:**

*   **Attack Vector:** Database credentials or connection strings inadvertently logged by the application.
    *   **Likelihood:** Moderate, especially if logging configurations are not carefully reviewed and sensitive data filtering is not implemented.
    *   **Impact:** Critical, as logs can be easily accessed by attackers who gain access to the server or logging infrastructure.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Implement strict logging policies and avoid logging sensitive information.**
        *   Sanitize log messages to remove any potential credentials.
        *   Secure access to log files and logging infrastructure.
