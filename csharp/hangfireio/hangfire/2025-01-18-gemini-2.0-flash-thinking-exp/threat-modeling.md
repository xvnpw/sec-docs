# Threat Model Analysis for hangfireio/hangfire

## Threat: [Unauthorized Dashboard Access](./threats/unauthorized_dashboard_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could attempt to access the Hangfire dashboard without proper authentication. This could involve brute-forcing credentials if basic authentication is used, exploiting default credentials if not changed, or leveraging vulnerabilities in Hangfire's authentication mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure about background jobs, server status, and potentially sensitive application data. The attacker could also manipulate or delete jobs, leading to disruption of services or data corruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Hangfire.Dashboard` module, specifically the authentication and authorization middleware.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for the Hangfire dashboard.
        *   Use Hangfire's built-in authorization filters or integrate with the application's existing authentication system (e.g., ASP.NET Core Identity).
        *   Ensure default credentials are changed immediately upon deployment.
        *   Restrict access to the dashboard endpoint to authorized users or IP addresses.
        *   Regularly review and update authentication configurations.

## Threat: [Malicious Job Execution via Dashboard](./threats/malicious_job_execution_via_dashboard.md)

*   **Description:** An authenticated attacker with sufficient privileges could create or trigger background jobs with malicious intent. This could involve executing arbitrary code on the server, interacting with internal systems in an unauthorized way, or performing actions that lead to data breaches or denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, system compromise, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Hangfire.Dashboard` module, specifically the job management features (e.g., triggering ad-hoc jobs, managing recurring jobs). `Hangfire.BackgroundJob` component responsible for executing the job.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement granular authorization controls within the Hangfire dashboard to restrict who can create and trigger jobs.
        *   Carefully review and sanitize any user input used in job creation or execution parameters.
        *   Consider using a limited set of predefined job types with controlled parameters instead of allowing arbitrary code execution.
        *   Implement code review processes for background job implementations.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Job Arguments](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_job_arguments.md)

*   **Description:** If job arguments are serialized and deserialized (e.g., using JSON.NET or binary formatters), an attacker could craft malicious serialized payloads that, when deserialized by Hangfire workers, lead to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Hangfire.Common` for serialization/deserialization mechanisms used for job arguments. `Hangfire.BackgroundJob` component during job execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid deserializing untrusted data directly.
        *   If deserialization is necessary, use secure serialization libraries and ensure they are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization on deserialized objects.
        *   Consider using simpler data formats for job arguments or passing references to data instead of the data itself.

## Threat: [SQL Injection in Hangfire Persistence](./threats/sql_injection_in_hangfire_persistence.md)

*   **Description:** If Hangfire is configured to use a SQL database for persistence and input validation is insufficient, an attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL queries through job parameters or other data stored by Hangfire.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, potential for executing arbitrary commands on the database server.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Hangfire.SqlServer` (or other persistence implementations like `Hangfire.Redis`), specifically the components responsible for interacting with the database.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that Hangfire's persistence layer is properly configured to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Use parameterized queries or ORM features to interact with the database.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any data that is stored in the database.
        *   Follow security best practices for the chosen database system.
