# Attack Surface Analysis for hangfireio/hangfire

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Hangfire Dashboard Access](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_hangfire_dashboard_access.md)

- **Description:** The Hangfire dashboard, which provides insights and control over background jobs, is accessible without proper authentication or authorization.
- **How Hangfire Contributes:** Hangfire provides a built-in dashboard that, if not secured, becomes a direct entry point for attackers to interact with the job processing system.
- **Example:** An attacker navigates to the `/hangfire` URL of the application and gains access to view all jobs, trigger new jobs, or delete existing ones without providing any credentials.
- **Impact:** Full control over background job processing, potential data manipulation or deletion, execution of arbitrary code through job creation, information disclosure about application internals.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement strong authentication for the Hangfire dashboard using `DashboardAuthorizationFilter`.
    - Avoid using default or weak credentials if any authentication mechanism is initially configured.
    - Restrict access to the dashboard to specific IP addresses or networks if applicable.
    - Regularly review and update the authentication and authorization logic for the dashboard.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Job Arguments](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_job_arguments.md)

- **Description:** Hangfire serializes job arguments for storage and deserializes them when a worker picks up the job. If the deserialization process is vulnerable, attackers can craft malicious payloads that execute arbitrary code upon deserialization.
- **How Hangfire Contributes:** Hangfire's core functionality relies on serialization and deserialization of job data, making it susceptible to deserialization attacks if not handled carefully.
- **Example:** An attacker manages to inject a malicious serialized object as a job argument. When a Hangfire worker processes this job, the malicious object is deserialized, leading to code execution on the server.
- **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breach.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources.
    - If deserialization is necessary, use safe deserialization methods or restrict the types of objects that can be deserialized.
    - Implement input validation and sanitization for job arguments before they are serialized.
    - Regularly update the serialization libraries used by Hangfire.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Hangfire Dashboard](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_the_hangfire_dashboard.md)

- **Description:** The Hangfire dashboard contains vulnerabilities that allow attackers to inject malicious scripts that are executed in the browsers of users accessing the dashboard.
- **How Hangfire Contributes:** The dashboard's user interface, if not properly sanitized, can become a vector for XSS attacks.
- **Example:** An attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into a job parameter or a dashboard comment. When an administrator views this information in the dashboard, the script executes, potentially stealing session cookies or performing actions on their behalf.
- **Impact:** Session hijacking, credential theft, defacement of the dashboard, redirection to malicious sites.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement proper output encoding and sanitization for all user-supplied data displayed in the Hangfire dashboard.
    - Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the dashboard can load resources.
    - Regularly update Hangfire to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Execution of Untrusted Code through Background Jobs](./attack_surfaces/execution_of_untrusted_code_through_background_jobs.md)

- **Description:** The application allows users or external systems to define or influence the code executed within background jobs, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code.
- **How Hangfire Contributes:** Hangfire facilitates the execution of arbitrary code defined as background jobs. If the source or parameters of these jobs are not controlled, it becomes an attack vector.
- **Example:** An attacker can create a background job with parameters that, when processed, execute a shell command on the server.
- **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breach.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Strictly control the source and definition of background jobs.
    - Avoid allowing users to directly define or influence the code executed in background jobs.
    - Implement strong input validation and sanitization for all job parameters.
    - Use a sandboxed environment or least privilege principles for Hangfire worker processes.
