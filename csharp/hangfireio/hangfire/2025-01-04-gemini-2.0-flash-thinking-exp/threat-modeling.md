# Threat Model Analysis for hangfireio/hangfire

## Threat: [Unauthorized Dashboard Access](./threats/unauthorized_dashboard_access.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the Hangfire dashboard without proper authentication. This could be achieved by exploiting default credentials (if any), brute-forcing weak credentials, or exploiting misconfigurations in the authentication setup provided by Hangfire.

**Impact:** Attackers can view sensitive job information (arguments, results, execution history), manipulate job queues (delete, trigger, or pause jobs), and potentially gain insights into the application's internal workings and infrastructure *through the Hangfire interface*.

**Affected Hangfire Component:**  Hangfire.Dashboard (the web UI module).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication for the Hangfire dashboard using Hangfire's built-in features or integration with existing authentication mechanisms.
*   Avoid using default credentials provided by Hangfire (if any).
*   Enforce strong password policies if using local authentication.
*   Consider using an authorization mechanism to restrict access based on user roles or permissions within the Hangfire dashboard.
*   Restrict access to the dashboard to specific IP addresses or networks if possible *at the network level or within Hangfire's configuration*.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Dashboard](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_the_dashboard.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious client-side scripts into the Hangfire dashboard UI. This could happen if user-supplied data (e.g., job names, arguments displayed in the dashboard) is not properly sanitized before rendering *by the Hangfire dashboard*. When other users access the dashboard, these scripts are executed in their browsers.

**Impact:** Session hijacking *of Hangfire dashboard users*, credential theft *related to the dashboard session*, redirection to malicious websites, and defacement of the dashboard.

**Affected Hangfire Component:** Hangfire.Dashboard (view rendering logic).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure Hangfire is updated to the latest version containing security patches for XSS vulnerabilities in the dashboard.
*   If customizing the Hangfire dashboard, implement proper input validation and output encoding/escaping to prevent the injection of malicious scripts.
*   Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources for the Hangfire dashboard.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Job Arguments](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_job_arguments.md)

**Description:** If job arguments are serialized using insecure methods (e.g., binary serialization without proper type handling), an attacker could craft malicious serialized payloads. When these payloads are deserialized by a Hangfire worker, *a component of Hangfire*, it could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Hangfire worker process and potentially the underlying system.

**Affected Hangfire Component:** Hangfire.BackgroundJobServer (job processing logic), potentially the storage mechanism if it stores serialized data directly (depending on the chosen storage).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using insecure serialization formats like binary serialization for job arguments when using Hangfire. Prefer safer formats like JSON, which Hangfire supports.
*   If binary serialization is necessary, ensure proper type handling and validation during deserialization *within the job implementation, being mindful of how Hangfire handles deserialization*.
*   Keep the .NET runtime and Hangfire dependencies updated to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities that might affect Hangfire's internal workings.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Job Storage](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_job_storage.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information contained within job arguments or results is stored in the Hangfire storage (e.g., database). If this storage is compromised due to vulnerabilities related to how Hangfire interacts with the storage (e.g., insufficient parameterization leading to SQL injection if using SQL Server storage, although Hangfire uses parameterized queries), or if the storage itself is insecure, this data could be exposed.

**Impact:** Data breaches, privacy violations, exposure of business secrets.

**Affected Hangfire Component:** Hangfire.Storage (the underlying storage mechanism integration, e.g., `Hangfire.SqlServer`, `Hangfire.Redis`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the underlying Hangfire storage with strong authentication and authorization, following the best practices for the chosen storage provider.
*   Encrypt sensitive data at rest in the Hangfire storage if the storage provider supports it.
*   Ensure secure communication between the application and the Hangfire storage (e.g., use TLS/SSL for database connections).
*   Keep Hangfire and its storage provider integration packages updated to benefit from security fixes.

## Threat: [Job Data Tampering in Storage](./threats/job_data_tampering_in_storage.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Hangfire storage and directly modifies job data (arguments, state, scheduled time). This could be due to vulnerabilities in how Hangfire manages access to the storage or due to compromised storage credentials.

**Impact:**  Incorrect processing of jobs, execution of jobs with malicious arguments, denial of service by altering job schedules.

**Affected Hangfire Component:** Hangfire.Storage (the underlying storage mechanism integration).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the underlying Hangfire storage with strong authentication and authorization.
*   Implement access controls to restrict who can read and write to the Hangfire storage, considering the permissions granted to the Hangfire application itself.
*   Consider using auditing mechanisms provided by the storage provider to track modifications to job data.

## Threat: [Execution of Malicious Code through Background Jobs](./threats/execution_of_malicious_code_through_background_jobs.md)

**Description:** If the code executed within background jobs, *triggered and managed by Hangfire*, is not carefully controlled and validated, an attacker might be able to inject malicious code that gets executed by Hangfire workers. This could happen if job arguments are used to construct and execute dynamic code within the job implementation.

**Impact:**  System compromise, data breaches, remote code execution *within the context of the Hangfire worker process*.

**Affected Hangfire Component:** Hangfire.BackgroundJobServer (job execution).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all inputs used within background jobs.
*   Avoid constructing and executing dynamic code based on user-supplied input within jobs managed by Hangfire.
*   Adhere to secure coding practices when developing background jobs that will be processed by Hangfire.
*   Implement proper error handling and logging within background jobs to detect and respond to unexpected behavior.
