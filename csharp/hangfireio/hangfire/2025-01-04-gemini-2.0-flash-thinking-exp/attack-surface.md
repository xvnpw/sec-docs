# Attack Surface Analysis for hangfireio/hangfire

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Hangfire Dashboard Access](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_hangfire_dashboard_access.md)

* **Unprotected Hangfire Dashboard Access:**
    * Description: The Hangfire dashboard, which provides insights and control over background jobs, is accessible without proper authentication and authorization.
    * How Hangfire Contributes: Hangfire provides the dashboard UI and its associated endpoints. If not secured, this direct access point is a vulnerability inherent to Hangfire's features.
    * Example: An attacker accesses the `/hangfire` URL of an application without needing to log in and can view job details, trigger new jobs, or delete existing ones.
    * Impact: Information disclosure (job details, server info), data manipulation (deleting jobs), denial of service (triggering resource-intensive jobs), potential for escalating privileges if job execution can be manipulated.
    * Risk Severity: **Critical**
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Implement authentication and authorization for the Hangfire dashboard using Hangfire's built-in features or integration with the application's authentication system.
        * Restrict access to the dashboard to authorized users only.
        * Review and configure the `DashboardAuthorizationFilters` to enforce access control.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization of Job Arguments](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization_of_job_arguments.md)

* **Insecure Deserialization of Job Arguments:**
    * Description: Hangfire serializes job arguments for storage and retrieval. If insecure deserialization methods are used, attackers can inject malicious code that Hangfire workers will execute upon deserialization.
    * How Hangfire Contributes: Hangfire's core functionality involves serializing and deserializing job arguments passed to background tasks. This process, if not handled securely, directly introduces the vulnerability.
    * Example: An attacker crafts a malicious serialized object as a job argument. When a Hangfire worker attempts to deserialize this object, it executes arbitrary code on the server.
    * Impact: **Critical** - Remote code execution on the server, leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.
    * Risk Severity: **Critical**
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Avoid using insecure deserialization formats like `BinaryFormatter`. Prefer safer alternatives like JSON.NET with type name handling disabled or carefully controlled.
        * Sanitize and validate job arguments before processing them in the background job logic.
        * Implement input validation to prevent unexpected data types or structures in job arguments.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Recurring Job Creation/Modification](./attack_surfaces/malicious_recurring_job_creationmodification.md)

* **Malicious Recurring Job Creation/Modification:**
    * Description: Attackers can create or modify recurring jobs through Hangfire's interface or API to execute arbitrary code or cause denial of service.
    * How Hangfire Contributes: Hangfire provides the mechanism for defining and scheduling recurring jobs. The vulnerability lies in the potential for unauthorized or improperly validated creation/modification of these jobs within Hangfire's framework.
    * Example: An attacker schedules a recurring job that executes a malicious script every minute, overloading the server or performing unauthorized actions.
    * Impact: Denial of service, resource exhaustion, potential for arbitrary code execution depending on the job's logic.
    * Risk Severity: **High**
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Restrict the ability to create or modify recurring jobs to authorized administrators only.
        * Implement strict input validation and sanitization for recurring job definitions (cron expressions, job parameters) within the application logic interacting with Hangfire.
        * Review and monitor existing recurring jobs for suspicious activity.
