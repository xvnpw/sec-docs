## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Job Processing Mechanism](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_job_processing_mechanism.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
* Malicious Job Payload Injection:
    * Deserialization Vulnerability: Inject a serialized object containing malicious code into a job parameter or state. When the Hangfire server deserializes this object, the malicious code is executed.
    * Type Confusion/Polymorphic Deserialization: Craft a payload that, upon deserialization, instantiates a different, malicious type than expected, leading to code execution.
* Crafted Job State Manipulation:
    * Direct Database Manipulation (if accessible): If the attacker gains access to the underlying job storage (e.g., SQL Server, Redis), they can directly modify job data, including parameters or state, to inject malicious commands or scripts.
    * Exploiting Delayed/Retried Job Logic: Manipulate job state (e.g., through the dashboard or direct storage access) to force a specific job to retry with modified parameters containing malicious code.
* Exploiting Job Activator:
    * Custom Job Activator Vulnerabilities: If a custom `JobActivator` is used, vulnerabilities within its implementation could be exploited to instantiate malicious objects or control the creation process in a harmful way.
* **Risk Summary:** This path is high-risk due to the potential for direct code execution on the server, which has a critical impact. The likelihood is elevated by common vulnerabilities like insecure deserialization and potential access to the job storage.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Hangfire Dashboard via Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_hangfire_dashboard_via_authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
* Default Credentials: If default credentials for the Hangfire dashboard are not changed, attackers can gain unauthorized access.
* Weak or Missing Authentication: Exploit vulnerabilities in the authentication mechanism (e.g., brute-force, credential stuffing) if it's not robust.
* Authorization Flaws: Exploit flaws in the authorization logic to access functionalities beyond the attacker's intended permissions.
* **Risk Summary:** This path is high-risk because successfully bypassing authentication grants the attacker significant control over the Hangfire environment, allowing them to manipulate jobs, view sensitive information, and potentially escalate privileges. The likelihood is moderate due to common misconfigurations and weak authentication practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Hangfire Configuration via Insecure Job Storage Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_hangfire_configuration_via_insecure_job_storage_configuration.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
* Publicly Accessible Job Storage: If the underlying job storage (e.g., Redis without authentication, publicly accessible SQL Server) is not properly secured, attackers can directly access and manipulate job data.
* Weak Storage Credentials: Use of default or weak credentials for accessing the job storage.
* **Risk Summary:** This path is high-risk because it provides direct access to the persistent state of Hangfire jobs. This allows attackers to manipulate job data, potentially inject malicious payloads, and disrupt job processing. The likelihood depends on the security practices applied to the job storage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Malicious Job Payload Injection](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_malicious_job_payload_injection.md)

* **Vulnerability:** The application processes job payloads, and a vulnerability exists where malicious data within the payload can be interpreted and executed by the Hangfire server.
* **Impact:**  Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Deserialization Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_deserialization_vulnerability.md)

* **Vulnerability:** The Hangfire server deserializes data (likely for job parameters or state) without proper validation, allowing an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects that execute code upon deserialization.
* **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Type Confusion/Polymorphic Deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_type_confusionpolymorphic_deserialization.md)

* **Vulnerability:** The deserialization process can be tricked into instantiating unexpected, malicious types, leading to code execution.
* **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Direct Database Manipulation (if accessible)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_direct_database_manipulation__if_accessible_.md)

* **Vulnerability:** The attacker gains direct access to the underlying job storage database and can modify job data.
* **Impact:**  Potential for arbitrary code execution by modifying job parameters or state, data manipulation, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Custom Job Activator Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_custom_job_activator_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Vulnerability:** A custom `JobActivator` implementation contains security flaws that allow attackers to control the instantiation of job objects in a malicious way.
* **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution during job instantiation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Default Credentials (Dashboard)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_default_credentials__dashboard_.md)

* **Vulnerability:** The default credentials for the Hangfire dashboard are not changed.
* **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the Hangfire dashboard, allowing manipulation of jobs and potentially further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Injection Vulnerabilities (Dashboard)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_injection_vulnerabilities__dashboard_.md)

* **Vulnerability:** The Hangfire dashboard contains input fields or functionalities that are vulnerable to injection attacks (e.g., command injection, SQL injection).
* **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution on the server or compromise of the underlying job storage database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Publicly Accessible Job Storage](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_publicly_accessible_job_storage.md)

* **Vulnerability:** The underlying job storage is accessible without proper authentication or authorization.
* **Impact:** Direct access to and manipulation of Hangfire job data, potentially leading to code execution or data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Weak Storage Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_weak_storage_credentials.md)

* **Vulnerability:** Weak or default credentials are used to protect access to the job storage.
* **Impact:** Full access to the Hangfire job storage, allowing manipulation of job data and potentially code injection.
