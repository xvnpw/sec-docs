# Threat Model Analysis for hangfireio/hangfire

## Threat: [Unsecured Hangfire Job Data in Storage](./threats/unsecured_hangfire_job_data_in_storage.md)

*   **Description:** Hangfire stores job data, including arguments and results, in a persistent storage. If Hangfire's access to this storage is not properly secured, or if data within the storage is not protected by Hangfire configurations, an attacker could bypass Hangfire and directly access or manipulate this sensitive job data. This could involve reading job arguments containing secrets, modifying job states, or deleting jobs.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach of sensitive job data managed by Hangfire, data integrity compromise of job processing, potential regulatory fines, business disruption due to data manipulation or loss.
    *   **Hangfire Component Affected:** Hangfire Storage (Redis, SQL Server, etc.), Hangfire Core.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure Hangfire to use secure connection methods to the storage (e.g., authentication, encryption in transit).
        *   Implement strong access control lists (ACLs) or firewall rules at the storage level to restrict direct access, even if compromised, to only authorized Hangfire components and administrators.
        *   Consider encrypting sensitive data within job arguments *before* enqueueing if storage-level encryption is insufficient or not applicable.
        *   Regularly audit storage access logs for suspicious activity related to Hangfire's data.

## Threat: [Job Argument Injection / Data Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./threats/job_argument_injection__data_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious job arguments that are processed by Hangfire. By exploiting vulnerabilities in how Hangfire deserializes or processes job arguments, especially if custom deserialization is used or arguments are not properly validated, the attacker could achieve remote code execution on the Hangfire server or manipulate job processing logic.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Hangfire server, data corruption during job processing, denial of service, potential full system compromise.
    *   **Hangfire Component Affected:** Job Processing, Job Deserialization within Hangfire Core and potentially custom job logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid passing sensitive or executable code directly as job arguments.
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all job arguments *before* enqueueing and within job processing logic, especially if they originate from untrusted sources.
        *   Use secure and well-vetted deserialization libraries and practices.
        *   Regularly update Hangfire and its dependencies to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement input validation and output encoding within job processing logic to prevent injection attacks.

## Threat: [Unsecured Hangfire Dashboard Access](./threats/unsecured_hangfire_dashboard_access.md)

*   **Description:** The Hangfire Dashboard, a web interface for managing and monitoring jobs, is exposed without proper authentication or authorization. An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the dashboard and use its features to monitor job details, delete critical jobs, trigger job retries maliciously, or potentially manipulate recurring jobs if these features are exposed.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized job management leading to data loss or business disruption, information disclosure through job details, potential denial of service by deleting or pausing jobs, potential data manipulation or system compromise depending on dashboard capabilities and job functionalities.
    *   **Hangfire Component Affected:** Hangfire Dashboard, Hangfire Core Authentication/Authorization mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication for the Hangfire Dashboard, ideally integrated with the application's existing authentication system or using Hangfire's built-in authorization filters.
        *   Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) to strictly limit dashboard functionality based on user roles, preventing unauthorized job management actions.
        *   Regularly review and audit dashboard access logs for suspicious activity.
        *   Consider disabling the dashboard in production environments if not strictly necessary, or restrict access to a dedicated management network behind a VPN or firewall.
        *   Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication with the dashboard and protect credentials in transit.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Job Enqueueing](./threats/unauthorized_job_enqueueing.md)

*   **Description:**  Job enqueueing mechanisms provided by Hangfire (e.g., API endpoints, direct queue access if exposed) are not properly secured. An attacker could bypass intended application logic and directly enqueue a large number of jobs, potentially leading to denial of service by overloading the Hangfire server. They could also enqueue malicious jobs if input validation at the enqueueing point is weak or non-existent.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service due to resource exhaustion on the Hangfire server, potential execution of malicious jobs leading to data corruption or system compromise, application instability.
    *   **Hangfire Component Affected:** Hangfire Job Enqueueing mechanisms (BackgroundJob.Enqueue, RecurringJob.AddOrUpdate, API endpoints if exposed), Hangfire Server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for all job enqueueing endpoints or methods.
        *   Rate limit job enqueueing requests to prevent abuse and denial of service attacks.
        *   Thoroughly validate job parameters and inputs at the enqueueing stage to prevent injection of malicious payloads or invalid data.
        *   Monitor job queues for unusual activity and implement alerting mechanisms to detect and respond to potential unauthorized enqueueing attempts.
        *   Secure any API endpoints used for job enqueueing with standard web security practices (HTTPS, input validation, authentication).

## Threat: [Vulnerable Hangfire Version or Dependencies](./threats/vulnerable_hangfire_version_or_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses an outdated version of Hangfire or its dependencies that contain known security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities, potentially gaining remote code execution on the Hangfire server or compromising sensitive data managed by Hangfire.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Hangfire server, data breaches, denial of service, depending on the specific vulnerability. Full system compromise is possible in severe cases.
    *   **Hangfire Component Affected:** Hangfire Core, Hangfire Dashboard, Hangfire Storage Providers, all Hangfire Dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Establish a process for regularly updating Hangfire and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
        *   Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases specifically for Hangfire and its dependencies.
        *   Integrate vulnerability scanning tools into the development and deployment pipeline to automatically detect vulnerable dependencies.
        *   Have a plan in place to quickly patch or mitigate identified vulnerabilities in Hangfire and its dependencies.
