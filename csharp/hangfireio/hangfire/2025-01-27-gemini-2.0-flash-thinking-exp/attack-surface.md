# Attack Surface Analysis for hangfireio/hangfire

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Hangfire Dashboard Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_hangfire_dashboard_access.md)

*   **Description:** The Hangfire Dashboard, providing monitoring and management, is accessible without authentication.
*   **Hangfire Contribution:** Hangfire provides the dashboard feature, and lack of default authentication directly contributes to this attack surface if developers fail to implement security.
*   **Example:** An application deploys Hangfire and neglects to configure dashboard authentication. Anyone accessing the dashboard URL can view sensitive job details, server information, and potentially manipulate job processing.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (job details, server info), unauthorized job manipulation, exposure of application logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Authentication:** Configure Hangfire Dashboard authentication using built-in providers (e.g., ASP.NET Core authentication) or custom authentication logic.
    *   **Authorization Rules:** Implement authorization rules to restrict dashboard access to specific roles or users.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Restrict network access to the dashboard, allowing only trusted networks or IP ranges.

## Attack Surface: [Job Argument Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/job_argument_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Hangfire serializes job arguments for storage and deserializes them during job execution. Insecure deserialization can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Hangfire Contribution:** Hangfire's core job persistence mechanism relies on serialization and deserialization. The choice of serializer and potential vulnerabilities within this process are directly related to Hangfire.
*   **Example:** An application uses a vulnerable deserialization formatter with Hangfire. An attacker crafts a malicious payload as a job argument. When Hangfire deserializes this argument for job execution, the payload executes, resulting in Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Secure Serialization:** Utilize secure serialization methods and libraries. In .NET, prefer `System.Text.Json` over older, less secure formatters.
    *   **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Ensure Hangfire and its serialization dependencies are updated to the latest versions with security patches.
    *   **Input Validation (Defense in Depth):** Validate job arguments after deserialization to detect and reject unexpected or malicious data, adding a layer of defense.

## Attack Surface: [Job Argument Injection](./attack_surfaces/job_argument_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Job arguments, if not validated and sanitized, can inject malicious commands, SQL, or other harmful inputs into job execution logic.
*   **Hangfire Contribution:** Hangfire directly passes job arguments to job methods. The responsibility for secure handling of these arguments within job implementations is crucial and directly related to how Hangfire jobs are designed.
*   **Example:** A job takes a filename as an argument and processes a file. If the filename is not validated, an attacker could inject a path like `../../../../etc/passwd`, leading to path traversal and information disclosure. Similarly, unsanitized arguments in database queries within jobs can cause SQL injection.
*   **Impact:** Command Injection, SQL Injection, Path Traversal, Logic Bugs, Information Disclosure, potentially RCE depending on the injection type and context.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation for all job arguments, defining allowed formats, lengths, and character sets.
    *   **Input Sanitization/Encoding:** Sanitize or encode job arguments before using them in commands, database queries, or file system operations to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run job execution environments with minimal necessary permissions to limit the impact of successful injection attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion through Malicious Jobs](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_through_malicious_jobs.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can schedule jobs designed to consume excessive resources, leading to Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Hangfire Contribution:** Hangfire's core function is to execute scheduled jobs. If job scheduling is not controlled or job logic is inefficient, it can be exploited to exhaust server resources.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to job scheduling and schedules numerous CPU-intensive jobs. This overwhelms the Hangfire server, causing unresponsiveness and potentially disrupting the entire application.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application instability, performance degradation, impacting availability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Implement rate limiting on job scheduling endpoints to prevent excessive job creation.
    *   **Job Queue Monitoring and Management:** Monitor job queue lengths and processing times. Implement mechanisms to pause or stop queues if overloaded.
    *   **Resource Limits for Workers:** Configure resource limits (CPU, memory) for Hangfire worker processes to prevent individual jobs from consuming excessive resources.
    *   **Input Validation and Job Logic Review:** Carefully review job logic for potential resource-intensive operations and validate job arguments to prevent malicious inputs triggering resource exhaustion.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Hangfire Dashboard](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_hangfire_dashboard.md)

*   **Description:** The Hangfire Dashboard might be vulnerable to XSS if user-supplied data displayed in the dashboard is not properly sanitized.
*   **Hangfire Contribution:** The Hangfire Dashboard is a component provided by Hangfire. Vulnerabilities within the dashboard code, such as XSS, are directly attributable to Hangfire.
*   **Example:** A job argument contains malicious JavaScript. When this job is displayed in the Hangfire Dashboard, the unsanitized argument is rendered, executing the script in the dashboard user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking or malicious actions within the dashboard context.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, account takeover, defacement of the dashboard, malicious actions performed on behalf of authenticated dashboard users.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Output Encoding:** Implement proper output encoding for all user-supplied data displayed in the Hangfire Dashboard to prevent XSS. Use context-aware encoding.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy to restrict resource loading in the dashboard, mitigating XSS impact.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Updates:** Regularly audit the Hangfire Dashboard code for XSS vulnerabilities and keep Hangfire and its dependencies updated with security patches.
