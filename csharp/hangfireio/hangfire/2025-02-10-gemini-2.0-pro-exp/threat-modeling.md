# Threat Model Analysis for hangfireio/hangfire

## Threat: [Unauthorized Job Manipulation](./threats/unauthorized_job_manipulation.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Job Manipulation

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Hangfire system and creates new malicious jobs, modifies parameters of existing jobs, or reschedules jobs.  They achieve this by exploiting weak authentication/authorization *specifically within the code interacting with Hangfire's API*, or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application code that uses Hangfire. This is *not* just about Dashboard access (covered separately), but about any code path that enqueues, modifies, or deletes jobs.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Execution of arbitrary code on the server.
        *   Data corruption or deletion.
        *   Privilege escalation (if jobs run with elevated privileges).
        *   Denial of service.
        *   Exposure of sensitive information.
    *   **Affected Hangfire Component:**
        *   `BackgroundJob.Enqueue()` and related methods (for creating jobs).
        *   `RecurringJob.AddOrUpdate()` and related methods (for recurring jobs).
        *   Hangfire Storage API (if the application directly interacts with it in an insecure way).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization *before* *any* interaction with the Hangfire API (enqueueing, updating, deleting). This is the *primary* defense.
        *   Rigorously validate *all* input parameters to jobs to prevent injection attacks. Treat job arguments as untrusted.
        *   Use the principle of least privilege: Jobs should execute with the *minimum* necessary permissions.
        *   Consider digitally signing job payloads (if feasible) to ensure integrity.
        *   Regularly audit code that interacts with the Hangfire API for security vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Job Queue Flooding](./threats/denial_of_service_via_job_queue_flooding.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Job Queue Flooding

    *   **Description:** An attacker submits a massive number of jobs to the Hangfire queue, overwhelming the Hangfire worker processes and preventing legitimate jobs from being processed. This is a direct attack on Hangfire's processing capacity.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Application unavailability or severe performance degradation.
        *   Delayed processing of critical business tasks.
        *   Potential resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, database connections *due to Hangfire activity*).
    *   **Affected Hangfire Component:**
        *   Hangfire Server (worker processes).
        *   Hangfire Storage (queue).
        *   `BackgroundJob.Enqueue()` and related methods (the attack vector).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict rate limiting on job enqueueing *within the application code*. Limit the number of jobs a user/system can submit within a time window. This is the *key* mitigation.
        *   Monitor queue length and worker process utilization. Set up alerts for unusual spikes.
        *   Use queue prioritization: Separate queues for different job priorities.
        *   Consider circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures.

## Threat: [Job Poisoning (Malicious Job Code Execution)](./threats/job_poisoning__malicious_job_code_execution_.md)

*   **Threat:** Job Poisoning (Malicious Job Code Execution)

    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into the job's execution logic. This is a direct threat to the code *executed by Hangfire workers*. The vulnerability might be in the application's job code itself or in a compromised dependency *used by that job code*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete server compromise.
        *   Data exfiltration.
        *   Lateral movement.
        *   Malware installation.
    *   **Affected Hangfire Component:**
        *   Job code itself (the methods executed by Hangfire workers).
        *   Dependencies used *within* job code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet all dependencies used in job code. Use dependency scanning tools.
        *   Implement strict code reviews for *all* job code.
        *   Run worker processes in a sandboxed environment (e.g., containers) with *minimal* privileges.
        *   Robust input validation and output encoding *within* the job code.
        *   Regularly update Hangfire and all related libraries.
        *   Use a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Hangfire Dashboard Access](./threats/unauthorized_hangfire_dashboard_access.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Hangfire Dashboard Access

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Hangfire Dashboard without authorization. This is a *direct* threat to the Dashboard component.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure of sensitive job information.
        *   Ability to manually trigger, delete, or modify jobs (leading to the same impacts as "Unauthorized Job Manipulation").
        *   Denial of service.
    *   **Affected Hangfire Component:**
        *   Hangfire Dashboard.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for the Hangfire Dashboard. Use ASP.NET Core Identity, OAuth, or a robust custom solution. *Do not rely on IP restrictions alone.*
        *   Disable the Dashboard in production if not *absolutely* necessary. If needed, restrict access tightly.
        *   Audit Dashboard access logs.
        *   Keep Hangfire updated.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependencies](./threats/vulnerable_dependencies.md)

* **Threat:** Vulnerable Dependencies

    * **Description:** Hangfire itself relies on external libraries (dependencies). If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit them to compromise the system, *specifically impacting Hangfire's operation*.
    * **Impact:**
        * Varies greatly, but could range from denial of service to remote code execution *within the context of Hangfire's worker processes or Dashboard*.
    * **Affected Hangfire Component:**
        * Hangfire itself (its direct dependencies).
    * **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Hangfire to the latest version. This is the *primary* mitigation for Hangfire's *own* dependencies.
        * Use dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities.
        * Consider using a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool.
