# Attack Surface Analysis for hangfireio/hangfire

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Dashboard Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_dashboard_access.md)

**Description:** The Hangfire Dashboard provides a web UI for managing jobs.  If left unprotected, it allows anyone to view, trigger, and modify jobs.
**How Hangfire Contributes:** Hangfire *provides* the dashboard functionality; it's a built-in feature that becomes a direct attack vector if not secured.
**Example:** An attacker navigates to `/hangfire` (or the configured dashboard path) and gains full control without needing credentials.
**Impact:** Complete control over job execution, potential access to sensitive data within job arguments/results, ability to trigger malicious jobs, and deletion of legitimate jobs.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication: Use ASP.NET Core Identity, OAuth, or a similar robust authentication mechanism.
    *   Implement authorization:  Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict dashboard features based on user roles (e.g., "admin," "operator," "viewer").
    *   Network restrictions:  Limit access to the dashboard to specific IP addresses or ranges, if feasible.
    *   Disable the dashboard in production if it's not strictly required.  Use alternative monitoring tools if possible.
    *   Regularly audit dashboard access logs.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

**Description:** Hangfire serializes and deserializes job arguments and results.  Vulnerable serializers can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
**How Hangfire Contributes:** Hangfire's *core functionality* relies on serialization/deserialization for job persistence and execution. This is inherent to how Hangfire operates.
**Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized object (e.g., using `ysoserial.net`) and injects it as a job argument.  When Hangfire *deserializes* it, the attacker's code runs.
**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server hosting Hangfire.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid `BinaryFormatter`:  Never use `BinaryFormatter` for untrusted data.
    *   Secure `Newtonsoft.Json`: If using `Newtonsoft.Json`, set `TypeNameHandling` to `None` unless absolutely necessary.  If `TypeNameHandling` is required, use a custom `SerializationBinder` to strictly control allowed types.
    *   Prefer `System.Text.Json`: In newer .NET versions, use `System.Text.Json` with appropriate configuration (avoiding insecure options).
    *   Keep serializers updated:  Regularly update serialization libraries to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Input validation: Validate and sanitize *all* data that might become job arguments, even indirectly. This is crucial, as even seemingly safe data could be manipulated into a malicious payload.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Job Code (Facilitated Execution)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_job_code__facilitated_execution_.md)

**Description:** While the vulnerability resides in *your* code, Hangfire provides the *mechanism* for that vulnerable code to be executed, often with elevated privileges or in a background context.
**How Hangfire Contributes:** Hangfire *executes* the job code.  It's the execution engine.  Without Hangfire, the vulnerable code might not be reachable or exploitable in the same way.
**Example:** A job takes a user-provided string as an argument and uses it directly in a SQL query without parameterization.  Hangfire executes this job, triggering the SQL Injection.
**Impact:**  Depends on the specific vulnerability within the job code, but can range from data breaches to RCE.  Hangfire's role is in *facilitating* the execution of this vulnerable code.
**Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability)
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure coding practices:  Apply standard secure coding practices within *all* job code. This is paramount.
    *   Input validation: Treat *all* job arguments as untrusted input.  Validate and sanitize them thoroughly, *before* they reach any potentially vulnerable code.
    *   Parameterized queries:  Use parameterized queries or ORMs for database interactions.
    *   Avoid shell commands:  Minimize or eliminate the use of shell commands.  If necessary, use secure APIs and sanitize all input.
    *   Principle of least privilege:  Run Hangfire worker processes, and the jobs themselves, with the minimum necessary privileges.
    *   Code reviews: Conduct thorough code reviews of all job code, focusing on security vulnerabilities.
