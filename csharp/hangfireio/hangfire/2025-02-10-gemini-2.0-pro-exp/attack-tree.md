## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Hangfire Dashboard Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_hangfire_dashboard_vulnerabilities__high-risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This path focuses on gaining unauthorized access to the Hangfire dashboard and then using that access to manipulate jobs, leading to RCE or DoS. The dashboard is a high-value target because it provides a user interface for managing Hangfire, making it easier for an attacker to interact with the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Unauthorized Dashboard Access [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__unauthorized_dashboard_access__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  Gaining access to the dashboard without proper credentials.
