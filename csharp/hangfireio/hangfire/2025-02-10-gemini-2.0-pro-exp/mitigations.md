# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for hangfireio/hangfire

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Hangfire Dashboard Access (Direct Hangfire Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_hangfire_dashboard_access__direct_hangfire_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create Custom Authorization Filter:** Implement a class that inherits from `Hangfire.Dashboard.IAuthorizationFilter`.
    2.  **Implement `Authorize` Method:** Within the `Authorize` method:
        *   Access the current `HttpContext`.
        *   Retrieve the user's identity and roles/claims.
        *   Check for authentication and required roles/claims (e.g., "HangfireAdmin"). Return `true` if authorized, `false` otherwise.
    3.  **Register the Filter:** In your Hangfire configuration (e.g., `Startup.cs`):
        ```csharp
        app.UseHangfireDashboard("/hangfire", new DashboardOptions
        {
            Authorization = new[] { new MyCustomHangfireAuthorizationFilter() }
        });
        ```
    4. **Disable Dashboard (If Possible):** If the dashboard is not strictly required in production, disable it entirely for maximum security. This is done by *not* calling `app.UseHangfireDashboard()`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Dashboard:** (Severity: **Critical**) - Prevents unauthorized users from interacting with the Hangfire dashboard.
    *   **Malicious Job Execution (Indirectly):** (Severity: **Critical**) - Reduces the attack surface for enqueuing malicious jobs via the dashboard.
    *   **Data Exfiltration (Indirectly):** (Severity: **High**) - Reduces the risk of viewing sensitive job data through the dashboard.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Dashboard:** Risk reduced from **Critical** to **Low** (with a strong authorization filter).
    *   **Malicious Job Execution:** Risk reduced from **Critical** to **Medium**.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Medium**.

*   **Currently Implemented:** *(Fill this in - Examples:)*
    *   "Implemented with a custom `IAuthorizationFilter` and ASP.NET Core Identity."
    *   "Dashboard is disabled in production."
    *   "Not implemented."

*   **Missing Implementation:** *(Fill this in - Examples:)*
    *   "Need to implement role-based access control within the authorization filter."
    *   "Need to disable the dashboard in the production environment."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Job Serialization (Direct Hangfire Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_job_serialization__direct_hangfire_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure the Serializer:**  In your Hangfire configuration, explicitly configure the serializer settings.  If using JSON.NET (the default):
        ```csharp
        GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.UseSerializerSettings(new JsonSerializerSettings
        {
            TypeNameHandling = TypeNameHandling.Auto // Or a custom SerializationBinder
        });
        ```
    2.  **Avoid `TypeNameHandling.All`:**  *Never* use `TypeNameHandling.All` in a production environment, as it's highly vulnerable to deserialization attacks.
    3.  **Custom `SerializationBinder` (Recommended):** For the highest level of security, implement a custom `SerializationBinder` to explicitly whitelist the types that are allowed to be deserialized:
        ```csharp
        public class MyCustomSerializationBinder : ISerializationBinder
        {
            private readonly List<Type> _allowedTypes = new List<Type>
            {
                typeof(MyJobArgumentType1),
                typeof(MyJobArgumentType2),
                // ... add all allowed types here ...
            };

            public Type BindToType(string assemblyName, string typeName)
            {
                var type = Type.GetType($"{typeName}, {assemblyName}");
                if (type != null && _allowedTypes.Contains(type))
                {
                    return type;
                }
                return null; // Or throw an exception
            }

            public void BindToName(Type serializedType, out string assemblyName, out string typeName)
            {
                assemblyName = serializedType.Assembly.FullName;
                typeName = serializedType.FullName;
            }
        }

        // In your Hangfire configuration:
        GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.UseSerializerSettings(new JsonSerializerSettings
        {
            TypeNameHandling = TypeNameHandling.Objects, // Use Objects with a custom binder
            SerializationBinder = new MyCustomSerializationBinder()
        });
        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities:** (Severity: **Critical**) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious payloads through the deserialization process.
    *   **Malicious Job Execution:** (Severity: **Critical**) - Prevents the execution of arbitrary code injected via deserialization.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced from **Critical** to **Low** (with a securely configured serializer and a custom `SerializationBinder`).
    *   **Malicious Job Execution:** Risk reduced from **Critical** to **Low** (as a direct consequence of preventing deserialization attacks).

*   **Currently Implemented:** *(Fill this in - Examples:)*
    *   "Using `TypeNameHandling.Auto`."
    *   "Using a custom `SerializationBinder`."
    *   "Not explicitly configured; using the default settings."

*   **Missing Implementation:** *(Fill this in - Examples:)*
    *   "Need to implement a custom `SerializationBinder`."
    *   "Need to switch from `TypeNameHandling.All` to `TypeNameHandling.Auto`."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Job Concurrency and Queue Limits (Direct Hangfire Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/configure_job_concurrency_and_queue_limits__direct_hangfire_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Worker Count:**  Configure the number of worker threads that Hangfire uses to process jobs.  This is typically done when configuring the Hangfire server:
        ```csharp
         //Example for SQL Server
        GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.UseSqlServerStorage("connection_string", new SqlServerStorageOptions
        {
            //Example
            CommandBatchMaxTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5),
            SlidingInvisibilityTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5),
            QueuePollInterval = TimeSpan.Zero,
            UseRecommendedIsolationLevel = true,
            DisableGlobalLocks = true,
            MaxDegreeOfParallelism = 4 // Example concurrency limit - adjust as needed!
        });

        // Or, for a BackgroundJobServer:
        app.UseHangfireServer(new BackgroundJobServerOptions
        {
            WorkerCount = Environment.ProcessorCount * 5 // Example - adjust as needed!
        });
        ```
    2.  **Queue Limits:**  If using a storage provider that supports queue limits (e.g., Redis), configure limits on the number of jobs that can be enqueued in each queue. This prevents a single queue from being overwhelmed. This is storage-provider specific.
    3. **Queue Prioritization:** Use different queues for different job types and assign priorities. This is done when enqueuing jobs:
        ```csharp
        BackgroundJob.Enqueue<IMyService>(x => x.MyMethod(), "high-priority"); // Enqueue to "high-priority" queue
        BackgroundJob.Enqueue<IMyService>(x => x.MyOtherMethod(), "default"); // Enqueue to "default" queue
        ```
        Then, configure your workers to process queues in priority order.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** (Severity: **High**) - Prevents an attacker from overwhelming the system by enqueuing a massive number of jobs.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Prevents Hangfire from consuming excessive resources (CPU, memory, threads).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduced from **High** to **Medium** (with appropriate concurrency and queue limits).
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced from **Medium** to **Low**.

*   **Currently Implemented:** *(Fill this in - Examples:)*
    *   "Worker count is set to the default."
    *   "Worker count is configured based on the number of processor cores."
    *   "Queue limits are not configured."
    * "Queue prioritization is used."

*   **Missing Implementation:** *(Fill this in - Examples:)*
    *   "Need to determine appropriate worker count based on load testing."
    *   "Need to configure queue limits (if using Redis)."
    * "Need to implement queue prioritization."
