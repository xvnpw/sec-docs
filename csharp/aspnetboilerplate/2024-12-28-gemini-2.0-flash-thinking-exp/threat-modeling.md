### High and Critical ASP.NET Boilerplate Specific Threats

This list contains high and critical severity threats that directly involve the ASP.NET Boilerplate framework.

* **Threat:** Malicious Actor Injects a Malicious Module
    * **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the **ASP.NET Boilerplate's module loading mechanism** to inject a custom, malicious module into the application. This could involve manipulating configuration files that the framework uses to discover and load modules, or exploiting weaknesses in how the framework handles module dependencies. Once injected, the malicious module could execute arbitrary code within the application's context.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application, including data breaches, denial of service, and the ability to perform actions with the application's privileges.
    * **Affected Component:** Module Loading Mechanism
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong validation and integrity checks for module files and their sources.
        * Restrict access to module directories and configuration files using operating system-level permissions.
        * Utilize signed assemblies for modules to ensure authenticity and prevent tampering.
        * Regularly audit the list of loaded modules and their origins.
        * If dynamic module loading is necessary, implement robust authorization and authentication for module management functionalities.

* **Threat:** Attacker Exploits Misconfigured Permissions to Access Restricted Functionality
    * **Description:** An attacker could leverage misconfigurations in **ASP.NET Boilerplate's permission system** to gain unauthorized access to features or data they should not have. This might involve exploiting overly permissive role assignments defined within the framework's permission management, vulnerabilities in custom permission checks interacting with the framework's system, or bypassing default permission checks due to incorrect implementation of authorization attributes provided by the framework. The attacker could then perform actions intended only for authorized users.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, unauthorized modification or deletion of data, privilege escalation within the application.
    * **Affected Component:** Permission Definition System, Authorization Attributes, User/Role Management
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Adhere to the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions to roles and users.
        * Thoroughly test all permission configurations for different roles and user scenarios.
        * Regularly review and audit permission settings and role assignments.
        * Utilize the built-in permission management features of ASP.NET Boilerplate effectively and avoid custom, potentially flawed implementations where possible.

* **Threat:** Attacker Exploits Localization Resource Vulnerabilities for XSS
    * **Description:** If the application allows for dynamic loading or modification of localization resources managed by **ASP.NET Boilerplate's localization system**, and these resources are not properly sanitized when displayed, an attacker could inject malicious scripts into localization files. When the application renders content using these poisoned localization strings, it could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
    * **Impact:** Execution of malicious scripts in users' browsers, leading to session hijacking, information theft, or defacement.
    * **Affected Component:** Localization System, Resource Management
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Sanitize and encode localized strings before displaying them in the UI.
        * Restrict access to localization resource files and management interfaces.
        * Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks.
        * Regularly review and validate localization resources for malicious content.

* **Threat:** Attacker Bypasses Data Filters to Access Restricted Data
    * **Description:** If data filters provided by **ASP.NET Boilerplate** (e.g., soft delete filters, multi-tenancy filters) are not implemented correctly or have vulnerabilities, an attacker might be able to bypass these filters and access data they should not have access to. This could involve manipulating query parameters that interact with the framework's filtering mechanisms, exploiting flaws in filter logic provided by the framework, or directly accessing the underlying data store while circumventing the framework's intended data access patterns.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, potential for data breaches, cross-tenant data access in multi-tenant applications.
    * **Affected Component:** Data Filtering Infrastructure, Entity Framework Integration
    * **Risk Severity:** High (especially in multi-tenant scenarios)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly test data filter implementations to ensure they cannot be bypassed.
        * Ensure filters are applied consistently across all data access points.
        * Avoid relying solely on client-side filtering for security.
        * Regularly review and update filter logic to address potential vulnerabilities.

* **Threat (Multi-Tenancy Specific):** Cross-Tenant Data Access Due to Isolation Failures
    * **Description:** In multi-tenant applications built with **ASP.NET Boilerplate**, vulnerabilities in the tenant isolation mechanisms provided by the framework could allow an attacker belonging to one tenant to access data or resources belonging to another tenant. This could be due to flaws in the framework's tenant identification, data filtering implementations, or shared resource management within the multi-tenancy features.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to other tenants' information, potential for data manipulation across tenants.
    * **Affected Component:** Multi-Tenancy Infrastructure, Tenant Resolution, Data Filtering
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust tenant identification and data segregation mechanisms.
        * Thoroughly test tenant isolation boundaries to ensure data cannot leak between tenants.
        * Regularly audit multi-tenant configurations and code related to tenant isolation.
        * Utilize ASP.NET Boilerplate's built-in multi-tenancy features correctly and avoid custom implementations that might introduce vulnerabilities.
