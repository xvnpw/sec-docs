## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit ABP Module Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_abp_module_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* **Exploit ABP Module Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This is a critical entry point as modules often handle sensitive data and core functionalities. Vulnerabilities here can have a significant impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Unsecured Module Endpoints (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_unsecured_module_endpoints__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Unsecured Module Endpoints (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * **Bypass Authorization Checks in Module APIs (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * Attackers exploit missing or improperly implemented authorization checks in module API endpoints to access restricted functionalities or data. This often involves manipulating requests or exploiting logical flaws in the authorization logic.
    * **Access Sensitive Data Without Authentication (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * Attackers directly access module endpoints that, due to misconfiguration or oversight, do not require authentication, leading to the exposure of sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Disable Security Features via Configuration (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/disable_security_features_via_configuration__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Module Configuration Issues:**
    * **Disable Security Features via Configuration (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        * Attackers gain access to configuration settings (through vulnerabilities or insecure access controls) and disable crucial security features like authorization, authentication, or auditing, making the application significantly more vulnerable to subsequent attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit ABP Authorization & Authentication Mechanisms (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_abp_authorization_&_authentication_mechanisms__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit ABP Authorization & Authentication Mechanisms (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This path directly targets the core security mechanisms of the application.
    * **Bypass ABP Authorization (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        * **Exploit Permission Definition Flaws (CRITICAL NODE):**
            * Attackers exploit incorrectly defined or overly permissive permissions, granting them access to functionalities they shouldn't have. This often involves understanding the permission structure and identifying logical errors.
        * **Manipulate User Roles/Claims (CRITICAL NODE):**
            * Attackers find ways to modify user roles or claims (through vulnerabilities in user management or direct data manipulation), leading to privilege escalation and unauthorized access.
    * **Exploit ABP Authentication (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        * **Weaknesses in Default Authentication Providers (CRITICAL NODE):**
            * Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the authentication providers used by ABP (e.g., default credentials, known library flaws) to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
        * **Bypass Two-Factor Authentication (if implemented via ABP) (CRITICAL NODE):**
            * Attackers find flaws in the implementation of two-factor authentication, allowing them to bypass this security measure and gain access to accounts that should be protected by 2FA.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Application Settings to Gain Control (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/modify_application_settings_to_gain_control__critical_node_.md)

* **Exploit ABP Setting Management (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * **Modify Application Settings to Gain Control (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the setting management system to modify application settings, potentially disabling security features, enabling debug modes to leak information, or granting themselves administrative privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit ABP Tenant Management (Multi-Tenancy) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_abp_tenant_management__multi-tenancy___critical_node_.md)

* **Exploit ABP Tenant Management (Multi-Tenancy) (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This path is critical for multi-tenant applications as it can lead to breaches affecting multiple tenants.
    * **Cross-Tenant Data Access (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * Attackers exploit flaws in the tenant isolation mechanisms to access data belonging to other tenants, violating data privacy and security boundaries.
    * **Elevate Privileges Within a Tenant (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in tenant-specific authorization to gain higher privileges within a particular tenant, allowing them to access more sensitive data or functionalities within that tenant's scope.
