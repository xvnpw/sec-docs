# Threat Model Analysis for abpframework/abp

## Threat: [Malicious Module Injection](./threats/malicious_module_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could potentially install a crafted or compromised ABP module into the application. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in ABP's module management functionalities or by gaining unauthorized access to the deployment environment. The malicious module could then execute arbitrary code, access sensitive data, or disrupt application functionality.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the application, including data breaches, denial of service, and potential server takeover.
    *   **ABP Component Affected:** Dynamic Module Loading System, Module Management APIs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict module validation and signing mechanisms within ABP's module management.
        *   Enforce strong access controls for ABP's module installation and management features.
        *   Regularly audit installed modules through ABP's module listing capabilities and verify their sources.
        *   Utilize ABP's module isolation features where available to limit the impact of a compromised module.
        *   Implement security scanning of modules before deployment, potentially integrating with ABP's module loading process.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion in Modules](./threats/dependency_confusion_in_modules.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could introduce a malicious package with the same name as an internal or private dependency used by an ABP module. If ABP's module dependency resolution is not strictly configured, the attacker's package could be fetched and executed instead of the legitimate one.
    *   **Impact:**  Code execution within the application context, potentially leading to data theft, privilege escalation, or denial of service.
    *   **ABP Component Affected:** Module Dependency Management within the ABP framework, Package Resolution mechanisms used by ABP.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize private package registries for internal dependencies, configuring ABP to prioritize these registries.
        *   Implement dependency pinning and integrity checks (e.g., using lock files) within the ABP module's build process.
        *   Regularly audit module dependencies and their sources as reported by ABP's dependency management tools.
        *   Enforce strict dependency versioning within the ABP module's configuration.

## Threat: [Abusing Dynamic Abstraction Layers](./threats/abusing_dynamic_abstraction_layers.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers might attempt to bypass intended security checks by directly interacting with underlying services or data access logic if the ABP abstraction layers (e.g., repositories, application services) are not properly secured. This could involve crafting requests that exploit vulnerabilities in custom implementations or missing validation within these layers, potentially bypassing ABP's intended authorization flow.
    *   **Impact:**  Circumvention of security controls enforced by ABP, unauthorized data access or modification, potential for business logic manipulation.
    *   **ABP Component Affected:** Application Services provided by ABP, Domain Services, Repositories defined and managed within the ABP framework.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within ABP application services and domain services.
        *   Enforce ABP's authorization checks at each layer, including within custom repository methods accessed through ABP's infrastructure.
        *   Avoid exposing internal implementation details through ABP's abstraction layers, ensuring that security is enforced at the abstraction level.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in ABP Infrastructure Implementations](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_abp_infrastructure_implementations.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws might exist within ABP's default implementations for infrastructure concerns like caching, distributed locking, or the event bus. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause denial of service, data corruption, or gain unauthorized access to internal application state managed by ABP.
    *   **Impact:**  Service disruption within the ABP application, data integrity issues affecting ABP managed data, potential for information leakage from ABP's internal state.
    *   **ABP Component Affected:** Caching Abstraction provided by ABP, Distributed Lock Abstraction, Event Bus implementation within ABP.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with ABP framework releases and patch notes to address known vulnerabilities in ABP's infrastructure implementations.
        *   Consider using alternative, well-vetted implementations for critical infrastructure components if concerns arise with ABP's defaults, leveraging ABP's extensibility.
        *   Monitor ABP security advisories for known vulnerabilities in its core infrastructure components.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) through ABP Features](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__through_abp_features.md)

*   **Description:** Certain ABP features that make outbound requests (e.g., integrations with external services configured through ABP, potentially some module functionalities leveraging ABP's HTTP client abstractions) could be vulnerable to SSRF if input validation is insufficient. An attacker could manipulate these ABP features to make requests to internal resources or arbitrary external endpoints.
    *   **Impact:**  Access to internal resources from the ABP application server, potential for further attacks on internal infrastructure, information disclosure, denial of service against other systems.
    *   **ABP Component Affected:** Potentially various components within ABP that interact with external systems (e.g., specific modules utilizing ABP's features, integration services built using ABP's abstractions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation for URLs and hostnames used in outbound requests initiated through ABP features.
        *   Utilize allow-lists for allowed destination hosts when configuring ABP integrations or module functionalities.
        *   Disable or restrict unnecessary network access from the ABP application server.
        *   Consider using a proxy server for outbound requests initiated by ABP components.
