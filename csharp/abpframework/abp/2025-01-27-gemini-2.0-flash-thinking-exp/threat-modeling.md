# Threat Model Analysis for abpframework/abp

## Threat: [Insecure Default Configuration of ABP Identity Module](./threats/insecure_default_configuration_of_abp_identity_module.md)

Description: An attacker could exploit weak default settings in the ABP Identity module, such as easily guessable default passwords, permissive user registration, or overly broad default roles. They might attempt to brute-force default accounts, register unauthorized users, or leverage default admin roles to gain unauthorized access and control over the application.
Impact: Unauthorized access, account compromise, privilege escalation, data breaches, system takeover.
Affected ABP Component: ABP Identity Module (Configuration, Default Users/Roles)
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Change default administrator passwords immediately upon deployment.
    * Review and customize ABP Identity module configuration to enforce strong password policies.
    * Disable or secure default user registration if not required.
    * Implement least privilege principle and customize default roles and permissions.
    * Regularly audit user accounts and roles.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of External Authentication Providers](./threats/misconfiguration_of_external_authentication_providers.md)

Description: An attacker could exploit misconfigurations in the integration with external authentication providers (e.g., OAuth, OpenID Connect). This could involve manipulating redirect URIs, exploiting insecure client secrets, or bypassing authentication flows due to incorrect setup. This could lead to account takeover or unauthorized access by impersonating legitimate users.
Impact: Unauthorized access, account compromise, data breaches, reputation damage.
Affected ABP Component: ABP Identity Module (External Authentication Integration)
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Thoroughly validate and test external authentication provider configurations.
    * Securely store and manage client IDs and secrets (using environment variables or secure vaults).
    * Enforce HTTPS for all authentication redirects.
    * Regularly review and update external authentication configurations and libraries.
    * Implement proper redirect URI validation to prevent manipulation.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in ABP's Permission Management System](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_abp's_permission_management_system.md)

Description: An attacker could discover and exploit vulnerabilities in the ABP permission checking logic or permission definition system. This could allow them to bypass permission checks, escalate privileges, and perform actions they are not authorized to perform, such as accessing sensitive data or modifying critical configurations.
Impact: Privilege escalation, unauthorized data access, data manipulation, system compromise.
Affected ABP Component: ABP Authorization System (Permission Definition, Permission Checking)
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Regularly review and audit permission definitions for accuracy and completeness.
    * Ensure robust and consistent permission checking logic throughout the application code.
    * Keep ABP framework and related packages updated to patch known vulnerabilities in the authorization system.
    * Implement unit and integration tests to verify permission enforcement.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Community Modules or Custom Modules](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_community_modules_or_custom_modules.md)

Description: An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities present in community modules or custom modules integrated into the ABP application. These modules might contain insecure code, outdated dependencies, or known vulnerabilities that could be leveraged to compromise the application, potentially leading to code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
Impact: Code execution, data breaches, denial of service, various impacts depending on the module vulnerability.
Affected ABP Component: ABP Module System (Community Modules, Custom Modules)
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Carefully vet community modules before use, assessing their security posture and reputation.
    * Perform security audits and code reviews of custom modules.
    * Keep modules and their dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
    * Use dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerable dependencies in modules.
    * Implement input validation and sanitization within modules.

## Threat: [Insecure Module Loading or Initialization](./threats/insecure_module_loading_or_initialization.md)

Description: An attacker could attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the ABP module loading or initialization process. If there are flaws in how modules are loaded or initialized, an attacker might be able to inject malicious code or bypass security checks during application startup, potentially gaining control early in the application lifecycle.
Impact: Code execution, application compromise, denial of service, system takeover.
Affected ABP Component: ABP Module System (Module Loading, Module Initialization)
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Keep ABP framework updated to benefit from security patches in module loading mechanisms.
    * Follow secure coding practices when developing custom modules, especially during module initialization.
    * Ensure proper input validation and sanitization if custom logic is involved in module loading.
    * Restrict access to module configuration files and directories.
