## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise ABP Application (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_abp_application__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved unauthorized access and control over the application, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or other malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit ABP Framework Features Directly (HIGH RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_abp_framework_features_directly__high_risk_path_start_.md)

*   This represents a category of attacks that directly target the functionalities and mechanisms provided by the ABP Framework.

    *   **Bypass Permission Checks (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH):**
        *   Attack Vectors:
            *   **Exploit Insecure Permission Definition (HIGH RISK PATH):**
                *   Leveraging overly broad or poorly defined permissions that grant unintended access to resources or functionalities. For example, a permission intended for administrators might be inadvertently granted to a wider group of users.
            *   **Exploit Permission Check Logic Flaws:**
                *   Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in the code responsible for evaluating user permissions. This could involve logic errors, race conditions, or incorrect handling of complex permission scenarios.
            *   **Exploit Permission Cache Issues:**
                *   Manipulating or bypassing the permission caching mechanism to gain unauthorized access. This could involve techniques like cache poisoning or exploiting inconsistencies in cache invalidation.

    *   **Exploit Dynamic Module Loading (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        *   Attack Vectors:
            *   **Inject Malicious Module (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH):**
                *   Finding a way to upload or introduce a malicious module into the application's module loading path. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in module management interfaces, insecure file upload mechanisms, or gaining unauthorized access to the server's file system. Once loaded, the malicious module can execute arbitrary code within the application's context.
            *   **Exploit Module Dependency Issues:**
                *   Leveraging known vulnerabilities in the dependencies of dynamically loaded modules. If a module relies on a vulnerable library, an attacker could exploit that vulnerability through the loaded module.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities Introduced by ABP (HIGH RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities_introduced_by_abp__high_risk_path_start_.md)

*   This category focuses on vulnerabilities arising from the configuration of the ABP Framework itself.

    *   **Exploit Insecure Default Configurations (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH):**
        *   Attack Vectors:
            *   Leveraging default settings within ABP that are insecure or overly permissive. This could include default administrative credentials, exposed debugging endpoints, or overly permissive security settings that are not changed after installation.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit ABP's Dependency Injection Mechanism](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_abp's_dependency_injection_mechanism.md)

*   This category targets the way ABP manages and injects dependencies.

    *   **Inject Malicious Dependencies (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   Attack Vectors:
            *   Finding a way to register malicious services or components within the dependency injection container. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in custom dependency registration logic or gaining unauthorized access to configuration files used for dependency registration. Once injected, these malicious dependencies can be used to intercept or manipulate application logic.
    *   **Override Existing Dependencies (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   Attack Vectors:
            *   Replacing legitimate services or components with malicious ones within the dependency injection container. This could be achieved through similar methods as injecting malicious dependencies, allowing the attacker to subtly alter the application's behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit ABP's Startup and Initialization Processes](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_abp's_startup_and_initialization_processes.md)

*   This category focuses on vulnerabilities during the application's startup phase.

    *   **Code Injection During Startup (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   Attack Vectors:
            *   Injecting malicious code that is executed during the application's startup sequence. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in configuration file parsing, environment variable handling, or other mechanisms used during startup. Successful code injection during startup can grant the attacker early and potentially complete control over the application.
