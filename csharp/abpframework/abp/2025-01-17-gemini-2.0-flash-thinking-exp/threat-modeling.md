# Threat Model Analysis for abpframework/abp

## Threat: [Malicious Module Injection](./threats/malicious_module_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could attempt to upload or inject a crafted, malicious module into the application's module directory or through a vulnerable module management interface provided by ABP. This module could contain code designed to execute arbitrary commands on the server, steal sensitive data, or disrupt application functionality by leveraging ABP's module loading mechanisms.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server. Data breaches, service disruption, and reputational damage.

**Affected ABP Component:** Module system, specifically `AbpModuleManager`, `IModuleLoader`, and related infrastructure for discovering and loading modules.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict validation and signing mechanisms for modules before loading, leveraging ABP's extensibility points if available.
*   Ensure modules are loaded from trusted and verified sources only, potentially using ABP's configuration to restrict module sources.
*   Restrict write access to the module directory on the server.
*   Regularly audit installed modules and their sources, potentially using ABP's module listing features.
*   Implement a secure module management interface with proper authentication and authorization, utilizing ABP's authorization framework.

## Threat: [Exploiting Default Authentication/Authorization Configuration](./threats/exploiting_default_authenticationauthorization_configuration.md)

**Description:** Attackers might try to exploit default or insecurely configured authentication and authorization settings provided directly by ABP. This could involve attempting to use default credentials (if not changed in ABP's configuration), bypassing weak authorization checks implemented using ABP's authorization attributes or services, or exploiting misconfigurations in permission definitions managed through ABP's permission system.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, functionalities, or administrative areas managed by ABP's authorization. Privilege escalation, allowing attackers to perform actions they are not authorized for within the ABP framework.

**Affected ABP Component:** `Abp.Authorization`, `Abp.Authentication`, potentially specific authentication providers integrated with ABP (e.g., `Abp.Zero.Ldap`), and the permission definition system within ABP.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Force the change of default credentials during initial setup, as recommended by ABP best practices.
*   Implement strong password policies and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) using ABP's authentication extension points or integrated providers.
*   Thoroughly review and customize default authentication and authorization settings within ABP's configuration.
*   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when defining permissions using ABP's permission management features.
*   Regularly audit permission configurations and user roles within the ABP framework.

## Threat: [Tenant Isolation Breach in Multi-Tenant Applications](./threats/tenant_isolation_breach_in_multi-tenant_applications.md)

**Description:** In multi-tenant applications built with ABP, an attacker within one tenant could attempt to bypass ABP's tenant isolation mechanisms to access data or resources belonging to other tenants. This could involve manipulating tenant identifiers handled by ABP, exploiting vulnerabilities in data filtering logic implemented using ABP's multi-tenancy features, or leveraging shared services or resources not properly isolated by ABP.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data belonging to other tenants, potentially leading to data breaches and privacy violations. Disruption of service for other tenants within the ABP application.

**Affected ABP Component:** `Abp.MultiTenancy`, tenant resolution mechanisms (`ITenantResolver`) provided by ABP, data filters (`IMayHaveTenant`, `IMustHaveTenant`) used within ABP entities, and potentially custom multi-tenancy implementations built on top of ABP's features.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly understand and implement ABP's multi-tenancy features correctly, following ABP's documentation and best practices.
*   Ensure all data access and operations are properly filtered by tenant using ABP's data filtering capabilities.
*   Avoid sharing resources between tenants without strict security controls enforced by ABP's multi-tenancy framework.
*   Regularly audit tenant isolation configurations and test for potential breaches, specifically focusing on ABP's multi-tenancy implementation.
*   Implement robust tenant identification and validation throughout the application, relying on ABP's tenant resolution mechanisms.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Dynamic UI Customization](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_dynamic_ui_customization.md)

**Description:** If the application utilizes ABP's features or integrations for dynamic UI customization or form rendering without proper input sanitization and output encoding, attackers could inject malicious scripts that are executed in the context of other users' browsers. This is particularly relevant if ABP provides components or helpers for dynamic UI generation that are not used securely.

**Impact:** Stealing user credentials, session hijacking, defacement of the application, or redirecting users to malicious websites.

**Affected ABP Component:** Potentially UI framework integrations provided by ABP (e.g., helpers for ASP.NET Core Razor Pages/Blazor), dynamic form rendering components within ABP modules, and any custom UI customization features built using ABP's extensibility.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data used in dynamic UI elements, ensuring adherence to secure coding practices within the ABP context.
*   Use proper output encoding techniques provided by the UI framework to prevent the execution of malicious scripts, especially when rendering data within ABP components.
*   Follow secure coding practices for UI development, being mindful of how ABP's features interact with UI rendering.
*   Consider using Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks, configuring it appropriately for the ABP application's UI structure.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities within ABP Modules](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_within_abp_modules.md)

**Description:** Modules used within the ABP application might introduce vulnerable dependencies (NuGet packages, JavaScript libraries, etc.) that are not centrally managed or updated by the main application. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application, leveraging the fact that ABP allows modules to bring in their own dependencies.

**Impact:**  Depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency. Could range from information disclosure to remote code execution within the context of the ABP application.

**Affected ABP Component:** The module system in general, as individual modules can bring in their own dependencies, potentially bypassing central dependency management.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement dependency scanning and vulnerability management for all modules used in the ABP application.
*   Encourage module developers to keep their dependencies up-to-date and follow secure development practices within the ABP ecosystem.
*   Consider using tools to manage and update dependencies across all modules, potentially integrating with ABP's module management system.
*   Regularly review the dependencies of all used modules, paying attention to security advisories related to those dependencies.
*   Consider establishing guidelines for module developers regarding dependency management within the ABP framework.
