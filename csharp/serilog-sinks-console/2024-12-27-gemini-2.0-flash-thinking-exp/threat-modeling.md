## High and Critical Threats Directly Involving serilog-sinks-console

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Accidental Logging of Sensitive Data** | An attacker with access to the console output (e.g., through compromised server access, container logs, or developer's machine) can read sensitive information like API keys, passwords, PII, or internal system details that were inadvertently logged by the application. The `serilog-sinks-console` sink directly writes this sensitive data to the console output stream. | **High:**  Exposure of sensitive data can lead to identity theft, financial loss, unauthorized access to systems, and reputational damage. | The `Write` method of the sink, resulting in sensitive data in the console output stream. | **High** | - **Strictly control what data is logged:** Implement robust filtering and sanitization of log messages *before* they reach the Serilog pipeline and the console sink. Use Serilog's destructuring capabilities to avoid logging entire objects containing sensitive data. - **Review logging configurations regularly:** Ensure that logging levels and formats are appropriate and don't expose unnecessary information. - **Consider alternative sinks for sensitive data:** If certain data *must* be logged for debugging, use sinks that offer more secure storage and access control (e.g., file sinks with restricted permissions, dedicated logging services) and avoid using the console sink for such data. - **Educate developers on secure logging practices:** Emphasize the importance of avoiding logging sensitive information and using appropriate logging levels. |
