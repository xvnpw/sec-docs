# Threat Model Analysis for questpdf/questpdf

## Threat: [PDF Injection Attacks](./threats/pdf_injection_attacks.md)

Description: An attacker crafts malicious input data that, when processed by QuestPDF for PDF generation, results in the embedding of harmful code (e.g., JavaScript) within the PDF document. When a user opens the generated PDF with a vulnerable PDF viewer, this malicious code can execute. This is achieved by exploiting insufficient input sanitization within QuestPDF when handling user-provided content intended for inclusion in the PDF.
Impact:
*   Cross-document scripting: Attackers can steal user credentials, session tokens, or perform actions on behalf of the user by executing malicious JavaScript within the PDF.
*   Remote code execution (in highly vulnerable PDF viewers, less common but theoretically possible): In extreme cases, vulnerabilities in PDF viewers combined with injected code could lead to remote code execution on the user's machine.
Affected QuestPDF Component: Text rendering module, potentially all modules handling user-provided data and content embedding.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
*   Developer Responsibility:
    *   Strict Input Sanitization:  Developers MUST rigorously sanitize and encode all user-provided data before using it within QuestPDF document generation. Utilize context-aware encoding methods appropriate for PDF content.
    *   Content Security Policy (CSP) for PDFs (if feasible): Explore if QuestPDF or PDF generation techniques allow for embedding CSP headers within PDFs to restrict JavaScript execution.
    *   Parameterization:  Favor parameterized approaches for content generation where user input is inserted into pre-defined, safe templates rather than directly embedding raw user input.

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow or Memory Corruption in Core Components](./threats/buffer_overflow_or_memory_corruption_in_core_components.md)

Description:  A sophisticated attacker provides exceptionally large or specifically crafted malformed input that targets vulnerabilities within QuestPDF's core PDF generation engine or critical underlying libraries it directly utilizes. This could trigger a buffer overflow or memory corruption during PDF processing.
Impact:
*   Denial of Service: Crashing the application server or the PDF generation process, preventing legitimate PDF generation.
*   Remote Code Execution: In the most severe scenario, successful exploitation of a buffer overflow could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running the QuestPDF application.
Affected QuestPDF Component: Core PDF generation engine, memory management within QuestPDF's critical modules, potentially underlying libraries directly linked to QuestPDF for core functionality.
Risk Severity: High (potentially Critical if remote code execution is achievable)
Mitigation Strategies:
*   QuestPDF Library Responsibility:
    *   Secure Coding Practices: QuestPDF developers must employ secure coding practices to prevent buffer overflows and memory corruption vulnerabilities in core components.
    *   Robust Input Validation within QuestPDF: Implement internal input validation within QuestPDF to handle and reject excessively large or malformed inputs before they reach vulnerable code paths.
    *   Memory Safety Reviews: Conduct thorough code reviews focused on memory safety and potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities in critical modules.
    *   Fuzzing and Security Testing: Utilize fuzzing techniques and security testing methodologies specifically targeting buffer overflow vulnerabilities in QuestPDF's core.
*   Developer Responsibility:
    *   Resource Limits: Implement resource limits on the server-side to prevent excessive resource consumption during PDF generation, which could exacerbate potential buffer overflow issues.
    *   Monitoring: Monitor server resources and application logs for unusual behavior during PDF generation that might indicate exploitation attempts.

## Threat: [Logic Bugs Leading to Exploitable PDFs](./threats/logic_bugs_leading_to_exploitable_pdfs.md)

Description:  Critical logic errors within QuestPDF's PDF generation engine result in the creation of PDFs with malformed or unexpected structures that can be exploited by vulnerabilities in widely used PDF viewers. These malformed PDFs, when opened by users, can trigger vulnerabilities in their PDF viewers.
Impact:
*   Denial of Service (PDF Viewer Side): Causing targeted PDF viewers to crash or become unresponsive when opening maliciously crafted PDFs generated by QuestPDF. This can be used for targeted attacks against users.
*   Information Disclosure (PDF Viewer Side): Exploiting PDF viewer vulnerabilities to potentially leak information from the user's system when they open a maliciously crafted PDF.
*   Potentially Remote Code Execution (PDF Viewer Side): In extreme cases, exploiting severe vulnerabilities in PDF viewers through malformed PDFs generated by QuestPDF could lead to remote code execution on the user's machine.
Affected QuestPDF Component: Core PDF generation engine, layout engine, rendering pipeline, all components contributing to the final PDF structure.
Risk Severity: High (potentially Critical if remote code execution in PDF viewers is achievable)
Mitigation Strategies:
*   QuestPDF Library Responsibility:
    *   Rigorous Testing of PDF Generation Logic: Implement extensive and rigorous testing of QuestPDF's PDF generation logic, including unit tests, integration tests, and system tests.
    *   PDF Fuzzing: Employ PDF fuzzing techniques to generate a wide variety of PDFs and test them against numerous PDF viewers to identify logic errors that lead to exploitable PDF structures.
    *   Adherence to PDF Standards and Best Practices: Ensure strict adherence to PDF standards and industry best practices throughout the PDF generation process within QuestPDF to minimize the risk of creating malformed PDFs.
*   Developer Responsibility:
    *   PDF Validation: Implement server-side validation of generated PDFs against PDF standards using automated validation tools to detect structural anomalies before PDFs are served to users.
    *   Compatibility Testing (Limited Developer Scope): While primarily QuestPDF's responsibility, developers can perform basic compatibility testing of generated PDFs with common PDF viewers to identify obvious rendering issues or errors that might indicate underlying problems.

## Threat: [Critical Vulnerabilities in Direct Dependencies](./threats/critical_vulnerabilities_in_direct_dependencies.md)

Description: QuestPDF relies on third-party libraries (NuGet packages) for core functionalities. If QuestPDF depends on libraries with known critical security vulnerabilities (e.g., remote code execution, significant information disclosure), applications using QuestPDF become indirectly vulnerable. Attackers can exploit these dependency vulnerabilities through the QuestPDF application.
Impact:
*   Remote Code Execution: If a dependency has a remote code execution vulnerability, attackers could potentially gain control of the server running the QuestPDF application.
*   Data Breach: Vulnerabilities in dependencies could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data processed by the QuestPDF application.
*   Full System Compromise: Successful exploitation of critical dependency vulnerabilities can lead to complete compromise of the application and the underlying server infrastructure.
Affected QuestPDF Component: Dependency management, all components that rely on vulnerable dependencies.
Risk Severity: Critical (if dependencies with critical vulnerabilities are used)
Mitigation Strategies:
*   QuestPDF Library Responsibility:
    *   Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Implement automated SCA tools in the QuestPDF development pipeline to continuously scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   Proactive Dependency Monitoring: Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for QuestPDF's direct dependencies.
    *   Rapid Patching and Updates: Establish a process for rapidly patching or updating vulnerable dependencies when security issues are identified. Prioritize using dependencies with active security maintenance.
    *   Dependency Vetting: Carefully vet and select dependencies, favoring well-maintained libraries with a strong security track record.
*   Developer Responsibility:
    *   Regular QuestPDF Updates:  Keep QuestPDF updated to the latest version to benefit from dependency updates and security patches released by the QuestPDF team.
    *   Dependency Scanning in Application Pipeline: Integrate dependency scanning tools into the application's development and deployment pipelines to detect vulnerabilities in QuestPDF's dependencies within the application context.
    *   Security Monitoring: Monitor security advisories related to QuestPDF and its dependencies and promptly apply updates or mitigations as recommended.
