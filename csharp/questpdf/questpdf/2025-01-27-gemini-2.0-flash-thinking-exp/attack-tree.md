## Attack Tree Path: [1. [CRITICAL NODE] 1. Exploit QuestPDF Input Processing Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1___critical_node__1__exploit_questpdf_input_processing_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This critical node represents attacks that target vulnerabilities arising from how the application processes user input when generating PDFs using QuestPDF.  It focuses on weaknesses in handling data that is incorporated into the PDF document.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [HIGH RISK PATH] 1.1. Data Injection into PDF Content [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2___high_risk_path__1_1__data_injection_into_pdf_content__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This high-risk path encompasses attacks where malicious data is injected into the PDF content itself, leveraging user-controlled input. This can lead to various issues depending on how the PDF is processed and viewed.

    *   **2.1. [CRITICAL NODE] 1.1.1.2. Information Disclosure via Data Injection [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Information Disclosure via Data Injection
        *   **Action:** Inject data into user-controlled input fields that are used to generate the PDF content. The goal is to leak sensitive information that the application might inadvertently include in the PDF document. Examples include server paths, internal data, configuration details, or other confidential information.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Low-Medium (Information disclosure, potential reconnaissance for further attacks)
        *   **Effort:** Low (Simple input manipulation)
        *   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic attacker)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected by monitoring PDF content for sensitive patterns, but might be missed)

    *   **2.2. [CRITICAL NODE] 1.1.2. Resource Exhaustion via Large/Complex PDF Generation [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]**
        *   **Description:** This critical node focuses on attacks that aim to exhaust server resources by requesting the generation of extremely large or complex PDFs.
            *   **2.2.1. [CRITICAL NODE] 1.1.2.1. Denial of Service (DoS) by Requesting Resource-Intensive PDFs [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Denial of Service (DoS) by Requesting Resource-Intensive PDFs
                *   **Action:** Send numerous requests to the application for PDFs that are designed to be resource-intensive to generate. This could involve manipulating parameters that control the number of pages, images, or complexity of the PDF layout. The goal is to overwhelm the server, leading to a denial of service.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium-High
                *   **Impact:** High (Application downtime, service disruption)
                *   **Effort:** Low (Simple scripting or readily available DoS tools)
                *   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic attacker)
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (DoS attacks are generally detectable through monitoring server load and network traffic)

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [CRITICAL NODE] 4.2. Improper Handling of User Input in PDF Generation Logic [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3___critical_node__4_2__improper_handling_of_user_input_in_pdf_generation_logic__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This critical node highlights vulnerabilities stemming from the application's code itself when it handles user input during the PDF generation process using QuestPDF. It emphasizes application-level flaws in input handling.

    *   **3.1. [CRITICAL NODE] 4.2.1. Lack of Input Sanitization Leading to Data Injection (Reiterated from 1.1.1 but from application's perspective) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Lack of Input Sanitization Leading to Data Injection
        *   **Action:** Exploit the application's failure to properly sanitize or validate user-provided data before using it within the QuestPDF document generation logic. This can lead to data injection vulnerabilities where malicious input is interpreted as code or data within the generated PDF, potentially causing information disclosure or client-side exploits when the PDF is viewed.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium-High
        *   **Impact:** Medium-High (Information disclosure, potential client-side exploits via PDF viewers)
        *   **Effort:** Low (Simple input manipulation)
        *   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic attacker)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Input validation checks, code review, potentially WAF rules)

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [CRITICAL NODE] 3. Exploit QuestPDF Dependency Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4___critical_node__3__exploit_questpdf_dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This critical node focuses on vulnerabilities that may exist not directly within QuestPDF itself, but in its dependencies â€“ the other NuGet packages that QuestPDF relies upon to function.

    *   **4.1. [CRITICAL NODE] 3.1. Vulnerable Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]**
        *   **Description:** This high-risk path specifically targets known vulnerabilities within QuestPDF's dependencies.
            *   **4.1.1. [CRITICAL NODE] 3.1.1. Identify and Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in QuestPDF Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Identify and Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in QuestPDF Dependencies
                *   **Action:** Analyze the list of NuGet packages that QuestPDF depends on. Use vulnerability scanners to identify known security vulnerabilities in these dependencies. If vulnerabilities are found, attempt to exploit them. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in image processing libraries, font libraries, or other components used internally by QuestPDF.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium
                *   **Impact:** High (Depends on the vulnerability, could be RCE, DoS, Information Disclosure)
                *   **Effort:** Low-Medium (Using vulnerability scanners is easy, exploit development might be harder depending on vulnerability)
                *   **Skill Level:** Medium (Understanding vulnerability reports, basic exploit knowledge)
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low-Medium (Vulnerability scanners can easily detect known vulnerabilities, runtime exploitation detection depends on the specific vulnerability)
