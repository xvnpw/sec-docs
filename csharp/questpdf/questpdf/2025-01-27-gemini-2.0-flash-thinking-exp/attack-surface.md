# Attack Surface Analysis for questpdf/questpdf

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via User-Controlled File Paths (Images, Fonts, External Resources)](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_user-controlled_file_paths__images__fonts__external_resources_.md)

Description: Application allows users to specify file paths for resources (images, fonts) included in the PDF, and these paths are not properly validated, leading to potential path traversal and unauthorized file access.

How QuestPDF contributes: QuestPDF's `Image()` and potentially font loading functionalities can be vulnerable if the paths provided to these functions are derived from unsanitized user input.

Example:

```csharp
document.Page(page =>
{
    page.Content().Image(userInputImagePath); // userInputImagePath is directly from user
});
```

A malicious user could provide `../../../../etc/shadow` as `userInputImagePath` (if server-side processing and insufficient file access restrictions), potentially leading to reading sensitive system files.

Impact: **Critical**. Unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server or local file system, potentially leading to information disclosure, privilege escalation, or further system compromise.

Risk Severity: **Critical** (when server-side file access is involved and sensitive files are at risk).

Mitigation Strategies:

*   **Strict Input Validation and Whitelisting:**  Thoroughly validate user-provided file paths. Implement a whitelist of allowed directories or file extensions. Reject any paths that do not conform to the whitelist.
*   **Path Sanitization:** Sanitize file paths to remove or escape potentially malicious path traversal sequences (e.g., `..`, `/`). However, whitelisting is a more robust approach.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the process generating PDFs operates with minimal file system permissions. Restrict file system access to only necessary directories. Ideally, use a dedicated service account with limited privileges.
*   **Use Safe File Handling APIs:** Utilize secure file handling APIs provided by the operating system or framework that are designed to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities. Avoid direct string manipulation for path construction.

## Attack Surface: [Excessive Resource Consumption during PDF Generation (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/excessive_resource_consumption_during_pdf_generation__dos_.md)

Description: Malicious users can craft requests that trigger the generation of extremely complex or large PDFs, consuming excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk space) and leading to denial of service.

How QuestPDF contributes: QuestPDF's flexible layout and content generation capabilities can be exploited to create computationally expensive PDF documents if input parameters are not controlled.

Example: An application allows users to generate reports with customizable charts and large datasets. A malicious user could request a report with an extremely large dataset or highly complex chart configurations, causing the server to become unresponsive due to resource exhaustion during PDF generation.

Impact: **High**. Denial of service, application unavailability, performance degradation for legitimate users, potential infrastructure costs due to resource over-utilization.

Risk Severity: **High** (if easily exploitable and significantly impacts application availability).

Mitigation Strategies:

*   **Input Validation and Limits:** Validate user inputs that directly influence PDF complexity (e.g., dataset size, number of chart elements, page count). Impose strict limits on these inputs to prevent the generation of overly complex PDFs.
*   **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for PDF generation processes. If PDF generation takes longer than a defined threshold, terminate the process to prevent resource exhaustion.
*   **Resource Limits (Containerization/Process Limits):**  If possible, run PDF generation in a containerized environment or with process-level resource limits (CPU, memory quotas) to contain resource consumption.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting for PDF generation requests to prevent a flood of malicious requests from overwhelming the server.
*   **Asynchronous Processing and Queues:** Offload PDF generation to background queues or asynchronous tasks. This prevents blocking the main application thread and allows for better resource management and handling of spikes in PDF generation requests.
*   **Cost Analysis of PDF Generation:**  If PDF generation is a paid service or has significant infrastructure costs, monitor resource usage and implement cost controls to prevent excessive spending due to malicious PDF generation requests.
