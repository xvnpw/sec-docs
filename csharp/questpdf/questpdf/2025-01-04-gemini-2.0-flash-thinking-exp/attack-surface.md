# Attack Surface Analysis for questpdf/questpdf

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Input Injection via Dynamic Content](./attack_surfaces/malicious_input_injection_via_dynamic_content.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious code or specially crafted strings into data that is used to dynamically generate PDF content.

**How QuestPDF Contributes to the Attack Surface:** QuestPDF's rendering engine processes this dynamic content and could be vulnerable to exploits if it doesn't properly sanitize or handle certain input patterns.

**Example:** An application takes user input for a "title" field in a PDF. An attacker enters `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` as the title. If QuestPDF doesn't sanitize this input, the generated PDF might contain active content that could be executed when opened in a vulnerable PDF viewer.

**Impact:** Potential for client-side exploits when the PDF is opened, information disclosure, or even remote code execution if vulnerabilities exist in the PDF viewer.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Image Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_image_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a malicious image file that exploits vulnerabilities in QuestPDF's image decoding or processing logic.

**How QuestPDF Contributes to the Attack Surface:** QuestPDF needs to decode and render images embedded in the PDF. Vulnerabilities in its image processing libraries or its own implementation can be exploited by crafted image files.

**Example:** An application allows users to upload images to be included in generated PDFs. An attacker uploads a specially crafted PNG file that triggers a buffer overflow in QuestPDF's image decoding routine, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Impact:** Denial of service (crashing the PDF generation process), potential for remote code execution on the server.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Malformed PDF Generation Leading to Client-Side Exploits](./attack_surfaces/malformed_pdf_generation_leading_to_client-side_exploits.md)

**Description:** Bugs or vulnerabilities within QuestPDF's PDF generation logic could lead to the creation of malformed PDF files that trigger vulnerabilities in PDF viewers.

**How QuestPDF Contributes to the Attack Surface:** QuestPDF is responsible for the structure and content of the generated PDF file. Errors in its generation process can create malformed PDFs.

**Example:** A bug in QuestPDF's handling of specific PDF object types leads to the creation of a PDF with a malformed cross-reference table. When opened in a vulnerable PDF viewer, this triggers a buffer overflow, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.

**Impact:** Client-side denial of service, potential for arbitrary code execution on the client machine.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in QuestPDF's Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_questpdf's_dependencies.md)

**Description:** QuestPDF relies on other libraries for various functionalities. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly introduce attack vectors.

**How QuestPDF Contributes to the Attack Surface:** By including and using these dependencies, QuestPDF inherits any vulnerabilities present in them.

**Example:** QuestPDF might use a third-party library for image processing. If this library has a known buffer overflow vulnerability, an attacker could exploit it by providing a malicious image that is processed by QuestPDF through this vulnerable dependency.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability in the dependency, potentially ranging from denial of service to remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High
