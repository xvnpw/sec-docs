# Threat Model Analysis for questpdf/questpdf

## Threat: [Malicious Input Leading to Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/malicious_input_leading_to_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides specially crafted or excessively large input data (e.g., very long strings, deeply nested structures, extremely large images) directly to the QuestPDF library during PDF generation. This causes the library itself to consume excessive CPU and memory resources.

**Impact:** The application's PDF generation functionality, which relies on QuestPDF, becomes unavailable, leading to service disruption. The server hosting the application might become overloaded or crash specifically due to QuestPDF's resource consumption.

**Affected Component:**
*   Input processing module within QuestPDF
*   Layout engine within QuestPDF
*   Rendering engine within QuestPDF

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict input validation on all data directly provided to QuestPDF. Limit the size and complexity of text, images, and other data processed by the library.
*   Set timeouts specifically for QuestPDF's PDF generation processes to prevent indefinite resource consumption within the library.
*   Implement resource limits (e.g., memory limits, CPU quotas) for the processes directly executing QuestPDF's code for PDF generation.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion due to Unbounded Operations within QuestPDF](./threats/resource_exhaustion_due_to_unbounded_operations_within_questpdf.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits features within QuestPDF that allow for dynamically generating a large number of elements or pages without proper internal limits within the library itself. This leads to excessive memory consumption *within QuestPDF*, potentially crashing the application due to QuestPDF's resource usage.

**Impact:** The application's PDF generation functionality becomes unavailable due to QuestPDF's failure. The server might crash due to out-of-memory errors directly caused by QuestPDF's memory consumption.

**Affected Component:**
*   Layout engine within QuestPDF (especially dynamic content generation features)
*   Memory management within QuestPDF

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   When using QuestPDF's dynamic content generation features, implement limits on the number of elements generated.
*   Utilize QuestPDF's pagination features or other techniques to break down large documents into smaller, manageable parts *within the QuestPDF document structure*.
*   Monitor resource usage specifically of the processes running QuestPDF and implement alerts for excessive consumption.

## Threat: [Path Traversal Vulnerability in QuestPDF Resource Loading](./threats/path_traversal_vulnerability_in_questpdf_resource_loading.md)

**Description:** If the application allows users to specify file paths that are directly passed to QuestPDF for loading resources (e.g., images, fonts), an attacker could provide a malicious path that escapes the intended directory (path traversal). This allows them to instruct QuestPDF to access or include sensitive files from the server's file system in the generated PDF.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server through QuestPDF's file access mechanisms.

**Affected Component:**
*   Resource loading module within QuestPDF (image loading, font loading)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid allowing users to directly specify file paths that are passed to QuestPDF for resource loading.
*   If user-provided paths are absolutely necessary for QuestPDF, implement strict validation and sanitization *before* passing them to QuestPDF, to prevent path traversal attacks. Use whitelisting of allowed directories.
*   Store resources in a secure location and provide QuestPDF with controlled access mechanisms (e.g., using relative paths within a designated resource directory).
