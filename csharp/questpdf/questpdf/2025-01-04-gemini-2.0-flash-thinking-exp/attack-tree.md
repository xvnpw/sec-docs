## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious PDF Content Generation -> Inject Malicious JavaScript](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_pdf_content_generation_-_inject_malicious_javascript.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker provides input to the application that is used to generate a PDF document. This input contains malicious JavaScript code.

**QuestPDF's Role (Critical Node: QuestPDF Allows Embedding JavaScript):** QuestPDF, by design or lack of secure configuration, allows embedding JavaScript within the generated PDF.

**Application's Role (Critical Node: Application Does Not Sanitize Data Used in PDF Generation):** The application fails to sanitize or escape the user-provided input before passing it to QuestPDF for PDF generation. This allows the malicious JavaScript to be included verbatim in the PDF.

**Execution:** When a user opens the generated PDF in a vulnerable PDF viewer, the embedded malicious JavaScript is executed, potentially leading to:
*   Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks within the context of the PDF viewer.
*   Information theft from the user's system or other open browser tabs.
*   Redirection to malicious websites.
*   Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the PDF viewer itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious PDF Content Generation -> Trigger Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex PDF](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_pdf_content_generation_-_trigger_denial_of_service__dos__via_complex_pdf.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker provides input that, when processed by QuestPDF, results in a PDF document with an extremely complex structure.

**QuestPDF's Role (Critical Node: QuestPDF Has Performance Issues with Complex Structures):** QuestPDF's internal rendering engine struggles to process highly complex PDF structures efficiently, leading to excessive CPU and memory consumption.

**Application's Role (Critical Node: Application Does Not Implement Resource Limits for PDF Generation):** The application lacks mechanisms to limit the resources (CPU time, memory) consumed by the PDF generation process.

**Consequence:** When the application attempts to generate the complex PDF, it consumes excessive server resources, potentially leading to:
*   Slowdown or unresponsiveness of the application.
*   Denial of service for legitimate users.
*   Server crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious PDF Content Generation -> Embed Exploitable File Formats](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_pdf_content_generation_-_embed_exploitable_file_formats.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker provides input containing a link or embedded data of a malicious file (e.g., an SVG image with embedded JavaScript).

**QuestPDF's Role (Critical Node: QuestPDF Allows Embedding Arbitrary File Types):** QuestPDF allows embedding various file types within the PDF without proper sanitization or restriction.

**User's Role:** When the user opens the PDF, the PDF viewer attempts to render the embedded file.

**Vulnerability:** If the PDF viewer has vulnerabilities in handling the embedded file format (e.g., executing JavaScript within an SVG), the attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in PDF Generation Process -> Server-Side Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_pdf_generation_process_-_server-side_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker sends multiple concurrent or rapid requests to the application, each triggering a PDF generation process.

**QuestPDF's Role (Critical Node: QuestPDF is Resource Intensive):** Generating PDF documents with QuestPDF consumes a significant amount of server resources (CPU, memory).

**Application's Role (Critical Node: Application Lacks Rate Limiting or Resource Management):** The application does not implement sufficient rate limiting or resource management mechanisms to handle a large number of concurrent PDF generation requests.

**Consequence:** The influx of requests overwhelms the server's resources, leading to:
*   Slowdown or unresponsiveness of the application.
*   Denial of service for legitimate users.
*   Server crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in PDF Generation Process -> Code Injection via Templating (If Applicable)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_pdf_generation_process_-_code_injection_via_templating__if_applicable_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker provides malicious input that is intended to be used within a templating engine by QuestPDF.

**QuestPDF's Role (Critical Node: QuestPDF Uses a Templating Engine):** QuestPDF utilizes a templating engine to dynamically generate parts of the PDF content.

**Application's Role (Critical Node: Application Does Not Sanitize Input Used in Templates):** The application fails to properly sanitize or escape user-provided input before passing it to the templating engine.

**Consequence:** The templating engine interprets the malicious input as code, leading to:
*   Execution of arbitrary code on the server.
*   Data breaches.
*   Server compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Input to Achieve Unintended Outcomes -> Injecting Unintended Content](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_input_to_achieve_unintended_outcomes_-_injecting_unintended_content.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker provides input containing malicious text, HTML, or other markup that is not intended to be part of the final PDF content.

**Application's Role (Critical Node: Application Does Not Properly Sanitize Input):** The application fails to sanitize or escape user-provided input before passing it to QuestPDF for PDF generation.

**QuestPDF's Role:** QuestPDF renders the unsanitized input as part of the PDF document.

**Consequence:** This can lead to:
*   Defacement of the PDF document.
*   Insertion of misleading or harmful information.
*   Social engineering attacks by embedding phishing links or deceptive content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Input to Achieve Unintended Outcomes -> Exploiting File Path Handling (If Applicable)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_input_to_achieve_unintended_outcomes_-_exploiting_file_path_handling__if_applicable_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker provides a manipulated file path as input to the application, intending to access files outside the intended directory.

**Application's Role (Critical Node: Application Does Not Sanitize File Paths):** The application uses user-provided file paths without proper validation or sanitization.

**QuestPDF's Role:** If QuestPDF uses these unsanitized file paths to include external resources (images, fonts, etc.), it might access unintended files.

**Consequence:** This can lead to:
*   Access to sensitive files on the server.
*   Information disclosure.
*   Potential for further exploitation if accessed files contain sensitive data or executable code.
