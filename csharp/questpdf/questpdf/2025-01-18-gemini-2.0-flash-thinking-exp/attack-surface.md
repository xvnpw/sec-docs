# Attack Surface Analysis for questpdf/questpdf

## Attack Surface: [Image Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/image_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows users to provide image paths or data that QuestPDF processes, vulnerabilities in QuestPDF's underlying image decoding libraries could be exploited.
    *   **How QuestPDF Contributes:** QuestPDF uses image decoding libraries to process images included in the generated PDFs. If these libraries have vulnerabilities, processing malicious images can lead to issues.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted PNG file that exploits a known vulnerability in the image decoding library used by QuestPDF. When QuestPDF attempts to process this image, it could lead to a denial of service or, in more severe cases, remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if RCE is possible).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Validate Image Sources:**  If possible, restrict the sources of images to trusted locations or use a content delivery network (CDN) for static assets.
        *   **Input Validation for Images:** Validate the format and potentially the content of uploaded images before passing them to QuestPDF.
        *   **Keep QuestPDF Updated:** Regularly update QuestPDF to benefit from patches to its dependencies, including image decoding libraries.

## Attack Surface: [Font Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/font_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows users to specify custom fonts or if QuestPDF processes untrusted font files, vulnerabilities in font parsing libraries could be exploited.
    *   **How QuestPDF Contributes:** QuestPDF uses font parsing libraries to render text with specified fonts. Vulnerabilities in these libraries can be triggered by malicious font files.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a malicious TTF font file. When QuestPDF attempts to render text using this font, it triggers a buffer overflow in the font parsing library, leading to a crash or potential code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if RCE is possible).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict Font Sources:** Limit the ability to use custom fonts to trusted sources or pre-approved font sets.
        *   **Font Validation (Difficult):** Validating font files for malicious content is complex but might be necessary in high-security environments.
        *   **Keep QuestPDF Updated:** Ensure QuestPDF and its dependencies are up-to-date to patch font parsing vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in QuestPDF's Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_questpdf's_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** QuestPDF relies on other .NET libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly affect applications using QuestPDF.
    *   **How QuestPDF Contributes:** By including these dependencies, QuestPDF inherits any vulnerabilities present in them.
    *   **Example:** A critical security vulnerability is discovered in a NuGet package that QuestPDF depends on. Applications using the vulnerable version of QuestPDF are also at risk.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability in the dependency, potentially including Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, or information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep QuestPDF Updated:** Regularly update QuestPDF to the latest version, which will typically include updates to its dependencies, addressing known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use tools to scan your project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities and update them proactively.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories for QuestPDF and its dependencies.
