## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via QuestPDF Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_questpdf_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

* **Compromise Application via QuestPDF Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a successful breach of the application's security through vulnerabilities in the QuestPDF library.
    * Achieving this node signifies that the attacker has managed to leverage weaknesses in QuestPDF to gain unauthorized access or control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities in QuestPDF (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities_in_questpdf__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities in QuestPDF (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This node represents the exploitation of weaknesses in how the application processes input data that is subsequently used by QuestPDF to generate PDF documents.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Attackers can provide malicious input data through various channels (e.g., user forms, API requests) that is not properly sanitized or validated by the application before being passed to QuestPDF.
        * This can lead to the injection of unwanted content or instructions into the generated PDF.
    * **Why it's High-Risk/Critical:**
        * High Likelihood: Applications frequently use user-provided data in PDF generation, making this a common attack vector.
        * Significant Impact: Successful exploitation can lead to various forms of compromise, including phishing, malware distribution, and potentially more severe attacks depending on the injected content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Content into PDF Generation Data (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_content_into_pdf_generation_data__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Inject Malicious Content into PDF Generation Data (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This node specifically focuses on the injection of harmful content into the data stream used by QuestPDF.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Attackers can inject malicious links or URIs that, when clicked within the PDF, redirect users to phishing sites or initiate drive-by downloads.
    * **Why it's High-Risk/Critical:**
        * High Likelihood: If the application doesn't properly sanitize user-provided text or URLs, injection is easily achievable.
        * Significant Impact: Can lead to credential theft, malware infection, and reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Links/URIs (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_linksuris__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Inject Malicious Links/URIs (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This is a specific type of malicious content injection where the attacker embeds harmful web links within the PDF.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * An attacker provides malicious URLs as input, which are then directly included in the generated PDF content.
        * When a user clicks on these links within the PDF viewer, they are redirected to attacker-controlled websites.
    * **Why it's High-Risk:**
        * High Likelihood:  Applications often use user-provided URLs in PDFs (e.g., for references, contact information). If not validated, injection is straightforward.
        * Medium Impact: While not directly compromising the server, it can lead to phishing attacks and the distribution of malware.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Output Generation Vulnerabilities in QuestPDF (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_output_generation_vulnerabilities_in_questpdf__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Output Generation Vulnerabilities in QuestPDF (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This node focuses on vulnerabilities that arise during the process of QuestPDF generating the final PDF output.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * QuestPDF, due to bugs or design flaws, might generate PDFs with inherent vulnerabilities that can be exploited by PDF viewers.
        * Attackers can influence the generation process to embed malicious features within the PDF.
    * **Why it's High-Risk/Critical:**
        * Moderate Likelihood: While less common than input handling issues, vulnerabilities in output generation can have severe consequences.
        * Significant Impact: Successful exploitation can lead to code execution within the PDF viewer or other client-side attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Generate Malicious PDF Features (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/generate_malicious_pdf_features__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Generate Malicious PDF Features (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This node represents the deliberate creation of PDF documents containing malicious functionalities.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Attackers can leverage QuestPDF's features or vulnerabilities to embed malicious files within the PDF. When the PDF is opened, a vulnerable viewer might attempt to execute these embedded files.
        * Attackers can manipulate the PDF generation process to include "auto-action" features that automatically execute commands or open specific URLs when the PDF is opened in a vulnerable viewer.
    * **Why it's High-Risk/Critical:**
        * Moderate Likelihood: Requires some understanding of PDF features and how to manipulate QuestPDF, but well-documented techniques exist.
        * High Impact: Can lead to malware installation, remote code execution on the client machine, and other severe compromises.

## Attack Tree Path: [Embed Malicious Files (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/embed_malicious_files__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Embed Malicious Files (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This attack vector involves embedding harmful files (e.g., executables, scripts) within the generated PDF.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * If the application allows users to upload or link to files that are then embedded in the PDF, an attacker can upload a malicious file.
        * A vulnerable PDF viewer might then attempt to execute this embedded file when the PDF is opened.
    * **Why it's High-Risk:**
        * Medium Likelihood: Depends on whether the application offers functionality to embed external files.
        * High Impact:  Directly leads to the potential execution of arbitrary code on the user's machine.

## Attack Tree Path: [Generate PDFs with Auto-Action Exploits (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/generate_pdfs_with_auto-action_exploits__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Generate PDFs with Auto-Action Exploits (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * This attack vector focuses on manipulating PDF features that automatically trigger actions upon opening the document.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Attackers can influence the PDF generation process to include actions that automatically open malicious URLs, execute JavaScript code, or perform other harmful operations when the PDF is opened in a vulnerable viewer.
    * **Why it's High-Risk:**
        * Low to Medium Likelihood: Requires some knowledge of PDF specifications and how to manipulate QuestPDF to generate these features.
        * Medium to High Impact: Can lead to redirection to malicious sites, execution of client-side scripts for further exploitation, or information disclosure.
