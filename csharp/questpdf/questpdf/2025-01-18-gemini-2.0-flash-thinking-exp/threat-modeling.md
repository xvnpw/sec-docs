# Threat Model Analysis for questpdf/questpdf

## Threat: [Unsanitized Input Leading to JavaScript Injection within PDF](./threats/unsanitized_input_leading_to_javascript_injection_within_pdf.md)

**Description:** If QuestPDF's rendering engine processes user-provided input in a way that allows the execution of JavaScript within the generated PDF, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code. This could occur if QuestPDF doesn't properly sanitize or escape input used in text elements or through features allowing the embedding of potentially active content. The attacker aims to execute code on the victim's machine when they open the PDF.

**Impact:** Successful JavaScript injection can lead to:

*   Stealing sensitive information displayed in the PDF.
*   Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
*   Potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in the PDF viewer itself, leading to more severe consequences like arbitrary code execution on the victim's system.

**Affected Component:** Text rendering module, potentially any module handling user-provided string input or features allowing embedding of dynamic content.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Ensure QuestPDF's API is used in a way that prevents the interpretation of user-provided input as executable script.
*   If QuestPDF offers features for embedding dynamic content, carefully evaluate the security implications and implement strict controls.
*   Consider if the need for dynamic content within generated PDFs is absolutely necessary, and explore alternative approaches if possible.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of External Resources leading to SSRF](./threats/insecure_handling_of_external_resources_leading_to_ssrf.md)

**Description:** If QuestPDF allows embedding external resources (e.g., images, fonts) via URLs and doesn't properly validate or restrict these URLs, an attacker could provide a malicious URL. This could force the server running the application to make requests to unintended internal or external resources, leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack. This threat directly involves QuestPDF's functionality for fetching external content.

**Impact:** A successful SSRF attack through QuestPDF can allow an attacker to:

*   Scan internal network resources that are not publicly accessible.
*   Access internal services and potentially sensitive data.
*   Potentially perform actions on other systems using the application server's credentials.

**Affected Component:** Modules within QuestPDF responsible for fetching and embedding external resources based on provided URLs.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Strictly validate and sanitize all URLs provided to QuestPDF for external resources.
*   Implement a whitelist of allowed domains or protocols for external resources that QuestPDF is permitted to access.
*   Consider downloading and embedding external resources directly within the PDF generation process instead of relying on URLs provided at runtime.
*   If possible, disable or restrict the use of external resources within QuestPDF if the functionality is not essential.
