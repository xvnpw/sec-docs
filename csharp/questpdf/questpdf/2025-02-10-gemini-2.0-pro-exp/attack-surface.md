# Attack Surface Analysis for questpdf/questpdf

## Attack Surface: [1.1 Font Manipulation (High/Critical - Depending on SkiaSharp)](./attack_surfaces/1_1_font_manipulation__highcritical_-_depending_on_skiasharp_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in how QuestPDF (via SkiaSharp) handles font loading and rendering.
*   **How QuestPDF Contributes:** QuestPDF relies on SkiaSharp for font rendering.  Vulnerabilities in SkiaSharp's font handling directly impact QuestPDF.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides a font name that triggers a buffer overflow vulnerability in SkiaSharp's font parsing logic (hypothetical, but illustrates the risk).
*   **Impact:**  Denial of Service (DoS) is highly likely.  Remote Code Execution (RCE) is *possible* if a suitable SkiaSharp vulnerability exists, making this potentially Critical. Information disclosure is also possible.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (DoS) to Critical (RCE - dependent on SkiaSharp).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Fonts:**  *Strictly* limit font loading to a predefined, known-safe set of fonts.  Do *not* allow users to specify font names or URLs.
    *   **Validate Font Paths:** If loading from the file system, *rigorously* validate paths to prevent traversal. Use a base directory and ensure the path remains within it.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Limit font file sizes.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Isolate the font loading and rendering process (ideally, the entire PDF generation) in a restricted environment.
    *   **Keep SkiaSharp Updated:** This is *crucial*.  Monitor for SkiaSharp security updates and apply them immediately.

## Attack Surface: [1.2 Image Manipulation (SSRF - Critical)](./attack_surfaces/1_2_image_manipulation__ssrf_-_critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attacks leveraging QuestPDF's image loading to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
*   **How QuestPDF Contributes:** If QuestPDF is used to embed images based on user-provided URLs, it creates a direct SSRF vector.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides an image URL pointing to an internal service: `http://localhost:8080/admin/credentials`. QuestPDF, during PDF generation, makes a request to this URL.
*   **Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) â€“ potentially allowing access to internal services, data exfiltration, or even internal network pivoting.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Image Domains:**  *Strictly* enforce a whitelist of allowed domains for image sources.  *Never* allow arbitrary URLs.
    *   **SSRF Protection Library:** Use a dedicated, well-vetted library to prevent SSRF. This library should validate URLs against the whitelist and potentially perform additional checks.
    *   **Proxy Images:** Fetch all images through a secure proxy server that can enforce access control policies and prevent direct connections to internal resources.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** If possible, isolate the PDF generation process on a network segment that has limited access to internal resources.

## Attack Surface: [1.3 Malformed Content Injection (DoS - High)](./attack_surfaces/1_3_malformed_content_injection__dos_-_high_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks that provide specially crafted input designed to cause excessive resource consumption or trigger bugs in QuestPDF's layout engine.
*   **How QuestPDF Contributes:** QuestPDF's layout engine processes the input to structure the PDF.  Malformed input can exploit vulnerabilities in this process.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides extremely deeply nested elements or an extremely long string, aiming to cause a stack overflow or exhaust memory.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to resource exhaustion or application crashes.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Input Length Limits:** Enforce strict limits on the length of all text inputs.
    *   **Nesting Depth Limits:** If using nested structures (e.g., HTML-like content), limit the maximum nesting depth.
    *   **Complexity Limits:** Implement checks to prevent the generation of overly complex PDF structures (e.g., a huge number of pages or elements).
    *   **Input Validation (Regex):** Use regular expressions to validate the structure of input data, ensuring it conforms to expected patterns.

## Attack Surface: [2.1 SkiaSharp Vulnerability (Critical)](./attack_surfaces/2_1_skiasharp_vulnerability__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in SkiaSharp, the graphics library QuestPDF uses, directly impacting QuestPDF's security.
*   **How QuestPDF Contributes:** QuestPDF is directly dependent on SkiaSharp for rendering.  A SkiaSharp vulnerability is effectively a QuestPDF vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability in SkiaSharp's image decoding logic allows for remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Regular Dependency Updates:**  *Immediately* update SkiaSharp upon the release of security patches.  Automate this process.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use tools to actively scan for known vulnerabilities in SkiaSharp and other dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [3.1 Large Document DoS (High)](./attack_surfaces/3_1_large_document_dos__high_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks that exploit how QuestPDF allocates and manages memory, particularly when generating large or complex documents.
*   **How QuestPDF Contributes:** The PDF generation process can be memory-intensive. If not handled carefully, it can lead to resource exhaustion.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides input that results in a PDF with millions of pages or extremely complex vector graphics.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive memory consumption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Document Size Limits:** Impose strict limits on the maximum size (in bytes) and complexity (number of pages, elements) of generated PDFs.
    *   **Memory Monitoring:** Monitor memory usage during PDF generation and terminate the process if it exceeds predefined limits.
    *   **Streaming (if applicable):** If possible, use streaming techniques to generate the PDF incrementally, rather than building the entire document in memory at once. QuestPDF may have features to support this.
