# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for questpdf/questpdf

## Mitigation Strategy: [Complexity Limits (within QuestPDF)](./mitigation_strategies/complexity_limits__within_questpdf_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify QuestPDF-Specific Limits:** Focus on limits that can be checked *during* the document composition process using QuestPDF's API.  This includes:
        *   **Nesting Depth:** Use a counter within your document composition logic to track the current nesting level of elements.  Before adding a nested element (e.g., using `Container().Element(...)`), check if the counter exceeds the `MaxNestingDepth`.
        *   **Page Count (Conditional):** While QuestPDF doesn't have a direct "max pages" setting, you can *conditionally* add content based on the current page number.  Use `context.PageNumber` within `Compose` methods to check if adding the next element would exceed `MaxPageCount`.  If so, stop adding content.
        *   **Element Count (Conditional):** Similar to page count, maintain a counter for the total number of elements added.  Conditionally add elements based on this counter and `MaxElements`.
        *   **Table Row/Column Count (Conditional):** Within your table composition logic, track the number of rows and columns being added.  Before adding a new row or cell, check if the limits (`MaxTableRows`, `MaxTableColumns`) would be exceeded.
    2.  **Implement Checks within `Compose` Methods:** The checks described above should be implemented *within* the `Compose` methods of your QuestPDF components (e.g., `IDocument.Compose`, `IContainer.Compose`, custom component `Compose` methods). This is where you have the most control over the document structure.
    3.  **Error Handling (Graceful Degradation):** Instead of throwing exceptions, consider implementing graceful degradation.  If a limit is reached, stop adding further content *at that point* in the document, but still generate a valid (albeit incomplete) PDF.  Log a warning or error internally.  This is preferable to abruptly aborting the entire generation process.
    4.  **Dynamic Limits (Advanced):** For more complex scenarios, you might need to adjust limits dynamically based on the content being added.  For example, you could reduce the `MaxTextLength` if the document already contains a large number of images.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service):** (Severity: High) Prevents attackers from crafting overly complex documents that consume excessive server resources. This is now focused on *internal* QuestPDF limits.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** (Severity: Medium) Improves performance by preventing the generation of excessively large or complex PDFs.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Significantly reduces the risk, although external validation is still crucial for a complete defense.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Improves performance.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Page count limit is implemented (partially, as a conditional check) in `PdfGenerationService.cs`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Nesting depth limits are not implemented within QuestPDF's `Compose` methods.
    *   Table row/column limits are not implemented within QuestPDF's `Compose` methods.
    *   Total element limits are not implemented within QuestPDF's `Compose` methods.
    *   These should be added to the relevant `Compose` methods in `PdfGenerationService.cs` and any custom components.  A helper class or extension methods could be used to encapsulate the limit-checking logic. Graceful degradation should be implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Font Substitution (Fallback) Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/font_substitution__fallback__configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Default Fonts:** Determine which system fonts or bundled fonts will serve as fallbacks. These should be widely available and visually similar to the preferred fonts.
    2.  **Configure QuestPDF:** Use QuestPDF's font configuration API to specify fallback fonts. This typically involves:
        *   Using `Settings.DefaultFontFamily(...)` to set a global default font family.
        *   Using `TextStyle.FontFamily(...)` to set fallback fonts for specific text styles. You can chain multiple font families, with QuestPDF trying each one in order until it finds a match. Example: `.FontFamily("PreferredFont", "FallbackFont1", "FallbackFont2")`
    3.  **Test Fallback Rendering:**  Intentionally remove or rename one of your preferred fonts to test that the fallback mechanism works correctly.  Verify that the generated PDF still renders legibly with the fallback font.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Font Rendering Issues:** (Severity: Low) Prevents errors or unexpected output due to missing or unavailable fonts. Ensures that the PDF is still rendered, even if the preferred font is not found.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Font Rendering Issues:** Eliminates the risk of rendering problems due to missing fonts, as long as suitable fallbacks are configured.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   None.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Fallback fonts are not configured in QuestPDF. This should be added to `PdfGenerationService.cs`, where QuestPDF is initialized.  `Settings.DefaultFontFamily` should be set, and `TextStyle.FontFamily` should be used to specify fallbacks for any custom text styles.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Metadata Control (within QuestPDF)](./mitigation_strategies/metadata_control__within_questpdf_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Explicit Metadata Setting:** Use QuestPDF's `DocumentMetadata` class to *explicitly* set only the required metadata fields.  Do *not* rely on any automatic metadata generation. Example:
        ```csharp
        Document.Create(container => { ... })
            .WithMetadata(new DocumentMetadata
            {
                Title = sanitizedTitle, // Sanitize user input!
                Author = "My Application", // Hardcoded, safe value
                // Do NOT set other fields unless absolutely necessary
            });
        ```
    2.  **Avoid Automatic Population:** Be very cautious about any QuestPDF features that might automatically populate metadata fields.  If such features exist, disable them or ensure they are not using sensitive data.
    3.  **Sanitize User Input (if used):** If any metadata fields are populated from user input, *thoroughly* sanitize that input *before* passing it to QuestPDF. This is crucial to prevent injection attacks or the inclusion of unintended data.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Leakage:** (Severity: Low to Medium) Prevents sensitive information from being inadvertently exposed in PDF metadata.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Leakage:** Significantly reduces the risk of exposing sensitive information, provided that user input is properly sanitized.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic metadata (title) is set in `PdfGenerationService.cs`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No explicit sanitization of user-provided data used for the title. This is a *critical* missing piece.
    *   No mechanism to prevent other metadata fields from being automatically populated (if QuestPDF has such features). This needs investigation.
    *   The code in `PdfGenerationService.cs` should be updated to use `DocumentMetadata` explicitly and to sanitize any user-provided input used for metadata.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Stay Updated (QuestPDF Version)](./mitigation_strategies/stay_updated__questpdf_version_.md)

*   **Description:** (Same as before)
    1.  **Monitor Releases:** Regularly check the QuestPDF GitHub repository (or NuGet package manager) for new releases and security advisories.
    2.  **Update Promptly:** When a new version is released, especially one that includes security fixes, update the QuestPDF dependency in your project as soon as reasonably possible.
    3.  **Testing:** After updating, thoroughly test the PDF generation functionality to ensure that the update did not introduce any regressions or compatibility issues.
    4.  **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management tool (like NuGet) to track and manage the QuestPDF dependency. This simplifies the update process.

*   **Threats Mitigated:** (Same as before)
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** (Severity: Variable, depends on the vulnerability) Protects against known vulnerabilities in older versions of QuestPDF.

*   **Impact:** (Same as before)
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Reduces the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities. The impact depends on the severity of the specific vulnerabilities addressed in each update.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Same as before)
    *   The project uses NuGet for dependency management.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Same as before)
    *   A formal process for regularly checking for QuestPDF updates is not in place.  This should be added to the team's development workflow.
    *   Automated testing of PDF generation after updates is not fully implemented.
