# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a reliable and efficient solution for PDF generation in .NET applications.
*   Offer a user-friendly API that simplifies the complex task of PDF creation.
*   Maintain high performance and low memory consumption for optimal resource utilization.
*   Ensure compatibility across different .NET environments.
*   Foster a strong open-source community for continuous improvement and support.
*   Establish QuestPDF as a leading .NET library for PDF generation.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Inability to generate valid PDF documents, leading to data loss or corruption.
*   Performance bottlenecks or excessive memory usage, impacting application responsiveness.
*   Security vulnerabilities that could be exploited to compromise the system or data.
*   Lack of compatibility with specific .NET versions or platforms, limiting adoption.
*   Insufficient documentation or support, hindering developer productivity.
*   Competition from other PDF generation libraries, eroding market share.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Input validation: The library performs input validation to prevent common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or injection attacks. Implemented in the code, specifically in areas handling external data or user-provided content.
*   security control: Exception handling: Robust exception handling is implemented to gracefully handle errors and prevent unexpected application termination. Implemented throughout the codebase.
*   security control: Code reviews: Regular code reviews are conducted to identify and address potential security issues. Documented in pull requests and code review comments within the GitHub repository.
*   security control: Static analysis: Static analysis tools are used to detect potential vulnerabilities and code quality issues. Integrated into the build process, as indicated by the use of linters and code analysis tools.
*   security control: Dependency management: Dependencies are carefully managed to minimize the risk of introducing vulnerable libraries. Tracked and managed through the .NET project files and package manager.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The library relies on external dependencies, which may introduce vulnerabilities beyond the project's direct control.
*   accepted risk: The library's performance may be affected by the complexity and size of the generated PDF documents.
*   accepted risk: The library may not be fully compatible with all possible .NET environments or configurations.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Fuzz testing: Implement fuzz testing to identify unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities by providing invalid or random inputs.
*   security control: Content Security Policy (CSP): If applicable, implement CSP to mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   security control: Regular security audits: Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable, as the library itself does not handle authentication.
*   Authorization: Not directly applicable, as the library itself does not handle authorization.
*   Input Validation:
    *   All inputs to the library should be validated to ensure they conform to expected types, lengths, and formats.
    *   Specific validation rules should be implemented based on the type and purpose of each input.
    *   Invalid inputs should be rejected with appropriate error messages.
*   Cryptography:
    *   If the library handles sensitive data, appropriate cryptographic algorithms should be used for encryption and hashing.
    *   Cryptographic keys should be securely managed and protected.
    *   Consider supporting PDF encryption features if required by users.
*   Output Encoding:
    *   Ensure that any data included in the PDF is properly encoded to prevent injection vulnerabilities.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes to Protect:

*   PDF generation: The core functionality of the library must be reliable and secure.
*   Application integration: The library must integrate seamlessly with .NET applications without introducing vulnerabilities.
*   Reputation: Maintaining a positive reputation as a secure and reliable library is crucial.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
