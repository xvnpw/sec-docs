# Threat Model Analysis for questpdf/questpdf

## Threat: [Excessive Resource Consumption via Nested Elements](./threats/excessive_resource_consumption_via_nested_elements.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides input data with excessively deep nesting of layout elements (e.g., Containers within Containers within Containers, etc., to an extreme depth).  The attacker aims to exhaust server resources (CPU and memory) during the layout and rendering process.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). The application becomes unresponsive or crashes, preventing legitimate users from generating PDFs.  Potentially, the entire server could become unstable.
*   **Affected QuestPDF Component:**  Layout Engine (specifically, the recursive layout algorithms that handle nested elements).  This affects components like `Container`, `Column`, `Row`, and any other component that can contain other elements.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:**  Implement a strict limit on the maximum nesting depth allowed in the input data.  This limit should be based on the application's specific needs and performance testing.
    *   **Recursive Depth Tracking:**  Within the application logic *before* passing data to QuestPDF, implement a check to count the maximum nesting depth.  Reject input that exceeds the limit.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor CPU and memory usage during PDF generation.  If resource consumption exceeds predefined thresholds, terminate the process.

## Threat: [Large Image Resource Exhaustion](./threats/large_image_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides extremely large image files (in terms of dimensions or file size) as input.  The attacker's goal is to consume excessive memory and potentially disk space during image processing and embedding within the PDF.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).  The application may crash due to out-of-memory errors, or become extremely slow.  Disk space exhaustion is also a possibility if temporary files are created.
*   **Affected QuestPDF Component:**  Image Handling (`Image` component and underlying image processing libraries used by QuestPDF).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:**  Enforce strict limits on:
        *   Maximum image file size.
        *   Maximum image dimensions (width and height).
        *   Allowed image file types (e.g., only allow JPEG, PNG, etc.).
    *   **Image Resizing/Downscaling:**  Before passing images to QuestPDF, resize or downscale them to acceptable dimensions.  This reduces the memory footprint.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:**  Monitor memory usage during image processing.

## Threat: [Exploiting a Zero-Day Vulnerability in QuestPDF's Layout Engine](./threats/exploiting_a_zero-day_vulnerability_in_questpdf's_layout_engine.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a previously unknown vulnerability (zero-day) in QuestPDF's layout engine.  The specific attack vector would depend on the nature of the vulnerability, but could involve crafting malicious input that triggers unexpected behavior, potentially leading to information disclosure or, in a worst-case scenario, code execution.
*   **Impact:**  Variable, depending on the vulnerability. Could range from information disclosure to DoS to remote code execution (RCE).
*   **Affected QuestPDF Component:**  Layout Engine (potentially any component involved in layout calculations).
*   **Risk Severity:**  Potentially Critical (if RCE is possible), otherwise High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:**  This is the *primary* mitigation.  Monitor for security advisories and updates from the QuestPDF project and apply them promptly.
    *   **Input Validation:**  While not a complete defense against zero-days, robust input validation can reduce the attack surface and make exploitation more difficult.
    *   **Security Audits:**  Consider periodic security audits of the application and its dependencies, including QuestPDF, to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **WAF (Web Application Firewall):** A WAF might be able to detect and block some exploit attempts, but this is not a reliable defense against zero-days.

## Threat: [Tampering with Input Data to Generate Unexpected Content](./threats/tampering_with_input_data_to_generate_unexpected_content.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the input data provided to QuestPDF, but *not* in a way that directly causes a crash or DoS. Instead, the attacker aims to generate a PDF that contains unexpected or misleading content, potentially to defraud users or misrepresent information.  For example, changing numbers in a financial report.
*   **Impact:**  Data Integrity Violation.  The generated PDF does not accurately reflect the intended data.  This could have legal, financial, or reputational consequences.
*   **Affected QuestPDF Component:**  All components that consume input data (e.g., `Text`, `Image`, `Table`, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:**  Implement comprehensive input validation, including:
        *   Type checking.
        *   Range checks.
        *   Format validation (e.g., ensuring dates are valid).
        *   Whitelist-based validation where appropriate.
    *   **Data Integrity Checks:**  If the input data comes from a database or other trusted source, verify its integrity before passing it to QuestPDF (e.g., using checksums or digital signatures).
    *   **User Confirmation:**  For critical data, consider displaying a preview of the generated PDF to the user for confirmation *before* finalizing it.
