## Attack Tree Path: [[!!][Sub-Goal 3: Cause Denial of Service (DoS)] - High-Risk Path](./attack_tree_paths/_!!__sub-goal_3_cause_denial_of_service__dos___-_high-risk_path.md)

Description: This branch represents attacks aimed at making the application unavailable by exploiting QuestPDF's resource handling. DoS attacks are generally easier to execute than other types of attacks, requiring less skill and effort.
Reasoning: High likelihood due to the relative ease of crafting inputs that consume excessive resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [[!!][C1][***] Resource Exhaustion via Complex Layouts - Critical Node](./attack_tree_paths/_!!__c1____resource_exhaustion_via_complex_layouts_-_critical_node.md)

Description: An attacker crafts a PDF document with an extremely complex layout. This could involve deeply nested elements, very large tables, or other features that require significant processing by QuestPDF's layout engine. The goal is to consume excessive CPU or memory, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
Likelihood: High
Impact: Medium (Application unavailability)
Effort: Low
Skill Level: Low
Detection Difficulty: Low
Mitigation:
*   Implement strict limits on the complexity of documents that can be processed. This could include limits on the number of nested elements, table rows/columns, and overall document size.
*   Set timeouts for PDF generation. If a document takes too long to process, terminate the process.
*   Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) during PDF generation. If a process exceeds predefined thresholds, terminate it.
*   Use a queueing system to prevent a large number of complex documents from being processed simultaneously.

## Attack Tree Path: [[!!][C2][***] Resource Exhaustion via Large Images - Critical Node](./attack_tree_paths/_!!__c2____resource_exhaustion_via_large_images_-_critical_node.md)

Description: An attacker provides extremely large images (in terms of dimensions or file size) to be included in the PDF.  Processing these images can consume excessive memory and CPU, leading to a denial-of-service.
Likelihood: High
Impact: Medium (Application unavailability)
Effort: Very Low
Skill Level: Very Low
Detection Difficulty: Low
Mitigation:
*   Implement strict limits on image dimensions (width and height).
*   Implement strict limits on image file sizes.
*   Use image resizing and compression techniques *before* passing the image to QuestPDF.  Reduce the image to the necessary dimensions and quality for the PDF.
*   Consider using a separate service or process for image handling to isolate it from the main application.
*   Implement rate limiting on image uploads.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Sub-Goal 1: Execute Arbitrary Code]](./attack_tree_paths/_sub-goal_1_execute_arbitrary_code_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [[A1][***] Exploit Vulnerability in SkiaSharp (Dependency) - Critical Node](./attack_tree_paths/_a1____exploit_vulnerability_in_skiasharp__dependency__-_critical_node.md)

Description: QuestPDF relies on SkiaSharp for rendering.  A vulnerability in SkiaSharp (e.g., a buffer overflow, integer overflow, or use-after-free in image or font processing) could be exploited to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the server. This is a *critical* threat because SkiaSharp is a complex, low-level graphics library.
Likelihood: Medium
Impact: Very High (Complete server compromise)
Effort: High
Skill Level: High
Detection Difficulty: Medium
Mitigation:
*   **Keep SkiaSharp meticulously up-to-date.** This is the *most important* mitigation.  Apply security patches as soon as they are released.
*   **Monitor SkiaSharp's security advisories and CVE databases *very* closely.**  Be proactive in identifying and addressing vulnerabilities.
*   **Use a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool** to automatically track dependency vulnerabilities and alert you to updates.
*   **Implement robust input validation *before* data reaches QuestPDF/SkiaSharp.**  This can help prevent some exploits from reaching vulnerable code.  Focus on validating image data, font data, and any other external inputs.
*   **Consider using a WebAssembly (Wasm) sandbox** to isolate SkiaSharp's execution.  This is a more advanced mitigation, but it can significantly reduce the impact of a successful exploit. (Note: This would require significant changes to how QuestPDF is used, and might not be feasible in all cases.)
* **Implement WAF and IDS/IPS:** Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) and Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS) to detect and potentially block exploit attempts.
