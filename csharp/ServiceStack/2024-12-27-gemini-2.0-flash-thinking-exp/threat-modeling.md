## High and Critical ServiceStack Threats

| Threat | Description (What the attacker might do and how) | Impact | Affected ServiceStack Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Authentication Provider Spoofing/Bypass** | If custom authentication providers are used, an attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in their implementation to impersonate legitimate users or bypass authentication entirely. This could involve manipulating authentication tokens, exploiting logic flaws, or leveraging insecure credential storage. | Unauthorized access to user accounts, sensitive data, and application functionality. | AuthFeature Plugin, Custom Authentication Providers | Critical | - Thoroughly review and test custom authentication provider implementations. - Follow secure coding practices for authentication logic. - Utilize well-established and vetted authentication providers offered by ServiceStack where possible. - Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication. - Regularly audit authentication provider code. |
| **Insecure Plugin Usage** | If the application utilizes ServiceStack plugins, vulnerabilities within those plugins could be exploited by an attacker. This could range from information disclosure to remote code execution, depending on the plugin's functionality and vulnerabilities. | Potential for full application compromise, data breaches, and denial of service. | Plugin System, Specific Plugins | High to Critical (depending on the plugin) | - Carefully vet and select plugins from trusted sources. - Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. - Regularly review the security advisories of used plugins. - Understand the permissions and access levels granted to plugins. |
| **Session Fixation** | If relying on ServiceStack's built-in session management or implementing custom solutions, vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to fix a user's session ID. This means the attacker can trick a user into authenticating with a session ID they control, allowing the attacker to hijack the user's session after successful login. | Account takeover and unauthorized access to user data and functionality. | Session Management, AuthFeature Plugin | High | - Utilize ServiceStack's secure session management features. - Regenerate session IDs upon successful login. - Implement proper session invalidation upon logout. - Ensure secure transmission of session identifiers (HTTPS). |
| **Deserialization of Untrusted Data (if custom serialization is used insecurely)** | If custom serialization/deserialization is implemented without proper safeguards, an attacker could send malicious serialized payloads that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code on the server or consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service. | Remote code execution, denial of service. | Custom Serialization/Deserialization Logic | Critical | - Avoid custom serialization/deserialization if possible. - If necessary, carefully sanitize and validate data before deserialization. - Implement safeguards against deserialization bombs. - Consider using safer serialization formats. |
| **Insecure Service Authorization Logic** | If authorization logic within ServiceStack services is flawed or improperly implemented (e.g., relying on client-provided data for authorization decisions), an attacker could bypass access controls and perform actions they are not authorized to do. | Unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality, elevation of privilege. | Service Implementations, Auth Attributes (`[RequiredRole]`, `[RequiredPermission]`) | High | - Utilize ServiceStack's built-in authorization features (e.g., `[RequiredRole]`, `[RequiredPermission]`). - Implement robust and well-tested authorization logic within service implementations, relying on server-side checks. - Follow the principle of least privilege. - Avoid making authorization decisions based solely on client-provided data. |
| **Misconfiguration of Security Features** | Incorrect configuration of ServiceStack's security features (e.g., allowing anonymous access to sensitive endpoints, weak authentication settings) can create vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. | Various impacts depending on the misconfiguration, ranging from information disclosure to unauthorized access. | Configuration (`AppHost`), AuthFeature Plugin | High | - Follow ServiceStack's best practices for secure configuration. - Regularly review and audit ServiceStack configuration settings. - Implement security headers (e.g., Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options). - Ensure proper authentication and authorization are configured for all sensitive endpoints. |
