## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Strict Input Validation

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Identify Input Points:**  Locate all `gui.cs` widgets that accept user input such as `TextField`, `TextView`, `ComboBox` (when editable), and `Dialog` input prompts.
    *   **Step 2: Define Input Requirements:** For each input point, clearly define the expected input format, data type, length limits, and allowed character sets based on the application's logic.
    *   **Step 3: Implement Validation Logic using `gui.cs` Features:**
        *   **Utilize `gui.cs` Events:** Employ events like `TextField.Changed` or `TextField.KeyPress` to perform real-time validation as the user types within `gui.cs` widgets.
        *   **Custom Validation Functions:** Create dedicated validation functions that are called from within `gui.cs` event handlers to check input validity.
        *   **Integrate with `gui.cs` UI Feedback:** Use `gui.cs` UI elements to provide immediate feedback to the user about input validity, such as displaying error messages near input fields or changing the visual appearance of widgets.
    *   **Step 4: Client-Side Validation Focus:** Primarily focus on client-side validation within the `gui.cs` application to provide immediate user feedback and prevent obviously invalid input from being processed further.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Input Data Injection (High Severity):** Prevents injection attacks by ensuring input through `gui.cs` widgets conforms to expected formats.
    *   **Buffer Overflow (Medium Severity):** Limiting input length in `gui.cs` widgets helps prevent buffer overflows caused by excessively long inputs.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) through Malformed Input (Medium Severity):** Rejects malformed input at the `gui.cs` input stage, preventing potential DoS from processing invalid data.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Ensures data entered via `gui.cs` is in the correct format, maintaining data integrity within the application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Input Data Injection:** High Reduction - Significantly reduces injection risks by validating input directly within the `gui.cs` application.
    *   **Buffer Overflow:** Medium Reduction - Reduces buffer overflow risks by limiting input length handled by `gui.cs` widgets.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) through Malformed Input:** Medium Reduction - Reduces DoS risk by filtering invalid input at the `gui.cs` UI level.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues:** High Reduction - Greatly improves data integrity for data entered through `gui.cs` widgets.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Needs Assessment - Requires project-specific analysis to determine current implementation within `gui.cs` input handling.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Potentially missing in:
        *   Validation logic not consistently applied to all `gui.cs` input widgets.
        *   Lack of real-time validation feedback within the `gui.cs` UI.
        *   Reliance solely on backend validation without client-side checks in `gui.cs`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Escape Sequence Sanitization](./mitigation_strategies/escape_sequence_sanitization.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Escape Sequence Sanitization

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Identify `gui.cs` Output Points:** Locate all places where user-provided input or external data is displayed in the terminal UI using `gui.cs` widgets like `Label`, `TextView`, and `MessageBox`.
    *   **Step 2: Implement Sanitization within `gui.cs` Output Logic:**
        *   **Create Sanitization Function:** Develop a function that sanitizes strings by escaping or removing potentially dangerous terminal escape sequences.
        *   **Apply Before Display:**  Call this sanitization function on any string that originates from user input or external sources *immediately before* setting it as the text content of a `gui.cs` output widget (e.g., before setting `Label.Text`, `TextView.Text`, or passing to `MessageBox.Query`).
        *   **Focus on `gui.cs` Display Logic:** Ensure sanitization is integrated directly into the code paths that handle displaying text within `gui.cs` widgets.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Terminal Command Injection (High Severity):** Prevents injection of malicious commands through user input displayed via `gui.cs` by sanitizing escape sequences.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) through Terminal Overload (Medium Severity):** Prevents DoS attacks by removing escape sequences that could overwhelm the terminal when displayed by `gui.cs`.
    *   **UI Spoofing/Misleading Output (Medium Severity):** Prevents manipulation of the terminal display via escape sequences injected through user input and displayed by `gui.cs`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Terminal Command Injection:** High Reduction - Effectively eliminates command injection risk by sanitizing output within `gui.cs` display logic.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) through Terminal Overload:** Medium Reduction - Significantly reduces DoS risk by sanitizing terminal output generated by `gui.cs`.
    *   **UI Spoofing/Misleading Output:** Medium Reduction - Reduces UI spoofing risk by controlling terminal output displayed via `gui.cs`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Needs Assessment - Requires project analysis. Likely *not* implemented by default in basic `gui.cs` applications unless explicitly added in output handling.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Likely missing in:
        *   All areas where user input or external data is directly displayed in `gui.cs` widgets without explicit sanitization in the display code.
        *   Output paths in `gui.cs` code that were not initially considered as potential injection points.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Input Lengths (using `gui.cs` features)](./mitigation_strategies/limit_input_lengths__using__gui_cs__features_.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Limit Input Lengths (using `gui.cs` features)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Determine Maximum Lengths for `gui.cs` Inputs:** For each `TextField`, `TextView`, or other input widget in `gui.cs`, determine appropriate maximum input lengths based on application needs.
    *   **Step 2: Enforce Length Limits using `gui.cs` Properties and Events:**
        *   **`TextField.MaxLength` Property:**  Utilize the built-in `MaxLength` property of `TextField` to directly restrict input length within `gui.cs`.
        *   **Custom Length Checks in `gui.cs` Input Events:** For more complex scenarios or `TextView` input, implement custom length checks within `gui.cs` input event handlers (`Changed`, `KeyPress`) to prevent exceeding limits.
        *   **Integrate with `gui.cs` UI Feedback:** Provide visual feedback within the `gui.cs` UI to indicate input length limits, such as displaying remaining characters or disabling input when the limit is reached.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow (Medium Severity):** Reduces buffer overflow risks by limiting input length directly at the `gui.cs` input widget level.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion (Low to Medium Severity):** Prevents DoS by limiting resource consumption associated with excessively long inputs entered via `gui.cs`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow:** Medium Reduction - Reduces buffer overflow risk by enforcing length limits in `gui.cs` input widgets.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion:** Low to Medium Reduction - Provides some protection against DoS related to input length within the `gui.cs` application.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Needs Assessment - Requires project analysis. `TextField.MaxLength` is straightforward, so might be partially used, but consistent application across all relevant `gui.cs` input widgets needs verification.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Potentially missing in:
        *   Older `gui.cs` input fields where `MaxLength` was not initially set.
        *   `TextView` input handling where custom length limits are not implemented in `gui.cs` code.
        *   Inconsistent application of length limits across all input widgets in the `gui.cs` UI.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlled Output Generation (within `gui.cs`)](./mitigation_strategies/controlled_output_generation__within__gui_cs__.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Controlled Output Generation (within `gui.cs`)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Review `gui.cs` Output Logic:** Examine all code paths in the application that generate output displayed via `gui.cs` widgets.
    *   **Step 2: Avoid Direct Echoing of Unsanitized Input in `gui.cs`:**  Ensure that user-provided input or external data is *never* directly echoed or displayed in `gui.cs` widgets without proper sanitization (as described in "Escape Sequence Sanitization").
    *   **Step 3: Use `gui.cs` Formatting Functions Securely:** Utilize `gui.cs` formatting and display functions in a way that minimizes the risk of introducing vulnerabilities. Be cautious when constructing output strings dynamically, especially if incorporating external data.
    *   **Step 4: Centralize Output Handling (if feasible):** Consider centralizing output generation logic within the `gui.cs` application to make it easier to apply consistent sanitization and control measures.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Terminal Command Injection (High Severity):** Prevents accidental command injection by controlling how output is generated and displayed via `gui.cs`.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) through Terminal Overload (Medium Severity):** Reduces DoS risk by ensuring `gui.cs` output generation does not inadvertently create terminal-overloading sequences.
    *   **UI Spoofing/Misleading Output (Medium Severity):** Prevents unintentional UI spoofing by carefully controlling the content and format of output generated by `gui.cs`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Terminal Command Injection:** High Reduction - Significantly reduces command injection risk by controlling output generation within `gui.cs`.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) through Terminal Overload:** Medium Reduction - Reduces DoS risk by controlling output patterns generated by `gui.cs`.
    *   **UI Spoofing/Misleading Output:** Medium Reduction - Reduces unintentional UI spoofing by managing output content from `gui.cs`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Needs Assessment - Requires code review to assess current output generation practices within the `gui.cs` application.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Potentially missing if:
        *   Output generation logic in `gui.cs` is not reviewed for security implications.
        *   Unsanitized user input or external data is directly incorporated into `gui.cs` output.
        *   Output handling is scattered throughout the codebase, making consistent control difficult.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular `gui.cs` Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular__gui_cs__updates.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Regular `gui.cs` Updates

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Monitor `gui.cs` Repository:** Regularly check the official `gui.cs` GitHub repository for updates, releases, and security advisories related to the `gui.cs` library itself.
    *   **Step 2: Review `gui.cs` Release Notes:** When new versions of `gui.cs` are released, carefully review release notes and changelogs, specifically looking for bug fixes and security patches within the `gui.cs` library.
    *   **Step 3: Update `gui.cs` Library:**  Update the project's dependency on `gui.cs` to the latest stable version to incorporate security fixes and improvements provided by the `gui.cs` maintainers.
    *   **Step 4: Test After `gui.cs` Updates:** After updating `gui.cs`, thoroughly test the application to ensure compatibility and that the update has not introduced regressions in the application's `gui.cs` functionality.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known `gui.cs` Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Directly mitigates known security vulnerabilities *within* the `gui.cs` library itself.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known `gui.cs` Vulnerabilities:** High Reduction - Directly eliminates known vulnerabilities in `gui.cs`, significantly reducing the risk of exploitation targeting the library.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Needs Assessment - Requires assessment of project's dependency management and update practices for `gui.cs`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Potentially missing if:
        *   Project does not have a process for regularly updating dependencies, including `gui.cs`.
        *   Developers are not actively monitoring `gui.cs` releases for security updates.
        *   Updates to `gui.cs` are not tested and deployed in a timely manner.
