# Attack Surface Analysis for migueldeicaza/gui.cs

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Keyboard Input Sequences](./attack_surfaces/malicious_keyboard_input_sequences.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts specific sequences of keystrokes that exploit vulnerabilities in how the application or `gui.cs` handles keyboard input.
    *   **How `gui.cs` Contributes:** `gui.cs` handles and processes keyboard input events, making it the entry point for such attacks. If `gui.cs` or the application built on it doesn't properly sanitize or validate these inputs, it can lead to unexpected behavior.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker might input a sequence of control characters or escape sequences that cause the application to crash, execute unintended commands (if the application uses input for command processing), or bypass input validation checks.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential for command injection if input is used in system calls or external processes, bypassing security checks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all keyboard input received through `gui.cs`. Avoid directly using raw input for critical operations. Consider using allow-lists for expected input patterns. Limit the use of potentially dangerous key combinations.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about typing unusual sequences of characters, especially when instructed by untrusted sources.
