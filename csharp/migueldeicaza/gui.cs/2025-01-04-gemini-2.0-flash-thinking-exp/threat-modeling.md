# Threat Model Analysis for migueldeicaza/gui.cs

## Threat: [Malicious Input Injection](./threats/malicious_input_injection.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Input Injection

* **Description:** An attacker provides specially crafted input through the application's `gui.cs` interface. This input could include excessively long strings, control characters, or terminal escape sequences. The attacker aims to exploit vulnerabilities in how `gui.cs` processes this input.

* **Impact:**
    * Denial of Service (DoS): The application crashes or becomes unresponsive due to the inability to handle the malicious input.
    * Terminal Manipulation: The injected escape sequences alter the terminal display, potentially misleading the user or causing unexpected behavior.
    * Resource Exhaustion: Processing the malicious input consumes excessive memory or CPU, leading to performance degradation or crashes.

* **Affected Component:**
    * `Toplevel` class:  Handles the main application window and input events.
    * `View` class and its subclasses (e.g., `TextView`, `TextField`): Responsible for rendering and handling input within specific UI elements.
    * Input processing functions within these classes that handle keyboard and mouse events.

* **Risk Severity:** High

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the application logic *before* passing data to `gui.cs` components.
    * Limit the maximum length of input fields.
    * Filter out or escape potentially dangerous control characters and terminal escape sequences before displaying them.
    * Consider using `gui.cs` components with built-in input validation features if available.

## Threat: [Terminal Escape Sequence Injection (Output)](./threats/terminal_escape_sequence_injection__output_.md)

**Threat:** Terminal Escape Sequence Injection (Output)

* **Description:** An attacker influences data that is displayed by the application through `gui.cs`. This data contains malicious terminal escape sequences. The attacker aims to manipulate the user's terminal display.

* **Impact:**
    * Information Disclosure: Displaying sensitive information from other parts of the application or system in unexpected ways.
    * User Deception:  Altering the terminal display to trick the user into performing unintended actions (e.g., mimicking prompts or displaying fake information).
    * Potential for Local Code Execution (Indirect): While less direct, some terminal emulators might have vulnerabilities related to specific escape sequences that could be chained to achieve code execution.

* **Affected Component:**
    * `Label` class: Used for displaying static text.
    * `TextView` class: Used for displaying and editing multi-line text.
    * Drawing routines within `View` and its subclasses that render text to the terminal.

* **Risk Severity:** High

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Sanitize and encode any data originating from untrusted sources before displaying it using `gui.cs`.
    * Avoid directly displaying raw, user-provided data without proper encoding.
    * Consider using libraries or functions that automatically escape terminal control sequences.

## Threat: [Memory Management Issues within `gui.cs`](./threats/memory_management_issues_within__gui_cs_.md)

**Threat:** Memory Management Issues within `gui.cs`

* **Description:**  Bugs within `gui.cs`'s code could lead to memory leaks or use-after-free vulnerabilities. An attacker might trigger these conditions through specific interactions with the UI.

* **Impact:**
    * Denial of Service: Memory leaks can eventually exhaust system resources, leading to application crashes or system instability.
    * Potential for Exploitation: Use-after-free vulnerabilities can sometimes be exploited to gain control of the application's execution.

* **Affected Component:**
    * Memory allocation and deallocation routines within `gui.cs`'s internal implementation.
    * Object lifecycle management within the framework.

* **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical for use-after-free)

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Rely on the `gui.cs` maintainers to identify and fix memory management issues through regular updates.
    * Report any suspected memory leaks or crashes to the `gui.cs` development team.
    * Consider using memory profiling tools during development to identify potential issues.
