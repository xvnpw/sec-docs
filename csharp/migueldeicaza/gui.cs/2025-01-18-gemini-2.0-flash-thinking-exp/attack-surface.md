# Attack Surface Analysis for migueldeicaza/gui.cs

## Attack Surface: [Unsanitized User Input in Text Fields and Other Input Widgets](./attack_surfaces/unsanitized_user_input_in_text_fields_and_other_input_widgets.md)

*   **Description:**  `gui.cs` provides widgets like `TextField` and `TextView` for user input. If the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate this input, it can be exploited.
    *   **How gui.cs Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `gui.cs` itself doesn't enforce input validation. It's the developer's responsibility to handle input sanitization after retrieving it from the `gui.cs` widgets.
    *   **Example:** A user enters `"; rm -rf /"` into a `TextField` that is later used in a system command without sanitization.
    *   **Impact:** Command injection, potentially leading to complete system compromise or data loss.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data retrieved from `gui.cs` input widgets before using it in any operations (especially system calls, file operations, or database queries). Use parameterized queries or prepared statements where applicable. Employ allow-lists for expected input formats.

## Attack Surface: [Rendering Engine Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/rendering_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  `gui.cs` handles the rendering of UI elements to the terminal. Bugs in the rendering logic could be exploited.
    *   **How gui.cs Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `gui.cs` is responsible for translating UI element definitions into terminal escape sequences and managing the terminal display. Vulnerabilities in this translation or management could exist.
    *   **Example:** Providing an extremely long string to a `Label` or `TextView` that could cause a buffer overflow in the underlying rendering logic of `gui.cs` or the terminal emulator.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (application crash), potential for arbitrary code execution if memory corruption vulnerabilities exist within `gui.cs` or the terminal emulator.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Keep the `gui.cs` library updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches. Report any suspected rendering issues to the `gui.cs` developers.
        *   **User:** Use reputable and up-to-date terminal emulators.

## Attack Surface: [State Management Issues](./attack_surfaces/state_management_issues.md)

*   **Description:**  `gui.cs` manages the state of UI elements. If this state is not handled securely, it can be manipulated.
    *   **How gui.cs Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The way `gui.cs` stores and updates the state of widgets (e.g., the text in a `TextField`, the selection in a `ListView`) can be a point of vulnerability if not managed carefully by the application logic.
    *   **Example:** An application relies on the state of a checkbox (managed by `gui.cs`) to determine if a critical operation should be performed. If this state can be manipulated outside of the intended UI interaction, it could lead to unintended actions.
    *   **Impact:**  Bypassing security checks, triggering unintended application behavior, data corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**  Do not rely solely on the UI state for critical security decisions. Validate actions on the backend or in the application logic independently of the UI state. Implement proper state management practices and avoid exposing internal state unnecessarily.
