# Threat Model Analysis for migueldeicaza/gui.cs

## Threat: [Command Injection via Input Fields](./threats/command_injection_via_input_fields.md)

**Description:** If `gui.cs` does not properly sanitize or escape user input entered into its input components (like `TextView`, `TextField`, `Entry`), an attacker could inject malicious shell commands. The application, if naively using this unsanitized input in system calls, would then execute these commands with the application's privileges. This could lead to system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Impact:** System compromise, data breach, denial of service, privilege escalation.

**Affected gui.cs Component:** `TextView`, `TextField`, `Entry`, and any other input-receiving widgets where the `Text` property is directly used in system commands without sanitization by the application.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developer:**  Critically, the application *must* implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data received from `gui.cs` input components *before* using it in any system calls or external commands. Avoid directly constructing shell commands from user input. Use parameterized commands or safe APIs.

## Threat: [Terminal Escape Sequence Injection](./threats/terminal_escape_sequence_injection.md)

**Description:** Maliciously crafted input containing terminal escape sequences could be injected through `gui.cs` input fields or displayed in labels. `gui.cs`, if not handling these sequences securely, could render them, allowing an attacker to manipulate the terminal display. This can lead to UI spoofing (displaying fake information to trick the user) or denial of service (flooding the terminal with escape sequences, making it unresponsive). In some scenarios, it might even be used for information disclosure by manipulating the scrollback buffer.

**Impact:** UI deception, denial of service of the terminal, potential information disclosure.

**Affected gui.cs Component:** `Label`, `TextView`, `MessageBox`, and any other widgets that display text where `gui.cs` renders the content, potentially interpreting escape sequences.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developer:** Sanitize or strip potentially dangerous terminal escape sequences from any user-provided input before displaying it using `gui.cs` widgets. Consider using libraries specifically designed for safe terminal output or escaping mechanisms provided by such libraries.

## Threat: [Event Handling Vulnerabilities](./threats/event_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The event handling mechanism within `gui.cs` might have vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to manipulate or inject events. This could lead to triggering unintended actions within the application without direct user interaction, potentially bypassing security checks or causing unexpected state changes.

**Impact:** Unauthorized actions, bypass of security controls, potential for unexpected application behavior leading to vulnerabilities.

**Affected gui.cs Component:** The core event handling mechanism within `gui.cs`, including how events are dispatched and handled by widgets and the application's event loops.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developer:** Carefully review the `gui.cs` event handling logic used in the application. Ensure that critical actions are not solely reliant on UI events without additional validation. Be aware of potential race conditions or unexpected event sequences that could be exploited.
