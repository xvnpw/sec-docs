# Threat Model Analysis for migueldeicaza/gui.cs

## Threat: [Visual Spoofing of UI Elements](./threats/visual_spoofing_of_ui_elements.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious terminal sequences that are *not properly handled by gui.cs's rendering logic*, allowing them to manipulate the visual appearance of UI elements. This goes beyond simply providing bad input to the *application*; it exploits how `gui.cs` itself renders content to the terminal. The attacker might inject control characters that `gui.cs` doesn't properly sanitize, leading to cursor manipulation and overwriting of existing UI elements.
*   **Impact:** User deception, leading to unintended actions (e.g., deleting files, submitting incorrect data, granting unauthorized access). The user believes they are interacting with one element but are actually interacting with another, due to `gui.cs`'s failure to prevent the visual manipulation.
*   **Affected Component:** Any `View` that renders text, especially `Label`, `TextField`, `TextView`, `Button`, `Dialog`. The vulnerability lies in `gui.cs`'s rendering engine and its handling of terminal control sequences.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Input Sanitization (within gui.cs):** `gui.cs` itself *must* thoroughly sanitize all input it receives, even internally, before rendering it to the terminal. This includes removing or escaping any control characters or terminal sequences that could be used for visual spoofing. This is a *core responsibility of the library*.
    *   **Output Encoding (within gui.cs):** `gui.cs` should employ output encoding techniques to prevent the injection of malicious terminal sequences.
    *   **Internal Auditing of Rendering Code:** The `gui.cs` library maintainers should conduct regular security audits of the rendering code to identify and fix any potential vulnerabilities related to terminal sequence handling.

## Threat: [Input Injection into Text Fields (Exploiting gui.cs Handling)](./threats/input_injection_into_text_fields__exploiting_gui_cs_handling_.md)

*   **Description:** This focuses on vulnerabilities *within gui.cs's handling* of text input, *not* just the application's use of that input. An attacker might exploit a buffer overflow or other memory corruption vulnerability *within the TextField or TextView components themselves* by providing excessively long or specially crafted input. This is distinct from the application misusing the input; it's about breaking `gui.cs`'s internal mechanisms.
*   **Impact:**  Potentially crashes `gui.cs` (denial of service) or, in a worst-case scenario, could lead to arbitrary code execution *within the context of the application* if the vulnerability allows for overwriting function pointers or other critical data structures within `gui.cs`.
*   **Affected Component:** `TextField`, `TextView`. The vulnerability is within the internal implementation of these components.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if it leads to code execution) or High (if it leads to a crash).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Bounds Checking (within gui.cs):** `gui.cs` *must* rigorously enforce bounds checking on all input to `TextField` and `TextView` to prevent buffer overflows. This is a fundamental security requirement for these components.
    *   **Safe String Handling (within gui.cs):** `gui.cs` should use safe string handling techniques (e.g., avoiding `strcpy`, `strcat` without proper length checks) in its internal implementation.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** The `gui.cs` library should be subjected to extensive fuzz testing to identify and fix any potential vulnerabilities related to input handling.
    * **Memory Safe Language Features:** If possible, leverage features of the programming language (C#) that help prevent memory corruption, such as bounds checking on arrays and strings.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion (Targeting gui.cs)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion__targeting_gui_cs_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits weaknesses in `gui.cs`'s resource management to cause a denial of service. This is *not* about the application's logic being inefficient, but about `gui.cs` itself failing to handle large numbers of UI elements, rapid updates, or other resource-intensive operations gracefully. For example, rapidly creating and destroying thousands of `View`s might expose a memory leak or performance bottleneck *within gui.cs*.
*   **Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to `gui.cs`'s inability to handle the resource demands, preventing legitimate users from accessing it.
*   **Affected Component:** Potentially any `View`, but particularly those involved in handling large amounts of data or complex layouts (e.g., `TextView`, `ListView`, `TableView`, deeply nested `View`s). The vulnerability lies in `gui.cs`'s resource management and rendering efficiency.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Resource Limits (within gui.cs):** `gui.cs` should have internal mechanisms to limit the resources it consumes. This might involve limiting the number of nested views, the size of text buffers, or the frequency of UI updates.
    *   **Efficient Rendering (within gui.cs):** `gui.cs`'s rendering engine should be optimized to minimize CPU and memory usage. This includes techniques like damage region tracking (only redrawing the parts of the screen that have changed) and efficient data structures.
    *   **Profiling and Optimization:** The `gui.cs` library maintainers should regularly profile the library's performance to identify and address any bottlenecks.
    * **Asynchronous Operations (Consideration within gui.cs):** While primarily an application-level concern, `gui.cs` could explore providing asynchronous APIs for certain operations to help applications avoid blocking the UI thread.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Terminal History (Due to gui.cs Behavior)](./threats/information_disclosure_via_terminal_history__due_to_gui_cs_behavior_.md)

*   **Description:** While terminal history is generally an external factor, *if* `gui.cs` has features that *directly* output sensitive data to the terminal *without* providing mechanisms to control or mitigate this, it becomes a `gui.cs`-specific threat. For example, if `gui.cs` had a debugging mode that printed sensitive internal state to the console without a way to disable it, that would be a direct vulnerability. Or, if `gui.cs` *incorrectly* handled the `Secret` property of `TextField`, failing to mask the input, that would be a direct `gui.cs` issue.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys, internal application state) to unauthorized individuals through the terminal's scrollback buffer.
*   **Affected Component:** Any `View` that displays sensitive information, particularly `TextField` (if `Secret` is not handled correctly), `TextView`, `Label`. The vulnerability lies in `gui.cs`'s handling of sensitive data and its interaction with the terminal.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Correct `Secret` Implementation (within gui.cs):** `gui.cs` *must* correctly implement the `Secret` property of `TextField` to ensure that password input is masked and not stored in plain text in any internal buffers.
    *   **Controlled Debug Output (within gui.cs):** If `gui.cs` has any debugging features that output sensitive information to the terminal, these features *must* be disabled by default and require explicit, documented steps to enable.
    *   **Avoid Unnecessary Output:** `gui.cs` should avoid printing any unnecessary information to the terminal, especially anything that could be considered sensitive.
