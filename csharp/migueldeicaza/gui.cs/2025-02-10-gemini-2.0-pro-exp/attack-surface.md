# Attack Surface Analysis for migueldeicaza/gui.cs

## Attack Surface: [Input Injection (Text Fields)](./attack_surfaces/input_injection__text_fields_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers can inject malicious input into `TextField` and `Autocomplete` controls, potentially leading to various injection attacks if the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate the input before using it.
*   **How gui.cs Contributes:** `gui.cs` provides the input controls (`TextField`, `Autocomplete`) that are the *direct* entry points for this attack.  It does *not* inherently perform input validation or sanitization. This is the direct interface.
*   **Example:**  An attacker enters `../../etc/passwd` into a `TextField` used for file path input, attempting a path traversal attack.  Or, if the input is later used in a system command, they might inject shell commands.
*   **Impact:**  Data breaches, unauthorized file access, arbitrary code execution, system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:**  Critical (if user input is used in sensitive operations without validation) / High (if some validation is present but flawed).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Implement strict input validation (whitelisting preferred). Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases.  Encode output appropriately when displaying user input.  Avoid using user input directly in system commands or file paths. Sanitize `Autocomplete` suggestions if they come from untrusted sources. Set `MaxLength` property.
    *   **User:**  (Limited direct mitigation) Be cautious about entering sensitive information into applications.

## Attack Surface: [Terminal-Based "XSS" (Output Manipulation)](./attack_surfaces/terminal-based_xss__output_manipulation_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers can craft malicious input that, when displayed in `gui.cs` controls (e.g., `Label`, `TextView`), includes ANSI escape codes or other terminal control sequences.  This can manipulate the terminal output, potentially misleading the user or even triggering vulnerabilities in the terminal emulator itself.
*   **How gui.cs Contributes:** `gui.cs` controls are *directly* responsible for displaying the potentially malicious output.  The library doesn't inherently sanitize output for terminal control sequences. The display logic is within `gui.cs`.
*   **Example:**  An attacker provides input containing ANSI escape codes that clear the screen, change the text color, or reposition the cursor.  In extreme cases, vulnerabilities in the terminal emulator could allow code execution.
*   **Impact:**  User deception, potential for limited code execution (depending on terminal emulator vulnerabilities), application instability.
*   **Risk Severity:**  High (due to potential for terminal emulator exploitation).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**  *Always* encode or sanitize data from untrusted sources before displaying it in *any* `gui.cs` control.  Use a dedicated library for sanitizing terminal output.  Consider a whitelist of allowed characters/sequences.
    *   **User:**  Use a reputable and up-to-date terminal emulator.

## Attack Surface: [File System Interaction Vulnerabilities (Path Traversal, Symlink Attacks) - *via Dialogs*](./attack_surfaces/file_system_interaction_vulnerabilities__path_traversal__symlink_attacks__-_via_dialogs.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses `OpenDialog` or `SaveDialog`, attackers might exploit vulnerabilities related to file system interaction, such as path traversal or symlink attacks.
*   **How gui.cs Contributes:** `gui.cs` *directly* provides the `OpenDialog` and `SaveDialog` controls that facilitate file system interaction. The vulnerability exists because the application uses these dialogs without proper validation of the results.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses `OpenDialog` to select a file outside the intended directory (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`).
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized file access, data breaches, potential for code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Always validate the file paths returned by `OpenDialog` and `SaveDialog` *before* using them. Enforce strict access controls. Be cautious with symbolic links. Use a whitelist of allowed file extensions.
    * **User:** Be careful when selecting files using dialogs.
