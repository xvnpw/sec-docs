## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization for gui.cs Widgets](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization_for_gui_cs_widgets.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Input Validation and Sanitization for `gui.cs` Widgets
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Target `gui.cs` input widgets:** Focus on all `gui.cs` widgets that accept user input, such as `TextField`, `TextView`, `ComboBox`, and input fields within `Dialog`s.
    2.  **Leverage `gui.cs` events:** Utilize `gui.cs` events like `Changed`, `KeyPress`, `Validating`, and custom validation logic within these events to intercept and validate user input *before* it's processed by the application logic.
    3.  **Implement validation within `gui.cs` event handlers:** Write validation code directly within the event handlers of these widgets. This allows for immediate feedback to the user in the UI and prevents invalid data from propagating further.
    4.  **Sanitize input from `gui.cs` widgets:**  Even after validation, sanitize input retrieved from `gui.cs` widgets before using it in any potentially sensitive operations (e.g., constructing file paths, commands, or database queries). This is crucial as `gui.cs` itself doesn't inherently sanitize input.
    5.  **Use `gui.cs` Dialogs for controlled input:** When requiring specific input formats, utilize `gui.cs` `Dialog`s with pre-defined input fields and validation logic to guide users and enforce correct input directly within the UI flow.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Command Injection (High Severity):** If input from `gui.cs` widgets is used to construct shell commands without sanitization.
    *   **Format String Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** If input from `gui.cs` widgets is used in format strings improperly.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Terminal Context (Medium Severity):** If unsanitized input from `gui.cs` widgets is displayed in the terminal and contains malicious escape sequences.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Invalid input from `gui.cs` widgets leading to incorrect application behavior.
*   **Impact:** High Reduction for Command Injection and Format String Vulnerabilities. Medium Reduction for XSS (terminal context) and Data Integrity Issues.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Some `gui.cs` `TextField` widgets in the file manager application have basic length validation.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Consistent and comprehensive input validation and sanitization are missing across all relevant `gui.cs` widgets.  Validation logic is not consistently implemented within `gui.cs` event handlers. Sanitization of input retrieved from `gui.cs` widgets is not systematically applied.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Context-Aware Input Handling within gui.cs UI](./mitigation_strategies/context-aware_input_handling_within_gui_cs_ui.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Context-Aware Input Handling within `gui.cs` UI
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Differentiate `gui.cs` input widget contexts:**  Identify different contexts for input within the `gui.cs` application. For example, a `TextField` used for filenames has a different context than one used for search queries or configuration settings.
    2.  **Implement context-specific validation in `gui.cs` event handlers:**  Within the event handlers of `gui.cs` input widgets, implement conditional validation logic based on the context of the widget. This can be determined by the widget's purpose, name, or location in the UI.
    3.  **Use `gui.cs` widget properties to manage context:**  Leverage `gui.cs` widget properties (e.g., `Data`, `Tag`) to store context information and access it within validation logic.
    4.  **Provide context-sensitive feedback in `gui.cs` UI:**  Use `gui.cs` UI elements (e.g., `Label`s near input fields, `MessageBox`es in `Dialog`s) to provide context-sensitive error messages and guidance to the user directly within the `gui.cs` interface.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Bypassed Input Validation (Medium Severity):** Generic validation applied to all `gui.cs` input widgets might be insufficient for specific contexts.
    *   **Usability Issues Leading to Errors (Low Severity):** Inconsistent validation across different `gui.cs` input widgets can confuse users.
*   **Impact:** Medium Reduction for Bypassed Input Validation. Low Reduction for Usability Issues.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic context awareness exists in some parts of the UI, but it's not consistently enforced through `gui.cs` event handlers.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Context-aware validation logic needs to be systematically implemented within `gui.cs` event handlers for different types of input widgets and UI contexts.  `gui.cs` widget properties are not consistently used to manage context for validation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Handling Special Characters and Escape Sequences in gui.cs Display and Input](./mitigation_strategies/handling_special_characters_and_escape_sequences_in_gui_cs_display_and_input.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Handling Special Characters and Escape Sequences in `gui.cs` Display and Input
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Focus on terminal rendering via `gui.cs`:** Be aware that `gui.cs` renders to a terminal, and therefore, terminal escape sequences are relevant. Consider how user input displayed or processed by `gui.cs` might interact with terminal escape sequences.
    2.  **Escape special characters in `gui.cs` output:** When displaying user-provided text or data retrieved from external sources within `gui.cs` widgets (especially `TextView` or `Label`), consider escaping special characters that could be interpreted as terminal escape sequences. This prevents unintended formatting or potential injection issues in the terminal display.
    3.  **Sanitize input for escape sequences in `gui.cs` input widgets:** When validating input in `gui.cs` widgets, consider sanitizing or rejecting input that contains potentially harmful terminal escape sequences, especially if this input is later displayed or processed in a way that could be vulnerable.
    4.  **Utilize `gui.cs` text formatting features carefully:** If using `gui.cs`'s text formatting capabilities, ensure that user input is not inadvertently interpreted as formatting commands, leading to unexpected display or potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Terminal Escape Sequence Injection (Medium Severity):** Malicious escape sequences injected via user input displayed through `gui.cs` or processed by the application.
    *   **UI Spoofing (Low to Medium Severity):**  Escape sequences could potentially be used to spoof the `gui.cs` UI display in the terminal.
*   **Impact:** Medium Reduction for Terminal Escape Sequence Injection and UI Spoofing.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic escaping might be implicitly handled by `gui.cs` in some rendering scenarios, but explicit handling is not consistently implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Systematic escaping of special characters in `gui.cs` output, especially for user-provided text, is missing.  Input validation specifically targeting terminal escape sequences in `gui.cs` input widgets is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting User Input via gui.cs Events](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_user_input_via_gui_cs_events.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Rate Limiting User Input via `gui.cs` Events
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Target resource-intensive actions triggered by `gui.cs` events:** Identify `gui.cs` UI actions (e.g., button clicks, text input in `TextField`s, selection changes in `ListView`s) that trigger resource-intensive operations.
    2.  **Implement rate limiting within `gui.cs` event handlers:**  Introduce rate limiting logic directly within the event handlers of `gui.cs` widgets that trigger these resource-intensive actions.
    3.  **Use timers or counters within `gui.cs` application logic:**  Employ timers or counters within the `gui.cs` application's logic to track the frequency of user actions and enforce rate limits.
    4.  **Provide feedback in `gui.cs` UI for rate limits:**  If a user exceeds a rate limit, display informative messages directly in the `gui.cs` UI (e.g., using `MessageBox`es or status bars) to indicate the limit and suggest waiting before retrying.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (High Severity):** Attackers attempting to overwhelm the application by rapidly interacting with the `gui.cs` UI.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Unintentional or malicious rapid UI interactions leading to resource exhaustion.
*   **Impact:** High Reduction for DoS Attacks and Resource Exhaustion related to UI interactions.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No rate limiting is implemented within `gui.cs` event handlers or UI logic.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Rate limiting mechanisms should be implemented within `gui.cs` event handlers for resource-intensive UI actions, particularly those related to file searching or large file operations triggered through the UI.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update gui.cs Library](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_gui_cs_library.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update `gui.cs` Library
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor `gui.cs` releases:** Regularly check the `gui.cs` GitHub repository (https://github.com/migueldeicaza/gui.cs) and NuGet package feeds for new releases and security advisories.
    2.  **Apply `gui.cs` updates promptly:** When new versions of `gui.cs` are released, especially those containing security patches or bug fixes, update the application's dependency on `gui.cs` promptly.
    3.  **Test after `gui.cs` updates:** After updating `gui.cs`, thoroughly test the application to ensure compatibility and that the update hasn't introduced any regressions or broken existing functionality.
    4.  **Stay informed about `gui.cs` security issues:**  Actively seek information about known security vulnerabilities in `gui.cs` and follow recommendations from the `gui.cs` community or maintainers regarding security best practices.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in `gui.cs` (High Severity):** Outdated versions of `gui.cs` may contain known security vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit if present in the application.
*   **Impact:** High Reduction for Exploitation of Known `gui.cs` Vulnerabilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** `gui.cs` is managed as a NuGet dependency, but updates are not applied regularly or systematically.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  A process for regularly monitoring `gui.cs` releases and applying updates, especially security updates, is missing. Automated dependency checks for `gui.cs` are not in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Verify Integrity of gui.cs NuGet Package](./mitigation_strategies/verify_integrity_of_gui_cs_nuget_package.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Verify Integrity of `gui.cs` NuGet Package
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use official NuGet feed:** Obtain the `gui.cs` NuGet package from the official NuGet.org feed to ensure you are using a legitimate and trusted source.
    2.  **Enable NuGet package signature verification:** Configure NuGet to verify package signatures during installation and restore processes. This helps ensure that the `gui.cs` package hasn't been tampered with.
    3.  **Review package details:** Before installing or updating the `gui.cs` NuGet package, review the package details on NuGet.org, including the publisher, version history, and any available security information.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Medium Severity):** Using a compromised or tampered `gui.cs` NuGet package could introduce malicious code into the application.
    *   **Accidental Corruption (Low Severity):**  Download errors or corrupted NuGet packages could lead to application instability.
*   **Impact:** Medium Reduction for Supply Chain Attacks related to `gui.cs`. Low Reduction for Accidental Corruption.
*   **Currently Implemented:** NuGet is used to manage `gui.cs`, implicitly providing some level of integrity.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  NuGet package signature verification is not explicitly configured or enforced.  Manual review of `gui.cs` NuGet package details before updates is not a standard practice.
