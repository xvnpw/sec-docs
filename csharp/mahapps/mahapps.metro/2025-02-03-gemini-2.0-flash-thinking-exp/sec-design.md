# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, MahApps.Metro, provides a set of UI controls, themes, and styles for WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) applications. It aims to enable developers to create modern, visually appealing, and consistent desktop applications using WPF.

* Business priorities:
 - Enhance developer productivity by providing reusable and customizable UI components.
 - Improve the user experience of WPF applications built with MahApps.Metro by offering modern and visually appealing themes.
 - Maintain a stable and reliable UI framework that developers can depend on.
 - Foster a community around the project to encourage contributions and ensure long-term sustainability.

* Business goals:
 - Increase adoption of MahApps.Metro among WPF developers.
 - Provide a comprehensive and feature-rich UI toolkit for WPF.
 - Ensure compatibility with various WPF versions and .NET frameworks.
 - Maintain high code quality and address bug fixes and feature requests promptly.

* Most important business risks:
 - Security vulnerabilities in the framework could be inherited by applications using MahApps.Metro, leading to potential exploits in end-user applications.
 - Supply chain risks associated with dependencies and build process could compromise the integrity of the framework.
 - Lack of maintenance or community support could lead to stagnation and decreased adoption.
 - Breaking changes or instability could negatively impact developers relying on the framework.

# SECURITY POSTURE

* Security controls:
 - security control: Source code is hosted on GitHub, providing version control and transparency. (Implemented: GitHub)
 - security control: Project is open source, allowing community review and contributions, potentially leading to earlier identification of vulnerabilities. (Implemented: GitHub)
 - security control: NuGet package distribution provides a standardized and widely used mechanism for distributing and consuming the framework. (Implemented: NuGet)

* Accepted risks:
 - accepted risk: As an open-source project, there is reliance on community contributions for security reviews and vulnerability identification.
 - accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to be present in dependencies used by MahApps.Metro.
 - accepted risk: Risk of malicious contributions if contribution review process is not robust.

* Recommended security controls:
 - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in the code.
 - security control: Introduce dependency scanning to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
 - security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
 - security control: Perform regular security code reviews, especially for critical components and new features.
 - security control: Implement code signing for NuGet packages to ensure integrity and authenticity.

* Security requirements:
 - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a UI framework itself. Authentication is the responsibility of applications built using MahApps.Metro.
 - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a UI framework itself. Authorization is the responsibility of applications built using MahApps.Metro.
 - Input validation: MahApps.Metro controls should be designed to handle various inputs safely and prevent common input validation vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, injection). Input validation should primarily be implemented within the controls themselves to ensure robustness.
 - Cryptography:  MahApps.Metro itself is unlikely to require extensive cryptography. If any cryptographic operations are performed (e.g., for secure storage of settings, though unlikely in a UI framework), established and secure cryptographic libraries should be used. Applications using MahApps.Metro may require cryptography, but this is outside the scope of the framework itself.

## DEPLOYMENT

MahApps.Metro is primarily deployed as a NuGet package. Applications using MahApps.Metro will have their own deployment architectures. We will focus on the NuGet package deployment and general application deployment considerations.

Possible Deployment Architectures for Applications using MahApps.Metro:
1.  Desktop Deployment (Common for WPF applications): Applications are installed directly on user's Windows machines.
2.  Enterprise Deployment: Applications deployed within a corporate network, potentially using centralized deployment mechanisms.
3.  Cloud-based Desktop (Less common for WPF, but possible): Applications virtualized or streamed from the cloud.

We will focus on the most common scenario: Desktop Deployment.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

* Critical business process:
 - Development and distribution of MahApps.Metro framework.
 - Adoption and usage of MahApps.Metro by WPF application developers.
 - Functionality of applications built using MahApps.Metro.

* Data we are trying to protect:
 - Source code of MahApps.Metro: Sensitivity - Publicly available, but integrity and confidentiality during development are important.
 - NuGet packages: Sensitivity - Publicly available, but integrity and authenticity are critical to prevent supply chain attacks.
 - Build environment and credentials: Sensitivity - Confidential, compromise could lead to malicious package releases.

* Data sensitivity:
 - Publicly available source code and NuGet packages, but integrity and authenticity are paramount.
 - Build environment and credentials are highly sensitive and require strong protection.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

* Questions:
 - What is the process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities in MahApps.Metro? (Assumption: A process should be established and clearly documented).
 - Are there any specific security requirements or compliance standards that MahApps.Metro needs to adhere to? (Assumption: General secure development practices are sufficient for an open-source UI framework).
 - What is the process for reviewing and accepting contributions to ensure code quality and security? (Assumption: Code review process is in place, but its security focus needs to be strengthened).
 - Are there any plans to implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) and dependency scanning in the CI/CD pipeline? (Assumption: These are recommended security controls that should be considered for implementation).

* Assumptions:
 - MahApps.Metro is intended for general-purpose WPF desktop applications and does not handle highly sensitive data directly within the framework itself.
 - Security is a shared responsibility between the MahApps.Metro project and the developers using the framework in their applications.
 - The primary security concern is ensuring the integrity and security of the MahApps.Metro framework itself to prevent vulnerabilities from being inherited by consuming applications.
 - The project operates with a reasonable level of security awareness, but there is room for improvement in implementing more proactive security measures, especially in the build and release pipeline.
