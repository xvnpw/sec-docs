# Threat Model Analysis for mahapps/mahapps.metro

## Threat: [UI Injection / Cross-UI Scripting (XUIS)](./threats/ui_injection__cross-ui_scripting__xuis_.md)

Description: Attackers inject malicious code or markup into UI elements by providing crafted user input that is not properly sanitized or encoded before being displayed by MahApps.Metro components. This allows attackers to manipulate the UI, potentially execute limited scripts within the UI context, or mislead users into performing actions they didn't intend. Attackers target input fields, text display areas, or any UI element that dynamically renders user-provided content within MahApps.Metro.
*   **Impact:** UI manipulation leading to phishing attacks through UI spoofing, potential for limited client-side code execution within the UI context, information disclosure through UI manipulation, and compromised user experience.
*   **Affected MahApps.Metro Component:**  `TextBlock`, `TextBox`, `Label`, `ContentControl`, `DataGrid`, and any other MahApps.Metro components that display or render user-provided data. Data binding mechanisms within MahApps.Metro are also relevant.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Crucially sanitize and encode all user-provided data** before displaying it in MahApps.Metro UI elements. Use appropriate encoding functions for the specific UI context (e.g., HTML encoding if rendering HTML-like content).
    *   Implement robust input validation to strictly control the types of characters and data allowed in user inputs processed by MahApps.Metro components.
    *   Avoid dynamically constructing UI elements based on raw user input when using MahApps.Metro. If dynamic UI generation is necessary, use parameterized UI construction methods and carefully validate inputs.
    *   Conduct regular code reviews specifically focused on user input handling and UI rendering within MahApps.Metro components to identify and remediate potential injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through UI Elements or Debug Features](./threats/information_disclosure_through_ui_elements_or_debug_features.md)

Description: Attackers observe or extract sensitive information that is unintentionally exposed through UI elements of MahApps.Metro. This occurs when developers mistakenly display sensitive data directly in MahApps.Metro UI components without proper masking or redaction. Attackers can directly observe the UI, potentially capture screenshots, or use UI automation tools to extract displayed information.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data (credentials, personal information, business secrets) directly through the application's UI, leading to privacy violations, reputational damage, and potential legal repercussions.
*   **Affected MahApps.Metro Component:** `TextBlock`, `TextBox`, `Label`, `Flyout`, `Dialog`, and any MahApps.Metro component used to display data to the user.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never display sensitive information directly in MahApps.Metro UI elements without explicit and strong justification.**
    *   Implement mandatory masking, redaction, or placeholders for sensitive data displayed in the UI. Ensure sensitive data is never visible in its raw form.
    *   Enforce strict access control and authorization mechanisms within the application to limit access to sensitive information in the backend, thus reducing the risk of it being displayed in the UI in the first place.
    *   Conduct thorough security reviews of the UI design and data display logic to identify and eliminate any unintentional exposure of sensitive information through MahApps.Metro components.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks](./threats/supply_chain_attacks.md)

Description: Attackers compromise the official MahApps.Metro NuGet package or its distribution channels (NuGet.org). By injecting malicious code into a compromised package, attackers can distribute malware or backdoors to applications that depend on MahApps.Metro. This results in widespread compromise as developers unknowingly include the malicious MahApps.Metro package in their applications.
*   **Impact:** Widespread application compromise affecting all applications using the compromised MahApps.Metro package, potential for large-scale malware distribution, data breaches across numerous applications, and severe loss of trust in the .NET software supply chain and MahApps.Metro.
*   **Affected MahApps.Metro Component:** The entire MahApps.Metro NuGet package and consequently, any application that includes and utilizes the compromised package.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always use official and trusted NuGet package sources (NuGet.org) for obtaining MahApps.Metro.**
    *   Implement and utilize Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to continuously monitor project dependencies, including MahApps.Metro, for known vulnerabilities and potential supply chain risks.
    *   While NuGet package verification is largely automated by the NuGet client, stay informed about any security advisories related to NuGet and the .NET ecosystem that might indicate supply chain compromise.
    *   Consider using private NuGet package repositories for enhanced control over dependencies, especially in highly sensitive environments. This allows for internal vetting and mirroring of packages.
    *   Incorporate regular security audits of the application's dependency chain, including MahApps.Metro, to proactively identify and mitigate potential supply chain vulnerabilities.
