# Threat Model Analysis for mahapps/mahapps.metro

## Threat: [Malicious Theme Loading](./threats/malicious_theme_loading.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could trick a user into loading a specially crafted theme file. This malicious theme could contain XAML that, when parsed and rendered by WPF *through MahApps.Metro*, could trigger unexpected behavior, potentially leading to resource exhaustion or even the execution of arbitrary code within the application's context. The attacker might achieve this through social engineering, offering "custom themes" or by compromising a source of themes. The direct involvement of MahApps.Metro lies in its reliance on WPF's theming mechanism and how it applies styles and resources.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (application crash or unresponsiveness), potential for arbitrary code execution if the malicious XAML exploits a WPF vulnerability, UI disruption or misrepresentation.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ThemeManager` within MahApps.Metro, XAML parsing and rendering as utilized by MahApps.Metro's styles and templates.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict the ability for users to load arbitrary theme files.
        *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of theme files before loading them.
        *   Load themes from trusted sources only.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed environment or limited permissions when loading external theme files.
        *   Regularly update MahApps.Metro to benefit from any security patches related to theme handling.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Custom Controls](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_custom_controls.md)

*   **Description:** MahApps.Metro provides a variety of custom controls. An attacker could provide unexpected or malicious input to *these specific controls*, exploiting potential vulnerabilities in their implementation. This could lead to application crashes, unexpected behavior, or potentially even memory corruption if the control has underlying flaws. The attacker interacts directly with the MahApps.Metro provided controls.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (application crash), unexpected application behavior, potential for information disclosure or arbitrary code execution depending on the nature of the vulnerability within the MahApps.Metro control.
    *   **Affected Component:** Specific custom controls *provided by MahApps.Metro* (e.g., `MetroButton`, `Flyout`, `Dialog`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potential for arbitrary code execution depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep MahApps.Metro updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in its controls.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the application when interacting with MahApps.Metro controls.
        *   Perform thorough testing of application functionality involving MahApps.Metro controls, including edge cases and unexpected inputs.
        *   Consider code reviews focusing on the implementation of MahApps.Metro controls within the application.
