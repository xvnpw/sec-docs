# Attack Surface Analysis for mahapps/mahapps.metro

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Themes/Styles (XAML Injection)](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_themesstyles__xaml_injection_.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious XAML code into theme files or dynamically loaded styles. This injected code can execute arbitrary commands within the application's context.

**How MahApps.Metro Contributes:** MahApps.Metro relies heavily on XAML for styling and theming. If the application allows loading themes from untrusted sources or doesn't properly sanitize style definitions, it becomes vulnerable.

**Example:** An attacker provides a custom theme file containing XAML that launches a process or modifies local files when the application loads the theme.

**Impact:** Critical - Can lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or complete compromise of the application and potentially the user's system.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure Theme Loading: Only load themes from trusted and verified sources.
* Input Sanitization:  If allowing any form of user-provided styling, rigorously sanitize the input to prevent XAML injection.
* Content Security Policy (CSP) for Desktop (if applicable): Explore if any desktop CSP-like mechanisms can be applied to restrict XAML execution.
* Code Reviews: Carefully review code that handles theme loading and application of styles.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Themes](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_via_malicious_themes.md)

**Description:** Attackers craft themes with highly complex or numerous visual elements, causing excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory) and leading to application unresponsiveness or crashes (Denial of Service).

**How MahApps.Metro Contributes:** The extensive styling capabilities of MahApps.Metro, while powerful, can be abused to create resource-intensive themes.

**Example:** A theme with thousands of intricate visual elements or animations that overload the rendering engine when applied.

**Impact:** High - Can lead to application unavailability, data loss due to crashes, and a negative user experience.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Theme Complexity Limits: Implement limits on the complexity and size of loaded themes.
* Resource Monitoring: Monitor application resource usage when applying themes and potentially block overly resource-intensive ones.
* Default Theme Robustness: Ensure the default theme is lightweight and resilient to prevent accidental resource exhaustion.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Custom MahApps.Metro Controls](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_custom_mahapps_metro_controls.md)

**Description:** Security flaws exist within the specific custom controls provided by MahApps.Metro (e.g., `Flyout`, `MetroWindow` features, date pickers, etc.). These vulnerabilities can be exploited to bypass security measures or cause unexpected behavior.

**How MahApps.Metro Contributes:** MahApps.Metro introduces its own set of UI controls with specific functionalities. Bugs or oversights in the implementation of these controls can create vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A vulnerability in the `Flyout` control allows an attacker to bypass access restrictions or trigger unintended actions when interacting with it.

**Impact:** Medium to High -  Impact depends on the specific vulnerability and the functionality of the affected control. Could lead to information disclosure, unauthorized actions, or application crashes.

**Risk Severity:** High (assuming potential for significant impact based on control functionality)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep MahApps.Metro Updated: Regularly update to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
* Monitor Security Advisories: Stay informed about reported vulnerabilities in MahApps.Metro.
* Input Validation for Control Inputs: If MahApps.Metro controls accept user input, implement robust input validation to prevent unexpected behavior or exploits.
