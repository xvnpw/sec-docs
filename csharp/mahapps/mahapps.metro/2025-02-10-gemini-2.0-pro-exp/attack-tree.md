## Attack Tree Path: [1. UI Manipulation / Redirection](./attack_tree_paths/1__ui_manipulation__redirection.md)

*   **1.1 Exploit Custom Control Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in how MahApps.Metro custom controls (like `NumericUpDown`, `TextBox`, `ComboBox`, etc.) handle user input. This is a high-risk area because custom controls often have complex internal logic and may not have been as thoroughly vetted for security vulnerabilities as standard .NET controls.
    *   **1.1.1 Input Validation Bypass in Custom Controls [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** Attackers attempt to provide input that violates the expected format, type, or range of the control.
        *   **1.1.1.1 Inject unexpected data types:**
            *   *Example:*  Trying to enter text into a `NumericUpDown` control, or injecting special characters into a field that expects only alphanumeric input.
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium
            *   *Impact:* Medium to High (depending on how the application uses the input)
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Novice to Intermediate
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
        *   **1.1.1.2 Overflow/Underflow numeric limits:**
            *   *Example:*  Entering a number larger than the maximum allowed value or smaller than the minimum allowed value in a `NumericUpDown` control.
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium
            *   *Impact:* Medium to High (could cause crashes or unexpected behavior)
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
        *   **1.1.1.3 Bypass length restrictions:**
            *   *Example:*  Entering a string longer than the maximum allowed length in a `TextBox` control.
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium
            *   *Impact:* Medium (could lead to data truncation or, rarely, buffer overflows)
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Novice to Intermediate
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium

*   **1.2 Theme/Style Manipulation**
    *   **1.2.1 Inject Malicious XAML via Theme Resources [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  Attackers attempt to inject malicious XAML code into the application's theme resources. This is a critical vulnerability because successful XAML injection can often lead to arbitrary code execution.
        *   **1.2.1.1 Override default styles with malicious code:**
            *   *Example:*  Modifying a XAML resource dictionary to include an event handler that executes arbitrary code when a control is rendered.
            *   *Likelihood:* Low (requires the ability to modify theme resources)
            *   *Impact:* High to Very High (potential for code execution)
            *   *Effort:* Medium to High
            *   *Skill Level:* Advanced
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Hard
        *   **1.2.1.2 Load external XAML resources containing malicious code:**
            *   *Example:*  Tricking the application into loading a XAML file from an untrusted source (e.g., a network share or a website) that contains malicious code.
            *   *Likelihood:* Low (requires the application to load external XAML)
            *   *Impact:* High to Very High (potential for code execution)
            *   *Effort:* Medium
            *   *Skill Level:* Advanced
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Denial of Service (DoS) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__denial_of_service__dos___high_risk_.md)

*   **2.1 Resource Exhaustion via UI Elements [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers attempt to make the application unresponsive by consuming excessive system resources (CPU, memory) through the UI.
    *   **2.1.1 Trigger excessive rendering of complex controls:**
        *   *Example:*  Rapidly opening and closing nested Flyouts, or creating a large number of complex controls dynamically.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* Medium (application becomes unresponsive)
        *   *Effort:* Low to Medium
        *   *Skill Level:* Novice to Intermediate
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Code Execution (Less Likely, but Possible) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3__code_execution__less_likely__but_possible___critical_.md)

*   **3.1 XAML Injection Leading to Code Execution [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:**  This is the most severe type of vulnerability.  If an attacker can inject arbitrary XAML, they can often execute arbitrary code within the application's context.
    *   **3.1.1 If custom controls or theme resources allow for the injection of XAML...**
        *   *Example:*  Exploiting a vulnerability in a custom control that allows the attacker to inject XAML containing a `Button` with a `Click` event handler that executes a malicious script.
        *   *Likelihood:* Very Low
        *   *Impact:* Very High (complete system compromise)
        *   *Effort:* High
        *   *Skill Level:* Expert
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Very Hard

*   **3.2 Exploit Vulnerabilities in Underlying .NET Framework via MahApps.Metro [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** MahApps.Metro, being built on the .NET Framework, might inadvertently expose or trigger vulnerabilities within the framework itself.
    *   **3.2.1 If MahApps.Metro interacts with .NET Framework components in an insecure way...**
        *   *Example:* MahApps.Metro might use a .NET Framework API in a way that is vulnerable to a known exploit, even if MahApps.Metro itself is not directly vulnerable.
        *   *Likelihood:* Very Low
        *   *Impact:* Very High (potential for system compromise)
        *   *Effort:* Very High
        *   *Skill Level:* Expert
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Very Hard
