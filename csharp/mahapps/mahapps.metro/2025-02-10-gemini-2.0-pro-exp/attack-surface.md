# Attack Surface Analysis for mahapps/mahapps.metro

## Attack Surface: [1. Flyout Content Injection](./attack_surfaces/1__flyout_content_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Injecting malicious content into MahApps.Metro Flyouts, particularly if the Flyout's content is loaded dynamically from an untrusted source.
*   **MahApps.Metro Contribution:**  Flyouts are a *core and prominent feature* of MahApps.Metro, providing a specific mechanism for displaying content.  This *direct* involvement makes it a key attack surface. The library itself does not perform sanitization; it's entirely the developer's responsibility.
*   **Example:**  An application loads Flyout content from a remote server without proper sanitization.  An attacker compromises the server and injects malicious JavaScript into the Flyout content, leading to XSS when a user opens the Flyout.
*   **Impact:**  XSS, phishing, data theft, potentially leading to further compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:**  High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Sanitize *all* content loaded into Flyouts, *especially* if it comes from external sources.  Treat Flyout content with the *same* level of security scrutiny as any other user-facing control.  Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) if applicable, and consider restricting the capabilities of scripts within the Flyout.  Validate data types and structure rigorously.
    *   **Users:**  (Limited direct mitigation).  Be wary of applications that load Flyout content from unfamiliar or untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [2. Input Validation Bypass (Control Level - *Specific Cases*)](./attack_surfaces/2__input_validation_bypass__control_level_-_specific_cases_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting weaknesses in input validation within *specific* MahApps.Metro-styled controls where the visual styling or control behavior *might* mislead developers into overlooking standard validation. This is *not* about *all* controls, but about cases where MahApps.Metro's features could contribute to the oversight.
*   **MahApps.Metro Contribution:** While MahApps.Metro doesn't *remove* the need for validation, the enhanced appearance and features of certain controls (e.g., `NumericUpDown` with custom formatting, `DatePicker` with culture-specific handling) could create a *higher risk* of developer error if standard WPF validation practices are not meticulously followed. The *direct* contribution is the potential for misinterpreting the control's capabilities.
*   **Example:**
    *   A `NumericUpDown` control is styled to accept currency symbols.  The developer assumes the control handles currency validation, but it only handles basic numeric input.  An attacker injects a malicious string that bypasses the numeric check but is then used in a database query.
    *   A `DatePicker` is used with a custom culture setting. The developer doesn't fully account for all possible date formats allowed by that culture, leading to a parsing error that can be exploited.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, code execution (in the case of XSS, if the control's output is displayed unsanitized), denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation using WPF's built-in validation mechanisms (`IDataErrorInfo`, `ValidationRules`) *regardless* of the MahApps.Metro control's appearance or features.  Do *not* rely on the control's visual styling to imply any level of built-in security.  Use regular expressions and explicit type checks.  *Always* parameterize SQL queries. Sanitize output. Understand the specific validation requirements of *each* control type, including culture-specific considerations.
    *   **Users:** (Limited direct mitigation). Be cautious about entering unusual characters.

## Attack Surface: [3. Dependency Vulnerabilities (Direct MahApps.Metro Vulnerabilities)](./attack_surfaces/3__dependency_vulnerabilities__direct_mahapps_metro_vulnerabilities_.md)

*    **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities *directly within* the MahApps.Metro library itself. This excludes vulnerabilities in *other* libraries that MahApps.Metro depends on.
*    **MahApps.Metro Contribution:** This is a *direct* attack surface because the vulnerability resides within the MahApps.Metro code.
*    **Example:** A hypothetical vulnerability is discovered in MahApps.Metro's Flyout handling that allows an attacker to bypass intended security restrictions and inject arbitrary code.
*    **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but could range from denial-of-service to code execution *within the context of the application*.
*    **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability).
*    **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *    **Developers:** Keep MahApps.Metro updated to the *latest stable version*. Monitor the official MahApps.Metro GitHub repository and security advisories for any reported vulnerabilities. Consider using a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to specifically track vulnerabilities in MahApps.Metro.
    *    **Users:** Install application updates promptly, especially those that mention security fixes.
