# Threat Model Analysis for mahapps/mahapps.metro

## Threat: [XAML Injection in Dynamic UI Generation (MahApps.Metro Context)](./threats/xaml_injection_in_dynamic_ui_generation__mahapps_metro_context_.md)

*   **Threat:** XAML Injection in Dynamic UI Generation (MahApps.Metro Context)

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides malicious input that is used to dynamically generate XAML *specifically related to MahApps.Metro controls or styles*. This is a more focused version of the previous XAML injection threat, emphasizing the MahApps.Metro aspect. For example, an attacker might inject code that modifies a `MetroWindow`'s template or a `DataGrid`'s column definitions.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the application's context, potentially leading to data exfiltration, system compromise, or denial of service. The attacker could manipulate the UI to phish users, hide malicious controls, or disrupt the application's functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any scenario where MahApps.Metro-specific XAML (control templates, styles, resource dictionaries) is dynamically generated from user input. This is a *usage pattern* rather than a single control, but it *directly* involves how MahApps.Metro is used. Examples include:
        *   Dynamically creating `Style` objects based on user input.
        *   Loading custom `ControlTemplate` instances for MahApps.Metro controls from untrusted sources.
        *   Modifying `ResourceDictionary` entries at runtime based on user input.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Dynamic MahApps.Metro XAML from Untrusted Input:** The primary mitigation is to *strictly avoid* constructing MahApps.Metro-specific XAML (styles, templates, resource dictionaries) directly from user input. Use predefined styles and templates whenever possible.
        *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** If dynamic generation is absolutely unavoidable, *rigorously* validate and sanitize *all* user input before incorporating it into the XAML. Use whitelisting of allowed characters and patterns. Consider using an XML encoder to escape potentially dangerous characters.  This is *extremely* difficult to do correctly and securely.
        *   **Parameterized XAML (if feasible):** Explore the possibility of a parameterized approach, where user input is treated as data and inserted into placeholders within a predefined XAML template. This is a complex approach and may not be feasible in all cases.
        *   **Code Reviews:**  Mandatory, thorough code reviews of *any* code that dynamically generates MahApps.Metro-related XAML.

## Threat: [Data Binding Exploitation in `DataGrid` (MahApps.Metro Specifics)](./threats/data_binding_exploitation_in__datagrid___mahapps_metro_specifics_.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Binding Exploitation in `DataGrid` (MahApps.Metro Specifics)

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how the MahApps.Metro `DataGrid` handles data binding, *specifically targeting features or behaviors unique to the MahApps.Metro implementation*. This could involve exploiting custom styling, event handling, or data formatting features provided by MahApps.Metro. The attacker might try to inject malicious data that triggers unexpected behavior in the `DataGrid`'s rendering or data processing logic.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (viewing unauthorized data), data modification (altering data displayed in the grid, potentially leading to incorrect application behavior), or denial of service (crashing the application by providing malformed data that interacts poorly with MahApps.Metro's `DataGrid` customizations).
    *   **Affected Component:** `DataGrid` control (specifically, the MahApps.Metro-styled `DataGrid`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Data Validation (Object Level):** Implement robust data validation on the objects bound to the `DataGrid`. Use data annotations, validation rules, or custom validation logic to ensure data integrity *before* it reaches the `DataGrid`.
        *   **Secure Data Source:** Ensure the data source itself is secure and that the application has appropriate access controls.
        *   **Read-Only Mode (When Appropriate):** If users should not modify data, use the `DataGrid`'s `IsReadOnly="True"` property or disable editing on individual columns.
        *   **MahApps.Metro-Specific Event Handling Review:** Carefully review any event handlers associated with the MahApps.Metro `DataGrid` (e.g., custom event handlers for styling or data formatting) to ensure they handle user input and data manipulation securely. Pay close attention to any custom logic that interacts with MahApps.Metro's styling or data presentation features.
        * **Input validation on cell level:** Validate input on cell level, before it is processed by DataGrid.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerability within a *MahApps.Metro* Control (Hypothetical)](./threats/deserialization_vulnerability_within_a_mahapps_metro_control__hypothetical_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Deserialization Vulnerability within a *MahApps.Metro* Control (Hypothetical)

    *   **Description:**  This is a *hypothetical* threat, as no currently known deserialization vulnerabilities exist in *core* MahApps.Metro controls.  However, it's included for completeness.  The threat would be that a *future* version of MahApps.Metro, or a *custom control inheriting from a MahApps.Metro control*, introduces a deserialization vulnerability. An attacker could provide a crafted serialized object that, when deserialized by the control, executes malicious code.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Hypothetically, *any* MahApps.Metro control that *could* be involved in deserialization, or a custom control inheriting from a MahApps.Metro control that performs deserialization. This is highly unlikely in the core library, but more plausible in custom extensions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Deserialization in Controls:**  As a general principle, avoid performing deserialization of untrusted data within UI controls. Deserialization should ideally be handled in separate data access or business logic layers.
        *   **If Unavoidable, Use Safe Deserialization Practices:** If deserialization *must* occur within a control (or a custom control inheriting from MahApps.Metro), use a secure deserialization library and implement strict type filtering. This is a high-risk operation and should be avoided if at all possible.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits, including penetration testing, to identify any potential deserialization vulnerabilities.
        * **Stay Updated:** Keep MahApps.Metro updated to the latest version.
