## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Memory Corruption in WASM Runtime (Uno Specific) [HIGH_RISK_PATH] [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_memory_corruption_in_wasm_runtime__uno_specific___high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or use-after-free errors within the WebAssembly (WASM) runtime environment as utilized by the Uno Platform. This could involve crafting specific inputs or interactions that trigger these memory errors, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the client-side.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Successful exploitation can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the application's context, potentially gaining full control of the client-side environment and accessing sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SkiaSharp Memory Corruption via Uno's Graphics Abstraction [HIGH_RISK_PATH] [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_skiasharp_memory_corruption_via_uno's_graphics_abstraction__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  For platforms using SkiaSharp for rendering, attackers can attempt to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities within the SkiaSharp library as integrated with Uno. This might involve sending malicious image data or crafting specific drawing instructions that trigger memory errors, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Successful exploitation can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the application's rendering process, potentially gaining control of the client-side environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Data Binding Expressions [HIGH_RISK_PATH] [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_data_binding_expressions__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to inject malicious code snippets into data binding expressions used within the Uno application. If user-provided or external data is not properly sanitized before being used in data binding, it could be interpreted as executable code, leading to code injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** High - Successful injection can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the application's context, potentially accessing sensitive data or manipulating application logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Data Stored Insecurely by Uno's Local Storage Abstraction [HIGH_RISK_PATH] [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_data_stored_insecurely_by_uno's_local_storage_abstraction__high_risk_path___critica_bd7cd060.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the Uno application stores sensitive data using the platform's local storage mechanisms without proper encryption or protection, attackers can directly access this data. This could involve using browser developer tools or other means to inspect the local storage.
*   **Impact:** High -  Sensitive data stored insecurely can be directly accessed, leading to confidentiality breaches and potential misuse of user information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept or Tamper with Communication Between Uno and Native Code [HIGH_RISK_PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_or_tamper_with_communication_between_uno_and_native_code__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Uno applications often need to communicate with native platform features. Attackers might try to intercept or tamper with this communication channel, potentially modifying data being exchanged or injecting malicious commands.
*   **Impact:** High -  Tampering with communication can lead to data corruption, unauthorized actions, or the execution of malicious code within the native context.
        *   **Exploit Weaknesses in Uno's Platform Channel Implementation [CRITICAL_NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** This focuses on exploiting specific vulnerabilities or weaknesses in how the Uno Platform implements the communication channel between its managed code and the underlying native platform.
            *   **Impact:** Critical - Successful exploitation could allow for complete control over the communication channel, enabling arbitrary command execution or data manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Privilege Escalation via Uno's Native Feature Access [HIGH_RISK_PATH] [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_privilege_escalation_via_uno's_native_feature_access__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the Uno application has access to native platform APIs, attackers might try to abuse these APIs to gain elevated privileges beyond what the application is normally authorized to do. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the native APIs themselves or in how Uno interacts with them.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Successful privilege escalation can allow the attacker to gain control over the underlying operating system or access resources normally restricted to higher privilege levels.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Uno's Backend Interactions [HIGH_RISK_PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_uno's_backend_interactions__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the Uno application, particularly in server-side rendering scenarios, makes requests to backend resources based on user-controlled input, attackers might be able to manipulate these requests to target internal servers or external resources that should not be accessible.
*   **Impact:** High - Successful SSRF can allow attackers to access internal systems, read sensitive data, or perform actions on behalf of the server.
        *   **Manipulate Uno's Backend Requests to Access Internal Resources [CRITICAL_NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** This is the specific action of crafting malicious requests through the Uno application to target internal infrastructure.
            *   **Impact:** Critical - Accessing internal resources can lead to data breaches, service disruption, or further compromise of the backend environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) via Uno Client Requests [HIGH_RISK_PATH] [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_direct_object_references__idor__via_uno_client_requests__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the Uno client application sends requests to the backend API that directly reference internal objects (e.g., database IDs) without proper authorization checks, attackers can manipulate these references to access resources belonging to other users or entities.
*   **Impact:** High - Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality belonging to other users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Broken Authentication/Authorization due to Uno Client Implementation [HIGH_RISK_PATH] [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/broken_authenticationauthorization_due_to_uno_client_implementation__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Flaws in how the Uno client application handles authentication or authorization can allow attackers to bypass security checks on the backend. This could involve manipulating authentication tokens or exploiting logic errors in the client's authorization flow.
*   **Impact:** High - Attackers can impersonate legitimate users or gain access to resources they are not authorized to access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Libraries Used by Uno for Backend Communication [HIGH_RISK_PATH] [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_known_vulnerabilities_in_libraries_used_by_uno_for_backend_communication__high_risk_path____7076984a.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Uno applications often use third-party libraries for communicating with the backend. Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in these libraries if they are not kept up-to-date.
*   **Impact:** High - Exploiting vulnerabilities in communication libraries can lead to various forms of compromise, including data breaches, remote code execution, or denial of service.
