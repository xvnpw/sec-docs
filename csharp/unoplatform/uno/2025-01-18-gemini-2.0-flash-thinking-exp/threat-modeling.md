# Threat Model Analysis for unoplatform/uno

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the Uno Framework Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the_uno_framework_itself.md)

**Description:** Bugs or security flaws within the Uno Platform codebase itself could be exploited by attackers. This could include vulnerabilities in XAML parsing, the rendering engine, or the platform abstraction layers. An attacker could craft specific XAML or trigger certain application states to exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution on the target device, denial of service affecting the application, or information disclosure by bypassing security checks within the framework. This would affect all applications using the vulnerable version of Uno.

**Affected Uno Component:** Core Uno libraries, XAML parser, rendering engine, platform abstraction layers.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the Uno Platform updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
*   Monitor Uno Platform release notes and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities.
*   Implement input sanitization even for data that is seemingly internal to the application, as it might interact with vulnerable Uno components.
*   Report any discovered vulnerabilities to the Uno Platform team through their established channels.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation Through Native Code Interaction (Due to Uno's Interop)](./threats/privilege_escalation_through_native_code_interaction__due_to_uno's_interop_.md)

**Description:** If the Uno application interacts with native code through Uno's provided mechanisms (e.g., custom renderers, effects, or platform-specific implementations within Uno itself), vulnerabilities in how Uno handles this interop could allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges on the target device. This could involve exploiting weaknesses in how Uno marshals data or manages the execution context between managed and native code.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the device, access to sensitive system resources, and the ability to perform unauthorized actions. This is a critical threat as it bypasses the security sandbox of the managed environment.

**Affected Uno Component:** Custom renderers, effects system, platform-specific implementations within Uno, native interop bridge.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review and audit the Uno Platform's native interop code for security vulnerabilities.
*   Minimize the surface area of native code interaction.
*   Implement strict security boundaries and validation when passing data between managed and native code within Uno.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when Uno interacts with native platform APIs.

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection During Build Process (Impacting Uno Projects)](./threats/malicious_code_injection_during_build_process__impacting_uno_projects_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could compromise the build environment or dependencies specifically used by Uno projects (e.g., Uno.UI NuGet packages, Uno build tasks) to inject malicious code into the final application packages for different platforms. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the Uno build tooling or its dependencies.

**Impact:** Distribution of compromised applications built with Uno, leading to device compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities affecting users of applications built with the compromised Uno tooling.

**Affected Uno Component:** Build pipeline, Uno-specific NuGet packages, Uno build tasks and tooling.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the build environment and infrastructure used for Uno projects.
*   Use trusted and verified sources for Uno Platform NuGet packages and build tools.
*   Implement integrity checks for build artifacts generated by the Uno build process.
*   Regularly scan the build environment for malware and vulnerabilities in Uno-related dependencies.

## Threat: [Platform-Specific Vulnerabilities Exposed Through Abstraction (in Uno)](./threats/platform-specific_vulnerabilities_exposed_through_abstraction__in_uno_.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities inherent in the underlying native UI frameworks (e.g., UIKit on iOS, Android SDK) might be indirectly exploitable through the Uno abstraction layer if Uno doesn't properly sanitize or handle inputs/outputs when translating XAML or handling events. An attacker could craft specific UI interactions or data that trigger these underlying platform vulnerabilities through the Uno abstraction.

**Impact:** Exploitation of platform-specific vulnerabilities leading to potential remote code execution, privilege escalation, or denial of service on specific platforms where the Uno application is running.

**Affected Uno Component:** UI rendering engine, platform-specific renderers within Uno, event handling mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   The Uno Platform team should rigorously test the abstraction layer for potential exposure of underlying platform vulnerabilities.
*   Keep the Uno Platform updated to benefit from any fixes or mitigations implemented by the Uno team.
*   Developers should be aware of potential platform-specific behaviors and test thoroughly on all target platforms.

## Threat: [Insecure Application Update Process (Custom Updates Bypassing Platform Stores, Potentially Due to Uno Features)](./threats/insecure_application_update_process__custom_updates_bypassing_platform_stores__potentially_due_to_un_a1046479.md)

**Description:** If the application uses a custom update mechanism (not relying solely on platform app stores), and this mechanism interacts with Uno features or libraries in an insecure way, attackers could distribute malicious updates. This could involve vulnerabilities in how Uno handles network requests or file operations related to updates.

**Impact:** Installation of compromised application versions, leading to device compromise and data theft. This is a high risk as it bypasses the security checks of official app stores.

**Affected Uno Component:** Potentially network communication libraries within Uno, file system access within Uno, custom update logic interacting with Uno components.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize platform-provided update mechanisms whenever possible.
*   If a custom update mechanism is necessary, ensure it uses secure communication channels (HTTPS) and robust signature verification, independent of Uno's core functionalities.
*   Carefully audit any interaction between the custom update mechanism and Uno Platform features.
