# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for unoplatform/uno

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Uno Platform and Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_uno_platform_and_dependencies.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update Uno Platform and Dependencies
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Uno Platform Dependency Management:**  Specifically track the version of the Uno Platform SDK and Uno-related NuGet packages used in the project. Utilize NuGet Package Manager for managing these dependencies.
    2.  **Monitor Uno Platform Releases:** Subscribe to official Uno Platform release channels (e.g., GitHub releases, blog, mailing lists) and security advisories *specifically from the Uno Platform team*.  Pay close attention to announcements regarding security patches or updates for the Uno Platform itself.
    3.  **Schedule Regular Uno Updates:** Incorporate Uno Platform updates into your development cycle. Schedule regular reviews (e.g., aligned with Uno Platform release cycles) to check for and apply updates to the Uno Platform SDK and related NuGet packages.
    4.  **Test Uno Updates Thoroughly:** Before deploying updates to production, thoroughly test them in a staging or testing environment to ensure compatibility with your Uno application and prevent regressions *specifically related to Uno Platform functionality*.
    5.  **Automate Uno Dependency Scanning (Optional):** Consider integrating automated dependency scanning tools into your CI/CD pipeline to specifically identify outdated or vulnerable *Uno Platform related* packages.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Uno Platform Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated Uno Platform versions may contain known vulnerabilities within the framework itself.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Uno Platform Vulnerabilities (High Reduction):**  Significantly reduces the risk by patching known vulnerabilities in the Uno Platform promptly.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. We are using NuGet Package Manager and generally update Uno packages when new features are needed, but we don't have a formal scheduled update process specifically for Uno or automated scanning focused on Uno packages.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal scheduled Uno Platform dependency update reviews aligned with Uno release cycles.
    *   Subscription to official Uno Platform security advisories.
    *   Automated dependency scanning in CI/CD pipeline specifically targeting Uno Platform packages.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Client-Side Logic (WASM/JavaScript) - *Uno Specific Focus*](./mitigation_strategies/secure_client-side_logic__wasmjavascript__-_uno_specific_focus.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Client-Side Logic (WASM/JavaScript) - Uno Specific Focus
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Uno Client-Side Code Review:** Conduct code reviews of the C# code that compiles to WASM or JavaScript via Uno, specifically looking for sensitive logic that might be exposed on the client-side *due to Uno's client-side execution model*.
    2.  **Minimize Sensitive Logic in Uno Client:** Design your Uno application architecture to minimize the amount of sensitive business logic, algorithms, or data handling performed in the Uno client-side code. Leverage server-side APIs for critical operations *to reduce the attack surface exposed by the Uno client*.
    3.  **Server-Side Validation for Uno Inputs:** Ensure all user inputs and data originating from the Uno client application are rigorously validated and sanitized on the server-side. Do not rely solely on client-side validation implemented within the Uno application *as client-side code can be bypassed*.
    4.  **Uno Client-Side Obfuscation (Cautiously):** For remaining sensitive client-side logic within the Uno application that cannot be moved to the server, consider code obfuscation techniques *specifically for the compiled WASM/JavaScript output of the Uno application*. Use obfuscation as a defense-in-depth measure, not a primary security control.
    5.  **Secure Uno Client-Side Storage (if used):** If client-side storage (e.g., LocalStorage, Cookies) is necessary within the Uno application for sensitive data, encrypt the data before storing it *within the Uno client context*.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Reverse Engineering of Uno Business Logic (Medium Severity):** Attackers can analyze the compiled WASM/JavaScript output of the Uno application to understand application logic and potentially find vulnerabilities or bypass security measures *specific to the client-side Uno implementation*.
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Data in Uno Client-Side Code (High Severity):** Accidental or intentional inclusion of secrets, API keys, or sensitive data in the C# code compiled by Uno to the client can lead to direct compromise *due to the client-side nature of Uno WASM/JavaScript applications*.
    *   **Client-Side Data Tampering in Uno Application (Medium Severity):** Attackers can manipulate the client-side code or data of the Uno application to bypass validation or alter application behavior *within the client-side Uno context*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Reverse Engineering of Uno Business Logic (Medium Reduction):** Obfuscation provides some reduction, moving logic to server provides significant reduction.
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Data in Uno Client-Side Code (High Reduction):** Moving sensitive data handling to the server eliminates client-side exposure within the Uno application. Encryption reduces risk for stored data.
    *   **Client-Side Data Tampering in Uno Application (High Reduction):** Server-side validation makes client-side tampering ineffective for critical operations originating from the Uno client.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. We perform server-side validation for most critical inputs originating from the Uno application. We are aware of client-side logic exposure in Uno but haven't systematically reviewed and moved logic to the server or implemented obfuscation specifically for the Uno client output. Client-side storage within Uno is currently not used for sensitive data.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Systematic review and refactoring of Uno client-side logic to minimize sensitive operations.
    *   Implementation of code obfuscation specifically for the WASM/JavaScript output of the Uno application.
    *   Formal guidelines and training for developers on minimizing client-side logic exposure in Uno applications.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of Uno Platform Controls and Libraries](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_uno_platform_controls_and_libraries.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Handling of Uno Platform Controls and Libraries
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Prioritize Official Uno Controls:** Primarily use official Uno Platform controls and libraries provided by the Uno Platform team. These are designed to be secure within the Uno framework and are actively maintained.
    2.  **Third-Party Uno Library Vetting:** If using third-party Uno Platform libraries or components, carefully vet them for security *within the Uno context*. Check the library's reputation, maintenance status, community activity, and any reported vulnerabilities *specifically related to Uno Platform usage*. Prefer libraries from trusted sources within the Uno community.
    3.  **Security Review of Custom Uno Controls:** If developing custom Uno Platform controls, conduct thorough security reviews of the control's code, especially if it handles user input, data, or interacts with platform APIs *through the Uno Platform*. Follow secure coding practices when developing custom Uno controls.
    4.  **Regular Uno Library Updates:** Keep all Uno Platform libraries, third-party Uno components, and custom Uno controls updated to their latest versions. This ensures you benefit from security patches and bug fixes *within the Uno ecosystem*.
    5.  **Input Validation in Uno Controls:** When using Uno Platform controls that handle user input, ensure proper input validation is implemented both within the control (if possible) and in the application logic that processes the control's output *within the Uno application*.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Uno Platform Controls or Libraries (Medium to High Severity):** Vulnerabilities in Uno controls or libraries can be exploited to compromise the Uno application. Severity depends on the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Malicious Third-Party Uno Libraries (Medium to High Severity):** Using untrusted or malicious third-party Uno libraries can introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors into the Uno application.
    *   **Input Validation Issues in Uno Controls (Medium Severity):** Improper input handling in Uno controls can lead to vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) or injection attacks *within the Uno application context*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Uno Platform Controls or Libraries (Medium to High Reduction):** Using official Uno controls and regular updates reduces the risk.
    *   **Malicious Third-Party Uno Libraries (Medium to High Reduction):** Careful vetting and using trusted sources significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **Input Validation Issues in Uno Controls (Medium Reduction):** Input validation practices mitigate this risk within the Uno application.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. We primarily use official Uno controls. We use some third-party Uno libraries but vetting process is informal and not specifically focused on Uno context. Custom Uno control security reviews are not consistently performed. Uno library updates are generally done reactively.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal process for vetting third-party Uno Platform libraries, focusing on Uno-specific security considerations.
    *   Mandatory security reviews for custom Uno Platform controls.
    *   Proactive and scheduled updates for all Uno libraries and controls.
    *   Guidelines for developers on secure Uno control usage and input validation within Uno applications.
