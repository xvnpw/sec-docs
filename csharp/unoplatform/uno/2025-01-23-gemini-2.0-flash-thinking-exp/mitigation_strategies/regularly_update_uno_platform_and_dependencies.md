#### 4.2. List of Threats Mitigated and Impact:

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Uno Platform Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated Uno Platform versions may contain known vulnerabilities within the framework itself.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Uno Platform Vulnerabilities (High Reduction):** Significantly reduces the risk by patching known vulnerabilities in the Uno Platform promptly.

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Validity:** The identified threat is valid and significant. Like any software framework, Uno Platform is susceptible to vulnerabilities. Exploiting framework vulnerabilities can have severe consequences, potentially affecting all applications built on it.
    *   **Severity:**  "High Severity" is an appropriate classification. Framework vulnerabilities can often lead to critical issues like remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Impact Reduction:** "High Reduction" is also accurate. Regularly updating the Uno Platform and its dependencies is a highly effective way to mitigate the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities. Patching vulnerabilities as soon as updates are available significantly reduces the window of opportunity for attackers.

#### 4.3. Currently Implemented and Missing Implementation:

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. We are using NuGet Package Manager and generally update Uno packages when new features are needed, but we don't have a formal scheduled update process specifically for Uno or automated scanning focused on Uno packages.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal scheduled Uno Platform dependency update reviews aligned with Uno release cycles.
    *   Subscription to official Uno Platform security advisories.
    *   Automated dependency scanning in CI/CD pipeline specifically targeting Uno Platform packages.

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Current State:**  "Partially Implemented" accurately reflects the situation. Using NuGet Package Manager is a good starting point, but reactive updates based on feature needs are insufficient for proactive security.
    *   **Missing Implementations - Prioritization:**
        *   **Formal scheduled Uno Platform dependency update reviews aligned with Uno release cycles:** **High Priority.** This is crucial for establishing a proactive and consistent update process.
        *   **Subscription to official Uno Platform security advisories:** **High Priority.**  Essential for timely awareness of security updates and vulnerabilities.
        *   **Automated dependency scanning in CI/CD pipeline specifically targeting Uno Platform packages:** **Medium to High Priority.**  Highly recommended for continuous monitoring and early vulnerability detection, but can be implemented after establishing scheduled updates and monitoring.
