# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for unoplatform/uno

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Obfuscation (Client-Side - Uno WASM/JavaScript)](./mitigation_strategies/code_obfuscation__client-side_-_uno_wasmjavascript_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Code Obfuscation (Uno WASM/JavaScript Client-Side)
*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Choose an Obfuscation Tool Compatible with WASM/JavaScript:** Select an obfuscation tool that is effective for WebAssembly and JavaScript code generated by Uno. Consider tools specifically designed for JavaScript or those that can handle WASM output.
    *   **Step 2: Integrate into Uno Project's Build Process:** Integrate the chosen obfuscation tool into the Uno project's build pipeline. This typically involves modifying the Uno project file (`.csproj`) or build scripts to include a step that runs the obfuscator after the Uno application is compiled to WASM/JavaScript. Ensure the obfuscation step occurs before deployment.
    *   **Step 3: Configure Obfuscation for Uno Output:** Configure the obfuscation tool to effectively handle the specific structure and characteristics of code generated by the Uno compiler. Test different obfuscation settings to find a balance between security and potential performance impact on the Uno application.
    *   **Step 4: Test Uno Application Functionality After Obfuscation:** Thoroughly test the Uno application on target platforms (WebAssembly in browsers, JavaScript environments) after applying obfuscation. Verify that all Uno UI components, data binding, and application logic function correctly after obfuscation.
    *   **Step 5: Regularly Update and Review Obfuscation Strategy:**  Keep the obfuscation tool and configuration up-to-date with the latest best practices and consider re-evaluating the obfuscation strategy as the Uno Platform and tooling evolve.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Reverse Engineering of Uno Client-Side Logic (High Severity):** Makes it significantly more difficult for attackers to reverse engineer the client-side application logic implemented in C# and compiled to WASM/JavaScript by Uno. This protects proprietary algorithms, business rules, and sensitive data handling logic exposed on the client.
    *   **Intellectual Property Exposure of Uno Application Code (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of unauthorized extraction and reuse of the Uno application's codebase, which represents intellectual property and development effort.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Reverse Engineering of Uno Client-Side Logic:** High reduction in risk. Obfuscation adds a significant barrier to understanding the compiled Uno client-side code.
    *   **Intellectual Property Exposure of Uno Application Code:** Medium reduction in risk. Obfuscation is a deterrent but not a foolproof protection against determined attackers.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented for WebAssembly target. Basic JavaScript obfuscation is applied to the output JavaScript bundles during production builds using a simple tool integrated into build scripts.
    *   **Location:** Build scripts within the WebAssembly project of the Uno solution (e.g., `build.sh`, `.csproj` with MSBuild targets).
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Exploring and implementing more advanced obfuscation techniques specifically tailored for Uno's WASM/JavaScript output (e.g., control flow flattening, string encryption, WASM-specific obfuscation if available).
    *   Consistent obfuscation across all relevant client-side targets if the Uno application targets JavaScript directly in addition to WASM.
    *   Formalized process for regular review and updates of the obfuscation strategy and tooling in the context of Uno Platform updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Scanning and Management (Uno Platform and NuGet Packages)](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_scanning_and_management__uno_platform_and_nuget_packages_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Dependency Scanning and Management (Uno Platform and NuGet Packages)
*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Choose a Dependency Scanning Tool Compatible with .NET and NuGet:** Select a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool or dependency scanning tool that effectively scans .NET projects and NuGet packages, including transitive dependencies.
    *   **Step 2: Integrate into Uno Solution's CI/CD Pipeline:** Integrate the chosen dependency scanning tool into the CI/CD pipeline for the Uno solution. This ensures that all NuGet package dependencies, including Uno Platform packages and their dependencies, are scanned automatically during builds and releases.
    *   **Step 3: Configure Tool to Scan Uno Platform and Project Dependencies:** Configure the dependency scanning tool to specifically scan all NuGet packages used in the Uno solution, paying particular attention to Uno Platform packages (e.g., `Uno.UI`, `Uno.WinUI`, platform-specific Uno packages) and their transitive dependencies.
    *   **Step 4: Define Policies for Uno and Related Vulnerabilities:** Define specific policies within the dependency scanning tool to prioritize and flag vulnerabilities found in Uno Platform packages and their direct or transitive dependencies. Set severity thresholds and define actions for vulnerability remediation.
    *   **Step 5: Regularly Review and Remediate Uno Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Regularly review the scan results, focusing on vulnerabilities identified in Uno Platform packages and related dependencies. Prioritize remediation by updating to patched versions of Uno packages or their dependencies as soon as updates are available. Follow Uno Platform security advisories and release notes for guidance.
    *   **Step 6: Monitor Uno Platform Security Advisories:** Actively monitor official Uno Platform communication channels, security advisories, and release notes for any reported vulnerabilities in the Uno framework or its dependencies. Proactively apply security patches and updates released by the Uno Platform team.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Uno Platform Framework and NuGet Dependencies (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of exploiting known security vulnerabilities present within the Uno Platform framework itself, its NuGet packages, and other third-party libraries used by the Uno application. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could lead to various security breaches, including unauthorized access, code execution, or denial of service within the Uno application across all target platforms.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Uno Platform Framework and NuGet Dependencies:** High reduction in risk. Proactive dependency scanning and management, especially for the core Uno Platform dependencies, is crucial for maintaining the security of Uno applications across all platforms.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented specifically for Uno dependencies. General dependency scanning might be in place for backend components, but not specifically configured or focused on the Uno Platform NuGet packages within the Uno client application projects.
    *   **Location:** N/A - currently missing for Uno client projects.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Selection and integration of a dependency scanning tool into the CI/CD pipeline for the Uno solution, specifically targeting NuGet package dependencies in Uno client projects.
    *   Configuration of the tool to prioritize and specifically monitor vulnerabilities within Uno Platform packages and their dependencies.
    *   Establishment of a clear process for regularly reviewing and remediating vulnerability scan results related to Uno dependencies, including monitoring Uno Platform security advisories.
    *   Automated alerts and notifications for newly discovered vulnerabilities in Uno Platform dependencies to enable timely patching and updates.
