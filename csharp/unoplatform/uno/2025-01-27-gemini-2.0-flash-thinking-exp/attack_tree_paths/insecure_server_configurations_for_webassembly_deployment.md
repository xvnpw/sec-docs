#### 4.1. Attack Vector: Web Server Misconfigurations

This attack vector focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities arising from improperly configured web servers that host the Uno WebAssembly application.  Web server misconfigurations can create pathways for attackers to bypass security controls and gain unauthorized access or control.  These misconfigurations can manifest in various forms, including:

*   **Directory Listing Enabled:**
    *   **Description:**  Web servers can be configured to automatically display a list of files and directories when no index file (e.g., `index.html`) is present in a requested directory.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Exposes the directory structure and potentially sensitive files to unauthorized users. Attackers can discover application structure, configuration files, server-side scripts, or even source code if accidentally deployed.
    *   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, potential for further exploitation based on revealed information.
    *   **Example (Uno Context):** If directory listing is enabled for the directory containing the Uno WebAssembly application files (`.wasm`, `.js`, `.html`, assets), attackers could discover the application's internal structure and potentially download sensitive assets or configuration files if they exist in the served directories.

*   **Default Credentials and Configurations:**
    *   **Description:** Using default usernames and passwords for web server administration interfaces or leaving default configurations unchanged.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Well-known default credentials are easily guessable or publicly available. Default configurations might have insecure settings enabled.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized Access, Server Compromise, Data Breach.
    *   **Example (Uno Context):**  If the web server's administration panel (e.g., IIS Manager, Nginx web interface) is accessible and uses default credentials, attackers could gain administrative access to the server, potentially modifying the application, server configurations, or even gaining control of the entire server.

*   **Insecure File Permissions:**
    *   **Description:** Incorrectly set file permissions on server files and directories, allowing unauthorized users to read, write, or execute files.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Allows attackers to modify application files, upload malicious content, or execute arbitrary code if write or execute permissions are granted inappropriately.
    *   **Impact:**  Application Tampering, Code Execution, Server Compromise.
    *   **Example (Uno Context):** If the web server user account has write permissions to the directory containing the Uno WebAssembly application files, an attacker could potentially upload a modified `index.html` file to inject malicious JavaScript or replace the `.wasm` application with a compromised version.

*   **Missing Security Headers:**
    *   **Description:**  Lack of security-related HTTP headers in the server's responses. These headers help browsers enforce security policies and mitigate common web attacks.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Makes the application vulnerable to attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Clickjacking, and MIME-sniffing attacks.
    *   **Impact:**  Client-Side Attacks, Data Theft, Session Hijacking.
    *   **Example (Uno Context):**  Without headers like `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP), `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, and `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS), the Uno WebAssembly application might be more susceptible to client-side attacks targeting users' browsers.

*   **Unnecessary Services and Ports Exposed:**
    *   **Description:** Running unnecessary services on the web server and leaving unnecessary ports open to the internet.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Increases the attack surface and provides more potential entry points for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in these services.
    *   **Impact:**  Server Compromise, Denial of Service.
    *   **Example (Uno Context):**  If services like FTP, Telnet, or database servers are running on the same server as the web server hosting the Uno application and are exposed to the internet, vulnerabilities in these services could be exploited to compromise the server, indirectly affecting the Uno application.

*   **Outdated Server Software:**
    *   **Description:** Running outdated versions of the web server software or related components with known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Exploitable vulnerabilities in outdated software can be easily targeted by attackers using publicly available exploits.
    *   **Impact:**  Server Compromise, Data Breach, Denial of Service.
    *   **Example (Uno Context):**  Using an old, unpatched version of IIS, Nginx, or Apache could expose the server hosting the Uno WebAssembly application to known vulnerabilities that could lead to server compromise and potentially impact the application's availability and integrity.

#### 4.2. Mitigation Focus: Secure Server Configuration and Regular Security Audits

The mitigation focus for this attack path centers around two key strategies:

*   **Secure Server Configuration Following Security Hardening Guides:**

    This involves implementing security best practices during the initial server setup and ongoing maintenance.  Key actions include:

    *   **Disable Directory Listing:**  Ensure directory listing is disabled for all directories serving the Uno WebAssembly application files. This is typically configured in the web server's configuration files (e.g., `nginx.conf`, `httpd.conf`, IIS Manager).
    *   **Change Default Credentials:**  Immediately change all default usernames and passwords for web server administration interfaces and any related services. Use strong, unique passwords.
    *   **Implement Least Privilege File Permissions:**  Configure file permissions so that the web server user account has only the necessary permissions to read and execute the application files.  Restrict write access to only essential directories and files, and only to the necessary user accounts.
    *   **Configure Security Headers:**  Implement recommended security HTTP headers in the web server configuration. This includes:
        *   **`Content-Security-Policy` (CSP):**  To control the resources the browser is allowed to load, mitigating XSS attacks.
        *   **`X-Frame-Options`:** To prevent Clickjacking attacks by controlling whether the application can be embedded in frames.
        *   **`X-XSS-Protection`:** To enable the browser's built-in XSS filter (though CSP is a more robust solution).
        *   **`Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS):** To enforce HTTPS connections and prevent protocol downgrade attacks.
        *   **`Referrer-Policy`:** To control the referrer information sent in HTTP requests.
        *   **`Permissions-Policy` (formerly Feature-Policy):** To control browser features that the application can use.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Services and Ports:**  Disable or uninstall any unnecessary services running on the web server. Close or firewall off any unused ports to reduce the attack surface.
    *   **Keep Server Software Up-to-Date:**  Establish a regular patching schedule to ensure the web server software, operating system, and all related components are updated with the latest security patches. Use automated patching tools where possible.
    *   **Enable HTTPS:**  Always serve the Uno WebAssembly application over HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and server, protecting data in transit. Obtain and properly configure SSL/TLS certificates.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Consider deploying a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of the web server to provide an additional layer of security against common web attacks.
    *   **Input Validation (Server-Side):** While the focus is on server configuration, remember that server-side input validation is crucial for any backend services the Uno WebAssembly application interacts with. Secure these backend services independently.

*   **Regular Security Audits of Server Configurations:**

    Proactive security audits are essential to identify and remediate misconfigurations that may arise over time or be introduced during updates or changes. This includes:

    *   **Periodic Configuration Reviews:**  Regularly review web server configurations against security hardening checklists and best practices.
    *   **Automated Security Scanning:**  Utilize automated vulnerability scanners to scan the web server for known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. Tools like Nessus, OpenVAS, and Qualys can be used.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct periodic penetration testing by security professionals to simulate real-world attacks and identify exploitable vulnerabilities in the server configuration and application deployment.
    *   **Log Monitoring and Analysis:**  Implement robust logging and monitoring of web server activity. Analyze logs for suspicious patterns or security incidents. Use Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems for centralized log management and analysis.
    *   **Configuration Management:**  Use configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to automate server configuration and ensure consistent and secure configurations across environments. This also helps in tracking configuration changes and reverting to known good states.
