3. **Automation and Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Automate build and deployment processes using IaC to ensure consistency, repeatability, and auditability, while reducing manual errors and potential security gaps.
4. **Continuous Security Testing:** Integrate security testing (SAST, DAST, SCA) into the CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities early in the development process.
5. **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing of the build and deployment pipeline to identify and address vulnerabilities proactively.
6. **Security Awareness Training:** Provide regular security awareness training to developers, DevOps engineers, and other personnel involved in the build and deployment process.
7. **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and maintain a comprehensive incident response plan to effectively handle security incidents related to the build and deployment pipeline.

By implementing these mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of successful attacks targeting the Uno Platform application build and deployment process, ensuring the delivery of secure and trustworthy applications to users.
