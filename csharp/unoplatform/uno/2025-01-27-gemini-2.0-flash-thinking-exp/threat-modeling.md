# Threat Model Analysis for unoplatform/uno

## Threat: [Uno Framework Code Vulnerability](./threats/uno_framework_code_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a bug, logic error, or security flaw within the Uno Platform framework's C# code, JavaScript interop layer, or UI rendering logic. This could be achieved by analyzing the framework's source code or through fuzzing and testing.
*   **Impact:**  XSS, denial of service, information disclosure, or potentially remote code execution if the vulnerability allows bypassing WebAssembly sandbox restrictions (less likely). The impact depends on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Uno Component Affected:** Uno Platform Framework (Core libraries, UI rendering engine, JavaScript interop)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Uno Platform NuGet packages updated to the latest versions.
    *   Monitor Uno Platform release notes and security advisories.
    *   Participate in the Uno Platform community and report potential security issues.
    *   Perform security code reviews of custom Uno Platform code and consider static analysis tools.

## Threat: [Insecure Browser API/Interop Usage](./threats/insecure_browser_apiinterop_usage.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities arising from how the Uno Platform application interacts with browser APIs (DOM, JavaScript APIs) or through its JavaScript interop layer. This could involve injecting malicious code through improperly sanitized data passed between C# and JavaScript, or exploiting insecure usage of browser features.
*   **Impact:** XSS, injection vulnerabilities, privilege escalation if interop allows access to sensitive browser functionalities without proper authorization, data corruption.
*   **Uno Component Affected:** Uno Platform JavaScript Interop Layer, Browser API interactions within Uno code
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review and sanitize all data passed between C# and JavaScript code.
    *   Follow secure coding practices for JavaScript interop, including input validation and output encoding.
    *   Minimize the surface area of JavaScript interop if possible.
    *   Use browser APIs securely and be aware of their potential security implications, especially when handling user input or sensitive data.

## Threat: [Uno UI Rendering XSS](./threats/uno_ui_rendering_xss.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into data that is rendered by the Uno Platform UI. If the UI rendering logic or data binding mechanisms are vulnerable to improper input sanitization, these scripts can be executed in the user's browser, leading to XSS attacks.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the application, information theft, execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser context.
*   **Uno Component Affected:** Uno Platform UI Rendering Engine, Data Binding Mechanisms, Input Handling
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow secure coding practices for UI development and data binding in Uno.
    *   Sanitize user inputs and data before rendering them in the UI to prevent script injection.
    *   Utilize browser's built-in XSS protection mechanisms, such as Content Security Policy (CSP).
    *   Regularly test for XSS vulnerabilities in the Uno application using security scanning tools and manual testing.
