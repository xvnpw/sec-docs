# Attack Surface Analysis for unoplatform/uno

## Attack Surface: [Abstraction Layer Bugs](./attack_surfaces/abstraction_layer_bugs.md)

Description: Vulnerabilities within the Uno Platform's abstraction layer that maps platform-specific APIs to a unified .NET API.

Uno Contribution: Uno's core function is to abstract platform differences. Bugs in this abstraction directly translate to cross-platform vulnerabilities.

Example: Incorrect permission mapping in the abstraction layer allows an application to access sensitive device features (like camera or location) on one platform without proper user consent, even if consent is correctly handled on another platform.

Impact: Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to device resources, data leakage, application crashes.

Risk Severity: High

Mitigation Strategies:

*   Thoroughly test Uno applications on all target platforms, focusing on security-sensitive APIs.
*   Stay updated with Uno Platform releases and security patches.
*   Report any suspicious behavior or discrepancies in platform API behavior to the Uno Platform team.
*   Implement robust input validation and output encoding, even when relying on abstracted APIs.

## Attack Surface: [Compilation Chain Issues](./attack_surfaces/compilation_chain_issues.md)

Description: Vulnerabilities introduced during the compilation process from C# code to platform-specific binaries (WASM, native).

Uno Contribution: Uno relies on a complex compilation chain involving .NET tools, platform SDKs, and potentially Uno-specific compilers.

Example: A vulnerability in the Uno compiler or a dependency used during compilation could inject malicious code into the final application binary without the developer's knowledge.

Impact: Code injection, malware distribution, compromised application integrity, supply chain attacks.

Risk Severity: High

Mitigation Strategies:

*   Use trusted and verified build environments.
*   Regularly update build tools, SDKs, and NuGet packages to their latest secure versions.
*   Implement build pipeline security measures, such as dependency scanning and integrity checks.
*   Consider using reproducible builds to verify the integrity of the build process.

## Attack Surface: [JavaScript Interop Issues (Web Targets)](./attack_surfaces/javascript_interop_issues__web_targets_.md)

Description: Vulnerabilities arising from the interaction between Uno WASM code and JavaScript code in the browser environment.

Uno Contribution: Uno WASM applications often require JavaScript interop for accessing browser APIs or integrating with JavaScript libraries. Insecure interop can create vulnerabilities.

Example:  Improperly sanitized data passed from .NET/WASM to JavaScript is used to construct a DOM element, leading to a DOM-based XSS vulnerability. Or, insecurely exposed .NET methods are called from JavaScript with malicious arguments.

Impact: Cross-site scripting (XSS), arbitrary JavaScript execution, data leakage, session hijacking.

Risk Severity: High

Mitigation Strategies:

*   Minimize JavaScript interop where possible.
*   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all data passed between .NET/WASM and JavaScript.
*   Use secure JavaScript coding practices and libraries.
*   Implement robust input validation and output encoding on both the .NET/WASM and JavaScript sides of the interop boundary.

## Attack Surface: [Serialization/Deserialization Flaws in WASM Boundary (Web Targets)](./attack_surfaces/serializationdeserialization_flaws_in_wasm_boundary__web_targets_.md)

Description: Vulnerabilities related to insecure serialization and deserialization of data exchanged between .NET code and WASM/JavaScript.

Uno Contribution: Uno applications rely on serialization to pass data across the WASM boundary. Insecure deserialization can be exploited.

Example:  An attacker manipulates serialized data sent from the server to the Uno WASM client. Insecure deserialization on the client-side leads to code execution or data corruption.

Impact: Remote code execution, denial of service, data corruption, information disclosure.

Risk Severity: Critical

Mitigation Strategies:

*   Avoid deserializing untrusted data directly.
*   Use secure serialization formats and libraries that are less prone to vulnerabilities.
*   Implement integrity checks (e.g., signatures, MACs) on serialized data to detect tampering.
*   Restrict the types of objects that can be deserialized.

## Attack Surface: [Platform API Misuse (Native Targets)](./attack_surfaces/platform_api_misuse__native_targets_.md)

Description: Incorrect or insecure usage of native platform APIs through the Uno abstraction layer.

Uno Contribution: Uno applications interact with platform-specific APIs via its abstraction. Misuse in the abstraction or application code can lead to vulnerabilities.

Example:  Incorrectly handling file permissions when using a file access API abstracted by Uno leads to an application creating world-writable files, allowing unauthorized access to application data.

Impact: Privilege escalation, unauthorized data access, data corruption, application crashes.

Risk Severity: High

Mitigation Strategies:

*   Thoroughly understand the security implications of platform APIs used through Uno.
*   Follow platform-specific security best practices when using abstracted APIs.
*   Perform platform-specific security testing to identify API misuse vulnerabilities.
*   Use least privilege principles when requesting and using platform permissions.

## Attack Surface: [XAML Parsing and Rendering Issues](./attack_surfaces/xaml_parsing_and_rendering_issues.md)

Description: Vulnerabilities in the Uno Platform's XAML parser or rendering engine.

Uno Contribution: Uno uses XAML for UI definition. Vulnerabilities in processing XAML can be exploited.

Example:  A specially crafted XAML file, either loaded from a remote source or embedded in the application, exploits a vulnerability in the XAML parser, leading to a denial of service or potentially code execution.

Impact: Denial of service, application crashes, potential remote code execution.

Risk Severity: High

Mitigation Strategies:

*   Sanitize and validate any XAML loaded from external sources.
*   Stay updated with Uno Platform releases and security patches that address XAML parsing vulnerabilities.
*   Limit the application's ability to load XAML from untrusted sources.
*   Implement input validation for data bound to XAML elements to prevent injection attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Uno Library Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/uno_library_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: Bugs or security flaws within the Uno framework libraries themselves, beyond the abstraction layer.

Uno Contribution: Uno framework code itself can contain vulnerabilities, like any software library.

Example: A vulnerability in a specific Uno UI control or data binding mechanism allows an attacker to trigger unexpected behavior or gain unauthorized access.

Impact: Denial of service, unexpected application behavior, data leakage, potential privilege escalation.

Risk Severity: High

Mitigation Strategies:

*   Stay updated with Uno Platform releases and security patches.
*   Monitor Uno Platform security advisories and community discussions for reported vulnerabilities.
*   Participate in Uno Platform community security discussions and contribute to vulnerability reporting.
*   Perform regular security audits of Uno applications, including the use of Uno framework components.
