## Attack Tree Path: [Attack Goal: Compromise Uno Platform Application](./attack_tree_paths/attack_goal_compromise_uno_platform_application.md)

Attack Vectors: All paths in the attack tree ultimately lead to this goal.
Mitigation Focus: Comprehensive security strategy covering all identified attack vectors.

Attack Vectors: Exploiting weaknesses inherent to the Uno Platform's design, implementation, or platform bridges.
Mitigation Focus: Regular Uno Platform updates, security audits of Uno core code, secure coding practices within the Uno Platform project.

## Attack Tree Path: [Memory Corruption Bugs in Uno Runtime](./attack_tree_paths/memory_corruption_bugs_in_uno_runtime.md)

Attack Vectors:
    * Buffer Overflows: Sending maliciously crafted XAML with oversized elements or strings to overflow memory buffers during parsing or rendering.
    * Use-After-Free: Triggering specific sequences of UI element creation and destruction to exploit memory management flaws, leading to use of freed memory.
Mitigation Focus:
    * Memory safety checks in Uno runtime code.
    * Fuzzing the XAML parser and rendering engine.
    * Regular Uno Platform updates to patch memory corruption vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Logic Errors in Uno Platform Core Logic](./attack_tree_paths/logic_errors_in_uno_platform_core_logic.md)

Attack Vectors:
    * XAML Binding Engine Vulnerabilities: Crafting malicious XAML bindings that exploit logic flaws in the binding engine to execute code or manipulate data.
    * Flaws in Event Handling Mechanism:  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how events are handled to bypass security checks or trigger unintended actions.
Mitigation Focus:
    * Regular security audits of Uno core logic, especially binding and event handling.
    * Secure XAML coding practices to avoid logic vulnerabilities.
    * Input validation for XAML and resources to prevent malicious input from exploiting logic flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Platform-Specific Uno Implementations (WebAssembly/Native Bridges)](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_platform-specific_uno_implementations__webassemblynative_bridges_.md)

Attack Vectors: Exploiting weaknesses in the code that bridges Uno Platform's core logic with platform-specific APIs and functionalities (browser APIs for WebAssembly, OS APIs for native platforms).
Mitigation Focus:
    * Secure coding practices in platform bridge implementations.
    * Rigorous testing on all target platforms to identify platform-specific bugs.
    * Input validation at platform bridge boundaries to prevent injection attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inadequate Input Validation in Platform Bridges](./attack_tree_paths/inadequate_input_validation_in_platform_bridges.md)

Attack Vectors:
    * Injection vulnerabilities: Passing unvalidated data from Uno code to platform-specific code, allowing attackers to inject malicious commands or code into platform APIs.
Mitigation Focus:
    * Implement robust input validation for all data crossing the platform bridge.
    * Secure coding practices to prevent injection vulnerabilities in platform-specific code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Uno Platform Build and Deployment Process Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_uno_platform_build_and_deployment_process_vulnerabilities.md)

Attack Vectors: Compromising the processes used to build and deploy Uno Platform applications, leading to the distribution of malicious or vulnerable applications.
Mitigation Focus: Secure the entire build and deployment pipeline, from code repositories to production servers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attacks targeting Uno Platform Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attacks_targeting_uno_platform_dependencies.md)

Attack Vectors:
    * Compromised NuGet Packages: Injecting malicious code into NuGet packages used by the Uno Platform or the application itself, leading to code execution during build or within the deployed application.
Mitigation Focus:
    * Dependency scanning and vulnerability management to detect compromised packages.
    * Secure build pipeline with integrity checks for dependencies.
    * Verify integrity of Uno Platform tools and templates.
    * Use signed NuGet packages to ensure authenticity.

Attack Vectors: Exploiting misconfigurations in the deployment environment to gain unauthorized access or compromise the application.
Mitigation Focus: Secure deployment configurations and regular security audits of deployment environments.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Server Configurations for WebAssembly Deployment](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_server_configurations_for_webassembly_deployment.md)

Attack Vectors:
    * Web Server Misconfigurations: Exploiting misconfigured web servers hosting the Uno WebAssembly application to access server files, manipulate application assets, or perform server-side attacks.
Mitigation Focus:
    * Secure server configuration following security hardening guides.
    * Regular security audits of server configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Uno Platform Extensions or Libraries -> Vulnerabilities in Application-Specific Uno Platform Code](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_custom_uno_platform_extensions_or_libraries_-_vulnerabilities_in_application-spec_0255b315.md)

Attack Vectors: Exploiting coding errors or security flaws in the application's own C# and XAML code that interacts with the Uno Platform. This is often the most likely attack vector due to application-specific code being less rigorously tested than core platform code.
Mitigation Focus:
    * Secure coding practices for all application-specific Uno code.
    * Security reviews and code audits of application code.
    * Regular testing, including penetration testing, of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in NuGet Packages used by the Application (Beyond Uno Core) -> Known Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_nuget_packages_used_by_the_application__beyond_uno_core__-_known_vulnerabilities__f2f34977.md)

Mitigation Focus:
    * Dependency scanning and vulnerability management to identify known vulnerabilities in NuGet packages.
    * Regular updates of NuGet packages to patch known vulnerabilities.
    * SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) management to track dependencies and their vulnerabilities.
