# Threat Model Analysis for unoplatform/uno

## Threat: [Cross-Platform Input Validation Bypass](./threats/cross-platform_input_validation_bypass.md)

*   **Threat:** Cross-Platform Input Validation Bypass
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts input that bypasses validation logic implemented within the Uno layer on one platform but is processed without proper validation on another target platform due to inconsistencies in how Uno handles input or translates validation rules across different native environments. This could stem from differences in underlying platform APIs or how Uno's abstraction layer handles input sanitization. For example, a specific character encoding vulnerability might be present on Android but not on WebAssembly, allowing an attacker to bypass Uno's validation on Android.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, injection attacks (if the unvalidated input is used in further processing), unexpected application behavior, or security vulnerabilities specific to the target platform.
    *   **Affected Uno Component:** Input Validation mechanisms within the Uno Framework, potentially affecting the `TextBox`, `ComboBox`, or custom input controls and their associated validation logic. Critically affects the Platform Abstraction Layer responsible for ensuring consistent input handling across different targets.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement input validation with a strong focus on platform-agnostic approaches within the Uno layer.
        *   Thoroughly test input validation logic on *all* target platforms, specifically looking for discrepancies in behavior.
        *   Utilize whitelisting and strict input validation rules rather than relying solely on blacklisting.
        *   Sanitize and encode user inputs consistently across all platforms before processing them on the backend or displaying them in the UI.

## Threat: [Platform-Specific API Misuse Leading to Privilege Escalation](./threats/platform-specific_api_misuse_leading_to_privilege_escalation.md)

*   **Threat:** Platform-Specific API Misuse Leading to Privilege Escalation
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities arising from the incorrect or insecure use of platform-specific APIs *through Uno's interoperability mechanisms*. This occurs when Uno's abstraction over native APIs introduces weaknesses or fails to properly enforce security constraints. For instance, if Uno provides a method to access a sensitive platform feature without adequately checking permissions, an attacker could leverage this flaw to gain elevated privileges on the target platform. This is directly related to how Uno bridges to and interacts with native code.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to system resources, data breaches, modification of system settings, or execution of arbitrary code on the target platform.
    *   **Affected Uno Component:** Platform Abstraction Layer, Native API Interop mechanisms within Uno, and any Uno code directly utilizing these mechanisms to interact with platform-specific functionalities (e.g., accessing sensors, file system, network).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when designing Uno's interaction with platform permissions.
        *   Carefully review and rigorously test all Uno code that interacts with platform-specific APIs for potential security vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization at the Uno/native boundary.
        *   Leverage Uno's built-in abstractions for platform features where they provide secure and well-tested implementations.
        *   Conduct security audits specifically focused on the Uno Platform's native interoperability layer.

## Threat: [WebAssembly Security Sandbox Escape (WebAssembly Targets)](./threats/webassembly_security_sandbox_escape__webassembly_targets_.md)

*   **Threat:** WebAssembly Security Sandbox Escape (WebAssembly Targets)
    *   **Description:** For applications specifically targeting WebAssembly, an attacker might attempt to exploit vulnerabilities *within the Uno Platform's WebAssembly implementation itself* or the way Uno interacts with the browser's WebAssembly runtime to escape the security sandbox. This could involve flaws in Uno's code generation, memory management within the WebAssembly environment, or incorrect handling of browser APIs.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the client's browser environment, potential for cross-site scripting (XSS) if not properly handled by Uno's rendering within the browser context, or unauthorized access to client-side resources.
    *   **Affected Uno Component:** Uno.UI.WebAssembly rendering engine, the underlying Mono/WebAssembly runtime as integrated and used by Uno, and the JavaScript interop layer provided by Uno for WebAssembly.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with the latest Uno Platform releases and pay close attention to security advisories specifically related to WebAssembly.
        *   Follow browser security best practices and utilize security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP).
        *   Carefully review and sanitize any data passed between the Uno WebAssembly application and JavaScript code.
        *   Conduct thorough security testing of the Uno application in the target browsers.
