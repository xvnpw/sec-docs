## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Platform Discrepancies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_platform_discrepancies.md)

This node represents the inherent risks in targeting multiple platforms with a single codebase. Differences in security models, API implementations, and resource handling can create vulnerabilities if not carefully managed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Platform Security Features -> Exploit Inconsistent Permission Handling](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_platform_security_features_-_exploit_inconsistent_permission_handling.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers identify discrepancies in how permissions are handled across different platforms targeted by the Uno application (e.g., Android, iOS, WebAssembly). They then exploit the least restrictive permission model to gain unauthorized access or capabilities on other platforms.
* **Example:** An application might correctly request and handle sensitive permissions on Android and iOS, but the WebAssembly version running in a browser might not have the same level of permission control, allowing an attacker to bypass intended restrictions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit XAML Processing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_xaml_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

This node highlights the risks associated with how the Uno Platform processes XAML, which is used to define the user interface. Vulnerabilities in the XAML parsing or rendering engine can lead to various attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit XAML Injection -> Inject malicious XAML code through data binding or user input](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_xaml_injection_-_inject_malicious_xaml_code_through_data_binding_or_user_input.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious XAML code into the application through data binding mechanisms or user input fields that are not properly sanitized. This injected XAML can then be processed by the Uno rendering engine, potentially leading to code execution or other unintended behavior.
* **Example:** If an application displays user-generated content that includes XAML, an attacker could inject malicious XAML that, when rendered, executes arbitrary code within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Client-Side Logic Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_client-side_logic_vulnerabilities.md)

This node focuses on vulnerabilities present in the client-side code of the Uno application, particularly after it has been compiled to target platforms (e.g., WebAssembly, JavaScript).

## Attack Tree Path: [Reverse Engineer and Exploit Client-Side Code -> Analyze compiled code (WASM, JavaScript, native) for vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/reverse_engineer_and_exploit_client-side_code_-_analyze_compiled_code__wasm__javascript__native__for_3d14091a.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers reverse engineer the compiled client-side code (especially WebAssembly or JavaScript) to identify vulnerabilities in the application's logic. These vulnerabilities can then be exploited to bypass security checks, manipulate data, or gain unauthorized access.
* **Example:** An attacker analyzes the WebAssembly code of an Uno application and discovers a flaw in the authentication logic that allows them to bypass login procedures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Build/Deployment Process](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_builddeployment_process.md)

This node represents the risks associated with the processes used to build and deploy the Uno application. If these processes are compromised, attackers can inject malicious code into the application before it reaches users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code during Build -> Tamper with Uno project files or build scripts to inject malicious code](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_during_build_-_tamper_with_uno_project_files_or_build_scripts_to_inject_malici_6e77de5e.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the development environment or build pipeline and modify Uno project files, build scripts, or other build artifacts to inject malicious code into the application.
* **Example:** An attacker compromises a developer's machine and modifies the build script to include a backdoor in the final application package.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Dependencies -> Introduce malicious dependencies or exploit vulnerabilities in Uno's dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_dependencies_-_introduce_malicious_dependencies_or_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_uno's_depen_06c4036f.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers either introduce malicious third-party libraries into the project's dependencies or exploit known vulnerabilities in existing dependencies used by the Uno application.
* **Example:** An attacker identifies a vulnerable version of a NuGet package used by the Uno project and leverages that vulnerability to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Local Storage/Data Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_local_storagedata_handling.md)

This node focuses on the risks associated with how the Uno application stores and manages data locally on the user's device or within the browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Data Stored Locally -> Exploit vulnerabilities to access data stored by the application (e.g., using platform-specific storage mechanisms)](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_data_stored_locally_-_exploit_vulnerabilities_to_access_data_stored_by_the_applicat_74a86dea.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the application or the underlying platform to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored locally by the Uno application. This could involve bypassing encryption, exploiting insecure storage mechanisms, or leveraging platform-specific vulnerabilities.
* **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the way the Uno application stores user credentials in local storage on a mobile device, allowing them to retrieve those credentials.
