# Attack Surface Analysis for unoplatform/uno

## Attack Surface: [Uno's Platform-Specific Rendering Engine Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/uno's_platform-specific_rendering_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Bugs or security flaws within the rendering engines used by Uno (e.g., SkiaSharp, native platform renderers) can be exploited.
    * **How Uno Contributes:** Uno relies on these rendering engines to display the UI. Vulnerabilities within these engines become part of the application's attack surface.
    * **Example:** A vulnerability in SkiaSharp could allow an attacker to craft a specific visual element that, when rendered, causes a crash (DoS) or potentially even leads to memory corruption. On native platforms, vulnerabilities in the underlying OS rendering could be triggered via Uno's usage.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, potential information disclosure (e.g., through memory leaks), or in some scenarios, potentially limited code execution within the rendering engine's sandbox.
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep Uno Platform updated, as updates often include fixes for rendering engine vulnerabilities.
        * Be cautious when using custom drawing or rendering logic that might interact directly with the underlying rendering engine.
        * Consider the security track record of the specific rendering engines used by Uno on your target platforms.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure JavaScript Interop (for WebAssembly targets)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_javascript_interop__for_webassembly_targets_.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from the communication between the Uno application (running in Wasm) and JavaScript code in the browser.
    * **How Uno Contributes:** Uno applications often need to interact with browser APIs or existing JavaScript libraries. This interop layer can introduce security risks if not handled carefully.
    * **Example:**  Passing sensitive data from the Uno application to JavaScript without proper sanitization could expose it to malicious scripts on the page. Conversely, unsanitized input from JavaScript passed to the Uno application could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities within the .NET code.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure, cross-site scripting (XSS) if not handled correctly, or potentially control hijacking of the Uno application.
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Sanitize all data passed between JavaScript and the Uno application.
        * Minimize the amount of sensitive data passed through the interop layer.
        * Carefully review and audit all JavaScript code interacting with the Uno application.
        * Consider using secure communication patterns for interop.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Uno Platform Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_uno_platform_dependencies.md)

* **Description:** Security flaws within the Uno Platform libraries or their transitive dependencies can be exploited in applications using them.
    * **How Uno Contributes:** Uno relies on numerous NuGet packages. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies directly impact the security of applications built with Uno.
    * **Example:** A vulnerability in a networking library used by Uno could allow an attacker to intercept or manipulate network traffic.
    * **Impact:** Varies widely depending on the vulnerability, potentially including remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies, can be Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Uno Platform and all NuGet dependencies to the latest stable versions.
        * Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
        * Monitor security advisories for Uno Platform and its dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Custom Renderers or Platform Effects](./attack_surfaces/insecure_custom_renderers_or_platform_effects.md)

* **Description:** Security vulnerabilities introduced by developers when creating custom renderers or platform effects to extend Uno's functionality.
    * **How Uno Contributes:** Uno allows for customization through renderers and effects. If these custom implementations are not developed securely, they can introduce new attack vectors.
    * **Example:** A custom renderer for displaying images might have a buffer overflow vulnerability when handling malformed image data. A platform effect interacting with sensitive platform APIs might do so insecurely.
    * **Impact:** Can range from denial of service and information disclosure to arbitrary code execution depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom code.
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Follow secure coding practices when developing custom renderers and platform effects.
        * Thoroughly test custom implementations for vulnerabilities.
        * Conduct security reviews of custom code.
        * Limit the scope and privileges of custom renderers and effects.
