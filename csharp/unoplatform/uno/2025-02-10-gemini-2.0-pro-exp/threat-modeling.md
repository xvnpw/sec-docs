# Threat Model Analysis for unoplatform/uno

## Threat: [Dependency Hijacking (NuGet/Platform Dependencies)](./threats/dependency_hijacking__nugetplatform_dependencies_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a NuGet package *specifically tailored for Uno Platform* or a platform-specific dependency *that Uno Platform relies on*. The attacker injects malicious code into this dependency, which is then executed within the context of the Uno application due to Uno's cross-platform build process. This is distinct from general dependency hijacking because the compromised component is *integral to Uno's operation*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete application compromise (attacker gains full control, potentially across all supported platforms due to Uno's nature).
    *   Data breaches.
    *   Malware distribution.
    *   Loss of user trust.
*   **Affected Uno Component:** The entire Uno application, as any compromised Uno-specific dependency could affect any part of the system. Specifically, the build process that incorporates Uno packages and the Uno runtime environment that loads and executes these dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use SCA tools, paying *particular attention to Uno-specific packages and their transitive dependencies*.
    *   **Dependency Pinning:** Specify exact versions of *all Uno-related dependencies* to prevent unexpected updates.
    *   **Private NuGet Feed:** Use a private NuGet feed to control which *Uno packages* are available to the build process.
    *   **Regular Dependency Audits:** Regularly audit *Uno-related dependencies* for known vulnerabilities and update them promptly.
    *   **Source Code Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to scan *Uno dependencies* for potential security issues.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate vulnerability scanning into the CI/CD pipeline, *specifically targeting Uno components*.

## Threat: [Platform-Specific Data Leakage (Uno Abstraction Flaw)](./threats/platform-specific_data_leakage__uno_abstraction_flaw_.md)

*   **Description:** A flaw *within Uno Platform's abstraction layer* for a specific platform (e.g., iOS, Android, WASM) causes sensitive data to be leaked. This is *not* a general platform vulnerability, but a bug *in Uno's code* that handles platform-specific APIs or data management. For example, Uno's iOS implementation might incorrectly handle memory, leading to a crash dump containing sensitive data, *a scenario unique to Uno's bridging of .NET to iOS*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data breaches (sensitive user data exposed).
    *   Privacy violations.
    *   Compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
*   **Affected Uno Component:** The *platform-specific implementation of Uno's core components* (e.g., `Uno.UI.iOS`, `Uno.UI.Android`, `Uno.UI.Wasm`). Specifically, any Uno component that interacts with platform APIs or manages sensitive data *through Uno's abstraction*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Platform-Specific Testing:** Thoroughly test the application on all target platforms, paying *extra attention to how Uno handles data and memory on each platform*.
    *   **Platform-Specific Security Analysis:** Use platform-specific security analysis tools (e.g., Xcode Instruments, Android Lint), *focusing on areas where Uno interacts with the platform*.
    *   **Secure Data Storage:** Use platform-specific secure storage mechanisms, *but verify that Uno's interaction with these mechanisms is secure*.
    *   **Data Sanitization:** Sanitize data before displaying it or logging it, *considering potential Uno-specific vulnerabilities*.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Grant the application only the necessary permissions, *and verify that Uno correctly enforces these permissions*.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews, *specifically targeting Uno's platform-specific code and data handling logic*.

## Threat: [Uno Runtime Code Injection](./threats/uno_runtime_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *within the Uno Platform runtime itself* (e.g., in Uno's XAML parsing engine, Uno's JavaScript interop implementation, or a platform-specific Uno component) to inject and execute arbitrary code. This is *distinct from general code injection* because it targets the *core of Uno's execution environment*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete application compromise (across all platforms supported by the vulnerable Uno runtime).
    *   Data breaches.
    *   Malware distribution.
    *   System compromise (if the attacker can escalate privileges *through the compromised Uno runtime*).
*   **Affected Uno Component:** The *Uno Platform runtime itself* (e.g., `Uno.UI.dll`, platform-specific Uno runtime components). Specifically, any Uno component that handles untrusted input or interacts with the underlying operating system *as part of Uno's core functionality*.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Uno Updated:** Always use the *absolute latest version* of the Uno Platform, which includes security patches *specifically addressing runtime vulnerabilities*.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Rigorously validate and sanitize all input, *even if it's processed by Uno's internal components*, as this is a potential attack vector.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices *when developing with Uno*, to minimize the risk of introducing vulnerabilities that could be exploited through the runtime.
    *   **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits, *specifically focusing on the interaction between your application code and the Uno Platform runtime*.
    *   **Vulnerability Disclosure Program:** Participate in Uno's vulnerability disclosure program (if they have one) to report any security issues you find *in the Uno runtime*.
    *   **Avoid Untrusted Components:** Be extremely cautious when using third-party Uno components, and thoroughly vet them for security, *as they could introduce vulnerabilities into the Uno runtime environment*.

## Threat: [Permission Escalation (via Uno Abstraction)](./threats/permission_escalation__via_uno_abstraction_.md)

*   **Description:** A flaw *within Uno Platform's abstraction layer for platform permissions* allows the application to gain access to permissions it shouldn't have. This is *not* a general platform permission issue, but a bug *in Uno's code* that handles permission requests and enforcement across different platforms. An attacker might exploit this *Uno-specific vulnerability* to access sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data breaches (access to unauthorized data).
    *   Privacy violations.
    *   System compromise (if the attacker can gain elevated privileges *through the compromised Uno permission handling*).
*   **Affected Uno Component:** *Uno's platform-specific permission handling components* (e.g., the code that requests and manages permissions on iOS, Android, etc., *within the Uno framework*). The *abstraction layer for permissions provided by Uno*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Request only the minimum necessary permissions, *and verify that Uno correctly translates these requests across platforms*.
    *   **Platform-Specific Testing:** Thoroughly test permission handling on all target platforms, *specifically focusing on how Uno interacts with the platform's permission system*.
    *   **Security Analysis Tools:** Use platform-specific security analysis tools, *paying attention to how Uno requests and uses permissions*.
    *   **Avoid Custom Permission APIs:** Prefer standard, well-tested *Uno-provided* permission APIs.
    *   **Regular Permission Review:** Regularly review the application's permissions, *and ensure that Uno is not granting more permissions than intended*.
    *   **Runtime Permission Checks:** Implement runtime checks *within your application code, even if relying on Uno's permission handling*, to ensure that the application has the necessary permissions before performing sensitive operations.
