# Attack Surface Analysis for unoplatform/uno

## Attack Surface: [Reverse Engineering and Code Tampering (Wasm)](./attack_surfaces/reverse_engineering_and_code_tampering__wasm_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers analyze and modify the application's WebAssembly code to understand its logic, bypass security, or inject malicious code.
    *   **Uno Contribution:** Uno compiles .NET code to Wasm, which is more susceptible to reverse engineering than native code.  Uno's interpreted mode (for hot-reload) further increases this risk.
    *   **Example:** An attacker decompiles the Wasm module, finds a hardcoded API key, and uses it to access sensitive data.  Or, they modify a function that validates user input to always return "true," bypassing authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, application compromise, intellectual property theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (for most applications, Critical for those handling sensitive data)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Use strong code obfuscation (both .NET and Wasm-specific tools).  Minimize client-side sensitive logic; perform critical operations server-side.  Validate *all* inputs on the server, even if validated client-side.  Consider AOT compilation where feasible.  Implement runtime integrity checks (though these can be bypassed, they raise the bar).

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Wasm and Native)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__wasm_and_native_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the .NET runtime (for Wasm), Uno Platform itself, or third-party libraries (both .NET and native) are exploited.
    *   **Uno Contribution:** Uno relies on the .NET runtime and platform-specific native libraries.  Uno itself is a dependency.
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability in a .NET Wasm library used for networking is exploited to perform a denial-of-service attack.  Or, a vulnerability in a native Android library used by Uno for UI rendering allows for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Application compromise, denial of service, data breaches, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Use a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to identify and track dependencies.  Keep the .NET SDK, Uno Platform NuGet packages, and all third-party libraries up-to-date.  Apply security patches promptly.  Vet third-party libraries carefully before using them.

## Attack Surface: [JavaScript Interop Exploitation (Wasm)](./attack_surfaces/javascript_interop_exploitation__wasm_.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code interacts with the Uno.Wasm application through the interop layer, exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access or inject malicious code.
    *   **Uno Contribution:** Uno provides a JavaScript interop layer to allow communication between Wasm and the browser's JavaScript environment.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript that calls an Uno interop function with crafted parameters, causing a buffer overflow in the Wasm module.  Or, an XSS vulnerability in a *different* part of the website allows an attacker to inject JavaScript that manipulates the Uno application.
    *   **Impact:** Application compromise, data breaches, cross-site scripting (XSS) amplification.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**  Treat the JavaScript interop layer as a security boundary.  Strictly validate and sanitize *all* data passed between JavaScript and Wasm.  Minimize the use of interop where possible.  Use a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the origins of JavaScript that can interact with the application.  Encode output properly to prevent XSS.

## Attack Surface: [Uno Platform Bridge Vulnerabilities (Native)](./attack_surfaces/uno_platform_bridge_vulnerabilities__native_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the Uno Platform's code that bridges .NET and the native platform APIs are exploited.
    *   **Uno Contribution:** Uno's core functionality is to translate .NET code and XAML into native code and UI.  This translation layer is a potential source of vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A bug in Uno's implementation of file system access on Android allows an attacker to read or write files outside the application's sandbox.
    *   **Impact:** Application compromise, data breaches, privilege escalation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Keep the Uno Platform NuGet packages updated.  Thoroughly test the application on all target platforms.  Follow secure coding practices when interacting with native APIs through Uno.  Be aware of platform-specific security best practices.  Report any suspected vulnerabilities to the Uno Platform team.

## Attack Surface: [WASI Abuse (If Used)](./attack_surfaces/wasi_abuse__if_used_.md)

* **Description:** If the Uno.Wasm application uses the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) for system-level access, misconfigured permissions or vulnerabilities in the WASI implementation could be exploited.
    * **Uno Contribution:** While not a direct contribution of Uno, if an Uno.Wasm application chooses to use WASI, it opens this attack surface.
    * **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the WASI file system API to gain access to files outside the application's designated sandbox.
    * **Impact:** System compromise, data breaches, unauthorized access.
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:** Avoid using WASI if not absolutely necessary. If WASI is required, carefully review and restrict WASI permissions to the absolute minimum required. Keep the WASI runtime updated.
