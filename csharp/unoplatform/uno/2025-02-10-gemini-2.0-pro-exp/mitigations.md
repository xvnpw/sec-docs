## Mitigation Strategy: [Thorough API Review and Secure Wrapper Implementation (Uno-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/thorough_api_review_and_secure_wrapper_implementation__uno-specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Thorough API Review and Secure Wrapper Implementation (Uno-Specific)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Critical Uno APIs:** Create a list of all *Uno Platform-provided* APIs used by the application. Focus on those bridging to platform-specific functionality (file system, network, sensors, native UI components, etc.). Exclude standard .NET APIs.
    2.  **Uno Source Code Review:** For each identified *Uno* API, examine the corresponding Uno Platform source code on GitHub. Look for:
        *   **Input Validation (Uno Bridge):** Check how the Uno bridge handles input parameters *before* passing them to the underlying platform API. Are there Uno-specific checks?
        *   **Error Handling (Uno Bridge):** Analyze how the Uno bridge handles errors returned from the underlying platform API. Are errors properly translated and propagated to the .NET side?
        *   **Uno-Specific Logic Errors:** Look for logic errors *within* the Uno bridging code that could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities, *independent* of the underlying platform API.
        *   **Platform-Specific Nuances (Uno Handling):** Pay close attention to how the Uno API handles differences between platforms in its bridging logic. Are there any platform-specific vulnerabilities introduced by Uno's abstraction layer?
    3.  **Wrapper Creation (Around Uno APIs):** For high-risk Uno APIs, create a thin wrapper class around the *Uno* API (not the underlying platform API). This wrapper should:
        *   **Additional Validation (Pre-Uno):** Add application-specific validation logic *before* calling the Uno API, enforcing stricter rules.
        *   **Centralize Error Handling (Post-Uno):** Provide consistent error handling for the application, abstracting away Uno-specific and platform-specific error codes.
        *   **Audit Logging (Uno Interactions):** Log all calls to the wrapped *Uno* API, including input parameters and results.
    4.  **Code Review of Wrappers (Uno Focus):** Have another developer review the wrapper code, focusing on its interaction with the Uno API.
    5.  **Unit and Integration Tests (Uno-Specific):** Write unit tests for the wrapper and its interaction with the *Uno* API, focusing on edge cases and potential vulnerabilities in the Uno bridging code.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Platform-Specific API Vulnerabilities (in Uno's Bridge) (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of exploits targeting flaws in *Uno's implementation* of platform API bridges.
    *   **Injection Attacks (through Uno APIs) (High Severity):** Input validation in wrappers mitigates injection attacks that might be possible due to flaws in how Uno handles data passed to platform APIs.
    *   **Information Disclosure (from Uno APIs) (Medium Severity):** Proper error handling in wrappers prevents leakage of sensitive information from Uno's error handling.
    *   **Logic Errors in Uno's Bridging Code (High Severity):** Reduces the impact of logic errors specifically within Uno's bridging code.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Platform-Specific API Vulnerabilities (Uno Bridge):** Significantly reduces risk (e.g., 70-90%).
    *   **Injection Attacks (through Uno APIs):** High reduction (80-95%) if wrappers implement robust pre-Uno validation.
    *   **Information Disclosure (from Uno APIs):** Moderate reduction (50-70%).
    *   **Logic Errors in Uno's Bridging Code:** Moderate to high reduction (60-80%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   API Review: Partially implemented. Review completed for `Uno.Storage` APIs in the `FileSystemAccess` module.
    *   Wrapper Creation: Implemented for `Uno.Storage.Pickers.FileOpenPicker` in the `FileService` class. Includes input validation and logging.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   API Review: Missing for `Uno.Networking.Connectivity` and `Uno.Devices.Sensors` APIs.
    *   Wrapper Creation: Missing for all APIs except `Uno.Storage.Pickers.FileOpenPicker`. High priority for networking and sensor APIs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize JavaScript Interop (Uno.Wasm Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_javascript_interop__uno_wasm_specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Minimize JavaScript Interop (Uno.Wasm Specific)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Audit Existing Uno.Wasm Interop:** Identify all instances of `[JSImport]` and `[JSExport]` in the codebase that are used for interacting with JavaScript from the Uno.Wasm application.
    2.  **Refactor to Reduce Uno.Wasm Interop:** Explore alternative solutions that don't require JavaScript interop. Can the functionality be achieved using Uno-provided APIs or .NET libraries that Uno has already bridged?  Prioritize using Uno's existing bridges over custom JavaScript interop.
    3.  **Input/Output Sanitization (Uno.Wasm Bridge):** For *unavoidable* interop calls, rigorously sanitize all data passed between .NET and JavaScript *within the context of the Uno.Wasm bridge*. Validate data types and formats on both sides, using Uno-provided mechanisms where possible.
    4. **Review Uno.Wasm Bootstrapper:** Examine the Uno.Wasm bootstrapper code and configuration. Ensure it's not exposing any sensitive information or providing unnecessary access to the browser environment *through Uno's mechanisms*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **JavaScript Sandbox Escape (via Uno.Wasm) (High Severity):** Minimizing interop reduces the attack surface for vulnerabilities that could allow escaping the WebAssembly sandbox *through flaws in Uno's interop implementation*.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (through Uno.Wasm Interop) (High Severity):** Sanitization within the Uno.Wasm bridge helps prevent XSS attacks that might exploit vulnerabilities in Uno's interop handling.
    * **Code Injection (via Uno.Wasm) (High Severity):** Reduces attack surface.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **JavaScript Sandbox Escape (via Uno.Wasm):** Moderate to high reduction (60-80%) by minimizing the attack surface related to Uno's interop.
    *   **XSS (through Uno.Wasm Interop):** High reduction (80-95%) with rigorous sanitization within the Uno bridge.
    * **Code Injection (via Uno.Wasm):** High reduction.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Interop Audit: Partially completed. Identified 3 instances of `[JSImport]` in `GeolocationService`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Interop Audit: Incomplete. Needs review for all modules.
    *   Interop Minimization: Not yet attempted. Need to investigate alternatives to JavaScript interop in `GeolocationService`, prioritizing Uno-provided solutions.
    *   Input/Output Sanitization: Needs to be implemented for all existing interop calls, focusing on how Uno handles the data transfer.
    *   Uno.Wasm Bootstrapper Review: Not yet performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Vetting Uno-Specific NuGet Packages](./mitigation_strategies/vetting_uno-specific_nuget_packages.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Vetting Uno-Specific NuGet Packages

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Uno-Specific Packages:** Create a list of all NuGet packages used in the project that are *specifically designed for or heavily integrated with* the Uno Platform.  This excludes general-purpose .NET libraries.
    2.  **Vetting Process for New Uno Packages:** Before adding a new Uno-specific NuGet package:
        *   **Check Source:** Is it from the official Uno Platform NuGet feed, a well-known community contributor with a strong track record, or a trusted organization?
        *   **Examine Source Code (if available):** Look for obvious security issues, *particularly in how the package interacts with Uno's platform-specific features*.
        *   **Check Dependencies:** Analyze the package's own dependencies, paying special attention to any *other* Uno-specific packages it relies on.
        *   **Review Documentation:** Look for security-related information or warnings, especially regarding Uno compatibility and platform-specific considerations.
        *   **Check for Known Vulnerabilities:** Search for known vulnerabilities associated with the package *and its Uno-related dependencies*.
    3. **Prefer Official Uno Packages:** Whenever possible, use packages provided and maintained by the official Uno Platform team. These are more likely to be thoroughly tested, kept up-to-date, and adhere to Uno's security best practices.
    4. **Regular Audits (Uno Focus):** Periodically review all existing *Uno-specific* dependencies, even if automated tools don't report any vulnerabilities. New vulnerabilities may be discovered in previously scanned packages, particularly those related to Uno's evolving platform support.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerable Uno-Specific Dependencies (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of using Uno-related NuGet packages with known vulnerabilities that could impact the application's security *through their interaction with Uno*.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (targeting Uno) (High Severity):** Helps detect compromised or malicious packages that are specifically designed to exploit Uno Platform features.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerable Uno-Specific Dependencies:** High reduction (70-90%).
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (targeting Uno):** Moderate reduction (40-60%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   None.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   All aspects of this strategy are currently missing. This is a high-priority area.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unused Uno Features](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unused_uno_features.md)

* **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Unused Uno Features

* **Description:**
    1. **Identify Unused Features:** Review the application's functionality and identify any Uno Platform features (e.g., specific UI controls, platform APIs, renderers) that are *not* being used.
    2. **Disable via Project Configuration:** Use Uno Platform's project configuration settings (e.g., in the `.csproj` file, Uno-specific configuration files) to disable these unused features. This often involves removing references to specific Uno assemblies or setting feature flags.
    3. **Test After Disabling:** After disabling features, thoroughly test the application to ensure that no functionality is broken.
    4. **Regular Review:** Periodically review the list of disabled features and re-enable them only if they become necessary.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Vulnerabilities in Unused Uno Code (Medium Severity):** Reduces the attack surface by removing code paths related to unused Uno features, which might contain vulnerabilities.
    * **Performance Issues (Low Severity):** Disabling unused features can slightly improve application performance and reduce its size.

* **Impact:**
    * **Vulnerabilities in Unused Uno Code:** Moderate reduction (30-50%), depending on the number of unused features.
    * **Performance Issues:** Low to moderate improvement.

* **Currently Implemented:**
     * None.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * All aspects of this strategy are currently missing.
