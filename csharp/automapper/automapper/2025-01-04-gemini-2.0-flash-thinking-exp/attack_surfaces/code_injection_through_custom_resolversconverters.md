## Deep Analysis: Code Injection through Custom Resolvers/Converters in AutoMapper

This analysis delves into the specific attack surface of "Code Injection through Custom Resolvers/Converters" within applications utilizing the AutoMapper library. We will explore the mechanics of this vulnerability, its potential impact, and provide actionable recommendations for mitigation.

**1. Understanding the Attack Surface:**

The core strength of AutoMapper lies in its ability to automate the transfer of data between objects of different types. However, this flexibility extends to allowing developers to define custom logic for specific property mappings through **resolvers** and **type converters**. While powerful, this customization introduces a potential security vulnerability if not implemented with caution.

The attack surface arises when these custom resolvers or converters directly process or utilize user-controlled input without proper validation and sanitization. Essentially, the developer becomes responsible for the security of this custom mapping logic, and any oversight can lead to code injection vulnerabilities.

**2. Deeper Dive into the Mechanics:**

* **Resolvers (IValueResolver):** Resolvers are used to calculate the value of a destination property based on the source object. They receive the source object and the destination object as input. If a resolver uses a property from the source object (which might originate from user input) to construct commands, queries, or system calls without sanitization, it becomes a prime injection point.

* **Type Converters (ITypeConverter):** Type converters are responsible for converting a source type to a destination type. Similar to resolvers, if the conversion logic involves processing string-based user input and uses it to dynamically construct executable code or commands, it's vulnerable.

**3. Elaborating on the Example: SQL Injection through a Custom Resolver:**

Let's dissect the provided SQL injection example:

```csharp
public class UserToOrderCountResolver : IValueResolver<User, OrderSummary, int>
{
    private readonly IDbConnection _dbConnection;

    public UserToOrderCountResolver(IDbConnection dbConnection)
    {
        _dbConnection = dbConnection;
    }

    public int Resolve(User source, OrderSummary destination, int destMember, ResolutionContext context)
    {
        // Vulnerable code: Directly using source.SearchTerm in the query
        string query = $"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Orders WHERE CustomerName = '{source.SearchTerm}'";
        return _dbConnection.QuerySingle<int>(query);
    }
}

public class User
{
    public string SearchTerm { get; set; }
    // ... other properties
}

public class OrderSummary
{
    public int OrderCount { get; set; }
    // ... other properties
}

// Mapping configuration
cfg.CreateMap<User, OrderSummary>()
   .ForMember(dest => dest.OrderCount, opt => opt.MapFrom<UserToOrderCountResolver>());

// Usage with potentially malicious input
var user = new User { SearchTerm = "'; DROP TABLE Orders; --" };
var orderSummary = _mapper.Map<OrderSummary>(user);
```

In this scenario:

* The `UserToOrderCountResolver` takes a `User` object as input.
* The `User` object has a `SearchTerm` property, which could be populated directly from user input (e.g., a search box).
* The resolver directly embeds the `source.SearchTerm` into a SQL query string using string interpolation.
* An attacker can manipulate the `SearchTerm` to inject malicious SQL code, such as `'; DROP TABLE Orders; --`.
* When the query is executed, it will first select the count of orders for an empty customer name (due to the closing single quote), then execute the `DROP TABLE Orders` command, and finally ignore the rest of the string due to the comment `--`.

**4. Expanding on the Impact:**

The impact of successful code injection through custom resolvers/converters can be catastrophic:

* **Complete System Compromise:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially gaining full control over the application and the underlying infrastructure.
* **Data Breach:** Sensitive data stored in the database or accessible by the application can be stolen or manipulated.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can execute commands that crash the application or consume excessive resources, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
* **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE):** This is the most severe impact, allowing attackers to run any code they desire on the server, leading to any of the above consequences.
* **Lateral Movement:**  If the compromised application has access to other systems or networks, attackers can use it as a stepping stone to further compromise the environment.

**5. Deep Dive into Mitigation Strategies:**

Let's expand on the provided mitigation strategies with more technical detail:

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Whitelisting:** Define allowed characters, patterns, and values for user input. Reject any input that doesn't conform. For example, if `SearchTerm` should only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces, enforce this rule.
    * **Blacklisting (Less Effective):**  Identify and block known malicious patterns. This approach is less robust as attackers can often find new ways to bypass blacklists.
    * **Data Type Validation:** Ensure the input conforms to the expected data type.
    * **Length Restrictions:** Limit the length of input fields to prevent buffer overflows or excessively long queries.
    * **Encoding:** Encode user input appropriately for the context where it will be used (e.g., HTML encoding for display in web pages, URL encoding for use in URLs).

* **Avoid Dynamic Code Execution:**
    * **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  Crucially important for preventing SQL injection. Instead of directly embedding user input into the query string, use placeholders and pass the input as parameters. This ensures the database treats the input as data, not executable code.
    * **Stored Procedures:**  Encapsulate database logic within stored procedures, reducing the need for dynamic query construction in the application code.
    * **Avoid `eval()` and similar constructs:**  Never use functions that directly execute arbitrary code based on user input.
    * **Restrict External Command Execution:** If absolutely necessary to execute external commands, carefully sanitize the input and use secure methods to invoke the commands with minimal privileges.

* **Secure Coding Practices:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that resolvers and converters only have the necessary permissions to perform their intended tasks. Avoid granting them broad access to sensitive resources.
    * **Secure String Handling:** Be cautious when concatenating strings, especially when user input is involved. Prefer safer alternatives like string builders or parameterized queries.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular code reviews and security audits to identify potential vulnerabilities in custom resolvers and converters.
    * **Static Analysis Tools:** Utilize static analysis tools to automatically detect potential code injection vulnerabilities during development.

* **Principle of Least Privilege for Resolvers/Converters:**
    * **Restrict Data Access:**  If a resolver interacts with a database, ensure the database connection used has only the necessary permissions (e.g., read-only access if it only needs to retrieve data).
    * **Limit External System Access:** If a resolver interacts with external systems, ensure it has the minimal required permissions on those systems.
    * **Avoid Elevated Privileges:**  Never run resolvers or converters with elevated privileges unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.

**6. Detection and Prevention During Development:**

* **Code Reviews:**  Thoroughly review the implementation of all custom resolvers and converters, paying close attention to how user input is handled. Look for any instances of direct string concatenation for building commands or queries.
* **Unit Testing:**  Write unit tests specifically designed to test the robustness of resolvers and converters against malicious input. Inject various forms of potentially harmful data to see how the code behaves.
* **Integration Testing:**  Test the entire data flow, including the mapping process, with potentially malicious input to ensure that vulnerabilities are not introduced at different stages.
* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Integrate SAST tools into the development pipeline to automatically scan the codebase for potential code injection vulnerabilities in custom resolvers and converters.
* **Developer Training:** Educate developers about the risks of code injection and secure coding practices for implementing custom mapping logic.

**7. Security Testing Strategies:**

* **Penetration Testing:**  Engage security professionals to perform penetration testing, specifically targeting the areas where custom resolvers and converters are used.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Utilize DAST tools to test the running application by simulating attacks and observing its behavior.
* **Fuzzing:**  Use fuzzing techniques to inject a large volume of random and malformed data into the application to identify potential vulnerabilities in input processing.

**8. Developer Guidelines for Secure Custom Resolvers/Converters:**

* **Treat all external data as untrusted.**
* **Always validate and sanitize user input before using it in resolvers or converters.**
* **Prefer parameterized queries or stored procedures for database interactions.**
* **Avoid dynamic code execution within resolvers and converters.**
* **Apply the principle of least privilege.**
* **Conduct thorough code reviews and security testing.**
* **Stay updated on common code injection vulnerabilities and best practices for prevention.**

**9. Conclusion:**

The ability to define custom resolvers and converters in AutoMapper offers significant flexibility but introduces a critical attack surface if not handled with utmost care. Developers must be acutely aware of the risks associated with directly processing user-controlled input within these custom components. By implementing robust input validation, avoiding dynamic code execution, adhering to secure coding practices, and conducting thorough security testing, development teams can significantly mitigate the risk of code injection vulnerabilities in applications utilizing AutoMapper. A proactive and security-conscious approach is paramount to ensuring the integrity and security of the application and its data.
