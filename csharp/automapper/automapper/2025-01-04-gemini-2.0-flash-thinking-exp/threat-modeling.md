# Threat Model Analysis for automapper/automapper

## Threat: [Malicious Configuration Injection](./threats/malicious_configuration_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the source of Automapper configuration (e.g., a configuration file, database, or remote service) to inject malicious mapping rules *that Automapper then uses*. This could involve adding mappings that expose sensitive data, redirect data flow, or trigger unintended actions *within the mapping process*. The attacker might achieve this by compromising the storage location of the configuration or exploiting vulnerabilities in the configuration loading mechanism *that feeds into Automapper*.

**Impact:** Information disclosure (sensitive data mapped to unauthorized destinations), data manipulation (data altered during mapping), or unauthorized actions (mapping triggering specific application logic).

**Affected Component:** `MapperConfiguration` (specifically how profiles and mappings are defined and loaded *by Automapper*).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the storage and retrieval of Automapper configuration data.
* Implement integrity checks on configuration data to detect tampering *before Automapper loads it*.
* Use a principle of least privilege when defining mappings, only mapping necessary properties *within Automapper profiles*.
* Avoid loading configuration from untrusted sources.

## Threat: [Unintended Side Effects in Custom Mapping Logic](./threats/unintended_side_effects_in_custom_mapping_logic.md)

**Description:** Developers implement custom mapping logic *within Automapper profiles* (e.g., using `MapFrom()` with complex expressions or custom resolvers) that contains vulnerabilities. An attacker can influence the source data or application state to trigger these vulnerabilities *during the Automapper mapping process*, leading to unintended actions, code execution, or data manipulation.

**Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability in the custom logic, including data manipulation, unauthorized access, or even remote code execution if the logic interacts with external systems insecurely *from within Automapper's context*.

**Affected Component:** `MapFrom()` method, custom type converters, and `IValueResolver` implementations *within Automapper*.

**Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly review and test all custom mapping logic for potential vulnerabilities (e.g., injection flaws, insecure API calls).
* Avoid performing complex or security-sensitive operations within custom mapping logic if possible.
* Sanitize and validate any external data used within custom mapping logic *before or during its use by Automapper*.
* Follow secure coding practices when implementing custom resolvers and converters.
