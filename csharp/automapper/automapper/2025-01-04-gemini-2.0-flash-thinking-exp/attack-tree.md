## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Automapper [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_automapper__critical_.md)

This is the root goal. The attacker's objective is to successfully compromise the application by exploiting vulnerabilities within the Automapper library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Automapper Configuration [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_automapper_configuration__critical_.md)

*   Goal: Alter the way Automapper behaves by manipulating its configuration.
*   Description: Attackers aim to modify Automapper's configuration to introduce vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Configuration [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_configuration__critical_.md)

*   Description: Introduce malicious configuration settings that can be interpreted and executed by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_configuration_files.md)

*   Description: If Automapper's configuration is loaded from serialized files (e.g., XML, JSON), an attacker might inject malicious payloads that execute code upon deserialization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Configuration Source (e.g., Database, Environment Variables)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_configuration_source__e_g___database__environment_variables_.md)

*   Description: If configuration is loaded from external sources like databases or environment variables, compromising these sources allows attackers to inject malicious configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Mapping Logic Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_mapping_logic_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   Goal: Leverage weaknesses in how Automapper performs object-to-object mapping.
*   Description: Focus on exploiting the core functionality of Automapper â€“ the mapping process itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Type Confusion/Mismatch Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/type_confusionmismatch_exploitation.md)

*   Description: Exploiting situations where Automapper attempts to map between incompatible types.

## Attack Tree Path: [Force Mapping Between Incompatible Types Leading to Data Corruption or Unexpected Behavior](./attack_tree_paths/force_mapping_between_incompatible_types_leading_to_data_corruption_or_unexpected_behavior.md)

*   Description: Manipulating input data to force Automapper to map between types that are not directly compatible, potentially leading to data loss, corruption, or unexpected application behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Implicit Type Conversions to Inject Malicious Data](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_implicit_type_conversions_to_inject_malicious_data.md)

*   Description: Leveraging implicit type conversions performed by Automapper to inject data that bypasses security checks or introduces vulnerabilities. For example, converting a string to an integer might truncate data or lead to unexpected values.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Custom Mapping Logic [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_custom_mapping_logic__critical_.md)

*   Description: Targeting vulnerabilities introduced by custom mapping logic provided by developers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Custom Type Converters or Resolvers](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_custom_type_converters_or_resolvers.md)

*   Description: If custom type converters or resolvers are used, attackers might try to inject malicious code that gets executed during the mapping process. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the custom code itself or manipulating input data to trigger unintended execution paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Logic Errors in Custom Mapping Functions](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_logic_errors_in_custom_mapping_functions.md)

*   Description: Logic flaws in custom mapping functions can be exploited to manipulate data or bypass security checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Member Mapping Configuration Issues](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_member_mapping_configuration_issues.md)

*   Description: Targeting vulnerabilities arising from how specific members are mapped.

## Attack Tree Path: [Map Sensitive Data to Unprotected Fields](./attack_tree_paths/map_sensitive_data_to_unprotected_fields.md)

*   Description:  Configuration errors might lead to sensitive data being inadvertently mapped to fields that are not properly protected or exposed through API endpoints.
