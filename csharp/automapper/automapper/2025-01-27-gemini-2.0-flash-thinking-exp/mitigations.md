# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for automapper/automapper

## Mitigation Strategy: [Favor Explicit Configuration over Convention-Based Mapping](./mitigation_strategies/favor_explicit_configuration_over_convention-based_mapping.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1:  Review all existing AutoMapper configurations in your project. Identify any configurations that rely on default convention-based mapping.
    *   Step 2: For each convention-based mapping, explicitly define the mapping using `CreateMap<TSource, TDestination>()`.
    *   Step 3: Within each `CreateMap`, use `ForMember(dest => dest.PropertyName, opt => opt.MapFrom(src => src.SourcePropertyName))` to explicitly map each property you intend to transfer.
    *   Step 4:  For properties that should *not* be mapped, do not include them in the `ForMember` definitions.
    *   Step 5: Regularly review and maintain these explicit mappings as your data models evolve.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Data - Severity: High
    *   Over-Mapping and Information Disclosure - Severity: Medium
    *   Unexpected Data Modification due to unintended mappings - Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Data: High Reduction
    *   Over-Mapping and Information Disclosure: High Reduction
    *   Unexpected Data Modification due to unintended mappings: Medium Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** [Project Specific Location] - [Specify Yes/No/Partial and location in your project]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [Project Specific Location or N/A] - [Specify location if not fully implemented, or N/A if fully implemented]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use `Ignore()` to Explicitly Exclude Properties](./mitigation_strategies/use__ignore____to_explicitly_exclude_properties.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Review all explicit `CreateMap` configurations.
    *   Step 2: Identify properties in the destination objects that should *never* be mapped from the source, especially sensitive data.
    *   Step 3: For each such property, add `.ForMember(dest => dest.SensitiveProperty, opt => opt.Ignore())` within the corresponding `CreateMap` definition.
    *   Step 4:  Document the ignored properties and the reason for ignoring them.
    *   Step 5:  Periodically review ignored properties to ensure they remain correctly excluded.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Data - Severity: High
    *   Information Disclosure through Unintended Property Mapping - Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Data: High Reduction
    *   Information Disclosure through Unintended Property Mapping: High Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** [Project Specific Location] - [Specify Yes/No/Partial and location]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [Project Specific Location or N/A] - [Specify location if not fully implemented, or N/A if fully implemented]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use `ConvertUsing()` for Custom and Secure Type Conversions](./mitigation_strategies/use__convertusing____for_custom_and_secure_type_conversions.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify scenarios where AutoMapper performs type conversions, especially when converting user-provided input or sensitive data.
    *   Step 2: For these conversions, use `ForMember().ConvertUsing(converter)` to define custom conversion logic instead of relying on AutoMapper's default type conversion.
    *   Step 3: Implement the custom converter logic to include:
        *   Strict input validation and sanitization *within the converter*.
        *   Error handling for invalid input formats or conversion failures.
        *   Secure type transformation logic.
    *   Step 4:  Test custom converters thoroughly to ensure secure handling of various input scenarios.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Type Conversion Vulnerabilities (e.g., integer overflows, format string bugs) - Severity: Medium to High
    *   Injection Attacks through type conversion manipulation - Severity: Medium
    *   Data Integrity Issues due to incorrect or insecure conversions - Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   Type Conversion Vulnerabilities: High Reduction
    *   Injection Attacks through type conversion manipulation: Medium Reduction
    *   Data Integrity Issues due to incorrect or insecure conversions: High Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** [Project Specific Location] - [Specify Yes/No/Partial and location]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [Project Specific Location or N/A] - [Specify location if not fully implemented, or N/A if fully implemented]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Be Mindful of Type Conversion Vulnerabilities](./mitigation_strategies/be_mindful_of_type_conversion_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1:  Educate developers about potential security risks associated with automatic and implicit type conversions within AutoMapper.
    *   Step 2:  Review AutoMapper configurations and code involving type conversions, especially from strings to numbers, dates, and complex types.
    *   Step 3:  Where possible and for critical data, replace reliance on AutoMapper's automatic conversions with explicit parsing and validation logic *outside* of AutoMapper or within `ConvertUsing()`.
    *   Step 4:  Implement robust error handling for parsing failures and invalid input during type conversion.
    *   Step 5:  Conduct security testing specifically targeting type conversion vulnerabilities in AutoMapper mappings.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Type Conversion Vulnerabilities - Severity: Medium to High
    *   Data Integrity Issues due to unexpected conversion behavior - Severity: Medium
    *   Potential for bypass of input validation through type conversion manipulation - Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   Type Conversion Vulnerabilities: Medium Reduction
    *   Data Integrity Issues due to unexpected conversion behavior: Medium Reduction
    *   Potential for bypass of input validation through type conversion manipulation: Low Reduction

## Mitigation Strategy: [Static Configuration Where Possible](./mitigation_strategies/static_configuration_where_possible.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Review your AutoMapper configuration loading mechanism.
    *   Step 2: If using dynamic configuration, evaluate if static, code-defined configuration is feasible.

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: If dynamic configuration loading from files is used, identify configuration file locations.
    *   Step 2: Implement strict access control to restrict access to these files.
    *   Step 3: Ensure only authorized users/processes have read access.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate Configuration Sources](./mitigation_strategies/validate_configuration_sources.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: If dynamic configuration is loaded from external sources, implement validation of configuration data after loading.
    *   Step 2: Validate structure, schema, and integrity of loaded configuration data.
    *   Step 3: Use checksums, digital signatures, or integrity checks to ensure configuration data integrity.
