# Threat Model Analysis for automapper/automapper

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration Storage and Management](./threats/insecure_configuration_storage_and_management.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to AutoMapper configuration files. They might read these files to understand sensitive data mappings and application data structures, potentially leading to targeted attacks. In a more severe scenario, they could modify these configurations to alter data mappings, potentially leading to data corruption or unauthorized data access when the application uses the modified configuration.

**Impact:** Information disclosure of sensitive data mappings and application structure (High). Data manipulation and unauthorized data access if configurations are modified (Critical).

**Affected AutoMapper Component:** Configuration Loading, Profile Definitions, Mapping Configurations.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (Critical if configuration modification is easily achievable and leads to significant impact).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust access control mechanisms to protect configuration file storage locations.
*   Encrypt configuration files, especially if they contain sensitive information or connection strings.
*   Store configurations outside of publicly accessible web directories.
*   Utilize secure configuration management practices and tools with audit logging.
*   Regularly audit access to configuration files and configuration management systems.

## Threat: [Overly Permissive or Unnecessary Mapping Configurations](./threats/overly_permissive_or_unnecessary_mapping_configurations.md)

**Description:** Developers create AutoMapper configurations that map sensitive or internal properties into DTOs or view models that are exposed to users or external systems. An attacker, with legitimate access to the application's API or UI, can then access this unintentionally exposed sensitive information by exploiting the overly broad mappings.

**Impact:** Information disclosure of sensitive data, data leakage, violation of the principle of least privilege, potential privacy breaches (High).

**Affected AutoMapper Component:** Profile Definitions, Mapping Configurations, Convention-Based Mapping.

**Risk Severity:** High (due to potential for direct sensitive data exposure).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly adhere to the principle of least privilege when defining mappings. Only map properties that are absolutely necessary for the intended purpose.
*   Favor explicit mapping configurations over relying solely on convention-based mapping, especially for sensitive data.
*   Conduct regular and thorough reviews and audits of mapping configurations to identify and rectify overly permissive mappings.
*   Design DTOs and View Models to be highly specific to their use cases, minimizing the risk of accidental data exposure.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Mapping Logic](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_mapping_logic.md)

**Description:** Developers introduce security vulnerabilities within custom mapping logic implemented using features like `ConvertUsing`, `MapFrom`, or custom resolvers. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by providing crafted input data that is processed by these custom mappings, or by triggering application flows that utilize these vulnerable mappings. This could lead to various severe outcomes depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom code. For example, insecure handling of external data within custom logic could lead to injection vulnerabilities or data corruption.

**Impact:** Data corruption, application errors, information disclosure, potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) if custom logic interacts with external systems insecurely or performs unsafe operations (High to Critical, potentially Critical if RCE is possible).

**Affected AutoMapper Component:** `ConvertUsing`, `MapFrom`, Custom Resolvers, Mapping Engine.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (Critical if custom logic is complex, handles sensitive data, and introduces severe vulnerabilities like RCE).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Apply rigorous secure coding practices when developing custom mapping logic.
*   Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization within custom mapping logic, especially when dealing with external data or user input.
*   Thoroughly test custom mapping logic, including boundary conditions, error handling, and security-related test cases.
*   Conduct mandatory code reviews of all custom mapping logic to identify potential vulnerabilities before deployment.
*   Minimize the complexity of custom mapping logic and avoid performing security-sensitive operations directly within mapping functions. Delegate such operations to dedicated, well-secured services.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the AutoMapper Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the_automapper_library_itself.md)

**Description:** A zero-day or unpatched security vulnerability exists within the AutoMapper library code. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if the application uses a vulnerable version of AutoMapper. Exploitation methods are dependent on the specific vulnerability, but could range from denial of service to remote code execution.

**Impact:**  Potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), or other severe impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability (Critical).

**Affected AutoMapper Component:** Core Library Code, Mapping Engine, potentially any component depending on the vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (due to potential for severe impact like RCE).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Proactively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for AutoMapper and its dependencies.
*   Maintain AutoMapper at the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
*   Implement a rapid patch management process to quickly apply security updates when vulnerabilities are disclosed.
*   Utilize Software Composition Analysis (SCA) or dependency scanning tools to automatically detect known vulnerabilities in AutoMapper and its dependencies within your project.
