## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via AutoMapper [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_automapper__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate attacker goal. Success means gaining unauthorized access, control, or causing significant harm to the application through vulnerabilities related to AutoMapper.
*   **Why Critical:** Represents the highest level objective and encompasses all potential successful attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit AutoMapper Core Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_automapper_core_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Targeting hypothetical vulnerabilities within the AutoMapper library's core code itself.
*   **Why Critical:**  Core vulnerabilities, while less likely, have a wide-reaching impact affecting all applications using the library.

    *   **2.1. Code Execution Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting a vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Code execution is the most severe vulnerability, leading to complete system compromise.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **2.1.1. Malicious Profile Injection (Requires Application Vuln) [CRITICAL NODE]**
                *   **Description:**  Exploiting a vulnerability in the *application* (not AutoMapper itself) that allows injecting a malicious AutoMapper profile.
                *   **Why Critical:**  Leads to code execution.
                *   **Exploitation:**
                    *   Attacker identifies an application vulnerability that allows control over AutoMapper profile loading or creation (e.g., via user-controlled configuration files, database entries, or API parameters).
                    *   Attacker crafts a malicious AutoMapper profile containing code execution payloads, potentially within custom resolvers or converters defined in the profile.
                    *   Attacker injects this malicious profile into the application.
                    *   When the application uses AutoMapper with the injected profile, the malicious code is executed.
                *   **Mitigation:**
                    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Never allow untrusted user input to directly influence AutoMapper profile loading or creation.
                    *   **Secure Configuration Management:**  Store and manage AutoMapper profiles securely, preventing unauthorized modification.
                    *   **Code Review:**  Thoroughly review code that handles profile loading and configuration for potential injection vulnerabilities.

            *   **2.1.2. Vulnerable Custom Resolver/Converter (Developer Responsibility) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]**
                *   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities within *developer-written* custom resolvers or converters used by AutoMapper.
                *   **Why High-Risk:**  Relies on developer error, which is a more common source of vulnerabilities than core library flaws. Code execution impact is critical.
                *   **Exploitation:**
                    *   Attacker analyzes the application and identifies the use of custom resolvers or converters in AutoMapper mappings.
                    *   Attacker examines the code of these custom components, looking for vulnerabilities such as:
                        *   Code injection flaws (e.g., using `eval`, `Process.Start` with unsanitized input).
                        *   Buffer overflows (if custom code handles memory unsafely).
                        *   Insecure deserialization (if custom code deserializes data from untrusted sources).
                    *   Attacker crafts input data that, when processed by AutoMapper and the vulnerable custom component, triggers the vulnerability and allows code execution.
                *   **Mitigation:**
                    *   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Follow secure coding guidelines when developing custom resolvers and converters. Avoid dangerous functions and ensure proper input validation and sanitization within custom code.
                    *   **Code Review and Security Testing:**  Thoroughly review and security test all custom resolvers and converters. Use static analysis and dynamic testing tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.
                    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run the application with minimal necessary permissions to limit the impact of code execution vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misuse/Configuration of AutoMapper [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misuseconfiguration_of_automapper__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from incorrect or insecure usage of AutoMapper by developers.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Misuse is a more common and likely attack vector than core library vulnerabilities.

    *   **3.1. Logic/Data Manipulation [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting incorrect mappings or type mismatches to manipulate application logic or data in unintended ways.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Can lead to data corruption, logic errors, and potentially security bypasses. Type confusion is a common developer mistake.
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   **3.1.1. Type Confusion/Mismatched Mapping (Data Integrity Issues) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]**
                *   **Description:**  AutoMapper configured with incorrect or ambiguous mappings inadvertently maps data to wrong properties or types, leading to data corruption or logic errors.
                *   **Why High-Risk:** Type confusion is a common developer oversight, especially in complex mappings. Can lead to data integrity issues and security bypasses if type safety is relied upon for security decisions.
                *   **Exploitation:**
                    *   Attacker analyzes AutoMapper mappings and identifies potential type mismatches or ambiguous mappings.
                    *   Attacker crafts input data designed to exploit these mismatches. For example, providing a string where an integer is expected, or vice versa, if the mapping is not strictly defined.
                    *   AutoMapper, following the incorrect mapping, transforms the data in an unintended way.
                    *   The application, relying on the incorrectly mapped data, performs actions based on corrupted or misinterpreted information, potentially leading to logic errors, data corruption, or security bypasses (e.g., bypassing access control checks if user roles are incorrectly mapped).
                *   **Mitigation:**
                    *   **Rigorous Mapping Definition:** Clearly define mappings, explicitly specifying types and directions. Avoid ambiguous or implicit mappings.
                    *   **Unit Testing Mappings:** Thoroughly unit test all AutoMapper mappings, especially those involving sensitive data or critical application logic. Verify that data is transformed correctly and types are handled as expected.
                    *   **Data Validation Post-Mapping:** Implement validation checks *after* AutoMapper mapping to ensure data conforms to expected types, formats, and constraints. Do not solely rely on AutoMapper for data validation.

    *   **3.2. Denial of Service (DoS) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting AutoMapper to cause a denial of service, making the application unavailable.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** DoS attacks can significantly impact application availability and are relatively easy to execute.
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   **3.2.1. Resource Exhaustion (Memory/CPU) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]**
                *   **Description:** Mapping very large or deeply nested objects, especially with complex mappings, consumes excessive resources, leading to DoS.
                *   **Why High-Risk:** Resource exhaustion is a common and relatively easy DoS attack vector. Large or complex mappings, especially with user-controlled data, can be exploited.
                *   **Exploitation:**
                    *   Attacker identifies endpoints or functionalities that use AutoMapper for mapping data, especially those that process user-provided data.
                    *   Attacker crafts malicious requests containing extremely large or deeply nested data structures intended for mapping.
                    *   When the application attempts to map this data using AutoMapper, it consumes excessive CPU and memory resources.
                    *   Repeated requests of this type can exhaust server resources, leading to application slowdown or complete denial of service.
                *   **Mitigation:**
                    *   **Input Size Limits:** Implement strict limits on the size and complexity of input data that is processed by AutoMapper. Reject requests exceeding these limits.
                    *   **Resource Monitoring and Throttling:** Monitor application resource usage (CPU, memory). Implement throttling or rate limiting for mapping operations, especially for user-facing endpoints.
                    *   **Asynchronous Mapping:** For scenarios involving potentially large mappings, consider using asynchronous processing to prevent blocking the main application thread and improve responsiveness under load.
                    *   **Mapping Complexity Limits:**  Establish guidelines for mapping complexity and avoid overly complex configurations, especially when dealing with user-provided data.
