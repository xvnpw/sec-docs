# Attack Surface Analysis for automapper/automapper

## Attack Surface: [Custom Mapping Logic Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/custom_mapping_logic_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  When developers implement custom mapping logic using AutoMapper's features like `ConvertUsing` or `MapFrom`, vulnerabilities can be introduced within this custom code. This is especially critical if the custom logic handles external or user-controlled data without proper security measures.
*   **How AutoMapper Contributes:** AutoMapper provides extension points for custom logic execution during the mapping process. The security of this attack surface is entirely dependent on the security of the developer-written custom mapping code. AutoMapper itself facilitates the execution of this potentially vulnerable code within the application's context.
*   **Example:** A custom mapping function takes user input from a web request and uses it to dynamically construct a file path for reading data. If input validation is missing, an attacker could inject a malicious path (e.g., using path traversal) to access sensitive files on the server, leading to information disclosure or even code execution if the read file is later processed as code.
*   **Impact:** **Critical:** Code Injection, Arbitrary File Read/Write, Remote Code Execution, Application Logic Bypass, Data Manipulation, Privilege Escalation (depending on the context and vulnerabilities in custom logic).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Coding Practices in Custom Logic (Mandatory):**  Treat custom mapping code as security-sensitive code.  Strictly adhere to secure coding principles. **Never** use untrusted data directly in operations that can lead to code injection (e.g., dynamic code execution, command execution, SQL queries, file system operations).
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Crucial):**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all external or user-controlled data *before* it is used within custom mapping logic. Use allow-lists and escape/encode data appropriately for the context where it's used.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Apply to Custom Logic):**  Design custom mapping functions with the principle of least privilege. Limit their access to system resources and sensitive data. Avoid granting them unnecessary permissions.
    *   **Code Reviews and Security Testing (Essential):**  Mandatory code reviews specifically focused on the security aspects of custom mapping logic. Implement security testing, including penetration testing, to identify and address vulnerabilities in custom mappings.
    *   **Sandboxing/Isolation (Advanced):** In highly sensitive applications, consider sandboxing or isolating custom mapping logic to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Vulnerabilities Leading to Sensitive Data Exposure](./attack_surfaces/configuration_vulnerabilities_leading_to_sensitive_data_exposure.md)

*   **Description:**  Misconfigurations in AutoMapper, specifically overly broad or unintentional mappings, can lead to the exposure of sensitive data. This is a high-risk scenario when sensitive information from backend systems or internal objects is inadvertently mapped to publicly accessible outputs (e.g., API responses, user interfaces).
*   **How AutoMapper Contributes:** AutoMapper's configuration dictates what data is mapped and how.  A poorly designed or unreviewed configuration can unintentionally include sensitive properties in mappings, leading to data leaks. AutoMapper faithfully executes the configured mappings, regardless of their security implications if misconfigured.
*   **Example:** An AutoMapper profile is configured to broadly map properties between database entities and API Data Transfer Objects (DTOs).  A developer unintentionally includes a property containing user passwords (even if hashed) or internal system identifiers in the mapping. This sensitive data is then exposed in the API responses, potentially leading to account compromise or system information disclosure.
*   **Impact:** **High:** Information Disclosure, Data Breach, Exposure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Violation of Data Privacy Regulations, Reputational Damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege in Mapping Configuration (Critical):**  **Mandatory** application of the principle of least privilege to mapping configurations.  **Explicitly define** mappings to include only the *absolutely necessary* properties for the destination object.  **Default to deny** mapping and explicitly allow only required properties.
    *   **Regular Configuration Audits (Essential):**  Implement a process for regular audits of AutoMapper configurations, especially when changes are made to data models or API contracts. Verify that mappings are still secure and do not expose sensitive data.
    *   **Data Classification and Sensitivity Awareness (Crucial):**  Clearly classify data based on sensitivity levels. Ensure that AutoMapper configurations are designed with awareness of data sensitivity and prevent mapping of sensitive data to less secure contexts.
    *   **Automated Configuration Validation (Recommended):**  Implement automated checks or unit tests that validate AutoMapper configurations against security policies and data sensitivity rules. These tests should fail if sensitive data is inadvertently included in mappings intended for less secure contexts.
    *   **Secure Development Training (Proactive):**  Train developers on secure AutoMapper configuration practices and the risks of over-mapping and unintentional data exposure.
