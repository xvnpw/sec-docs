# Threat Model Analysis for automapper/automapper

## Threat: [Unintended Data Overwriting due to Incorrect Mapping Configuration](./threats/unintended_data_overwriting_due_to_incorrect_mapping_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker could potentially manipulate data by exploiting loosely defined mappings within AutoMapper. They might provide input data containing values for properties that should not be mapped or overwritten in the destination object. This is a direct consequence of how AutoMapper is configured to map data.

**Impact:** Data corruption, unintended changes in application state, potential privilege escalation if security-sensitive properties are affected.

**Affected AutoMapper Component:** Mapping Configuration (specifically, the `CreateMap` and `ForMember` methods).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review and explicitly define all mapping configurations within AutoMapper.
*   Use `ForMember` with conditional logic (`Condition`) within AutoMapper's configuration to restrict mapping based on specific criteria.
*   Utilize `Ignore()` within AutoMapper's configuration to explicitly prevent mapping of certain properties.
*   Implement unit tests specifically targeting AutoMapper mappings to verify behavior and prevent unintended overwrites.

## Threat: [Information Leakage through Unintended Property Mapping](./threats/information_leakage_through_unintended_property_mapping.md)

**Description:** An attacker might gain access to sensitive information if internal properties of the source object are inadvertently mapped to the destination object by AutoMapper, which is then exposed (e.g., through an API response). This directly stems from how AutoMapper is configured to transfer data between objects.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data (e.g., internal IDs, security-related flags, implementation details), potentially leading to further attacks or compliance violations.

**Affected AutoMapper Component:** Mapping Configuration (specifically, the `CreateMap` and default mapping behavior within AutoMapper).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully design Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) that only contain necessary information for external communication, and configure AutoMapper to map to these DTOs.
*   Explicitly define mappings in AutoMapper and avoid relying on default mapping conventions for sensitive data.
*   Use `Ignore()` within AutoMapper's configuration to prevent mapping of internal or sensitive properties to external-facing DTOs.
*   Regularly audit AutoMapper mapping configurations to ensure no unintended information is being exposed.

## Threat: [Security Issues in Custom Value Resolvers or Type Converters](./threats/security_issues_in_custom_value_resolvers_or_type_converters.md)

**Description:** If developers implement custom value resolvers or type converters for use with AutoMapper, vulnerabilities within this custom code can be directly exploited. This is a risk introduced by extending AutoMapper's functionality with custom logic.

**Impact:** Code execution on the server, access to sensitive resources, data breaches, denial of service, depending on the vulnerability in the custom code.

**Affected AutoMapper Component:** Custom Value Resolvers and Custom Type Converters registered and used by AutoMapper.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Treat custom value resolvers and type converters used with AutoMapper as security-sensitive code.
*   Apply secure coding practices, including input validation, output encoding, and avoiding insecure functions within custom AutoMapper components.
*   Thoroughly review and test custom logic used with AutoMapper for potential vulnerabilities.
*   Consider using established and well-vetted libraries for common conversion tasks instead of writing custom code for AutoMapper.
