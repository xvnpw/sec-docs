## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploit Misconfiguration or Insecure Usage -> Insecure Custom Mapping Logic -> Code Injection via Custom Mapping Function -> Inject Malicious Code](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploit_misconfiguration_or_insecure_usage_-_insecure_custom_mapping_logic_-_code_i_0ef9b6b5.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path targets applications that utilize custom mapping logic within Automapper and fail to sanitize inputs or restrict the capabilities of the custom mapping functions.
*   **Steps:**
    *   **Identify Custom Mapping Function:** The attacker first needs to identify if and how custom mapping functions are being used within the application's Automapper configuration. This might involve code analysis, reverse engineering, or observing application behavior.
    *   **Inject Malicious Code:** If dynamic code execution is possible within the custom mapping function (e.g., through reflection to set private fields based on input, or less likely, dynamic compilation), the attacker crafts input that, when processed by this function, executes arbitrary code. This could involve manipulating strings used in reflection calls or exploiting vulnerabilities in dynamic compilation if used.
*   **Impact:** Successful code injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to full application compromise, data breaches, and potential control over the underlying infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploit Misconfiguration or Insecure Usage -> Insecure Custom Mapping Logic -> Data Manipulation via Custom Mapping Logic -> Provide Input that Leads to Undesired Data Transformation](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploit_misconfiguration_or_insecure_usage_-_insecure_custom_mapping_logic_-_data_m_8cb64789.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path exploits flaws in the custom mapping logic to manipulate data in unintended ways.
*   **Steps:**
    *   **Identify Custom Mapping Logic:** The attacker analyzes the custom mapping logic to understand how data transformations are performed. This could involve examining the code or observing how different inputs affect the output.
    *   **Provide Input that Leads to Undesired Data Transformation:** The attacker crafts specific input that exploits vulnerabilities or flaws in the custom mapping logic. This could involve providing values that cause incorrect calculations, bypass conditional logic, or lead to the creation of manipulated data.
*   **Impact:** Successful data manipulation can lead to data corruption, privilege escalation (e.g., changing user roles), bypassing business logic (e.g., completing transactions without payment), and other unintended consequences that benefit the attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Exploit Misconfiguration or Insecure Usage -> Lack of Input Validation Before Mapping -> Provide Malicious Input that Exploits Downstream Processing](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_exploit_misconfiguration_or_insecure_usage_-_lack_of_input_validation_before_mappin_708c8e20.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path targets applications that do not properly validate user input before passing it to Automapper for mapping.
*   **Steps:**
    *   **Identify Input Fields Used in Mapping:** The attacker identifies which input fields are directly used as the source for Automapper mappings. This can be done through code analysis, API documentation, or by observing how the application handles user input.
    *   **Provide Malicious Input that Exploits Downstream Processing:** The attacker provides malicious input that bypasses any client-side or initial server-side validation. This malicious data is then mapped to internal objects by Automapper. The vulnerability lies in how this mapped data is subsequently used in other parts of the application. For example, if the mapped data is used in a database query without proper sanitization, it could lead to SQL injection.
*   **Impact:** The impact of this attack depends on the nature of the downstream vulnerability. It can range from data breaches (SQL injection), to remote code execution (command injection), or other forms of application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Misconfiguration or Insecure Usage](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_misconfiguration_or_insecure_usage.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This node represents the broad category of vulnerabilities arising from incorrect or insecure ways the application utilizes Automapper.
*   **Impact:** Successfully exploiting this node opens the door to various high-risk paths, including those involving insecure custom mapping logic and lack of input validation. Addressing issues at this level can prevent multiple types of attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Insecure Custom Mapping Logic](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_insecure_custom_mapping_logic.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This node highlights the risk associated with using custom mapping functions without proper security considerations.
*   **Impact:** Compromising this node allows attackers to potentially inject malicious code or manipulate data, leading to severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Code Injection via Custom Mapping Function](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_code_injection_via_custom_mapping_function.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This node represents a direct path to achieving remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation of this node grants the attacker complete control over the application server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Data Manipulation via Custom Mapping Logic](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_data_manipulation_via_custom_mapping_logic.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This node represents a direct path to compromising data integrity and potentially bypassing business logic.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to financial losses, unauthorized access, and other detrimental outcomes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Lack of Input Validation Before Mapping](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_lack_of_input_validation_before_mapping.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This node highlights a fundamental security flaw where untrusted data is directly used in the mapping process without proper sanitization.
*   **Impact:** Compromising this node allows attackers to inject malicious data that can be exploited in various downstream components, leading to a wide range of potential vulnerabilities.
