# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for automapper/automapper

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicitly Define Mappings](./mitigation_strategies/explicitly_define_mappings.md)

### Description:

1.  **Replace convention-based mappings with explicit configurations:** For each mapping scenario, use `CreateMap<TSource, TDestination>()` in your AutoMapper profiles instead of relying on default conventions.
2.  **Specify each property mapping using `.ForMember()`:** Within each `CreateMap`, explicitly define property mappings using `.ForMember(dest => dest.PropertyName, opt => opt.MapFrom(src => src.SourcePropertyName))` or `.ForMember(dest => dest.PropertyName, opt => opt.Ignore())`.
3.  **Avoid global convention-based configurations:**  Refrain from using `Mapper.Initialize` with configurations that broadly apply conventions without explicit definitions.

### List of Threats Mitigated:

*   **Unintended Property Exposure (High Severity):**  Reduces accidental mapping of sensitive properties.
*   **Data Leaks (High Severity):** Prevents unintentional disclosure of sensitive information through over-mapping.

### Impact:

*   **Unintended Property Exposure:** High reduction. Explicit mappings provide precise control.
*   **Data Leaks:** High reduction. Explicit definitions force consideration of each property.

### Currently Implemented:

Partially implemented in `Api.MappingProfiles`, but older modules rely on conventions.

### Missing Implementation:

In modules with convention-based mappings, especially for API responses and data persistence.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize `Ignore()` for Sensitive Properties](./mitigation_strategies/utilize__ignore____for_sensitive_properties.md)

### Description:

1.  **Identify sensitive properties:** Determine properties containing sensitive information.
2.  **Use `.ForMember(dest => dest.SensitiveProperty, opt => opt.Ignore())`:** In mapping profiles, explicitly use `.ForMember()` with `.Ignore()` for sensitive properties in destination types (especially DTOs).
3.  **Apply to all relevant mappings:** Ensure `.Ignore()` is used where sensitive source properties could map to external or persistent destination types.

### List of Threats Mitigated:

*   **Unintended Property Exposure (High Severity):**  Directly prevents mapping of sensitive properties.
*   **Data Leaks (High Severity):**  Significantly reduces data leak risk by preventing sensitive data transfer.

### Impact:

*   **Unintended Property Exposure:** High reduction. `.Ignore()` directly prevents property mapping.
*   **Data Leaks:** High reduction. Explicitly ignoring sensitive properties eliminates leak risk via AutoMapper.

### Currently Implemented:

Partially implemented for obvious sensitive fields like passwords in user DTOs.

### Missing Implementation:

In mappings for internal DTOs, logging DTOs, and data persistence, requiring a comprehensive review for missing `Ignore()` usages.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Employ Projection and Selectivity](./mitigation_strategies/employ_projection_and_selectivity.md)

### Description:

1.  **Use `ProjectTo<TDto>(configuration)` (with ORM):** When querying data with an ORM like Entity Framework, use AutoMapper's `ProjectTo<TDto>(configuration)` on `IQueryable` to project directly at the database level.
2.  **Use `Select()` for manual projection (without ORM projection):** If ORM projection isn't used, apply LINQ's `Select()` *before* AutoMapper mapping to select only necessary properties.
3.  **Avoid fetching entire entities then mapping:**  Refrain from fetching full objects and then mapping to DTOs; use projection instead.

### List of Threats Mitigated:

*   **Unintended Property Exposure (Medium Severity):** Reduces risk by limiting data retrieved from the source.
*   **Data Leaks (Medium Severity):**  Minimizes leak potential by processing and mapping only necessary data.
*   **Performance and DoS Risks (Low Severity):** Improves performance by reducing data transfer and processing.

### Impact:

*   **Unintended Property Exposure:** Medium reduction. Projection limits data available for mapping.
*   **Data Leaks:** Medium reduction. Projection helps limit data flow.
*   **Performance and DoS Risks:** Low reduction. Performance gains are beneficial, but rate limiting is primary DoS mitigation.

### Currently Implemented:

Partially implemented in newer API endpoints using Entity Framework and `ProjectTo<TDto>()`.

### Missing Implementation:

In older API endpoints, background services, and data processing tasks still fetching and mapping entire entities.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Define Explicit Type Converters for Complex Types](./mitigation_strategies/define_explicit_type_converters_for_complex_types.md)

### Description:

1.  **Identify complex/sensitive types:** Find data types needing custom conversion, especially security-sensitive, custom formats, or validation-required types.
2.  **Create custom type converters:** Implement `ITypeConverter<TSource, TDestination>` or use `ConvertUsing(Func<TSource, TDestination>)` in profiles for custom conversion logic.
3.  **Implement secure conversion logic:** Include input validation, error handling, sanitization (if needed), and secure type conversion within custom converters.
4.  **Register converters in profiles:** Use `.ConvertUsing<TConverter>()` or `ConvertUsing(Func<TSource, TDestination>)` in `CreateMap` for relevant properties.

### List of Threats Mitigated:

*   **Data Integrity Risks (Medium Severity):** Prevents data corruption from insecure/incorrect conversions.
*   **Input Validation Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):**  Reduces vulnerabilities from processing invalid input during conversion.
*   **Unexpected Behavior (Medium Severity):**  Minimizes unexpected behavior from default converters handling complex types.

### Impact:

*   **Data Integrity Risks:** Medium reduction. Custom converters offer more control.
*   **Input Validation Vulnerabilities:** Medium reduction. Custom converters enable input validation.
*   **Unexpected Behavior:** Medium reduction. Explicit converters ensure predictable behavior.

### Currently Implemented:

Rarely implemented; default AutoMapper converters are mostly used.

### Missing Implementation:

For sensitive data types, custom formats, and scenarios needing validation/sanitization during conversion.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Optimize Mapping Configurations for Performance](./mitigation_strategies/optimize_mapping_configurations_for_performance.md)

### Description:

1.  **Analyze mapping performance:** Identify slow mappings using profiling or logging.
2.  **Simplify complex mappings:** Reduce nesting, avoid unnecessary mappings, use projection.
3.  **Use `MaxDepth()` to limit nesting:** Implement `MaxDepth(n)` in profiles to limit object graph traversal depth for potentially exploitable deep nesting.
4.  **Avoid unnecessary mappings:** Map only needed properties.

### List of Threats Mitigated:

*   **Performance and DoS Risks (Medium Severity):** Reduces DoS risk from resource-intensive mappings.
*   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Minimizes resource consumption.

### Impact:

*   **Performance and DoS Risks:** Medium reduction. Optimization improves performance.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Medium reduction. Optimized mappings reduce resource usage.

### Currently Implemented:

Partially implemented; some profiles are performance-conscious, but systematic optimization and `MaxDepth()` are not regularly used.

### Missing Implementation:

Systematic performance analysis, proactive optimization, and `MaxDepth()` implementation where deep nesting is a risk.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege in Mapping Configurations](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_in_mapping_configurations.md)

### Description:

1.  **Review mapping profiles:** Identify overly broad or permissive mappings.
2.  **Refine mappings to map only necessary properties:** Map only essential properties in destination objects.
3.  **Create specific mappings:** Use specific profiles for use cases instead of generic mappings.
4.  **Avoid overly complex mappings:** Use simpler alternatives when possible.

### List of Threats Mitigated:

*   **Unintended Property Exposure (Medium Severity):** Reduces risk by limiting mapping scope.
*   **Data Leaks (Medium Severity):**  Minimizes leak potential by mapping only essential data.
*   **Performance and DoS Risks (Low Severity):** Indirectly improves performance.

### Impact:

*   **Unintended Property Exposure:** Medium reduction. Least privilege reduces exposure surface.
*   **Data Leaks:** Medium reduction. Least privilege minimizes leak potential.
*   **Performance and DoS Risks:** Low reduction. Performance is a side effect.

### Currently Implemented:

Partially implemented; some profiles use specific DTOs, but systematic least privilege application is lacking.

### Missing Implementation:

Systematic review to enforce least privilege across all profiles, especially for API responses and external data transfers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Thoroughly Review Mapping Configurations](./mitigation_strategies/thoroughly_review_mapping_configurations.md)

### Description:

1.  **Incorporate mapping profile review into code review:** Add mapping profile review to code review checklists.
2.  **Security-focused mapping review:** Train developers or designate security champions for security-focused mapping reviews.
3.  **Automated mapping profile analysis (if feasible):** Use tools/scripts to analyze profiles for potential issues.
4.  **Regular scheduled reviews:** Periodically review all profiles, even without changes.
5.  **Document mapping rationale:** Document purpose of complex mappings within profiles as comments.

### List of Threats Mitigated:

*   **Unintended Property Exposure (Medium Severity):** Reduces oversights in configurations.
*   **Data Leaks (Medium Severity):**  Helps catch potential data leak vulnerabilities.
*   **Data Integrity Risks (Low Severity):**  Can identify type conversion or incorrect mapping issues.

### Impact:

*   **Unintended Property Exposure:** Medium reduction. Code reviews catch errors, but rely on vigilance.
*   **Data Leaks:** Medium reduction. Reviews can catch leaks, but are not foolproof.
*   **Data Integrity Risks:** Low reduction. Reviews can identify some issues, but testing is better.

### Currently Implemented:

Partially implemented; code reviews exist, but security-focused mapping review is not standard.

### Missing Implementation:

Formal security-focused review step for profiles in code review. Automated analysis tools and scheduled reviews are missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Audit and Review Mapping Profiles](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_audit_and_review_mapping_profiles.md)

### Description:

1.  **Establish audit schedule:** Define regular schedule (e.g., quarterly) for auditing mapping profiles.
2.  **Conduct security-focused audits:** Focus on security aspects during audits (data exposure, over-mapping, insecure conversions, least privilege).
3.  **Involve security experts:** Include security experts in audits.
4.  **Update profiles based on audits:** Refine profiles based on audit findings.
5.  **Document audit findings:** Document findings and actions taken.

### List of Threats Mitigated:

*   **All previously listed threats (Low to Medium Severity):** Regular audits detect and address various AutoMapper security risks.
*   **Security Drift (Medium Severity):** Prevents configurations from becoming outdated.

### Impact:

*   **All previously listed threats:** Low to Medium reduction. Audits are preventative.
*   **Security Drift:** Medium reduction. Audits maintain security alignment.

### Currently Implemented:

Not implemented; regular scheduled audits are not performed.

### Missing Implementation:

Formal process for regular security audits. Schedule, procedures, and security expert involvement are needed.
