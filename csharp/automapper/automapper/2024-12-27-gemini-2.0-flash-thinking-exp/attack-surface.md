*   **Attack Surface: Insecure Mapping Configuration Injection**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate external data sources that influence AutoMapper's configuration to inject malicious mapping rules.
    *   **How AutoMapper Contributes:** AutoMapper allows for dynamic configuration and the use of external data to define mappings. If this external data is not sanitized, attackers can inject malicious configurations.
    *   **Example:** An application reads mapping configurations from a database. An attacker gains access to the database and modifies a configuration to map a sensitive user property to a publicly accessible field.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potential for data corruption, or unexpected application behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate all external data used to configure AutoMapper mappings.
        *   Avoid dynamic configuration based on untrusted sources if possible.
        *   Implement strict access controls on configuration data sources.
        *   Use a predefined, code-based configuration where feasible.

*   **Attack Surface: Type Conversion Exploits via Custom Converters**
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within custom type converters or value resolvers used by AutoMapper can be exploited by providing specific input data.
    *   **How AutoMapper Contributes:** AutoMapper allows developers to define custom logic for type conversions. If this custom logic contains vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, format string bugs), AutoMapper acts as the entry point for exploiting them.
    *   **Example:** A custom converter for handling dates has a buffer overflow vulnerability. An attacker provides a specially crafted date string that, when processed by the converter, overwrites memory.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, or application crashes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test all custom value resolvers and type converters for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when implementing custom logic.
        *   Consider using built-in AutoMapper converters where possible.
        *   Implement input validation within custom converters to prevent unexpected data.

*   **Attack Surface: Data Truncation or Loss Leading to Security Bypass**
    *   **Description:** Mapping between data types with different sizes or precision can lead to data truncation or loss, potentially bypassing security checks or altering critical data.
    *   **How AutoMapper Contributes:** AutoMapper performs type conversions based on defined mappings. If a mapping implicitly truncates data without proper validation or awareness, it can lead to security issues.
    *   **Example:** Mapping a long password hash from a database (e.g., 64 characters) to a shorter field in a DTO (e.g., 32 characters) could truncate the hash, making authentication bypass easier.
    *   **Impact:** Security bypasses, data integrity issues, incorrect authorization decisions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully define mappings to avoid implicit data truncation.
        *   Implement explicit checks and validation when mapping between different data types.
        *   Consider using `ConvertUsing` with custom logic to handle potential truncation scenarios securely.
        *   Ensure destination types are large enough to accommodate the source data.
