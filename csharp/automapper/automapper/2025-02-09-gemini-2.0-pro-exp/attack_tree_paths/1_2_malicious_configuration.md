# AutoMapper Attack Tree Analysis: Deep Dive - Malicious Configuration (1.2)

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Malicious Configuration" attack vector against applications utilizing AutoMapper, identify specific vulnerabilities, propose concrete mitigation strategies, and provide actionable recommendations for the development team.  We aim to answer these key questions:

*   **How** can an attacker practically exploit a malicious configuration?
*   **What** are the potential impacts of a successful attack?
*   **Where** are the most likely points of vulnerability within a typical application?
*   **What specific AutoMapper features** are most susceptible to this attack?
*   **How can we prevent or mitigate** this attack vector effectively?

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on attack path 1.2, "Malicious Configuration," within the broader AutoMapper attack tree.  We will consider:

*   **AutoMapper versions:**  We'll primarily focus on recent, supported versions of AutoMapper, but will also consider potential vulnerabilities in older versions if relevant.
*   **Configuration sources:**  We'll examine various ways configurations can be loaded, including:
    *   Files (JSON, XML, YAML, etc.)
    *   Databases
    *   Environment variables
    *   User input (directly or indirectly)
    *   Third-party services
*   **AutoMapper features:** We'll analyze features that could be abused via configuration, including:
    *   Custom type converters
    *   Custom value resolvers
    *   Custom value transformers
    *   `AfterMap` and `BeforeMap` actions
    *   `ProjectTo` with custom expressions
    *   Conditional mapping (`.ForMember` with conditions)
    *   Unflattening/Flattening
    *   Configuration validation (or lack thereof)
*   **Application context:** We'll consider how the application uses AutoMapper (e.g., API endpoints, background jobs, data import/export) to understand the potential impact.
* **.NET version:** We will consider .NET version that is used by application.

We will *not* cover:

*   Attacks unrelated to AutoMapper configuration (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, unless they directly enable a malicious configuration).
*   General security best practices not specific to AutoMapper (e.g., input validation *before* it reaches AutoMapper, unless it's directly related to configuration).

### 1.3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Literature Review:**  Examine AutoMapper documentation, security advisories (if any), blog posts, and community discussions related to configuration vulnerabilities.
2.  **Code Review (Hypothetical):**  Analyze hypothetical (and, if available, real-world) code examples to identify potential vulnerabilities in how AutoMapper is configured and used.
3.  **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Development (Hypothetical):**  Create hypothetical PoC exploits to demonstrate the feasibility of the attack vector.  This will be done *without* targeting any live systems.
4.  **Threat Modeling:**  Apply threat modeling principles to identify potential attack scenarios and their impact.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies based on the findings.
6.  **Documentation and Reporting:**  Clearly document the findings, risks, and recommendations in this report.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.2: Malicious Configuration

### 2.1. Threat Landscape and Attack Scenarios

The core threat is that an attacker can inject or modify AutoMapper configurations to execute arbitrary code or manipulate data transformations in unintended ways.  Here are some likely attack scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1: Untrusted Configuration File:** An application loads AutoMapper configuration from a JSON file.  An attacker uploads a malicious JSON file (e.g., via a file upload vulnerability) that overrides the legitimate configuration.  This malicious configuration includes a custom type converter that executes arbitrary code.

*   **Scenario 2: Database Configuration Poisoning:**  The application stores AutoMapper configurations in a database.  An attacker gains access to the database (e.g., via SQL injection) and modifies a configuration entry to include a malicious `AfterMap` action that steals sensitive data.

*   **Scenario 3: Environment Variable Manipulation:** The application uses environment variables to configure parts of AutoMapper.  An attacker compromises the server environment and sets a malicious environment variable that injects a dangerous custom value resolver.

*   **Scenario 4: User-Controlled Configuration (Indirect):**  An application allows users to customize data transformations through a web interface.  While the application doesn't directly expose AutoMapper configuration, the user input is used to *construct* the configuration.  An attacker crafts malicious input that results in a dangerous configuration being generated.

*   **Scenario 5: Deserialization of Untrusted Configuration:** The application receives serialized AutoMapper configuration (e.g., over a network connection) from an untrusted source.  The attacker sends a maliciously crafted serialized configuration that, when deserialized, triggers unintended code execution.

### 2.2. Vulnerable AutoMapper Features

Several AutoMapper features, if misconfigured or used with untrusted input, can lead to vulnerabilities:

*   **Custom Type Converters (`ITypeConverter<TSource, TDestination>`):**  These allow developers to define custom logic for converting between types.  A malicious converter could execute arbitrary code during the mapping process.  This is a *high-risk* area.

*   **Custom Value Resolvers (`IValueResolver<TSource, TDestination, TMember>`):**  These resolve individual member values.  A malicious resolver could similarly execute arbitrary code or manipulate data in unexpected ways.  This is also *high-risk*.

*   **Custom Value Transformers (`.ConvertUsing()`):** Similar to resolvers, these allow for custom transformation logic, posing a similar risk.

*   **`AfterMap` and `BeforeMap` Actions:**  These actions are executed before or after the mapping occurs.  Malicious actions could perform unauthorized operations, such as writing to files, accessing network resources, or modifying global state.

*   **`ProjectTo` with Custom Expressions:**  If the application allows user-provided expressions to be used with `ProjectTo`, an attacker could inject malicious code into the expression. This is particularly dangerous if the expression is evaluated against a database.

*   **Conditional Mapping (`.ForMember` with conditions):** While less direct, complex conditions could be manipulated to trigger unintended mapping behavior.

*   **Configuration Validation (Lack Thereof):**  AutoMapper provides some configuration validation (`AssertConfigurationIsValid`), but it primarily checks for mapping completeness, *not* the safety of custom code within converters, resolvers, or actions.  If the application doesn't perform additional, custom validation of the configuration's *security implications*, it's vulnerable.

### 2.3. Hypothetical Proof-of-Concept (PoC) - Scenario 1 (Untrusted Configuration File)

Let's illustrate with a simplified, hypothetical PoC for Scenario 1.  This is for educational purposes only and should *never* be used against live systems.

**Vulnerable Application Code (Simplified):**

```csharp
// Vulnerable code - loads configuration from an untrusted file
public class MyService
{
    private readonly IMapper _mapper;

    public MyService(string configFilePath)
    {
        var config = new MapperConfiguration(cfg =>
        {
            // Load configuration from a file (potentially attacker-controlled)
            cfg.AddProfile(new AutoMapperProfile(configFilePath));
        });

        _mapper = config.CreateMapper();
    }

    public DestinationModel MapData(SourceModel source)
    {
        return _mapper.Map<DestinationModel>(source);
    }
}

public class AutoMapperProfile : Profile
{
    public AutoMapperProfile(string configFilePath)
    {
        // Load additional configuration from the file
        // In a real-world scenario, this might involve deserializing JSON, XML, etc.
        // For simplicity, we'll assume the file contains C# code that gets executed.
        // THIS IS HIGHLY VULNERABLE.
        var configCode = File.ReadAllText(configFilePath);
        // Execute the code from the file (DANGEROUS!)
        // In a real application, you would NEVER do this.
        // This is a simplified example to demonstrate the vulnerability.
        // You would likely use a deserializer here.
        ExecuteConfigCode(configCode);
    }

    private void ExecuteConfigCode(string code)
    {
        // In a real application, you would NEVER execute arbitrary code like this.
        // This is a simplified example for demonstration purposes.
        // Use a safe deserialization method instead.
        // ... (Imagine code execution here) ...
    }
}

public class SourceModel { public string Data { get; set; } }
public class DestinationModel { public string TransformedData { get; set; } }
```

**Malicious Configuration File (config.txt):**

```csharp
// Malicious configuration file (config.txt)
CreateMap<SourceModel, DestinationModel>()
    .ConvertUsing(new MaliciousConverter());

public class MaliciousConverter : ITypeConverter<SourceModel, DestinationModel>
{
    public DestinationModel Convert(SourceModel source, DestinationModel destination, ResolutionContext context)
    {
        // Execute arbitrary code (e.g., start a process)
        System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("calc.exe");

        // Perform the "normal" mapping (or not, to disrupt functionality)
        destination = new DestinationModel { TransformedData = source.Data.ToUpper() };
        return destination;
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  The `MyService` class loads an AutoMapper profile from a file specified by `configFilePath`.
2.  The `AutoMapperProfile` constructor reads the contents of this file and *executes it as C# code*.  This is a highly simplified and extremely dangerous example of how loading configuration from an untrusted source can lead to code execution.  In a real-world scenario, you would likely be deserializing JSON or XML, but the principle is the same: untrusted data is used to configure AutoMapper.
3.  The malicious `config.txt` file defines a custom type converter (`MaliciousConverter`) that uses `System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("calc.exe")` to execute arbitrary code (in this case, launching the calculator).
4.  When `MyService.MapData` is called, AutoMapper uses the malicious converter, triggering the code execution.

**Impact:**

The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Full system compromise.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive data.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Disrupting application functionality.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining higher privileges on the system.

### 2.4. Mitigation Strategies

Preventing malicious configuration attacks requires a multi-layered approach:

1.  **Never Trust Configuration Sources:**  Treat *all* configuration sources as potentially untrusted, even internal ones (e.g., databases can be compromised).

2.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges.  This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they achieve code execution.

3.  **Input Validation (Configuration Data):**
    *   **Schema Validation:** If using JSON, XML, or YAML for configuration, *strictly* validate the configuration against a predefined schema.  This schema should *only* allow known-safe configuration options and *disallow* any custom code or expressions.
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Types:**  If custom type converters or resolvers are *absolutely necessary*, maintain a whitelist of allowed types and *reject* any configuration that uses types not on the whitelist.
    *   **Sanitize Input:**  If configuration values are derived from user input, thoroughly sanitize the input *before* it's used to construct the configuration.

4.  **Secure Configuration Storage:**
    *   **Encryption:** Encrypt configuration files and database entries containing sensitive information.
    *   **Access Control:**  Restrict access to configuration files and database tables to only authorized users and processes.
    *   **Auditing:**  Log all changes to configuration data to detect unauthorized modifications.

5.  **Avoid Dynamic Code Execution:**  *Never* execute arbitrary code from configuration files or user input.  Use safe deserialization methods (e.g., with type whitelisting) and avoid features that allow dynamic code generation.

6.  **Harden AutoMapper Usage:**
    *   **Limit Custom Code:**  Minimize the use of custom type converters, resolvers, and `AfterMap`/`BeforeMap` actions.  If they are necessary, thoroughly review and test them for security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Avoid User-Controlled Expressions:**  Do *not* allow users to provide expressions for `ProjectTo` or other features that support dynamic code execution.
    *   **Use `AssertConfigurationIsValid` (But It's Not Enough):**  Call `AssertConfigurationIsValid` to catch basic mapping errors, but remember that it *doesn't* validate the security of custom code.

7.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

8.  **Dependency Management:** Keep AutoMapper and all other dependencies up-to-date to benefit from security patches.

9. **Sandboxing:** If custom type converters or resolvers are absolutely necessary, consider running them in a sandboxed environment with restricted privileges. This can limit the impact of a compromised converter. This is a more advanced technique and may not be feasible in all scenarios.

10. **Content Security Policy (CSP):** If the application is a web application, use a strict Content Security Policy to prevent the execution of unauthorized scripts, even if an attacker manages to inject malicious code.

### 2.5. Specific Recommendations for the Development Team

1.  **Immediate Action:**
    *   **Review all configuration loading mechanisms:** Identify all sources of AutoMapper configuration (files, databases, environment variables, etc.) and assess their trustworthiness.
    *   **Implement schema validation:**  If using structured configuration formats (JSON, XML, YAML), implement strict schema validation to prevent unexpected configuration elements.
    *   **Remove any dynamic code execution:**  Ensure that no configuration data is directly executed as code.

2.  **Short-Term Actions:**
    *   **Implement a whitelist for custom types:** If custom converters/resolvers are used, create a whitelist of allowed types and enforce it.
    *   **Review and harden custom code:**  Thoroughly review all custom type converters, resolvers, and `AfterMap`/`BeforeMap` actions for security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Implement secure configuration storage:**  Encrypt sensitive configuration data and restrict access to configuration sources.

3.  **Long-Term Actions:**
    *   **Refactor to minimize custom code:**  Explore ways to refactor the application to reduce the reliance on custom AutoMapper logic.
    *   **Implement sandboxing (if necessary):**  If custom code is unavoidable, consider sandboxing techniques.
    *   **Establish a regular security review process:**  Integrate security reviews into the development lifecycle.

4. **Training:** Provide training to developers about secure usage of AutoMapper.
