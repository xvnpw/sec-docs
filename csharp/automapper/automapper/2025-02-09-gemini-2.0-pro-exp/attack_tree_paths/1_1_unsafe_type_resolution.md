# Deep Analysis: AutoMapper - Unsafe Type Resolution Attack Path

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the "Unsafe Type Resolution" attack path within the context of our application's usage of AutoMapper.  We aim to:

*   **Identify specific vulnerabilities:** Determine if and how our application's configuration and usage of AutoMapper expose it to this attack vector.
*   **Assess the impact:**  Understand the potential consequences of a successful exploit, including the level of code execution achievable by an attacker.
*   **Develop mitigation strategies:**  Propose concrete, actionable steps to eliminate or significantly reduce the risk associated with this attack path.
*   **Enhance developer awareness:** Educate the development team about this specific vulnerability and best practices for secure AutoMapper usage.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following:

*   **Our application's code:**  All code that directly or indirectly interacts with AutoMapper, including configuration, mapping definitions, and calls to `Map` methods.
*   **AutoMapper configuration:**  The specific AutoMapper configuration used by our application, including profiles, custom type converters, and value resolvers.
*   **Input sources:**  Any external input (e.g., user input, API requests, database data) that could potentially influence the type resolution process within AutoMapper.  This includes data that might be used to construct type names or influence the selection of mapping configurations.
*   **AutoMapper version:** The specific version of AutoMapper being used (critical for identifying known vulnerabilities).  We will assume the latest stable version unless otherwise specified.  *It is crucial to document the exact version number here.*
* **.NET version:** The specific version of .NET being used.

This analysis *excludes* general security best practices unrelated to AutoMapper and vulnerabilities in other libraries or components of the application, except where they directly interact with the AutoMapper vulnerability.

## 3. Methodology

We will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review:**  Manual inspection of the application's codebase, focusing on:
    *   Uses of `Mapper.Map<TDestination>(source)` and related methods.
    *   AutoMapper configuration files (profiles, etc.).
    *   Custom type converters and value resolvers.
    *   Any logic that dynamically determines the destination type based on external input.
    *   Any use of `AllowNullCollections`, `AllowNullDestinationValues` or other flags that might affect type safety.
    *   Any use of `ProjectTo` with `IQueryable` where the destination type might be influenced by user input.

2.  **Static Analysis:**  Utilize static analysis tools (e.g., Roslyn analyzers, SonarQube, .NET security analyzers) to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities related to type safety and dynamic type resolution.  We will look for:
    *   Warnings related to unsafe type conversions.
    *   Potential injection points where user input could influence type names.
    *   Use of reflection in potentially unsafe ways.

3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing/Penetration Testing):**  If code review and static analysis reveal potential vulnerabilities, we will perform targeted fuzzing or penetration testing.  This involves:
    *   Crafting malicious inputs designed to trigger unsafe type resolution.
    *   Monitoring the application's behavior for exceptions, unexpected type instantiations, or other signs of successful exploitation.
    *   Using a debugger to trace the execution path and identify the precise point of vulnerability.

4.  **Documentation Review:**  Thorough review of the AutoMapper documentation, including:
    *   Best practices for secure configuration.
    *   Known vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies.
    *   Release notes for the specific version in use.

5.  **Threat Modeling:**  Consider various attack scenarios where an attacker might attempt to exploit unsafe type resolution, including:
    *   Different input vectors (e.g., HTTP requests, database queries).
    *   Attacker capabilities and motivations.
    *   Potential impact on the application and its data.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1 Unsafe Type Resolution

**4.1. Threat Description:**

AutoMapper's core functionality involves mapping data between objects of different types.  If the destination type is determined dynamically based on untrusted input, an attacker could potentially specify an arbitrary type, leading to the instantiation of a malicious class and, consequently, arbitrary code execution.

**4.2. Potential Vulnerability Scenarios:**

Several scenarios within our application could lead to this vulnerability:

*   **Scenario 1: Type Name Injection via API Request:**
    *   **Description:**  An API endpoint accepts a request containing a `typeName` parameter, which is then used to dynamically determine the destination type for an AutoMapper mapping operation.
    *   **Example:**
        ```csharp
        // Vulnerable API endpoint
        [HttpPost]
        public IActionResult MapData([FromBody] MappingRequest request)
        {
            Type destinationType = Type.GetType(request.TypeName); // DANGEROUS!
            if (destinationType == null)
            {
                return BadRequest("Invalid type name.");
            }
            var result = _mapper.Map(request.SourceData, typeof(SourceType), destinationType);
            return Ok(result);
        }

        public class MappingRequest
        {
            public string TypeName { get; set; }
            public object SourceData { get; set; }
        }
        ```
    *   **Exploit:** An attacker could send a request with `TypeName` set to a malicious type, such as `System.Diagnostics.Process`, allowing them to start an arbitrary process on the server.

*   **Scenario 2: Type Resolution from Database Data:**
    *   **Description:**  The application retrieves type information from a database, which is then used to configure AutoMapper mappings.  If the database is compromised or contains untrusted data, an attacker could inject malicious type names.
    *   **Example:**
        ```csharp
        // Vulnerable code retrieving type from database
        string typeName = _dbContext.MappingConfigurations.FirstOrDefault(c => c.Id == configId)?.DestinationTypeName; // DANGEROUS!
        Type destinationType = Type.GetType(typeName);
        var result = _mapper.Map(sourceData, typeof(SourceType), destinationType);
        ```
    *   **Exploit:** Similar to Scenario 1, an attacker could manipulate the database to inject a malicious type name.

*   **Scenario 3: Unsafe Use of `ProjectTo` with `IQueryable`:**
    * **Description:** If `ProjectTo` is used with an `IQueryable` and the destination type is somehow derived from user input (even indirectly), it could lead to unsafe type resolution.  This is because the type resolution happens within the expression tree and is executed by the underlying provider (e.g., Entity Framework).
    * **Example:**
        ```csharp
        // Potentially vulnerable if 'typeName' is influenced by user input
        public IQueryable<object> GetData(string typeName)
        {
            Type destinationType = Type.GetType(typeName); // DANGEROUS if typeName is from user input
            return _dbContext.Entities.ProjectTo(destinationType, _mapper.ConfigurationProvider);
        }
        ```
    * **Exploit:**  An attacker could manipulate the input that influences `typeName` to cause the instantiation of a malicious type during query execution.

*   **Scenario 4: Custom Type Converters or Value Resolvers with Unsafe Logic:**
    *   **Description:**  Custom type converters or value resolvers that use reflection or dynamic type loading based on untrusted input could be vulnerable.
    *   **Example:**
        ```csharp
        // Vulnerable custom type converter
        public class MyCustomConverter : ITypeConverter<string, Type>
        {
            public Type Convert(string source, Type destination, ResolutionContext context)
            {
                return Type.GetType(source); // DANGEROUS if 'source' is from user input
            }
        }
        ```
    *   **Exploit:**  An attacker could provide a malicious type name as input to a field mapped using this custom converter.

**4.3. Impact Assessment:**

The impact of a successful exploit is **critical**.  Arbitrary code execution allows an attacker to:

*   **Execute arbitrary commands:**  Run any command on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Access sensitive data:**  Read, modify, or delete data stored by the application.
*   **Install malware:**  Deploy malicious software on the server.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Crash the application or the entire server.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Use the compromised server to attack other systems on the network.

**4.4. Mitigation Strategies:**

The following mitigation strategies are crucial to address this vulnerability:

1.  **Never Trust User Input for Type Resolution:**  **This is the most important rule.**  Do not use `Type.GetType()` or any other dynamic type loading mechanism with untrusted input.

2.  **Use a Whitelist of Allowed Types:**  If dynamic type resolution is absolutely necessary, maintain a strict whitelist of allowed types.  Only instantiate types that are explicitly present in the whitelist.
    ```csharp
    private static readonly HashSet<string> AllowedTypes = new HashSet<string>
    {
        "MyApplication.Models.Dto1",
        "MyApplication.Models.Dto2",
        // ... other allowed types
    };

    public Type ResolveTypeSafely(string typeName)
    {
        if (AllowedTypes.Contains(typeName))
        {
            return Type.GetType(typeName);
        }
        return null; // Or throw an exception
    }
    ```

3.  **Use Static Type Mapping Whenever Possible:**  Define your mappings statically using `CreateMap` in your AutoMapper profiles.  Avoid dynamic type resolution entirely if possible.

4.  **Sanitize and Validate Input:**  If you must use user input to influence mapping behavior, thoroughly sanitize and validate the input *before* using it in any AutoMapper-related operation.  This includes checking for invalid characters, length restrictions, and adherence to expected formats.

5.  **Review Custom Type Converters and Value Resolvers:**  Carefully review any custom type converters or value resolvers for unsafe type resolution logic.  Ensure they do not use untrusted input to determine types.

6.  **Use `ProjectTo` with Caution:**  When using `ProjectTo` with `IQueryable`, ensure that the destination type is *not* derived from user input.  Use statically defined types or a whitelist approach.

7.  **Regularly Update AutoMapper:**  Keep AutoMapper up to date to benefit from the latest security patches and bug fixes.

8.  **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

9. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the potential damage from a successful exploit.

**4.5. Developer Training:**

The development team should be trained on:

*   The dangers of unsafe type resolution.
*   Secure coding practices for AutoMapper.
*   The mitigation strategies outlined above.
*   How to identify and report potential security vulnerabilities.

## 5. Conclusion

The "Unsafe Type Resolution" attack path in AutoMapper represents a significant security risk. By understanding the potential vulnerability scenarios, assessing the impact, and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, we can significantly reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit and protect our application from arbitrary code execution. Continuous monitoring, regular security audits, and ongoing developer training are essential to maintain a strong security posture.
