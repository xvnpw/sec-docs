Okay, let's perform a deep analysis of the "Custom Resolver / Value Injector Exploitation" attack surface in AutoMapper, as described.

## Deep Analysis: AutoMapper Custom Resolver/Value Injector Exploitation

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Fully understand the potential security risks associated with using custom resolvers and value injectors in AutoMapper.
*   Identify specific vulnerability patterns that are likely to occur within custom resolver/injector code.
*   Develop concrete recommendations for developers to mitigate these risks effectively.
*   Provide examples of vulnerable code and how to remediate it.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on the attack surface created by the use of `ResolveUsing` (and related methods like `MapFrom` with complex logic) and custom value injectors within the AutoMapper library.  It does *not* cover other aspects of AutoMapper's functionality, such as standard member-to-member mapping or configuration validation.  The analysis assumes that AutoMapper itself is correctly installed and configured; the focus is solely on the *application-specific* code within the resolvers/injectors.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identify potential attackers, their motivations, and the likely attack vectors they would use.
2.  **Vulnerability Pattern Identification:**  Based on the threat model and the nature of custom resolvers/injectors, identify common vulnerability patterns that are likely to arise.
3.  **Code Review (Hypothetical & Real-World):**  Analyze hypothetical and, if possible, real-world examples of custom resolver code to illustrate the vulnerabilities.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**  Expand on the initial mitigation strategies, providing specific, actionable guidance for developers.
5.  **Remediation Examples:** Provide code examples demonstrating how to fix vulnerable resolvers.

### 2. Threat Modeling

*   **Attacker Profiles:**
    *   **External Attacker:**  An unauthenticated or low-privileged user attempting to exploit the application through publicly exposed endpoints.  This is the most common and highest-risk attacker.
    *   **Internal Attacker (Malicious Insider):**  A user with legitimate access to the application who attempts to abuse their privileges or exploit vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or cause damage.
    *   **Compromised Dependency:**  A third-party library used by the application (or even AutoMapper itself, though this is outside the scope) is compromised, leading to an attack that leverages the custom resolver.

*   **Attacker Motivations:**
    *   **Data Theft:**  Stealing sensitive data (PII, financial information, etc.) from the application.
    *   **Data Modification:**  Altering data within the application, potentially for financial gain or to cause disruption.
    *   **Code Execution:**  Gaining the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Denial of Service:**  Making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **System Compromise:**  Gaining full control of the server hosting the application.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Input Manipulation:**  The attacker crafts malicious input to the application that is then processed by a vulnerable custom resolver.  This is the primary attack vector.
    *   **Dependency-Based Attacks:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in libraries used *within* the custom resolver (e.g., a vulnerable XML parsing library).

### 3. Vulnerability Pattern Identification

Based on the threat model and the nature of custom resolvers, the following vulnerability patterns are highly likely:

*   **1. Injection Flaws:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** If the resolver interacts with a database, unsanitized input from the source object could be used to construct malicious SQL queries.
    *   **NoSQL Injection:** Similar to SQL injection, but targeting NoSQL databases.
    *   **Command Injection:** If the resolver executes system commands, unsanitized input could allow the attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
    *   **LDAP Injection:** If the resolver interacts with an LDAP directory, unsanitized input could be used to manipulate LDAP queries.
    *   **XPath Injection / XML Injection:** If the resolver processes XML data, unsanitized input could lead to XPath or XML injection attacks.

*   **2. Path Traversal:** If the resolver constructs file paths based on input from the source object, an attacker could manipulate the input to access files outside of the intended directory.

*   **3. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** If the resolver makes external HTTP requests (e.g., to an API), an attacker could manipulate the URL or other parameters of the request to access internal resources or interact with unintended external services.

*   **4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected/Stored (Less Common, but Possible):** If the resolver's output is later used in a web page without proper encoding, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript. This is less direct, as AutoMapper's primary purpose isn't generating HTML, but it's a potential downstream effect.

*   **5. Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** If the resolver deserializes data from the source object (e.g., JSON, XML), and that data is attacker-controlled, it could lead to arbitrary code execution.

*   **6. Business Logic Errors:**  Flaws in the resolver's logic that allow an attacker to bypass security checks or perform unauthorized actions.  This is a broad category, but it's important to consider.

*   **7. Information Disclosure:** The resolver might inadvertently expose sensitive information, such as internal file paths, API keys, or database connection strings, through error messages or logging.

*   **8. Denial of Service (DoS):** A resolver could be designed in a way that makes it vulnerable to DoS attacks, such as by allocating excessive memory, performing computationally expensive operations, or making excessive external requests.

### 4. Code Review (Hypothetical Examples)

Let's illustrate some of these vulnerabilities with hypothetical C# code examples:

**Example 1: Path Traversal**

```csharp
// Source and Destination classes
public class UserProfile {
    public string AvatarFileName { get; set; }
}

public class UserProfileDto {
    public string AvatarPath { get; set; }
}

// AutoMapper configuration
CreateMap<UserProfile, UserProfileDto>()
    .ForMember(dest => dest.AvatarPath, opt => opt.ResolveUsing<AvatarPathResolver>());

// Vulnerable Resolver
public class AvatarPathResolver : IValueResolver<UserProfile, UserProfileDto, string>
{
    public string Resolve(UserProfile source, UserProfileDto destination, string destMember, ResolutionContext context)
    {
        // VULNERABLE: Directly concatenating user input into a file path.
        return Path.Combine("/var/www/avatars", source.AvatarFileName);
    }
}
```

**Attack:** An attacker could set `AvatarFileName` to `../../../etc/passwd` to potentially read the system's password file.

**Example 2: SQL Injection**

```csharp
// Source and Destination classes
public class Product {
    public string SearchTerm { get; set; }
}

public class ProductDto {
    public string Description { get; set; }
}

// AutoMapper configuration
CreateMap<Product, ProductDto>()
    .ForMember(dest => dest.Description, opt => opt.ResolveUsing<ProductDescriptionResolver>());

// Vulnerable Resolver
public class ProductDescriptionResolver : IValueResolver<Product, ProductDto, string>
{
    private readonly string _connectionString = "your_connection_string";

    public string Resolve(Product source, ProductDto destination, string destMember, ResolutionContext context)
    {
        using (var connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString))
        {
            connection.Open();
            // VULNERABLE: Using string concatenation to build a SQL query.
            var command = new SqlCommand($"SELECT Description FROM Products WHERE Name = '{source.SearchTerm}'", connection);
            var reader = command.ExecuteReader();
            if (reader.Read())
            {
                return reader.GetString(0);
            }
            return null;
        }
    }
}
```

**Attack:** An attacker could set `SearchTerm` to `' OR 1=1; --` to retrieve all product descriptions.  More sophisticated attacks could extract other data or even modify the database.

**Example 3: SSRF**

```csharp
// Source and Destination classes
public class Order {
    public string TrackingUrl { get; set; }
}

public class OrderDto {
    public string TrackingInfo { get; set; }
}

// AutoMapper configuration
CreateMap<Order, OrderDto>()
    .ForMember(dest => dest.TrackingInfo, opt => opt.ResolveUsing<TrackingInfoResolver>());

// Vulnerable Resolver
public class TrackingInfoResolver : IValueResolver<Order, OrderDto, string>
{
    public string Resolve(Order source, OrderDto destination, string destMember, ResolutionContext context)
    {
        // VULNERABLE: Making an HTTP request using an unsanitized URL.
        using (var client = new HttpClient())
        {
            try
            {
                return client.GetStringAsync(source.TrackingUrl).Result;
            }
            catch
            {
                return "Tracking information unavailable.";
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Attack:** An attacker could set `TrackingUrl` to `http://localhost:8080/admin` to attempt to access an internal administrative interface, or to `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/` to access AWS metadata (if running on AWS).

### 5. Mitigation Strategy Refinement

The initial mitigation strategies were a good starting point.  Let's refine them with more specific guidance:

*   **1. Secure Coding Practices (Comprehensive):**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the code within the resolver runs with the minimum necessary privileges.  Don't run the application as root/administrator.
    *   **Defense in Depth:** Implement multiple layers of security.  Don't rely solely on input validation.
    *   **Fail Securely:**  Handle errors and exceptions gracefully.  Don't leak sensitive information in error messages.
    *   **Keep it Simple:**  Avoid unnecessary complexity in resolvers.  The more complex the code, the greater the chance of vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Code Reviews:**  Have other developers review your custom resolver code, specifically looking for security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube, Roslyn analyzers) to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dynamic Analysis:** Use dynamic analysis tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) to test the running application for vulnerabilities.

*   **2. Minimize Complexity (Prioritize Declarative Mappings):**
    *   **Explicitly evaluate:** Before creating a custom resolver, *always* check if the mapping can be achieved using standard AutoMapper features (e.g., `ForMember`, `MapFrom`, `ProjectTo`).
    *   **Refactor:** If you have existing complex resolvers, consider refactoring them to use simpler mappings if possible.

*   **3. Input Sanitization and Validation (Within Resolver - Context-Specific):**
    *   **Whitelist, Not Blacklist:**  Whenever possible, use whitelisting (allowing only known-good values) instead of blacklisting (blocking known-bad values). Blacklisting is often incomplete.
    *   **Context-Specific Validation:**  The type of validation required depends on how the data will be used.
        *   **File Paths:** Use `Path.GetFullPath()` to resolve relative paths and then check if the resulting path is within the allowed directory.  *Never* directly concatenate user input into a file path.
        *   **URLs:** Use the `Uri` class to parse and validate URLs.  Check the scheme, host, and path.  Consider using a whitelist of allowed domains.
        *   **SQL Queries:** Use parameterized queries (or an ORM like Entity Framework) *exclusively*.  *Never* use string concatenation to build SQL queries.
        *   **XML/JSON:** Use a secure XML/JSON parser that is configured to prevent XXE (XML External Entity) attacks and other deserialization vulnerabilities.
        *   **HTML Output:** If the resolver's output is used in HTML, use a context-aware HTML encoder (e.g., `HtmlEncoder.Default` in ASP.NET Core).

*   **4. Thorough Testing (Beyond Unit Tests):**
    *   **Unit Tests:** Test the resolver with valid and invalid inputs, boundary conditions, and edge cases.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Test the resolver in the context of the entire mapping process.
    *   **Security-Focused Tests:**  Specifically test for the vulnerability patterns identified earlier (injection, path traversal, SSRF, etc.). Use fuzzing techniques to generate a wide range of inputs.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Consider engaging a security professional to perform penetration testing on your application.

*   **5. Dependency Management:**
    *   Regularly update all dependencies, including AutoMapper and any libraries used within your custom resolvers.
    *   Use a dependency vulnerability scanner (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk) to identify known vulnerabilities in your dependencies.

### 6. Remediation Examples

Let's revisit the previous examples and show how to fix them:

**Remediation 1: Path Traversal**

```csharp
// Remediation
public class AvatarPathResolver : IValueResolver<UserProfile, UserProfileDto, string>
{
    private readonly string _baseAvatarPath = "/var/www/avatars"; // Or better, from configuration

    public string Resolve(UserProfile source, UserProfileDto destination, string destMember, ResolutionContext context)
    {
        // 1. Sanitize the filename: Remove any invalid characters.
        var sanitizedFileName = Path.GetFileName(source.AvatarFileName); // Gets only filename, no path info

        // 2. Combine with the base path.
        var fullPath = Path.Combine(_baseAvatarPath, sanitizedFileName);

        // 3. Canonicalize the path (resolves "..", etc.).
        fullPath = Path.GetFullPath(fullPath);

        // 4. Verify that the resulting path is still within the allowed directory.
        if (!fullPath.StartsWith(_baseAvatarPath, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
        {
            // Handle the error appropriately (e.g., log, throw exception, return default avatar).
            throw new SecurityException("Invalid avatar file path.");
        }

        return fullPath;
    }
}
```

**Remediation 2: SQL Injection**

```csharp
// Remediation
public class ProductDescriptionResolver : IValueResolver<Product, ProductDto, string>
{
    private readonly string _connectionString = "your_connection_string";

    public string Resolve(Product source, ProductDto destination, string destMember, ResolutionContext context)
    {
        using (var connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString))
        {
            connection.Open();
            // Use parameterized queries!
            var command = new SqlCommand("SELECT Description FROM Products WHERE Name = @SearchTerm", connection);
            command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@SearchTerm", source.SearchTerm); // SQL Server handles escaping
            var reader = command.ExecuteReader();
            if (reader.Read())
            {
                return reader.GetString(0);
            }
            return null;
        }
    }
}
```

**Remediation 3: SSRF**

```csharp
// Remediation
public class TrackingInfoResolver : IValueResolver<Order, OrderDto, string>
{
    private static readonly HttpClient _httpClient = new HttpClient(); // Reuse HttpClient
    private static readonly HashSet<string> _allowedDomains = new HashSet<string> { "trackingprovider1.com", "trackingprovider2.com" };

    public string Resolve(Order source, OrderDto destination, string destMember, ResolutionContext context)
    {
        try
        {
            // 1. Parse the URL.
            var uri = new Uri(source.TrackingUrl);

            // 2. Validate the scheme (e.g., only allow HTTPS).
            if (uri.Scheme != "https")
            {
                return "Invalid tracking URL (HTTPS required).";
            }

            // 3. Validate the domain against a whitelist.
            if (!_allowedDomains.Contains(uri.Host))
            {
                return "Invalid tracking URL (domain not allowed).";
            }

            // 4. Make the request.
            return _httpClient.GetStringAsync(uri).Result;
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            // Log the exception (but don't expose sensitive details).
            Console.WriteLine($"Tracking request failed: {ex.Message}"); // Simplified logging
            return "Tracking information unavailable.";
        }
    }
}
```
