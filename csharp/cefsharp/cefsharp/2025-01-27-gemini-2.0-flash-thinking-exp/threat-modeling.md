# Threat Model Analysis for cefsharp/cefsharp

## Threat: [Outdated Chromium Version](./threats/outdated_chromium_version.md)

Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities present in older versions of Chromium embedded within CefSharp. This can be done by serving malicious web content to the CefSharp browser control that triggers these vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in Chromium](./threats/zero-day_vulnerabilities_in_chromium.md)

Attackers exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities in the Chromium engine before a patch is available. This can be achieved by crafting specific web pages or scripts that trigger these vulnerabilities when loaded in CefSharp.

## Threat: [Renderer Process Compromise](./threats/renderer_process_compromise.md)

Attackers exploit vulnerabilities within the Chromium renderer process (e.g., through memory corruption bugs) to gain control of this process. This can be achieved by serving malicious web content or exploiting vulnerabilities in browser extensions if enabled.

## Threat: [Insecure JavaScript to .NET Communication](./threats/insecure_javascript_to__net_communication.md)

Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the JavaScript to .NET communication bridge. This can involve injecting malicious JavaScript code (e.g., via XSS) that calls exposed .NET functions in unintended ways, or manipulating data passed between JavaScript and .NET.

## Threat: [Injection Attacks via IPC](./threats/injection_attacks_via_ipc.md)

Attackers inject malicious code or commands by exploiting vulnerabilities in the inter-process communication channels. This is broader than XSS and can involve injecting code that is interpreted as commands by either the .NET application or the Chromium process, depending on how IPC is implemented.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Schemes or Protocols](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_schemes_or_protocols.md)

If the application defines custom URL schemes or protocols for use within CefSharp (e.g., using `RegisterSchemeHandlerFactory`), vulnerabilities in the implementation of these schemes can be exploited by attackers crafting URLs with malicious payloads.

## Threat: [Disabling Security Features](./threats/disabling_security_features.md)

Developers may unintentionally or intentionally disable Chromium security features through CefSharp settings or command-line arguments. This weakens the security posture and makes the application more vulnerable to various attacks.

## Threat: [Incorrect Sandbox Configuration](./threats/incorrect_sandbox_configuration.md)

The Chromium sandbox might be improperly configured, weakened, or disabled, reducing its effectiveness in isolating the renderer process. Attackers exploiting a renderer process vulnerability can then more easily escape the sandbox and compromise the host application.
