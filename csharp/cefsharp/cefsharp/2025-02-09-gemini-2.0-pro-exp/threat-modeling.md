# Threat Model Analysis for cefsharp/cefsharp

## Threat: [Outdated Chromium Engine Exploitation](./threats/outdated_chromium_engine_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious webpage or injects malicious content into a legitimate webpage loaded within the CefSharp browser. This content exploits a known vulnerability (CVE) present in the outdated Chromium version used by the CefSharp instance. The attacker leverages this vulnerability to achieve their goals.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the host system, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), information disclosure (e.g., stealing cookies, session data), denial-of-service, or complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected CefSharp Component:** The underlying Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) binaries.  Specifically, any component within CEF that has a known vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Regularly update the CefSharp NuGet package to the latest stable release.  Implement a robust update mechanism for end-users (e.g., auto-updates).  Monitor the CefSharp project and Chromium CVE databases for security advisories.
        *   **User:** Ensure the application using CefSharp is kept up-to-date.

## Threat: [Zero-Day Chromium Engine Exploitation](./threats/zero-day_chromium_engine_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a previously unknown (zero-day) vulnerability in the Chromium engine embedded within CefSharp.  The attacker may have discovered the vulnerability themselves or obtained it from a third party.  They use this vulnerability through a malicious webpage or injected content.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to outdated engine exploitation: RCE, XSS, information disclosure, denial-of-service, or system compromise. The impact is potentially more severe due to the lack of available patches.
    *   **Affected CefSharp Component:** The underlying CEF binaries. Any component within CEF could be affected.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement strong input validation and sanitization on *all* data passed to the CefSharp control and the JavaScript bridge. Employ a "defense-in-depth" strategy, including application-level and system-level security measures.  Monitor security research for emerging threats.
        *   **User:** Keep the application and operating system up-to-date with security patches.  Exercise caution when browsing untrusted websites.

## Threat: [JavaScript Bridge RCE](./threats/javascript_bridge_rce.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the JavaScript bridge to execute arbitrary .NET code.  They craft malicious JavaScript code that calls exposed .NET methods with unexpected or malicious parameters. This could be due to improper input validation, type confusion, or other flaws in the bridge implementation.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the context of the .NET application.  The attacker gains control over the application and potentially the host system.
    *   **Affected CefSharp Component:** `IJavascriptObjectRepository`, `RegisterJsObject`, `RegisterAsyncJsObject`, `JavascriptObjectRepository.ObjectBoundInJavascript`, any custom-implemented communication mechanisms between .NET and JavaScript.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Minimize the surface area exposed to JavaScript.  Expose only essential methods and properties.  Use strong input validation and sanitization on *all* data received from JavaScript.  Avoid exposing sensitive .NET objects directly.  Prefer `RegisterAsyncJsObject` over `RegisterJsObject`.  Carefully manage the lifecycle of bound objects.
        *   **User:** No direct mitigation, relies on developer implementation.

## Threat: [JavaScript Bridge Data Exfiltration](./threats/javascript_bridge_data_exfiltration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uses the JavaScript bridge to access sensitive data exposed by the .NET application.  This might involve calling exposed methods to retrieve data or accessing global variables made available to JavaScript.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure.  The attacker can steal sensitive data, such as user credentials, session tokens, or application-specific data.
    *   **Affected CefSharp Component:** `IJavascriptObjectRepository`, `RegisterJsObject`, `RegisterAsyncJsObject`, `JavascriptObjectRepository.ObjectBoundInJavascript`, any custom communication mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**  Avoid exposing sensitive data to JavaScript.  Use a well-defined API with clear security boundaries.  Implement authorization checks on the .NET side to ensure that JavaScript code only accesses data it is permitted to see.
        *   **User:** No direct mitigation, relies on developer implementation.

## Threat: [CefSharp Settings Misconfiguration](./threats/cefsharp_settings_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages incorrectly configured CefSharp settings to weaken security.  This could involve disabling web security features (e.g., same-origin policy), enabling insecure features (e.g., allowing JavaScript to access local files), or exposing debugging interfaces.
    *   **Impact:** Increased susceptibility to XSS, data breaches, and potentially RCE, depending on the specific misconfiguration.
    *   **Affected CefSharp Component:** `CefSettings`, `BrowserSettings`, `RequestContextSettings`, any API calls that modify browser or request context behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the misconfiguration)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**  Thoroughly review and understand all CefSharp settings.  Use the principle of least privilege.  Disable remote debugging in production.  Implement strict certificate validation.  Use secure defaults.  Regularly audit the configuration.
        *   **User:** No direct mitigation, relies on developer implementation.

## Threat: [Unsafe Download Handling](./threats/unsafe_download_handling.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker initiates a file download from within the embedded browser. The downloaded file contains malware, and the application does not properly handle the download, leading to execution of the malicious file.
    *   **Impact:** System compromise through execution of malicious code.
    *   **Affected CefSharp Component:** `IDownloadHandler`, `OnBeforeDownload`, `OnDownloadUpdated`, any custom download handling logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement a secure download handler that scans downloaded files for malware, saves them to a secure location with appropriate permissions, prompts the user before opening, and potentially uses a sandbox for execution. Disable automatic downloads if not necessary.
        *   **User:** Be cautious about downloading files from untrusted sources within the embedded browser.
