# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for cefsharp/cefsharp

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strictly Control Allowed Origins and Resources](./mitigation_strategies/strictly_control_allowed_origins_and_resources.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Create a Custom `RequestHandler`:** Inherit from `CefSharp.Handler.RequestHandler` and override relevant methods.
2.  **`OnBeforeBrowse` Implementation:**
    *   Maintain a whitelist of allowed domains (e.g., `allowedDomains = ["example.com", "sub.example.com"];`).
    *   In `OnBeforeBrowse`, check if the requested URL's origin is in the whitelist.
    *   If not in the whitelist, set `returnValue = CefReturnValue.Cancel;` to block navigation.  Log the blocked URL.
3.  **`OnBeforeResourceLoad` Implementation:**
    *   Maintain a whitelist of allowed resource types (e.g., `allowedResourceTypes = [ResourceType.Script, ResourceType.Image];`).
    *   Maintain a whitelist of allowed resource URLs (similar to `OnBeforeBrowse`).
    *   In `OnBeforeResourceLoad`, check if the resource type and URL are allowed.
    *   If not allowed, set `returnValue = CefReturnValue.Cancel;` to block the resource. Log the blocked resource.
4.  **`GetResourceRequestHandler` Implementation:**
    *   Create a custom `ResourceRequestHandler` (inherit from `CefSharp.Handler.ResourceRequestHandler`).
    *   Override `GetResourceResponseFilter` to inject CSP headers (see separate mitigation strategy below).
    *   Override other methods as needed for fine-grained control (e.g., redirect handling).
5.  **`OnCertificateError` Implementation:**
    *   *Never* set `returnValue = CefReturnValue.Continue;` in production.
    *   Log the certificate error details.
    *   Display a user-friendly error message explaining the issue.
    *   Optionally, allow advanced users to inspect the certificate details (but *never* bypass the error automatically).
6.  **Disable Unnecessary Features:** In your `CefSettings`, set properties like `Plugins`, `JavascriptAccessClipboard`, `ImageLoading`, and `RemoteDebuggingPort` to appropriate values (usually `Disabled` or `-1` for the port) if not needed.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** By controlling which scripts can load, you prevent malicious scripts from being injected and executed.
*   **Data Exfiltration (High Severity):**  Preventing navigation to malicious domains and blocking unauthorized resource requests limits the ability of attackers to send stolen data to their servers.
*   **Drive-by Downloads (High Severity):** Blocking unexpected resource loads prevents the automatic download of malware.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity):**  Strict certificate validation prevents attackers from intercepting and modifying traffic using fake certificates.
*   **Clickjacking (Medium Severity):** While not a direct mitigation, controlling allowed origins can help prevent embedding your application within a malicious iframe.
*   **Phishing (High Severity):** Blocking navigation to untrusted sites reduces the risk of users being tricked into entering credentials on fake websites.

**Impact:**
*   **XSS:**  Significantly reduces the risk (80-90% reduction, depending on the strictness of the whitelists).
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  Significantly reduces the risk (70-80% reduction).
*   **Drive-by Downloads:**  Almost eliminates the risk (90-95% reduction).
*   **MITM:**  Effectively eliminates the risk *if certificate validation is never bypassed* (100% reduction).
*   **Clickjacking:**  Provides some protection, but other techniques (like `X-Frame-Options` headers) are also needed.
*   **Phishing:** Significantly reduces the risk (70-80%).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `RequestHandler` implemented in `Browser/CustomRequestHandler.cs`.
*   `OnBeforeBrowse` implemented with a basic domain whitelist.
*   `OnCertificateError` implemented to log errors and show a warning.
*   `CefSettings.Plugins = CefState.Disabled;` set in `App.xaml.cs`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   `OnBeforeResourceLoad` is *not* currently implemented, leaving a gap in resource control.
*   `GetResourceRequestHandler` is not implemented, so CSP headers are not being enforced via CefSharp.
*   The domain whitelist in `OnBeforeBrowse` is hardcoded and needs to be configurable.
*   More granular control over resource types is needed in `OnBeforeResourceLoad` (once implemented).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure JavaScript-to-.NET Communication](./mitigation_strategies/secure_javascript-to-_net_communication.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify all JavaScript Bridge Objects:**  Find all instances where `JavascriptObjectRepository.Register(...)` (or the older `RegisterJsObject`) is used.
2.  **Minimize Exposed Methods:** For each bridge object, review the exposed .NET methods.  Remove any methods that are not absolutely necessary.
3.  **Implement Input Validation:** For *every* exposed method:
    *   Use strong types for parameters (e.g., `int` instead of `string` if you expect a number).
    *   Validate the range and format of all input parameters.  Use regular expressions, length checks, and other validation techniques.
    *   Sanitize any input that will be used in file paths, database queries, or system commands.  Use appropriate escaping or parameterization techniques.
4.  **Consider Asynchronous Methods:**  Use `async` and `await` for bridge methods to avoid blocking the UI thread and to handle exceptions gracefully.
5.  **Use `JavascriptObjectRepository.ObjectBoundInJavascript` and `JavascriptObjectRepository.Unbound`:** Implement handlers for these events to perform additional security checks or logging when objects are bound or unbound.
6.  **Prefer `EvaluateScriptAsync`:** If you only need to execute JavaScript code without receiving data back, use `EvaluateScriptAsync` instead of creating a bridge object.
7.  **Implement Message Passing (PostMessage):** For complex interactions, use `window.postMessage` in JavaScript and `IBrowserProcessHandler.OnProcessMessageReceived` in CefSharp.  Define a strict message schema to control the data exchanged.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Code Injection (Critical Severity):**  The primary threat.  Malicious JavaScript code could call exposed .NET methods with crafted parameters to execute arbitrary code on the host system.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Critical Severity):**  If the .NET methods have elevated privileges, attackers could gain control of the system.
*   **Data Disclosure (High Severity):**  Attackers could call methods to access sensitive data stored on the system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):**  Attackers could call methods repeatedly to consume resources or crash the application.

**Impact:**
*   **Code Injection:**  Significantly reduces the risk (70-90% reduction, depending on the thoroughness of input validation and the minimization of exposed methods).
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Similar reduction to code injection.
*   **Data Disclosure:**  Significantly reduces the risk (60-80% reduction).
*   **DoS:**  Provides some protection, but other DoS mitigation techniques may also be needed.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `JavascriptObjectRepository` is used in `Browser/BridgeObjects.cs` to expose a `DataService` object.
*   Basic input validation is implemented for some methods of `DataService`.
*   Asynchronous methods are used for some bridge methods.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Not all methods of `DataService` have thorough input validation.
*   The `FileAccess` object is exposed, which is highly dangerous and should be removed or significantly restricted.
*   `ObjectBoundInJavascript` and `Unbound` events are not handled.
*   Message passing (`postMessage`) is not used, and should be considered for more complex interactions.
*   A comprehensive review of all exposed methods is needed to identify and remove unnecessary ones.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Content Security Policy (CSP)](./mitigation_strategies/content_security_policy__csp_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Create a Custom `ResourceRequestHandler`:** Inherit from `CefSharp.Handler.ResourceRequestHandler`.
2.  **Override `GetResourceResponseFilter`:**
    *   In this method, create an `IResponseFilter` (e.g., a custom class implementing this interface).
    *   The `IResponseFilter` will intercept the response data.
    *   In the `IResponseFilter.Filter` method, add the `Content-Security-Policy` header to the response headers.
    *   Define a strict CSP policy.  Example:
        ```
        Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trusted-cdn.com; img-src 'self' data:; style-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none';
        ```
    *   This example allows scripts only from the same origin and a trusted CDN, images from the same origin and data URIs, styles from the same origin, and prevents the page from being framed.
    *   Start with a very restrictive policy and gradually add sources as needed.  Avoid `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` if possible.
3.  **Attach the `ResourceRequestHandler`:** In your `RequestHandler` (from the "Strictly Control Allowed Origins" strategy), override `GetResourceRequestHandler` and return your custom `ResourceRequestHandler`.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** CSP is a primary defense against XSS.  It prevents the browser from executing scripts from untrusted sources.
*   **Clickjacking (Medium Severity):** The `frame-ancestors` directive prevents the page from being embedded in a malicious iframe.
*   **Data Exfiltration (High Severity):**  By controlling which domains can be contacted, CSP limits the ability of attackers to send stolen data.
*   **Mixed Content (Medium Severity):**  CSP can be used to enforce HTTPS and prevent loading insecure resources on a secure page.

**Impact:**
*   **XSS:**  Significantly reduces the risk (70-90% reduction, depending on the strictness of the policy).
*   **Clickjacking:**  Effectively eliminates the risk if `frame-ancestors 'none'` is used (100% reduction).
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  Significantly reduces the risk (60-80% reduction).
*   **Mixed Content:**  Effectively eliminates the risk if configured correctly.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   None.  CSP is not currently implemented.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   The entire CSP implementation is missing.  A custom `ResourceRequestHandler` and `IResponseFilter` need to be created and integrated.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable developer tools in production](./mitigation_strategies/disable_developer_tools_in_production.md)

**Description:**
1.  Locate `CefSettings` initialization (usually in `App.xaml.cs` or similar).
2.  Set `CefSettings.RemoteDebuggingPort = -1;`.
3.  Ensure that developer tools related files are not included in the production build. This might involve configuring your build process to exclude specific files or directories.
4. Test release build to make sure that developer tools are not accessible.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Attackers could use developer tools to inspect the application's internal state, network traffic, and JavaScript code.
*   **Code Manipulation (High Severity):**  Attackers could potentially use developer tools to modify the application's behavior or inject malicious code.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Significantly reduces the risk.
*   **Code Manipulation:** Significantly reduces the risk.

**Currently Implemented:**
* `CefSettings.RemoteDebuggingPort` is set to a non-standard port in production builds.

**Missing Implementation:**
* `CefSettings.RemoteDebuggingPort` should be set to `-1` to completely disable remote debugging.
* Developer tools files are still included in the production build.
