## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit Chromium Vulnerabilities (Unpatched/Zero-Day) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit_chromium_vulnerabilities__unpatchedzero-day___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This represents the fundamental risk of using a browser engine (Chromium) that is constantly under attack.  Vulnerabilities are regularly discovered, and attackers actively try to exploit them.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **1.1.4 Exploit outdated Chromium version. [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **1.1.4.1 Application uses an older, vulnerable CefSharp version with known Chromium CVEs:**
            *   *Attack:* The attacker identifies that the application is using an outdated CefSharp version, which bundles an older, vulnerable version of Chromium.  They then use publicly available exploits for known Chromium CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) to compromise the application.
            *   *Likelihood:* High (if updates are neglected)
            *   *Impact:* Very High
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy (vulnerability scanners)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Exploit misconfigured CefSharp settings [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_exploit_misconfigured_cefsharp_settings__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** CefSharp provides numerous configuration options.  Incorrectly configuring these settings can create significant security vulnerabilities.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **1.3.1 WebSecurity Disabled [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **1.3.1.1 Load malicious content from any origin, bypassing Same-Origin Policy:**
            *   *Attack:* The attacker leverages the disabled `WebSecurity` setting to load malicious content (e.g., JavaScript, HTML) from any origin, bypassing the Same-Origin Policy (SOP).  The SOP is a critical browser security mechanism that prevents scripts from one origin from accessing data from another origin.  With it disabled, the attacker can perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks with much greater ease and impact.
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium (if misconfigured)
            *   *Impact:* High
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy (configuration review)

    *   **1.3.2 RemoteDebuggingPort Enabled in Production [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **1.3.2.1 Connect to the debugging port and inject malicious code or inspect/modify application state:**
            *   *Attack:* The attacker discovers that the `RemoteDebuggingPort` is enabled in the production environment.  They use standard tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools) to connect to this port and gain full control over the Chromium instance.  They can inject arbitrary JavaScript, inspect and modify the application's state, and potentially execute code on the host system.
            *   *Likelihood:* Low (should be disabled in production)
            *   *Impact:* Very High
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy (port scanning)

    *   **1.3.4 Javascript access to .NET objects is too permissive [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **1.3.4.1 Use RegisterJsObject or RegisterAsyncJsObject to expose .NET methods that can be abused. [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   **1.3.4.1.1 Call sensitive .NET methods from JavaScript to perform unauthorized actions (e.g., file system access, registry manipulation):**
                *   *Attack:* The attacker exploits overly permissive JavaScript bindings.  The application has exposed .NET methods to JavaScript using `RegisterJsObject` or `RegisterAsyncJsObject` without proper security considerations.  The attacker crafts malicious JavaScript code that calls these exposed methods with unexpected parameters to perform unauthorized actions, such as reading or writing files, modifying the registry, or executing system commands.
                *   *Likelihood:* Medium (if poorly implemented)
                *   *Impact:* High
                *   *Effort:* Low
                *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
                *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium (code review)

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Abuse JavaScript Bridge (RegisterJsObject/RegisterAsyncJsObject) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_abuse_javascript_bridge__registerjsobjectregisterasyncjsobject___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector focuses on exploiting the mechanism that allows JavaScript code within the Chromium instance to interact with the .NET host application.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **2.1.1 Call exposed .NET methods with malicious parameters.**
        *   **2.1.1.1 Pass crafted strings or objects to trigger vulnerabilities in the .NET code:**
            *   *Attack:* The attacker calls exposed .NET methods with carefully crafted input (strings, objects, etc.) designed to trigger vulnerabilities in the .NET code.  This could include buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, SQL injection (if the .NET code interacts with a database), or other code injection flaws.
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium (if poorly implemented)
            *   *Impact:* Medium/High
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium (code review, input validation)

    *   **2.1.2 Exfiltrate data through exposed .NET methods.**
        *   **2.1.2.1 Call a .NET method designed to return data, but use it to leak sensitive information:**
            *   *Attack:* The attacker uses exposed .NET methods that are intended to return data to exfiltrate sensitive information from the application.  For example, if a method returns user profile data, the attacker might repeatedly call this method to collect data on multiple users.
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium (if poorly implemented)
            *   *Impact:* Medium/High
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium (network monitoring, data loss prevention)
    *   **2.1.3 Bypass intended application logic by calling .NET methods out of order or with unexpected combinations of parameters.**
        *   *Attack:* The attacker calls exposed .NET methods in an unexpected sequence or with unusual combinations of parameters to bypass the intended application logic. This could lead to unauthorized access to features, data manipulation, or other unintended consequences.
        *   *Likelihood:* Low
        *   *Impact:* Medium
        *   *Effort:* Medium
        *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium (application logs, anomaly detection)

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Supply Chain Attacks [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3__supply_chain_attacks__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** These attacks target the software supply chain, compromising the CefSharp library itself or its dependencies *before* it reaches the application developer.
*   **Sub-Vectors:** (While the sub-vectors are listed in the tree, they are all very low likelihood but very high impact. The critical aspect here is the *concept* of a supply chain attack.)
    *   *Compromised CefSharp NuGet Package:* A malicious version of the CefSharp package is published.
    *   *Compromised build server:* The CefSharp build server is compromised, and malicious code is injected.
    *   *Compromised dependency:* A library that CefSharp depends on is compromised.
    *   *Likelihood:* Very Low to Low
    *   *Impact:* Very High
    *   *Effort:* High to Very High
    *   *Skill Level:* Advanced to Expert
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Hard to Very Hard
