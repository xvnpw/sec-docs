# BUSINESS POSTURE

The CefSharp project aims to provide a .NET wrapper for the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF). This allows developers to embed a fully functional web browser into their .NET applications.

Business Priorities and Goals:

- Enable .NET developers to easily integrate web browsing capabilities into their desktop applications.
- Provide a modern and feature-rich browser engine based on Chromium, ensuring compatibility with modern web standards.
- Offer a cross-platform solution for embedding browsers in .NET applications (Windows, Linux, macOS).
- Maintain an active and community-driven project to ensure ongoing support and updates, keeping pace with Chromium and .NET developments.
- Provide a stable and reliable library suitable for use in production applications.

Business Risks:

- Security vulnerabilities in the underlying Chromium Embedded Framework could directly impact applications using CefSharp.
- Compatibility issues between CefSharp, CEF, and different .NET versions or operating systems could lead to application instability or malfunction.
- Lack of timely updates and security patches for CefSharp could expose applications to known vulnerabilities.
- Dependence on the Chromium project's roadmap and changes, which are outside of CefSharp's direct control.
- Potential for breaking changes in CEF or .NET that require significant rework in CefSharp and applications using it.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

- security control: Utilizes the security features of the Chromium Embedded Framework, which is based on the Chromium browser. Chromium has a strong security track record and undergoes continuous security audits and updates. (Implemented within CEF, inherited by CefSharp)
- security control: Relies on the .NET framework's security features and runtime environment. (Implemented by .NET runtime environment)
- security control: Open-source project with community review, allowing for broader scrutiny of the codebase for potential vulnerabilities. (Implemented through open-source development model and GitHub)
- security control: Regular updates to incorporate newer versions of CEF, including security patches from the Chromium project. (Implemented through project release cycle and dependency updates)

Accepted Risks:

- accepted risk: Inherited vulnerabilities from the upstream Chromium project before they are patched and released in CEF and subsequently CefSharp.
- accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in the CefSharp wrapper code itself, although the codebase is relatively thin as it primarily wraps CEF.
- accepted risk: Risk of misconfiguration or misuse of CefSharp by developers embedding it in their applications, leading to security weaknesses in those applications.
- accepted risk: Reliance on the security of the underlying operating system and hardware where applications using CefSharp are deployed.

Recommended Security Controls:

- security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) for the CefSharp codebase and build process to identify potential vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
- security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
- security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for developers using CefSharp to embed browsers securely in their applications, covering topics like input validation, origin control, and handling of sensitive data within the browser context.
- security control: Conduct regular security audits or penetration testing of applications that heavily rely on CefSharp to identify and mitigate application-level security risks.

Security Requirements:

- Authentication: CefSharp itself does not handle user authentication. Authentication is typically managed by the web applications loaded within the embedded browser or by the host .NET application. Security requirement: Applications using CefSharp should implement appropriate authentication mechanisms for web content and application features, as needed.
- Authorization: CefSharp does not enforce authorization policies. Authorization is the responsibility of the web applications and the host .NET application. Security requirement: Applications using CefSharp must implement proper authorization controls to restrict access to sensitive resources and functionalities, both within the embedded browser and the host application.
- Input Validation: CefSharp renders web content, which inherently involves processing various forms of input. Input validation is primarily the responsibility of the web applications loaded within CefSharp. Security requirement: Applications using CefSharp should ensure that web applications loaded within the browser perform robust input validation to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection if the web app interacts with a backend). Additionally, consider validating any data passed between the .NET application and the embedded browser via CefSharp's inter-process communication mechanisms.
- Cryptography: CefSharp relies on Chromium's built-in cryptography capabilities for secure communication (HTTPS) and handling of encrypted web content. Security requirement: Ensure that applications using CefSharp enforce HTTPS for all sensitive web traffic within the embedded browser. If the .NET application needs to handle sensitive data passed to or from the browser, consider using appropriate encryption methods provided by the .NET framework.

```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer writes code and commits changes to the Source Code Repository (e.g., GitHub).
2. CI/CD System (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) is triggered by code changes.
3. CI/CD System sets up a Build Environment.
4. Build Environment performs security checks:
    - SAST Scanner: Static Application Security Testing to find potential vulnerabilities in the code.
    - Dependency Check: Checks for known vulnerabilities in project dependencies (e.g., NuGet packages, CEF binaries).
    - Code Linter: Enforces code quality and style guidelines, which can indirectly improve security.
5. Build Environment compiles the code using a Compiler (.NET compiler, C++ compiler for CEF).
6. Compiler produces Build Artifacts: .NET assemblies (DLLs), native libraries (CEF binaries), and other necessary files.
7. Build Artifacts are stored in an Artifact Repository (e.g., NuGet for .NET packages, local file system for distribution).
8. Deployment Environment (User's Machine) retrieves Build Artifacts from the Artifact Repository for installation and execution.

- security control: Artifact Repository Security: Access control to the artifact repository, integrity checks of artifacts. (Implemented by artifact repository security features)

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

- Rendering and displaying web content within .NET applications. This is critical for applications that rely on web-based UIs or need to display online information.
- Interacting with web services and APIs from within .NET applications via the embedded browser. This is critical for applications that integrate with web-based platforms or services.
- User interaction with web content within the application. This is critical for user experience and application functionality.

Data Sensitivity:

- Data displayed and processed within the embedded browser: Sensitivity depends on the web applications loaded. Could include user credentials, personal information, financial data, or other sensitive content.
- Data exchanged between the .NET application and the embedded browser via CefSharp's inter-process communication: Sensitivity depends on the application's design. Could include application-specific data, user settings, or sensitive commands.
- Local storage and browser data within the embedded browser: Could contain browsing history, cookies, cached data, and potentially sensitive information depending on user activity and web application behavior. Sensitivity depends on the application's use case and data handling practices.

Data Sensitivity Levels (example, needs to be defined based on specific application context):

- Public: Non-sensitive, publicly available web content.
- Internal: Data intended for internal application use, not sensitive if exposed externally.
- Confidential: Data that requires protection from unauthorized access, such as user credentials or personal information.
- Highly Confidential: Extremely sensitive data, such as financial transactions or critical business data, requiring the highest level of security.
