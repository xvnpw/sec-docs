        print("""
        This threat hinges on the trust boundary between the untrusted web content rendered by
        Chromium (via CefSharp) and the trusted native application. CefSharp provides mechanisms
        to bridge this boundary, allowing JavaScript code running within the browser to invoke
        functions within the native application. This bridge, while powerful, can become a
        significant vulnerability if not implemented with extreme care.

        **Attack Vectors:**

        * **Compromised Website:** If the application loads content from a website controlled by
          an attacker or a compromised legitimate website, the attacker can inject malicious
          JavaScript.
        * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the application has vulnerabilities allowing XSS, an
          attacker can inject malicious scripts that interact with the native callbacks.
        * **Malicious Advertisements or Third-Party Content:** If the application displays
          advertisements or integrates third-party content, these could be vectors for
          malicious JavaScript injection.
        * **Local File Manipulation (Less Likely):** In specific scenarios, an attacker might be
          able to modify local HTML files loaded by the application.

        **Mechanism of Exploitation:**

        The attacker crafts JavaScript code that calls a registered native callback function. The
        vulnerability arises when:

        * **Insufficient Input Validation:** The native callback function doesn't rigorously check
          the type, format, and range of the arguments passed from JavaScript.
        * **Lack of Sanitization:** The native callback function doesn't sanitize the input to
          remove potentially harmful characters or sequences before using it in operations like
          file access, command execution, or database queries.
        * **Overly Permissive Callbacks:** The native application exposes callbacks that provide
          access to sensitive or critical functionalities without proper authorization or access
          controls.
        * **Unsafe Deserialization:** If the callback arguments involve serialized data (e.g., JSON),
          vulnerabilities in the deserialization process can be exploited.

        **Examples of Potential Exploits:**

        * **File Path Manipulation:** JavaScript could pass a malicious file path to a native
          function that opens or processes files, potentially accessing sensitive files outside
          the intended scope.
        * **Command Injection:** JavaScript could inject commands into a native function that
          executes system commands, leading to arbitrary code execution on the host system.
        * **SQL Injection:** If callback arguments are used to construct SQL queries without
          proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code.
        * **Data Exfiltration:** JavaScript could trigger native functions to read sensitive data
          and send it to an external server.
        """)

        print("\n### Impact Assessment (Detailed)\n")
        print(f"""
        The impact of this threat can be severe:

        * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute
          arbitrary code within the context of the native application. This could lead to full
          system compromise, data theft, or the installation of malware.
        * **Privilege Escalation:** If the native application runs with elevated privileges, a
          successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain those elevated privileges, enabling
          them to perform actions they wouldn't normally be authorized to do.
        * **Access to Sensitive Data:** Attackers could leverage callbacks to access sensitive
          data managed by the native application, such as user credentials, financial information,
          or proprietary data.
        * **Arbitrary System Commands:**  An attacker could potentially execute any command that the
          native application's user has permissions to run. This could include deleting files,
          modifying system settings, or installing software.
        * **Denial of Service (DoS):** In some scenarios, an attacker might be able to craft
          malicious callback calls that consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of
          service for the application.
        """)

        print("\n### Affected Components (Deep Dive)\n")
        print(f"""
        * **`IJsDialogHandler`:** This interface handles JavaScript dialogs (alerts, confirms,
          prompts). If a custom `IJsDialogHandler` is implemented and allows JavaScript to
          provide input that is then used in sensitive operations without validation, it becomes
          a vulnerability. For example, a custom prompt dialog taking a file path could be
          exploited if the native application directly uses that path without checking its validity.
        * **`IRequestHandler`:** While primarily for handling resource requests, custom
          implementations interacting with CefSharp's callback mechanisms (e.g., for custom
          scheme handlers) could be vulnerable if they process input from the request without
          proper validation.
        * **Custom JavaScript-to-Native Bridge Implementations:** Any custom code written to
          facilitate communication between JavaScript and the native application is a potential
          attack surface. This includes custom message handlers or objects registered using
          `RegisterJsObject`.

        The "High" risk severity is justified due to the potential for significant impact
        (RCE, privilege escalation, data breach) combined with a moderate likelihood of
        exploitation if proper security measures are not in place. The ease of exploiting
        vulnerabilities in callback handling often depends on the complexity of the native
        code and the thoroughness of input validation.

        print("""
            **Implementation Guidance for Mitigation Strategies:**

            * **Thorough Input Validation and Sanitization:**
                * **Type Checking:** Verify the data type of all arguments received from JavaScript.
                * **Format Validation:** Use regular expressions or other methods to validate the format
                  of strings (e.g., email addresses, URLs, file paths).
                * **Range Checking:** Ensure numerical values are within expected bounds.
                * **Whitelisting:** Prefer whitelisting allowed characters or values over blacklisting
                  potentially harmful ones.
                * **Sanitization:**
                    * **HTML Encoding:** Encode special characters in strings that will be displayed
                      in HTML to prevent XSS.
                    * **URL Encoding:** Encode strings that will be used in URLs.
                    * **Path Canonicalization:** Resolve relative paths to absolute paths and verify
                      they are within expected directories to prevent path traversal attacks.
                    * **Command Injection Prevention:** Avoid constructing shell commands directly from
                      user-provided input. If necessary, use parameterized commands or carefully
                      escape arguments.
                    * **SQL Injection Prevention:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements
                      when interacting with databases.

            * **Principle of Least Privilege:**
                * Design native callbacks with specific and limited functionalities. Avoid creating
                  overly powerful or generic callbacks.
                * Implement authorization checks within the native callback functions to ensure that
                  the caller has the necessary permissions to execute the requested action.

            * **Avoid Direct Exposure of Sensitive Functionalities:**
                * Instead of directly exposing sensitive operations through callbacks, create
                  abstraction layers that perform necessary security checks and sanitization
                  before invoking the underlying sensitive functionality.
                * Consider alternative communication patterns if direct callbacks are too risky.
                  For example, JavaScript could request an action, and the native application
                  could perform it asynchronously after validation and authorization.

            * **Secure Communication and Data Serialization:**
                * If using JSON for data exchange, ensure that you are using a secure JSON parser
                  and consider implementing schema validation to enforce the expected structure
                  and types of data.
                * Consider using binary serialization formats like Protocol Buffers or FlatBuffers,
                  which can offer better type safety and performance compared to text-based
                  formats.
                * If sensitive data is being exchanged, consider encrypting the data passed
                  through the callback mechanism.

            * **Robust Error Handling and Logging:**
                * Implement comprehensive error handling within the native callbacks to catch
                  unexpected inputs or errors during processing.
                * Log all callback invocations, including the arguments received, the user or
                  process initiating the call (if available), and the outcome of the call. This
                  can be invaluable for auditing and incident response.

            * **Regular Review and Audits:**
                * Periodically review the implementation of all JavaScript-to-native callbacks
                  to identify potential vulnerabilities or areas for improvement.
                * Conduct security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting these
                  communication channels.

            * **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
                * Implement a strict CSP to control the sources from which the application loads
                  resources and executes scripts. This can help prevent the injection of malicious
                  JavaScript in the first place.

            * **Multi-Layer Input Validation:**
                * Implement input validation both on the JavaScript side (before sending data to
                  the native application) and on the native side (upon receiving the data). This
                  provides defense in depth.
