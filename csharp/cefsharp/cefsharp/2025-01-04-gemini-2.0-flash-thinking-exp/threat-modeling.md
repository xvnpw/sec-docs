# Threat Model Analysis for cefsharp/cefsharp

## Threat: [Exploitation of Outdated Chromium Version](./threats/exploitation_of_outdated_chromium_version.md)

**Threat:** Exploitation of Outdated Chromium Version

**Description:** An attacker could leverage known vulnerabilities present in the specific version of Chromium embedded within CefSharp. They might craft malicious web pages or scripts that exploit these vulnerabilities when loaded in the CefSharp browser. This could involve techniques like heap overflows, use-after-free bugs, or other memory corruption issues within the rendering engine or JavaScript engine provided by the embedded Chromium instance within CefSharp.

**Impact:** Remote code execution within the application's process, allowing the attacker to gain complete control over the application and potentially the underlying system. Information disclosure by accessing application memory or local files. Denial of service by crashing the application.

**Affected Component:**  The CefSharp library itself, as it bundles a specific version of Chromium.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update CefSharp to the latest stable version.
* Implement automated checks for new CefSharp releases and integrate updates promptly.
* Consider using a dependency management system to track and manage CefSharp version.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of JavaScript-to-Native Callbacks](./threats/insecure_handling_of_javascript-to-native_callbacks.md)

**Threat:**  Insecure Handling of JavaScript-to-Native Callbacks

**Description:** An attacker could craft malicious JavaScript code within a loaded web page that calls a registered JavaScript-to-native callback function exposed by CefSharp with unexpected or malicious arguments. If the native callback function, implemented using CefSharp's provided mechanisms, doesn't properly validate and sanitize these arguments, it could lead to unintended actions within the native application. The attacker might manipulate file paths, execute arbitrary commands, or access sensitive data exposed through the callback mechanism provided by CefSharp.

**Impact:**  Remote code execution within the native application context, privilege escalation if the callback has elevated permissions, access to sensitive data managed by the native application, and potential for arbitrary system commands.

**Affected Component:** CefSharp's `IJsDialogHandler`, `IRequestHandler`, specifically the implementations interacting with CefSharp's callback mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input received from JavaScript-to-native callbacks.
* Implement the principle of least privilege for native callbacks, granting them only the necessary permissions.
* Avoid exposing sensitive or critical functionalities directly through CefSharp's JavaScript-to-native callback mechanisms.
* Consider using a secure communication protocol or data serialization format for data exchange.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Custom Scheme Handlers](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_custom_scheme_handlers.md)

**Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Custom Scheme Handlers

**Description:** An attacker could craft a malicious URL using a custom scheme registered through CefSharp's `RegisterSchemeHandlerFactory`. If the `ISchemeHandlerFactory` implementation, a CefSharp component, has vulnerabilities (e.g., improper parsing or lack of input validation), the attacker could trigger unintended actions. This might involve accessing local files, executing commands, or causing denial of service within the context of the application using CefSharp.

**Impact:**  Local file access, remote code execution within the native application context, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** CefSharp's `RegisterSchemeHandlerFactory` and the custom `ISchemeHandlerFactory` implementation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully validate and sanitize any input received through custom scheme handlers implemented using CefSharp's APIs.
* Avoid performing critical or sensitive actions directly within the scheme handler.
* Implement robust error handling and prevent information leakage in case of invalid input.
* Follow the principle of least privilege for the actions performed by the scheme handler.
