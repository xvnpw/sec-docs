## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Input Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_input_manipulation.md)

This node represents the broad category of attacks that involve manipulating the data provided to the WaveFunctionCollapse algorithm. It is critical because controlling the input (tileset, constraints, seed) offers attackers significant leverage to influence the generation process and potentially compromise the application. Effective security measures at this stage are crucial for preventing a wide range of attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Malicious Tileset Injection](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_malicious_tileset_injection.md)

- **Introduce Tiles with Unexpected Properties:** An attacker injects tiles into the tileset that have properties (size, shape, connection rules) that the application does not anticipate or handle correctly. This can lead to the application misinterpreting the generated output, resulting in functional errors, unexpected behavior, or even minor security vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Inject Tiles Causing Infinite Loops/Excessive Computation (CRITICAL NODE for DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_inject_tiles_causing_infinite_loopsexcessive_computation__critical_node_for_dos_.md)

An attacker crafts specific tiles with particular connection rules designed to cause the WaveFunctionCollapse algorithm to enter an infinite loop or a state requiring excessive computational resources to resolve. This leads to the application becoming unresponsive or consuming so many resources that it effectively becomes unavailable, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Manipulate Constraints](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_manipulate_constraints.md)

This path involves the attacker manipulating the constraints provided to the WaveFunctionCollapse algorithm, which define how tiles can be placed next to each other.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Conflicting Constraints](./attack_tree_paths/provide_conflicting_constraints.md)

The attacker provides constraints that are contradictory or impossible to satisfy simultaneously. This can cause the WaveFunctionCollapse algorithm to enter an infinite loop trying to find a valid solution, or produce unexpected and potentially invalid output that the application cannot handle correctly, leading to errors.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Provide Constraints Leading to Resource Exhaustion (CRITICAL NODE for DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_provide_constraints_leading_to_resource_exhaustion__critical_node_for_dos_.md)

The attacker provides constraints that are very complex or large, significantly increasing the computational cost of the WaveFunctionCollapse algorithm. This can lead to the application consuming excessive CPU time and memory, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Trigger Excessive Backtracking (CRITICAL NODE for DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_trigger_excessive_backtracking__critical_node_for_dos_.md)

This attack targets a potential weakness in the WaveFunctionCollapse algorithm's backtracking behavior. An attacker crafts specific input or constraints that force the algorithm to backtrack excessively during the generation process. This repeated backtracking consumes significant computational resources, leading to performance degradation and potentially a Denial of Service (DoS).

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Output Interpretation](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_output_interpretation.md)

This node represents the category of attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in how the application interprets and processes the output generated by the WaveFunctionCollapse algorithm. Even if the generation process itself is secure, flaws in how the application uses the output can be a significant attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Influence Output to Trigger Secondary Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_influence_output_to_trigger_secondary_vulnerabilities.md)

The attacker manipulates the input to the WaveFunctionCollapse algorithm in a way that influences the generated output to contain specific data or patterns. While the output might appear valid from the perspective of the WaveFunctionCollapse algorithm, this crafted output is designed to trigger vulnerabilities in other parts of the application that consume or process this output. This could lead to various security breaches depending on the nature of the secondary vulnerability, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) if the output is displayed in a web page without proper sanitization, or buffer overflows if the output is processed by a vulnerable library.
