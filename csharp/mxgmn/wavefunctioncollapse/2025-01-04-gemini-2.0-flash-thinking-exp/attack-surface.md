# Attack Surface Analysis for mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Tileset Definitions](./attack_surfaces/malicious_tileset_definitions.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Tileset Definitions
    *   **Description:**  A malicious actor provides crafted tileset definition files (e.g., XML, JSON) designed to exploit parsing vulnerabilities or trigger resource exhaustion *within the `wavefunctioncollapse` library's handling of these files*.
    *   **How WaveFunctionCollapse Contributes:** The library directly parses and interprets these user-provided files to define the rules and elements for the generation process. Vulnerabilities in *its own* parsing logic or the way it processes the data can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads an XML tileset file with deeply nested elements or uses specific XML features that cause the parsing logic *within the `wavefunctioncollapse` library* to consume excessive memory and crash the application.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application crashes, potential for arbitrary code execution if a parsing vulnerability within the library is severe enough.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict schema validation for tileset definition files *before* they are processed by the library.
        *   If the library performs parsing, ensure it uses secure and up-to-date parsing mechanisms. Consider sandboxing the parsing process.
        *   Set limits on the size and complexity (e.g., nesting depth) of tileset files *before* passing them to the library.
        *   Sanitize and validate input data *specifically for the library's expected format and constraints*.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion via Complex Tilesets/Constraints](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_via_complex_tilesetsconstraints.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Resource Exhaustion via Complex Tilesets/Constraints
    *   **Description:**  An attacker provides valid but extremely complex tileset definitions or constraints that force the `wavefunctioncollapse` algorithm to perform an excessive number of computations, leading to resource exhaustion *during the library's execution*.
    *   **How WaveFunctionCollapse Contributes:** The core algorithm's performance is directly tied to the complexity of the input tilesets and the defined constraints *that the library processes internally*. Intricate rules can significantly increase the library's processing time and memory usage.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a tileset with a vast number of unique tiles and highly interconnected adjacency rules, causing the *wavefunction collapse algorithm within the library* to run for an extended period, consuming CPU and memory until the server becomes unresponsive.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application slowdown, increased infrastructure costs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement timeouts for the wavefunction collapse generation process *within the application's integration with the library*.
        *   Set limits on the number of tiles, patterns, and constraints allowed in a tileset *before being processed by the library*.
        *   Monitor resource usage during the library's execution and implement alerts.
        *   Consider implementing a cost function or complexity analysis for tilesets *before passing them to the library*.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (Indirectly through WaveFunctionCollapse)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_dependencies__indirectly_through_wavefunctioncollapse_.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (Indirectly through WaveFunctionCollapse)
    *   **Description:** The `wavefunctioncollapse` library relies on other libraries for tasks. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited *through the `wavefunctioncollapse` library's use of them*.
    *   **How WaveFunctionCollapse Contributes:**  The library integrates and utilizes the functionality of these dependencies. If the library calls a vulnerable function in a dependency with attacker-controlled data, it becomes a vector.
    *   **Example:** The library uses an older version of an image manipulation library with a known buffer overflow vulnerability. The `wavefunctioncollapse` library passes generated image data to this vulnerable function, allowing an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:**  Range of impacts depending on the dependency vulnerability, including Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Can range from Medium to Critical depending on the dependency vulnerability. We are including it here due to the potential for Critical impacts.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update the `wavefunctioncollapse` library and all its dependencies to the latest versions.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies.
        *   Follow security best practices for managing dependencies in the development environment.
        *   Carefully review how the `wavefunctioncollapse` library interacts with its dependencies and ensure data passed to them is sanitized.
