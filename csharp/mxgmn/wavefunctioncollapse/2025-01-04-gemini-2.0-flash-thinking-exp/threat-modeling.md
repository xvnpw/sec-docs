# Threat Model Analysis for mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Input](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_malicious_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides carefully crafted input, such as a tile set with highly complex or contradictory adjacency rules, or an exceptionally large output dimension request. This input forces the `wavefunctioncollapse` algorithm into an extremely long computation loop or an inefficient search for a solution *within the library itself*.

**Impact:** The server's CPU and/or memory resources become saturated due to the intensive computation *within the wavefunctioncollapse process*, leading to slow response times or complete unresponsiveness for legitimate users. This can potentially crash the application or the underlying server.

**Affected Component:** The core `Run()` or similar generation function within the `wavefunctioncollapse` library, specifically the input processing and constraint satisfaction logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all user-provided parameters (tile sets, rules, output size limits) *before passing them to the library*.
* Set timeouts for the `wavefunctioncollapse` generation process to prevent indefinite execution *within the library*.
* Enforce resource limits (CPU time, memory) on the process running the `wavefunctioncollapse` library.
* Consider implementing a queueing system for generation requests to prevent overwhelming the server.

## Threat: [Memory Exhaustion due to Large Input/Output](./threats/memory_exhaustion_due_to_large_inputoutput.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides input that demands the allocation of an extremely large amount of memory *by the `wavefunctioncollapse` library itself*. This could involve very large tile sets, extremely high output dimensions, or a combination thereof, causing the library to consume excessive memory.

**Impact:** The application process consumes excessive memory *due to the library's internal operations*, potentially leading to out-of-memory errors, application crashes, or even operating system instability.

**Affected Component:** Memory allocation within the `wavefunctioncollapse` library, particularly during the initialization and generation phases.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Impose strict limits on the maximum size and complexity of input parameters (e.g., maximum number of tiles, maximum output width and height) *before passing them to the library*.
* Monitor memory usage during the `wavefunctioncollapse` execution and implement safeguards to terminate the process if memory consumption exceeds acceptable thresholds.

## Threat: [Exploiting Potential Vulnerabilities in Underlying C++ Code](./threats/exploiting_potential_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_c++_code.md)

**Description:** The `wavefunctioncollapse` library is written in C++. Like any C++ code, it could potentially contain vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, or use-after-free errors *within its own codebase*. An attacker could craft specific input that triggers these vulnerabilities *during the library's execution*.

**Impact:**  Potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server *within the context of the process running the library*, application crashes, or data corruption. This is a severe threat if successfully exploited.

**Affected Component:** Any part of the C++ codebase of the `wavefunctioncollapse` library.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Stay updated with the latest version of the `wavefunctioncollapse` library to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
* If feasible, integrate the library in a sandboxed environment or container to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
* Consider using static analysis tools on the library's source code (if available) to identify potential vulnerabilities.
