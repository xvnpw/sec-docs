# Attack Surface Analysis for mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Tile Definitions](./attack_surfaces/malicious_tile_definitions.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides crafted tile definitions that exploit vulnerabilities or cause unexpected behavior within the `wavefunctioncollapse` algorithm.
    *   **How Wavefunction Collapse Contributes:** The library directly processes and uses the provided tile definitions to generate the output. Malicious definitions can introduce complex or contradictory rules.
    *   **Example:** A tile definition with extremely complex or recursive constraints that cause the algorithm to enter an infinite loop or consume excessive computational resources.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), server resource exhaustion, application unresponsiveness.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on tile definitions provided by users or external sources.
        *   Define a schema or format for tile definitions and enforce it rigorously.
        *   Set limits on the complexity of tile definitions (e.g., number of constraints per tile).
        *   Consider using a sandboxed environment for processing user-provided tile definitions.

## Attack Surface: [Crafted Adjacency Rules](./attack_surfaces/crafted_adjacency_rules.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides manipulated adjacency rules that lead to inefficient processing, infinite loops, or unexpected output generation by the `wavefunctioncollapse` algorithm.
    *   **How Wavefunction Collapse Contributes:** The library relies on adjacency rules to determine valid tile placements. Malicious rules can create unsolvable or computationally expensive scenarios.
    *   **Example:** Adjacency rules that are contradictory or create circular dependencies, causing the algorithm to backtrack excessively or never converge.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), server resource exhaustion, generation of invalid or nonsensical output.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust validation and sanitization of adjacency rules.
        *   Define a clear and restricted format for adjacency rules.
        *   Implement checks for contradictory or overly complex rule sets.
        *   Set timeouts for the wavefunction collapse algorithm execution to prevent indefinite processing.

## Attack Surface: [Excessively Large Output Dimensions](./attack_surfaces/excessively_large_output_dimensions.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker requests the generation of an output with extremely large dimensions (width and height), overwhelming server resources.
    *   **How Wavefunction Collapse Contributes:** The library attempts to generate an output of the specified size, consuming memory and CPU resources proportional to the output dimensions.
    *   **Example:** A user providing output dimensions of 10000x10000, leading to massive memory allocation and potential server crash.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), server memory exhaustion, application crashes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict limits on the maximum allowed output dimensions.
        *   Validate user-provided dimensions against predefined limits.
        *   Implement resource monitoring and alerts to detect and mitigate excessive resource consumption.
