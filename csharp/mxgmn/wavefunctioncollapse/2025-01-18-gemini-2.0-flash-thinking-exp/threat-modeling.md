# Threat Model Analysis for mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse

## Threat: [Malicious Input Samples Leading to Infinite Loops or Excessive Computation](./threats/malicious_input_samples_leading_to_infinite_loops_or_excessive_computation.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides crafted or malicious input samples (e.g., tile sets with circular dependencies or highly complex constraints) that cause the `wavefunctioncollapse` algorithm to enter an infinite loop or perform an extremely large number of iterations. This directly involves the input processing of the `wavefunctioncollapse` algorithm.

**Impact:** Denial of service due to resource exhaustion (CPU, memory), application unresponsiveness, potential server crashes.

**Affected Component:** `core` module, specifically the constraint propagation and backtracking mechanisms within the `wavefunctioncollapse` algorithm.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement timeouts for the `wavefunctioncollapse` execution.
* Implement input validation and sanitization on the input samples to detect and reject potentially problematic patterns or sizes.
* Monitor resource usage during `wavefunctioncollapse` execution and terminate processes exceeding acceptable limits.
* Consider using a sandbox environment for executing the `wavefunctioncollapse` algorithm to limit resource consumption.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities within the Wavefunction Collapse Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_within_the_wavefunction_collapse_library_itself.md)

**Description:** The `wavefunctioncollapse` library, like any software, might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, integer overflows, denial-of-service vulnerabilities in the parsing logic). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if they can control the input or parameters passed to the library. This directly targets the library's code.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.

**Affected Component:** Any module or function within the `wavefunctioncollapse` library containing the vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical, High, or Medium depending on the vulnerability) -  Assuming a potential Critical or High severity vulnerability exists.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update the `wavefunctioncollapse` library to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
* Monitor for security advisories related to the `wavefunctioncollapse` library.
* Consider using static and dynamic analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the library (if feasible).
* Isolate the execution of the `wavefunctioncollapse` library in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
