## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Manipulate Generated Content for Malicious Outcome](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__manipulate_generated_content_for_malicious_outcome.md)

This is the overarching goal and a critical point as it represents the attacker successfully influencing the generated content for malicious purposes.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Influence Generation via Malicious Input Data [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__influence_generation_via_malicious_input_data__high-risk_path_start_.md)

This critical node represents the attacker's ability to control or influence the input data (samples or tilesets) used by the WaveFunctionCollapse algorithm. This is a high-risk path because controlling the input directly impacts the generated output.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Inject Malicious Sample/Tileset](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__inject_malicious_sampletileset.md)

This critical node involves the attacker providing a specially crafted sample image or tileset as input. This is a direct action to manipulate the generation process.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH START] Supply Crafted Sample/Tileset Leading to Exploitable Output](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path_start__supply_crafted_sampletileset_leading_to_exploitable_output.md)

This marks the beginning of a high-risk path where the attacker's crafted input is designed to force the algorithm to produce specific output that can be exploited by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH END] Generate Content Causing Application Crash/Error](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path_end__generate_content_causing_application_crasherror.md)

This is the end of a high-risk path where the malicious input leads to generated content that the application cannot handle, resulting in a crash or error.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH END] Generate Content Revealing Sensitive Information](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path_end__generate_content_revealing_sensitive_information.md)

This is the end of a high-risk path where the malicious input leads to generated content that inadvertently exposes sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH END] [CRITICAL] Generate Content Enabling Further Exploitation (e.g., XSS, Path Traversal)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path_end___critical__generate_content_enabling_further_exploitation__e_g___xss__path_trav_309f5b87.md)

This is a critical high-risk path endpoint where the generated content contains malicious code or data that can be used for further attacks like Cross-Site Scripting or Path Traversal. This node is critical because it allows for escalation of the attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Influence Generation via Manipulated Parameters [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__influence_generation_via_manipulated_parameters__high-risk_path_start_.md)

This critical node represents the attacker's ability to control or influence the parameters used by the WaveFunctionCollapse algorithm. This is a high-risk path because manipulating parameters can directly alter the generation process and its outcome.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH END] Provide Extreme Values Leading to Resource Exhaustion (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path_end__provide_extreme_values_leading_to_resource_exhaustion__dos_.md)

This is the end of a high-risk path where the attacker provides extreme parameter values that cause the algorithm to consume excessive resources, leading to a Denial-of-Service.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH END] Generate Content with Predictable or Exploitable Patterns](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path_end__generate_content_with_predictable_or_exploitable_patterns.md)

This is the end of a high-risk path where manipulated parameters cause the algorithm to generate predictable or flawed content that can be exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH END] Force Generation of Specific, Malicious Content](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path_end__force_generation_of_specific__malicious_content.md)

This is the end of a high-risk path where the attacker manipulates parameters to force the generation of specific content known to be malicious or exploitable.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Generate Content Known to Trigger Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH START] [HIGH-RISK PATH END]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__generate_content_known_to_trigger_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_start___high-risk_path__7bd05bd1.md)

This critical node and high-risk path endpoint represents the attacker successfully forcing the generation of content that directly triggers known vulnerabilities within the application. This is critical due to the direct exploitation of existing weaknesses.
