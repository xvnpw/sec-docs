* **Threat:** Malicious Tile Definitions Leading to Infinite Loops
    * **Description:** An attacker provides crafted tile definitions with contradictory or overly complex adjacency rules. When the WFC algorithm processes these definitions, it enters an infinite loop trying to find a valid configuration. This consumes excessive CPU resources.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, server resource exhaustion, application unresponsiveness.
    * **Affected Component:** `mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse` - Specifically the core logic for constraint propagation and state collapsing within the `Model` class or related functions handling tile adjacency.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement timeouts for the WFC generation process.
        * Analyze tile definitions for potential contradictions or overly complex rules before passing them to the WFC algorithm. This could involve static analysis or heuristics.
        * Limit the complexity of allowed tile definitions (e.g., maximum number of connections per tile).

* **Threat:** Malicious Constraint Definitions Causing Excessive Backtracking
    * **Description:** An attacker provides constraint definitions that create a very constrained problem space with few or no valid solutions. This forces the WFC algorithm to perform extensive backtracking, consuming significant CPU and memory resources.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, server resource exhaustion, slow response times.
    * **Affected Component:** `mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse` - The constraint processing logic within the `Model` class, particularly the parts responsible for enforcing constraints and backtracking.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement timeouts for the WFC generation process.
        * Analyze constraint definitions for potential for excessive backtracking before processing.
        * Limit the complexity and number of constraints allowed.
        * Implement mechanisms to detect and abort generation attempts that are taking an unusually long time.
