# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Ruleset Schema Validation](./mitigation_strategies/input_ruleset_schema_validation.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Ruleset Schema Validation
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define a Strict Schema for Wavefunctioncollapse Rulesets:** Create a formal schema (e.g., using XML Schema Definition (XSD) or JSON Schema) that precisely defines the expected structure and data types for your `wavefunctioncollapse` ruleset files (XML or JSON). This schema must be tailored to the specific ruleset format used by `wavefunctioncollapse` and should specify:
        *   Required elements and attributes as defined by `wavefunctioncollapse` ruleset structure.
        *   Allowed data types for each element/attribute (e.g., string, integer, boolean, path) relevant to `wavefunctioncollapse` rules.
        *   Valid value ranges or patterns where applicable, considering the constraints of `wavefunctioncollapse` parameters.
    2.  **Implement Validation Logic Before Wavefunctioncollapse Processing:** Integrate a schema validation library into your application's backend code *before* the ruleset is passed to the `wavefunctioncollapse` library. This library will parse the incoming ruleset and compare it against the defined schema.
    3.  **Reject Invalid Rulesets Before Wavefunctioncollapse:** If a ruleset fails schema validation, immediately reject it *before* any `wavefunctioncollapse` processing begins. Return an error message indicating the ruleset is invalid due to schema violations.
    4.  **Log Validation Failures Related to Wavefunctioncollapse Rulesets:** Log all schema validation failures, including the reason for failure and the submitted ruleset (or a sanitized version). This helps in identifying issues with ruleset generation or potential malicious attempts to provide malformed input to `wavefunctioncollapse`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Ruleset Injection targeting Wavefunctioncollapse Parsing (High Severity):** Attackers could craft malicious rulesets with unexpected structures or data types to exploit parsing vulnerabilities *within the `wavefunctioncollapse` library itself* or in your application's ruleset processing logic *before* it reaches `wavefunctioncollapse`.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Rulesets impacting Wavefunctioncollapse (Medium Severity):** Malformed rulesets could trigger excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory) during parsing *before* or *during* `wavefunctioncollapse` execution, leading to DoS.
    *   **Information Disclosure due to Wavefunctioncollapse Errors (Low Severity):** If parsing errors related to `wavefunctioncollapse` rulesets are not handled correctly, error messages might inadvertently reveal internal application details or configurations when `wavefunctioncollapse` encounters issues.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Ruleset Injection targeting Wavefunctioncollapse Parsing (High Reduction):** Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring only structurally valid rulesets, as expected by `wavefunctioncollapse`, are processed.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Rulesets impacting Wavefunctioncollapse (Medium Reduction):** Reduces the risk by preventing processing of rulesets with inherently invalid structures that might trigger resource exhaustion during parsing or execution within `wavefunctioncollapse`.
    *   **Information Disclosure due to Wavefunctioncollapse Errors (Low Reduction):** Minimally reduces risk by ensuring consistent parsing behavior and reducing chances of unexpected parsing errors related to `wavefunctioncollapse` rulesets leading to information leaks.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Implemented (Hypothetical Project - Schema definition and validation logic specific to `wavefunctioncollapse` rulesets needs to be built and integrated into the backend ruleset processing before calling `wavefunctioncollapse`).
*   **Missing Implementation:** Backend ruleset processing module, specifically the part that handles loading and parsing ruleset files *before* passing them to the `wavefunctioncollapse` library.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Ruleset Content Validation for Wavefunctioncollapse](./mitigation_strategies/input_ruleset_content_validation_for_wavefunctioncollapse.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Ruleset Content Validation for Wavefunctioncollapse
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Content Constraints Relevant to Wavefunctioncollapse Performance:** Establish specific limits and constraints on the *content* within valid rulesets, beyond just the schema, that are directly relevant to the performance and security of `wavefunctioncollapse`. This includes:
        *   **Maximum Tile Count for Wavefunctioncollapse:** Set a limit on the total number of tiles defined in a ruleset to prevent overly large problem spaces for `wavefunctioncollapse`.
        *   **Maximum Tile Variation Count for Wavefunctioncollapse:** Limit the number of variations allowed for each tile to control the complexity of the `wavefunctioncollapse` problem.
        *   **Maximum Rule Complexity for Wavefunctioncollapse:** If feasible, define metrics for rule complexity (e.g., number of constraints per rule, pattern size) that can impact `wavefunctioncollapse`'s performance and set limits.
        *   **Allowed Tile Names and Paths for Wavefunctioncollapse Assets:** If rulesets reference external tile images used by `wavefunctioncollapse`, create a whitelist of allowed tile names or paths to control asset access.
    2.  **Implement Content Validation Logic After Schema Validation, Before Wavefunctioncollapse:** After schema validation, implement code to programmatically check these content constraints *before* passing the ruleset to `wavefunctioncollapse`. This might involve:
        *   Parsing the ruleset and counting tiles, variations, and analyzing rule structures in the context of `wavefunctioncollapse`'s processing.
        *   Comparing tile names/paths against the whitelist for assets used by `wavefunctioncollapse`.
    3.  **Reject Rulesets Exceeding Wavefunctioncollapse Limits:** If a ruleset violates any content constraints relevant to `wavefunctioncollapse`, reject it with an appropriate error message *before* `wavefunctioncollapse` is invoked.
    4.  **Log Content Validation Failures Related to Wavefunctioncollapse:** Log all content validation failures, including the specific constraint violated and the relevant part of the ruleset. This helps in understanding why rulesets are rejected and identifying potential attempts to overload `wavefunctioncollapse`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion during Wavefunctioncollapse Generation (High Severity):** Attackers could craft rulesets with an extremely large number of tiles, variations, or complex rules, leading to excessive CPU and memory usage *during the `wavefunctioncollapse` generation process itself*.
        *   **Server-Side Resource Abuse by Overloading Wavefunctioncollapse (Medium Severity):** Malicious users could intentionally submit resource-intensive rulesets to overload the `wavefunctioncollapse` algorithm and consume server resources, degrading performance for other users.
    *   **Unauthorized File Access via Wavefunctioncollapse Assets (Medium Severity):** If tile paths used by `wavefunctioncollapse` are not validated, attackers might attempt to access files outside of the intended tile directory when `wavefunctioncollapse` tries to load assets.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion during Wavefunctioncollapse Generation (High Reduction):** Significantly reduces the risk by limiting the scale and complexity of rulesets that can be processed by `wavefunctioncollapse`, preventing resource exhaustion during generation.
    *   **Server-Side Resource Abuse by Overloading Wavefunctioncollapse (Medium Reduction):** Reduces the impact of resource abuse by limiting the resources a single `wavefunctioncollapse` generation process can consume.
    *   **Unauthorized File Access via Wavefunctioncollapse Assets (Medium Reduction):** Reduces the risk by restricting the allowed tile paths for assets used by `wavefunctioncollapse`, preventing access to arbitrary files during asset loading.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented (Hypothetical Project - Basic limits related to `wavefunctioncollapse` might be in place, but comprehensive content validation logic specifically tailored to `wavefunctioncollapse` performance and security likely needs to be added).
*   **Missing Implementation:** Backend ruleset processing module, specifically after schema validation but *before* passing the ruleset to `wavefunctioncollapse` for generation.

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Sanitize User-Provided Seeds for Wavefunctioncollapse
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Seed Input Type for Wavefunctioncollapse:** Determine the expected data type for user-provided seeds that are used to control the randomness in `wavefunctioncollapse` (e.g., integer).
    2.  **Validate Input Type for Wavefunctioncollapse Seeds:** Ensure that the user-provided seed is of the expected data type before using it with `wavefunctioncollapse`. Reject seeds that are not of the correct type.
    3.  **Validate Input Range for Wavefunctioncollapse Seeds:** If applicable, define a valid range for seed values that are appropriate for `wavefunctioncollapse`'s random number generator (e.g., positive integers, within a specific numerical range). Validate that the seed falls within this range.
    4.  **Sanitize Input (If Necessary) for Wavefunctioncollapse Seeds:** If the seed input is a string, sanitize it to remove any potentially harmful characters or escape sequences before using it to initialize `wavefunctioncollapse`'s random number generator. For integer seeds, direct type casting and range checks are usually sufficient.
    5.  **Consider Server-Side Seed Generation for Wavefunctioncollapse:** For applications where predictability is not a primary user feature of `wavefunctioncollapse`, consider generating seeds server-side using a secure random number generator and not relying on user input at all to have more control over the randomness in `wavefunctioncollapse`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unexpected Wavefunctioncollapse Behavior due to Invalid Seeds (Low Severity):** Invalid seed inputs might cause the `wavefunctioncollapse` algorithm to behave unexpectedly or throw errors, although this is less of a direct security threat and more of an application stability issue.
    *   **Limited Predictability Control over Wavefunctioncollapse Output (Low Severity):** While not a direct security threat, uncontrolled seed input might make it harder to reproduce or debug `wavefunctioncollapse` generation results, which can indirectly complicate security analysis.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unexpected Wavefunctioncollapse Behavior due to Invalid Seeds (Low Reduction):** Reduces the risk of application errors caused by invalid seed inputs to `wavefunctioncollapse`.
    *   **Limited Predictability Control over Wavefunctioncollapse Output (Low Reduction):** Improves predictability and control over `wavefunctioncollapse` generation results, which can indirectly aid in debugging and security analysis related to `wavefunctioncollapse`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented (Hypothetical Project - Basic type checking for `wavefunctioncollapse` seeds might be in place, but range validation and robust sanitization might be missing).
*   **Missing Implementation:** Input handling logic for generation requests, specifically where user-provided seeds are processed before being passed to the `wavefunctioncollapse` library.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Set Maximum Execution Time for Wavefunctioncollapse:** Determine a reasonable maximum execution time for the `wavefunctioncollapse` generation process based on expected ruleset complexity and server resources, considering the typical performance characteristics of `wavefunctioncollapse`.
    2.  **Implement Timeout Mechanism Around Wavefunctioncollapse Call:** Use programming language or framework features to set a timeout *specifically for the function call that executes the `wavefunctioncollapse` algorithm*. This could involve using timers, asynchronous operations with timeouts, or process monitoring with time limits applied to the `wavefunctioncollapse` execution.
    3.  **Handle Wavefunctioncollapse Timeout Events:** When the timeout is reached during `wavefunctioncollapse` execution, gracefully terminate the `wavefunctioncollapse` generation process.
    4.  **Return Wavefunctioncollapse Timeout Error:** Return an error message to the user indicating that the `wavefunctioncollapse` generation process timed out.
    5.  **Log Wavefunctioncollapse Timeout Events:** Log all timeout events, including the ruleset being processed (or a sanitized identifier) and the timeout duration. This helps in monitoring `wavefunctioncollapse` performance and identifying potentially problematic rulesets.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Long-Running Wavefunctioncollapse Generation (High Severity):** Attackers could submit complex rulesets that cause the `wavefunctioncollapse` algorithm to run indefinitely, consuming server resources and leading to DoS *specifically by overloading the `wavefunctioncollapse` process*.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion due to Unbounded Wavefunctioncollapse Execution (Medium Severity):** Unbounded `wavefunctioncollapse` generation processes can exhaust server resources (CPU, memory, threads) even without malicious intent, impacting application performance and stability due to prolonged `wavefunctioncollapse` execution.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Long-Running Wavefunctioncollapse Generation (High Reduction):** Significantly reduces the risk by preventing `wavefunctioncollapse` generation processes from running indefinitely and consuming excessive resources.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion due to Unbounded Wavefunctioncollapse Execution (Medium Reduction):** Reduces the risk of resource exhaustion by limiting the maximum runtime of `wavefunctioncollapse` generation processes.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Implemented (Hypothetical Project - Timeout mechanism for `wavefunctioncollapse` generation is likely missing).
*   **Missing Implementation:** Backend generation processing module, specifically the function that calls the `wavefunctioncollapse` library to perform generation.
