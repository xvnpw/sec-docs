## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Compromise Application via WaveFunctionCollapse Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_application_via_wavefunctioncollapse_vulnerabilities.md)

This is the root goal of the attacker. Success here means the attacker has achieved their objective by exploiting weaknesses related to the WaveFunctionCollapse library.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Input Processing Vulnerabilities in WFC](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_input_processing_vulnerabilities_in_wfc.md)

This is a primary attack vector.  Attackers target how the WFC library processes input data (rules, tile sets, parameters). Vulnerabilities here can lead to various impacts, from DoS to potential code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Malicious Input Rules/Constraints](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_malicious_input_rulesconstraints.md)

Attackers manipulate the rules and constraints provided as input to WFC. This is a direct way to influence WFC's behavior.

* **HIGH RISK PATH: Craft overly complex rules**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers create rule sets that are computationally very expensive for WFC to process.
    * **Result:**  Excessive CPU usage, memory consumption, and prolonged processing times, leading to Denial of Service (DoS). The application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to resource exhaustion.

* **HIGH RISK PATH: Provide extremely large rule sets/tile sets**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers provide very large input files for rules or tile sets, exceeding expected or reasonable sizes.
    * **Result:** Memory exhaustion and Denial of Service (DoS). The application runs out of memory and crashes, or becomes unresponsive due to excessive memory usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Input Buffer Overflow (in WFC C++ code)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_input_buffer_overflow__in_wfc_c++_code_.md)

Attackers attempt to exploit potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the C++ code of the WFC library during input processing.
    * **Attack Vector:** Providing excessively long input strings for rule names, tile names, or other input fields that are not properly bounded in the C++ code.
    * **Result:**  Application crash, and potentially, if exploitable, arbitrary code execution on the server. This is a high-impact vulnerability if present.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Integer Overflow/Underflow in Input Handling](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_integer_overflowunderflow_in_input_handling.md)

Attackers try to trigger integer overflow or underflow conditions in the WFC C++ code when handling input parameters.
    * **Attack Vector:** Providing extreme integer values for input parameters like tile counts, dimensions, or other numerical settings.
    * **Result:** Unexpected behavior, memory corruption, or Denial of Service. In some cases, integer overflows can be exploited for more severe vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit WFC Algorithm/Logic Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_wfc_algorithmlogic_vulnerabilities.md)

Attackers target weaknesses in the core WaveFunctionCollapse algorithm itself.

    * **CRITICAL NODE: Algorithmic Complexity Exploitation**
        * Attackers aim to exploit the computational complexity of the WFC algorithm.

        * **HIGH RISK PATH: Craft input that leads to exponential backtracking/slow convergence**
            * **Attack Vector:**  Designing input rules and constraints that force the WFC algorithm into a worst-case scenario, causing excessive backtracking and extremely slow convergence.
            * **Result:**  Excessive processing time and resource exhaustion, leading to Denial of Service (DoS). The application becomes unresponsive due to prolonged computation.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Output Handling Vulnerabilities in WFC](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_output_handling_vulnerabilities_in_wfc.md)

Attackers target potential vulnerabilities in how WFC generates and handles output data. This is less likely in the core library but could be relevant in specific integrations.
    * **Attack Vector:** Triggering the generation of extremely large output data or exploiting format string vulnerabilities during output formatting (less likely in core WFC).
    * **Result:** Output buffer overflows leading to crashes or potential code execution, or information disclosure/code execution from format string vulnerabilities (less likely).

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Dependency Vulnerabilities in WFC](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_dependency_vulnerabilities_in_wfc.md)

Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in external libraries that the WFC project depends on (e.g., image loading libraries).
    * **Attack Vector:** Identifying and exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in WFC's dependencies.
    * **Result:**  Depending on the dependency vulnerability, this could lead to code execution, Denial of Service, or other security breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Build/Deployment Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_builddeployment_vulnerabilities.md)

Attackers target vulnerabilities in the build and deployment process of the WFC library itself, or the application using it.

    * **CRITICAL NODE: Compromised WFC Library/Binary**
        * Attackers aim to replace the legitimate WFC library with a malicious or backdoored version.
        * **Attack Vector:** Supply chain attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks during download, or compromising the build environment to inject malicious code into the WFC library.
        * **Result:** Full application compromise, data theft, and complete control over the application and potentially the underlying system. This is a critical impact scenario.
