### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Craft input that leads to exponential backtracking/slow convergence

#### 4.1. Understanding the Attack: Algorithmic Complexity Exploitation in WFC

The WaveFunctionCollapse algorithm is a constraint satisfaction algorithm that generates patterns based on a set of input tiles and rules defining how these tiles can be adjacent to each other.  The algorithm works iteratively, collapsing "wave functions" (probabilities of tiles at each location) until a valid output pattern is generated or a contradiction is found (leading to backtracking).

**Backtracking** is a core mechanism in WFC. When the algorithm reaches a state where no valid tile can be placed at a certain location without violating the rules, it needs to backtrack to a previous state and try a different tile choice. In the worst-case scenario, the number of backtracking steps can grow exponentially with the size and complexity of the input rules and constraints.

**Algorithmic Complexity Exploitation** in this context means crafting input (specifically, the tile rules and constraints) in a way that intentionally forces the WFC algorithm into a computationally expensive search space, leading to a large number of backtracking steps and significantly increased processing time.

#### 4.2. Attack Vector: Crafting Malicious Input Rules and Constraints

The attack vector focuses on manipulating the input provided to the WFC algorithm.  This input typically includes:

* **Tile Set:** The collection of tiles that can be used in the output pattern.
* **Adjacency Rules (Constraints):**  Rules defining which tiles can be placed next to each other in different directions (up, down, left, right).
* **Output Grid Size:** The dimensions of the desired output pattern.
* **Initial Conditions/Constraints (Optional):**  Pre-defined tiles or constraints for specific locations in the output grid.

Attackers can craft malicious input by strategically designing the **adjacency rules and constraints**.  Here's how they can achieve exponential backtracking:

* **Conflicting Rules:**  Creating rules that are inherently contradictory or highly restrictive. For example:
    *  Tile 'A' must be adjacent to Tile 'B'.
    *  Tile 'B' must be adjacent to Tile 'C'.
    *  Tile 'C' must *not* be adjacent to Tile 'A'.
    This creates a circular dependency that might be impossible to satisfy, forcing the algorithm to explore many invalid paths and backtrack extensively.
* **Overly Restrictive Rules:**  Defining rules that are so specific and limited that they severely constrain the possible valid solutions. This can lead to a very sparse solution space, making it difficult for the algorithm to find a valid configuration quickly.  Imagine rules that allow only a very specific sequence of tiles, but the output grid size is large.
* **Large and Complex Rule Sets:**  While not necessarily contradictory, a very large and complex set of rules can increase the search space significantly.  Even without explicit contradictions, the sheer number of rules to check at each step can slow down the algorithm and increase the likelihood of backtracking.
* **Input Parameters Manipulation (if exposed):** If the application exposes parameters that control the rule generation or constraint application process (e.g., rule generation algorithms, constraint strength parameters), attackers might manipulate these to create problematic rule sets indirectly.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a simplified WFC application generating pixel art.  An attacker could craft input rules like:

1.  "Red pixel must be adjacent to Blue pixel."
2.  "Blue pixel must be adjacent to Green pixel."
3.  "Green pixel must be adjacent to Yellow pixel."
4.  "Yellow pixel must be adjacent to Red pixel."
5.  "No pixel can be adjacent to itself."

While not explicitly contradictory at first glance, these rules, especially combined with rule 5, create a very tight constraint loop.  If the output grid is large, the algorithm might struggle to find a valid configuration that satisfies all these rules simultaneously, leading to significant backtracking and prolonged processing.

#### 4.3. Result: Denial of Service (DoS)

The primary result of successfully exploiting this attack vector is a **Denial of Service (DoS)**.  When the WFC algorithm is forced into exponential backtracking, it consumes excessive computational resources:

* **CPU Exhaustion:** The algorithm will spend a significant amount of CPU time exploring invalid states and backtracking. This can saturate the server's CPU, making it unresponsive to legitimate user requests.
* **Memory Exhaustion:**  Backtracking algorithms often require storing intermediate states to revert to previous configurations.  Exponential backtracking can lead to a rapid increase in memory usage, potentially exhausting available memory and causing the application to crash or slow down drastically due to swapping.
* **Prolonged Processing Time:**  The most direct impact is a significant increase in the time it takes to process the WFC request.  What might normally take milliseconds or seconds could extend to minutes or even hours, rendering the application unusable for legitimate users.
* **Application Unresponsiveness:**  As resources are consumed and processing time increases, the application becomes unresponsive to user requests.  Users will experience timeouts, errors, or extremely slow loading times, effectively denying them access to the application's functionality.

This DoS attack is particularly insidious because it leverages the inherent complexity of the algorithm itself, rather than relying on traditional vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or injection flaws. It can be difficult to detect and mitigate without understanding the underlying algorithmic behavior.

#### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate the risk of algorithmic complexity exploitation leading to DoS, the following strategies should be considered:

**4.4.1. Input Validation and Sanitization:**

* **Rule Complexity Limits:** Implement limits on the complexity of input rules. This could involve:
    * **Maximum Number of Rules:** Restricting the total number of adjacency rules allowed.
    * **Rule Specificity Limits:**  Limiting the complexity of individual rules (e.g., number of conditions per rule).
    * **Rule Structure Validation:**  Analyzing the structure of the rules to detect potentially problematic patterns (e.g., circular dependencies, overly restrictive combinations).
* **Input Parameter Validation:**  If the application exposes parameters that influence rule generation or constraint application, rigorously validate these parameters to prevent attackers from indirectly creating complex rule sets.
* **Input Size Limits:**  Limit the size of the input grid and the number of tiles. Larger grids generally increase computational complexity.

**4.4.2. Algorithmic Safeguards and Timeouts:**

* **Timeout Mechanisms:** Implement strict timeouts for WFC algorithm execution. If the algorithm exceeds a predefined time limit, terminate the process and return an error to the user. This prevents indefinite resource consumption.
* **Iteration Limits:**  Limit the maximum number of iterations or backtracking steps the WFC algorithm is allowed to perform.  This can prevent runaway computations, although it might also lead to incomplete or invalid outputs in some legitimate cases.
* **Complexity Analysis (Pre-computation Check):**  Before running the WFC algorithm, perform a lightweight analysis of the input rules and constraints to estimate their potential complexity. If the estimated complexity exceeds a threshold, reject the request or issue a warning. This is a more advanced technique and might be challenging to implement accurately.

**4.4.3. Resource Management and Monitoring:**

* **Resource Limits (Containerization/Sandboxing):**  Run the WFC algorithm in a sandboxed environment or container with resource limits (CPU, memory, time). This prevents a single malicious request from impacting the entire server.
* **Resource Monitoring:**  Implement real-time monitoring of resource usage (CPU, memory) during WFC algorithm execution.  If resource consumption spikes unexpectedly, trigger alerts and potentially terminate the process.
* **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting on requests that trigger the WFC algorithm. This can limit the number of malicious requests an attacker can send in a short period, reducing the overall impact of a DoS attack.

**4.4.4. Code Review and Algorithm Optimization:**

* **Code Review:**  Conduct thorough code reviews of the WFC algorithm implementation to identify potential performance bottlenecks and areas where complexity might be unintentionally introduced.
* **Algorithm Optimization:**  Explore opportunities to optimize the WFC algorithm implementation to improve its performance and reduce its susceptibility to complexity exploitation. This might involve exploring different backtracking strategies, constraint propagation techniques, or data structures.

#### 4.5. Risk Assessment

**Likelihood:**  **Medium to High.** The likelihood of this attack being successful depends on:

* **Exposure of Input Parameters:** If the application directly exposes the ability to define custom tile rules and constraints to users (especially untrusted users), the likelihood is higher.
* **Complexity of Application Logic:** If the application uses complex or dynamically generated rules, it might be easier for attackers to find problematic input combinations.
* **Lack of Input Validation:** If input validation is weak or non-existent, attackers have more freedom to craft malicious input.

**Impact:** **High.** The impact of a successful attack is significant, leading to:

* **Denial of Service:**  Application unresponsiveness and unavailability for legitimate users.
* **Resource Exhaustion:**  Potential server overload and instability.
* **Reputational Damage:**  Negative user experience and potential loss of trust.

**Overall Risk:** **Medium-High.**  This attack path represents a significant security risk, especially for applications that rely heavily on the WFC algorithm and expose input parameters to users.  Mitigation strategies are crucial to protect against this type of algorithmic complexity exploitation.
