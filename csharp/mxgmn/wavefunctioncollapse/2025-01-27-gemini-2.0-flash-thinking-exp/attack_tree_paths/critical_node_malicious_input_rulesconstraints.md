### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

#### 4.1. HIGH RISK PATH: Craft overly complex rules

##### 4.1.1. Threat Description

Attackers exploit the computational complexity inherent in certain rule sets used by the Wave Function Collapse algorithm. By crafting rules that lead to exponential or significantly increased processing time, attackers can induce a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This attack leverages the algorithm's processing logic itself, rather than exploiting traditional software vulnerabilities like buffer overflows.

##### 4.1.2. Attack Vector

The attack vector involves providing maliciously crafted rule sets as input to the WFC application. These rule sets are designed to be computationally expensive for the WFC algorithm to process. Specific examples of overly complex rules could include:

*   **Highly ambiguous constraints:** Rules that allow for a vast number of possible configurations, leading to extensive backtracking and search space exploration by the algorithm.
*   **Rules with high degrees of freedom:** Rules that introduce many variables or choices at each step of the WFC process, increasing the branching factor and computational load.
*   **Circular or self-referential rules:** Rules that create dependencies that are difficult to resolve or lead to infinite loops (though WFC implementations usually have mechanisms to prevent infinite loops, very long processing times are still possible).
*   **Rules that maximize backtracking:** Rules designed to force the WFC algorithm to explore many incorrect paths before finding a valid solution or determining that no solution exists.

##### 4.1.3. Technical Details

The Wave Function Collapse algorithm, in essence, is a constraint satisfaction problem solver. Its performance is heavily influenced by the complexity and constraints defined by the input rules.  When processing rules, the algorithm typically performs operations like:

*   **Constraint Propagation:**  Inferring constraints based on existing rules and tile configurations.
*   **Backtracking Search:** Exploring different tile placements and configurations, backtracking when constraints are violated.
*   **Entropy Calculation:**  Determining the tile with the lowest entropy (most constrained) to collapse next.

Overly complex rules can significantly increase the time spent in these operations, particularly in backtracking and constraint propagation.  The algorithm might get stuck in exploring a vast search space, leading to:

*   **Increased CPU Usage:**  The processor is constantly working to evaluate rules and explore possibilities.
*   **Increased Memory Consumption:**  The algorithm might need to store a large number of intermediate states and possibilities during the search process.
*   **Prolonged Processing Times:**  The WFC process takes an excessively long time to complete, or may never complete within a reasonable timeframe.

##### 4.1.4. Impact Assessment

The primary impact of this attack is Denial of Service (DoS).  Successful exploitation can lead to:

*   **Application Unresponsiveness:** The WFC application becomes slow or completely unresponsive to legitimate user requests.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Server resources (CPU, memory) are consumed excessively, potentially impacting other applications or services running on the same infrastructure.
*   **Application Crashes:** In extreme cases, resource exhaustion can lead to application crashes and service interruptions.
*   **User Frustration and Service Disruption:** Legitimate users are unable to use the WFC application, leading to frustration and disruption of workflows.

##### 4.1.5. Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate the risk of overly complex rule attacks, the following strategies should be implemented:

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Rule Complexity Limits:** Implement limits on the complexity of rules, such as the number of constraints per rule, the depth of rule dependencies, or the overall size of the rule set definition.
    *   **Syntax and Semantic Checks:**  Thoroughly validate the syntax and semantics of the input rules to ensure they are well-formed and within acceptable complexity bounds. Reject rules that are syntactically invalid or semantically ambiguous in a way that could lead to excessive computation.
    *   **Rule Analysis (Pre-processing):**  Develop a pre-processing step to analyze the input rules for potential complexity issues before feeding them to the core WFC algorithm. This could involve static analysis techniques to estimate the potential computational cost of a rule set.

*   **Resource Limits and Sandboxing:**
    *   **CPU Time Limits:** Implement timeouts for WFC processing. If processing exceeds a predefined time limit, terminate the process and return an error.
    *   **Memory Limits:**  Set memory limits for the WFC process to prevent it from consuming excessive memory and crashing the system.
    *   **Process Isolation (Sandboxing):** Run the WFC processing in a sandboxed environment with limited resource access to contain the impact of resource exhaustion.

*   **Algorithm Optimization (Careful Consideration):**
    *   While optimizing the core WFC algorithm itself is beneficial for general performance, it might not fully mitigate attacks based on inherently complex rule sets. However, algorithmic improvements can reduce the overall impact.

*   **Rate Limiting (If applicable via API):**
    *   If the WFC application is exposed via an API, implement rate limiting to restrict the number of rule processing requests from a single source within a given timeframe. This can help prevent attackers from overwhelming the system with malicious requests.

##### 4.1.6. Detection Methods

Detecting attacks based on overly complex rules can be achieved through monitoring and anomaly detection:

*   **Resource Monitoring:**
    *   **CPU Usage Monitoring:** Monitor CPU utilization for the WFC application. A sudden or sustained spike in CPU usage, especially when processing user-provided rules, could indicate an attack.
    *   **Memory Usage Monitoring:** Track memory consumption. Rapid or excessive memory growth during rule processing can be a sign of malicious input.
    *   **Processing Time Monitoring:** Log and monitor the processing time for each WFC request.  Unusually long processing times for specific rule sets should trigger alerts.

*   **Anomaly Detection:**
    *   **Baseline Establishment:** Establish baseline resource usage patterns for normal WFC operations with typical rule sets.
    *   **Deviation Detection:**  Detect significant deviations from the established baselines in CPU usage, memory consumption, or processing time.
    *   **Statistical Anomaly Detection:** Employ statistical methods to identify outliers in resource usage metrics that might indicate malicious activity.

*   **Logging and Auditing:**
    *   **Input Rule Logging:** Log the input rule sets being processed (or at least a hash of them for privacy). This can help in post-incident analysis and identifying malicious rule patterns.
    *   **Event Logging:** Log relevant events such as processing start/end times, resource usage metrics, and any errors or timeouts.

#### 4.2. HIGH RISK PATH: Provide extremely large rule sets/tile sets

##### 4.2.1. Threat Description

Attackers attempt to exhaust the application's resources by providing excessively large input files for rule sets or tile sets. This attack leverages the application's file handling and data loading mechanisms to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

##### 4.2.2. Attack Vector

The attack vector involves providing extremely large files as input for rule sets or tile sets. This can be achieved through:

*   **File Upload:** Uploading very large rule set or tile set files through a web interface or API endpoint.
*   **File Path Injection (Less likely in this context, but consider if file paths are user-controlled):**  Providing a path to an extremely large file accessible to the application.

##### 4.2.3. Technical Details

When processing large input files, the WFC application typically performs operations like:

*   **File Reading and Parsing:** Reading the entire file content into memory and parsing it to extract rules or tile set data.
*   **Data Storage:** Storing the parsed data in memory for use by the WFC algorithm.
*   **Memory Allocation:** Allocating memory to hold the large data structures representing rules and tile sets.

Providing extremely large files can lead to:

*   **Memory Exhaustion:**  Attempting to load and store very large files can quickly consume all available memory, leading to application crashes or system instability.
*   **Disk Space Exhaustion (If files are stored):** If the application stores uploaded files on disk, excessively large files can fill up disk space, impacting the application and potentially other services on the same system.
*   **Prolonged Processing Times (File I/O):** Reading and parsing very large files can take a significant amount of time, contributing to application unresponsiveness.

##### 4.2.4. Impact Assessment

Similar to the complex rules attack, the primary impact is Denial of Service (DoS).  Consequences include:

*   **Application Crashes:** Memory exhaustion is a common outcome, leading to application crashes.
*   **Application Unresponsiveness:**  Excessive memory usage or prolonged file I/O can make the application unresponsive.
*   **System Instability:** In severe cases, memory exhaustion can destabilize the entire system.
*   **Disk Space Exhaustion (If applicable):**  Can lead to broader system issues if disk space is critical.

##### 4.2.5. Mitigation Strategies

Mitigating large file attacks requires robust input validation and resource management:

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **File Size Limits:** Implement strict file size limits for uploaded rule set and tile set files. These limits should be based on reasonable expected file sizes for legitimate use cases and the available resources.
    *   **File Type Checks:**  Verify the file type and format to ensure they are expected and prevent the upload of arbitrary large files disguised as rule sets or tile sets.
    *   **Content Inspection (Limited):**  While difficult for very large files, consider basic content inspection to detect obviously malicious or oversized content within the file header or initial parts.

*   **Resource Limits and Sandboxing:**
    *   **Memory Limits:**  Set memory limits for the WFC process to prevent memory exhaustion from large file processing.
    *   **Disk Quotas (If applicable):** If files are stored, implement disk quotas to limit the amount of disk space that can be consumed by uploaded files.
    *   **Process Isolation (Sandboxing):**  Run file processing in a sandboxed environment to contain the impact of resource exhaustion.

*   **Streaming or Lazy Loading (If feasible for WFC):**
    *   Explore if the WFC algorithm can be adapted to process rule sets or tile sets in a streaming or lazy loading manner, rather than loading the entire file into memory at once. This can significantly reduce memory footprint for large files. However, this might be complex to implement depending on the WFC algorithm's architecture.

*   **Secure File Handling Practices:**
    *   **Temporary File Storage:** If files are temporarily stored during processing, use secure temporary directories and ensure proper cleanup after processing.
    *   **Access Control:**  Implement appropriate access controls to prevent unauthorized access to uploaded files.

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF) (If applicable via web interface):**
    *   **File Size Limits:** Configure WAF to enforce file size limits on uploads.
    *   **Content Type Filtering:**  Use WAF to filter and validate the content type of uploaded files.

##### 4.2.6. Detection Methods

Detecting large file attacks involves monitoring resource usage and file handling activities:

*   **Resource Monitoring:**
    *   **Memory Usage Monitoring:**  Monitor memory consumption closely, especially during file upload and processing. Rapid memory growth can indicate a large file attack.
    *   **Disk Space Monitoring (If applicable):** Monitor disk space usage if files are stored. Unexpected increases in disk usage could be a sign of large file uploads.
    *   **Network Traffic Monitoring (Upload Size):** Monitor network traffic for unusually large upload requests to the WFC application.

*   **Logging and Auditing:**
    *   **File Upload Logging:** Log file upload attempts, including file names, sizes, and upload times.
    *   **Error Logging:** Log any errors related to file processing, such as "out of memory" errors or file size limit violations.
    *   **Access Logging:** Log access to file storage locations (if applicable).

*   **Anomaly Detection:**
    *   **File Size Anomaly Detection:**  Detect unusually large file uploads compared to typical file sizes.
    *   **Memory Usage Anomaly Detection:** Detect significant deviations from baseline memory usage during file processing.
