## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Tile Set Schema Validation](./mitigation_strategies/strict_tile_set_schema_validation.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Tile Set Schema Validation

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define a Formal Schema:** Create a JSON Schema (or equivalent) that precisely defines the structure and allowed values for tile set definitions *that are fed into the `wavefunctioncollapse` library*. This schema acts as a contract for valid input.
    2.  **Schema Elements:** The schema should include:
        *   **Tile ID Format:** Specify the allowed data type (integer, string) and any constraints (e.g., maximum length, allowed characters) *for tile identifiers used by the library*.
        *   **Tile Properties:** Define required properties for each tile *as expected by the library* (e.g., image path if it uses images, color, metadata) and their data types.
        *   **Connectivity Rules:** Define the structure for specifying how tiles connect *according to the library's input format* (e.g., "north," "south," "east," "west" connections, or more complex adjacency rules). Specify allowed values and relationships.
        *   **Cardinality Constraints:** Limit the maximum number of tiles, the maximum number of connections per tile, and other quantitative limits *to prevent the library from being overwhelmed*.
    3.  **Implementation:** Integrate a JSON Schema validator library into the application. *Immediately before passing any tile set data to the `wavefunctioncollapse` library*, pass it to the validator.
    4.  **Rejection:** If the validator reports any errors (the input doesn't match the schema), reject the input immediately.  Return a clear error message to the user indicating the specific validation failures.  *Do not call the `wavefunctioncollapse` library with invalid input*.
    5.  **Example (Conceptual JSON Schema Snippet):** (Same as before, but the emphasis is on validating input *specifically for the library*).

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Tile Set Injection (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from injecting arbitrary data into the tile set, which could lead to unexpected behavior *within the `wavefunctioncollapse` library itself*.
    *   **Data Type Mismatches (Severity: Medium):** Ensures that tile properties and connection rules have the expected data types, preventing unexpected behavior or crashes *within the library*.
    *   **Schema Violation DoS (Severity: Medium):** By limiting the size and complexity of the tile set (cardinality constraints), it helps prevent denial-of-service attacks that attempt to overload the *`wavefunctioncollapse` library* with excessively large inputs.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Tile Set Injection:** Risk reduced significantly (close to elimination if the schema is comprehensive and the validator is correctly implemented).
    *   **Data Type Mismatches:** Risk reduced to near zero.
    *   **Schema Violation DoS:** Risk significantly reduced, but other DoS mitigations are still necessary.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** Schema definition exists in `tileset_schema.json`. Validation is performed in the `TileSetLoader` class.
    *   Missing cardinality constraints in the schema.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Cardinality constraints (maxItems, maxConnections, etc.) are not yet defined in `tileset_schema.json`.
    *   The error messages returned to the user could be more specific about the validation failures.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rule Logic Validation](./mitigation_strategies/rule_logic_validation.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy:** Rule Logic Validation

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Rule Representation:** Define a clear and unambiguous way to represent the connection rules between tiles *as understood by the `wavefunctioncollapse` library*. This could be a custom data structure or a domain-specific language (DSL), *but it must be compatible with the library's input format*.
    2.  **Completeness Check:**  For each tile and each possible direction (or adjacency type) *recognized by the library*, verify that a rule exists.  If a rule is missing, either:
        *   Reject the tile set as incomplete.
        *   Use a predefined default behavior (e.g., assume no connection) *if the library supports default behaviors*.
    3.  **Consistency Check:**  Examine pairs of rules to ensure they are not contradictory *according to the logic of the `wavefunctioncollapse` library*.
    4.  **Cycle Detection (If Applicable):**  *If the specific `wavefunctioncollapse` implementation is known to be susceptible to infinite loops from cyclical rule patterns*, implement an algorithm to detect and prevent these cycles.
    5.  **Implementation:** Create a `RuleValidator` class that encapsulates these checks.  This class should be called *immediately before passing the rule set to the `wavefunctioncollapse` library*.
    6.  **Rejection:** If any rule validation checks fail, reject the tile set and provide a clear error message. *Do not call the `wavefunctioncollapse` library with invalid rules*.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Infinite Loops (Severity: High):** Prevents the `wavefunctioncollapse` algorithm from getting stuck in an infinite loop due to contradictory or cyclical rules *within the library's internal logic*.
    *   **Unexpected Output (Severity: Medium):** Ensures that the generated output adheres to the intended rules, preventing nonsensical or inconsistent results *produced by the library*.
    *   **Logic Errors (Severity: Medium):** Catches errors in the rule definitions that could lead to unexpected behavior *within the library*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Infinite Loops:** Risk significantly reduced (close to elimination if cycle detection is robust and applicable to the library).
    *   **Unexpected Output:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Logic Errors:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** Basic consistency checks (e.g., checking for reciprocal connections) are implemented in the `RuleValidator` class.
    *   Completeness check is missing.
    *   Cycle detection is missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Completeness check (ensuring rules exist for all possible adjacencies) is not implemented.
    *   Cycle detection algorithm is not implemented (and may not be necessary depending on the specific `wavefunctioncollapse` library used).
    *   The `RuleValidator` needs to be integrated into the main processing pipeline *immediately before* the `wavefunctioncollapse` library call.

## Mitigation Strategy: [WFC Algorithm Timeout](./mitigation_strategies/wfc_algorithm_timeout.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy:** WFC Algorithm Timeout

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Set a Time Limit:** Determine a reasonable maximum execution time *for the `wavefunctioncollapse` library call*. This should be based on:
        *   The expected complexity of typical tile sets and rules *that are valid inputs to the library*.
        *   The desired performance characteristics of the application.
        *   Testing with various input sizes and complexities *passed to the library*.
    2.  **Implementation:**
        *   Use a timer mechanism (e.g., `threading.Timer` in Python) to track the execution time *of the `wavefunctioncollapse` library function*.
        *   Start the timer *immediately before* calling the `wavefunctioncollapse` function.
        *   If the timer expires before the `wavefunctioncollapse` algorithm completes, interrupt the algorithm.
    3.  **Interruption:**  The interruption mechanism *must be compatible with the `wavefunctioncollapse` library*. It might involve:
        *   Setting a flag that the `wavefunctioncollapse` algorithm checks periodically (if the library supports this).
        *   Raising an exception that the `wavefunctioncollapse` algorithm catches (if the library supports this).
        *   Terminating the thread or process running the `wavefunctioncollapse` algorithm (use with caution and only if the library can handle this gracefully).  *This is the least desirable option*.
    4.  **Error Handling:**  After interrupting the algorithm, handle the situation gracefully:
        *   Log the timeout event.
        *   Return an error message to the user indicating that the generation process timed out.
        *   Clean up any resources used by the `wavefunctioncollapse` algorithm (if necessary and possible).
    5. **Configuration:** Make the timeout value configurable, but provide a safe default value.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Complexity (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from causing a denial-of-service by providing inputs that lead to extremely long processing times *within the `wavefunctioncollapse` library*.
    *   **Infinite Loops (Severity: High):** Provides a fallback mechanism to stop the algorithm if it gets stuck in an infinite loop due to unforeseen issues *within the library*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS via Complexity:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Infinite Loops:** Risk significantly reduced (provides a safety net).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Not Implemented:** No timeout mechanism is currently in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The entire timeout mechanism needs to be implemented, including the timer, interruption logic (compatible with the library), and error handling. This should be integrated into the `WFCProcessor` class, *specifically around the call to the `wavefunctioncollapse` library*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Output Size Limits](./mitigation_strategies/output_size_limits.md)

**4. Mitigation Strategy:** Output Size Limits

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Maximum Dimensions:** Determine the maximum allowed width and height for the generated output *passed as parameters to the `wavefunctioncollapse` library*.
    2.  **Implementation:**
        *   *Before calling the `wavefunctioncollapse` library*, check the requested output dimensions against the defined limits.
        *   If the requested dimensions exceed the limits, reject the request and return an error message to the user. *Do not call the `wavefunctioncollapse` library with excessive dimensions*.
    3. **Configuration:** Make the maximum dimensions configurable, but with safe default values.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Output (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from requesting extremely large outputs that could cause the *`wavefunctioncollapse` library* to consume excessive memory or processing time.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: Medium):** Helps prevent the application from running out of memory or other resources due to excessively large outputs *generated by the library*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS via Large Output:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** Maximum width is limited to 500 in `config.py`.
    *   Maximum height is not limited.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Maximum height limit needs to be added to `config.py`.
    *   The error message should clearly indicate which dimension (width or height) exceeded the limit. *The check must occur before calling the `wavefunctioncollapse` library*.
