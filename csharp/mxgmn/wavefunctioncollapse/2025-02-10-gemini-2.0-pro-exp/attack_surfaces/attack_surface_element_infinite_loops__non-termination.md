# Deep Analysis: Infinite Loops / Non-Termination in Wave Function Collapse

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the "Infinite Loops / Non-Termination" attack surface element within applications leveraging the `wavefunctioncollapse` library.  We aim to understand the root causes, potential exploitation scenarios, and effective mitigation strategies to prevent Denial of Service (DoS) attacks stemming from this vulnerability.  This analysis will provide actionable recommendations for developers to enhance the robustness and security of their applications.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the `wavefunctioncollapse` library (https://github.com/mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse) and its core algorithm.  We will consider:

*   **Input Validation:** How user-provided input (rules, tile sets, constraints) can trigger non-termination.
*   **Algorithm Implementation:**  Potential bugs or logical flaws within the library's code that could lead to infinite loops.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:**  The impact of non-termination on system resources (CPU, memory).
*   **Integration with Applications:** How the library's behavior interacts with the larger application context.  We *won't* analyze the entire application's attack surface, only the parts directly related to the `wavefunctioncollapse` library's non-termination vulnerability.

## 3. Methodology

We will employ a combination of the following techniques:

*   **Code Review:**  Examine the `wavefunctioncollapse` library's source code for potential infinite loop conditions, focusing on iterative processes and constraint satisfaction logic.
*   **Fuzz Testing:**  Develop a fuzzer to generate a wide range of inputs (valid, invalid, edge cases, and intentionally malicious) to test the library's resilience to non-termination.  This will include:
    *   **Invalid Rule Sets:**  Rules that are inherently contradictory.
    *   **Edge Case Tile Sets:**  Minimal or overly complex tile sets.
    *   **Large Input Sizes:**  Testing with very large output dimensions.
*   **Static Analysis:**  Utilize static analysis tools (if applicable to the library's language, likely Rust or a similar systems language) to identify potential infinite loops or unreachable code.
*   **Dynamic Analysis:**  Run the library with various inputs under a debugger to observe its behavior and identify points where it might get stuck.
*   **Literature Review:**  Research existing literature on constraint satisfaction problems and common pitfalls that can lead to non-termination.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 4.1. Root Causes

The primary root causes of infinite loops or non-termination in the `wavefunctioncollapse` algorithm are:

*   **Contradictory Constraints:**  The most significant cause.  If the input rules and tile set define a scenario where no valid solution exists, the algorithm may endlessly attempt to find a solution that is impossible.  This can manifest in several ways:
    *   **Direct Contradictions:**  Rules that explicitly forbid a combination of tiles that are required by other rules.
    *   **Indirect Contradictions:**  A chain of rules that, when combined, lead to an impossible configuration.
    *   **Missing Rules:**  Insufficient rules to define all possible valid tile adjacencies, leading to ambiguity and potential looping.
*   **Implementation Bugs:**  Errors in the library's code, such as:
    *   **Incorrect Loop Conditions:**  A `while` or `for` loop that never reaches its termination condition due to a logical error.
    *   **Off-by-One Errors:**  Errors in indexing or boundary checks that can lead to infinite recursion or iteration.
    *   **Unintended State Transitions:**  The algorithm transitioning into an unexpected state from which it cannot recover.
*   **Stagnation:**  The algorithm may not be in a *true* infinite loop, but it may reach a state where it makes no meaningful progress.  It might repeatedly try the same combinations of tiles without finding a solution or making any changes to the output.  This is effectively non-termination from the user's perspective.

### 4.2. Exploitation Scenarios

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by:

*   **Crafting Malicious Input:**  The attacker provides a carefully designed rule set or tile set that is guaranteed to cause non-termination.  This could be done through a web form, API call, or any other input mechanism the application uses to interact with the `wavefunctioncollapse` library.
*   **Resource Exhaustion Attack:**  The attacker repeatedly sends requests with malicious input, causing the server to consume excessive CPU and memory, eventually leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.
*   **Timing Attacks (Less Likely):**  While less direct, an attacker *might* be able to glean information about the system by observing the time it takes for the server to respond (or fail to respond) to different inputs.  This is less likely to be a practical attack vector compared to DoS.

### 4.3. Detailed Mitigation Strategies

The following mitigation strategies are crucial, building upon the initial suggestions:

*   **1. Robust Input Validation and Preprocessing (Highest Priority):**
    *   **Constraint Consistency Checker:**  Before even starting the WFC algorithm, implement a separate module that analyzes the rule set for contradictions.  This is *the most important mitigation*.  This checker should:
        *   **Identify Direct Contradictions:**  Look for rules that directly conflict with each other.
        *   **Infer Indirect Contradictions:**  Use graph algorithms or constraint propagation techniques to detect contradictions that arise from the combination of multiple rules.  This is a complex but essential step.
        *   **Ensure Rule Completeness:**  Check if the rules cover all possible tile adjacencies.  If not, either reject the input or provide default rules (with a warning to the user).
        *   **Reject Invalid Input:**  If contradictions are found, *immediately* reject the input and return an error to the user, *before* any WFC processing begins.  Do not attempt to "fix" the input automatically.
    *   **Tile Set Validation:**  Ensure the tile set itself is valid (e.g., no duplicate tiles, consistent dimensions).
    *   **Input Sanitization:**  Remove any unnecessary or potentially harmful characters from the input.

*   **2. Maximum Iteration Limits:**
    *   **Hard Limit:**  Implement a non-negotiable, hard-coded limit on the maximum number of iterations the algorithm can perform.  This limit should be chosen based on the expected complexity of the problem and the available resources.
    *   **Configurable Limit (with a Safe Default):**  Allow the application developer to configure the iteration limit, but provide a safe default value that prevents excessive resource consumption.
    *   **Error Handling:**  When the iteration limit is reached, terminate the algorithm gracefully and return an error indicating that a solution could not be found within the allowed iterations.

*   **3. Stagnation Detection:**
    *   **Progress Monitoring:**  Track the algorithm's progress by measuring the number of uncollapsed cells or the entropy of the output.
    *   **Stagnation Threshold:**  Define a threshold for the change in progress over a certain number of iterations.  If the change falls below this threshold, consider the algorithm to be stagnated.
    *   **Early Termination:**  If stagnation is detected, terminate the algorithm and return an error (or a partial solution, if appropriate).

*   **4. Timeouts:**
    *   **Overall Timeout:**  Implement a timeout for the entire WFC process.  This prevents the application from hanging indefinitely, even if the iteration limit is not reached.
    *   **Per-Request Timeout (for Web Applications):**  If the WFC library is used in a web application, set a reasonable timeout for each request to prevent the server from becoming unresponsive.

*   **5. Code Hardening:**
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Conduct thorough code reviews of the `wavefunctioncollapse` library, focusing on loop conditions and potential infinite recursion.
    *   **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools to identify potential bugs and vulnerabilities.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:**  Regularly fuzz test the library with a wide range of inputs.
    *   **Unit Tests:**  Write comprehensive unit tests to cover all possible code paths and edge cases.

*   **6. Resource Limiting (System Level):**
    *   **Process Isolation:**  Run the WFC algorithm in a separate process or container to limit its resource consumption.
    *   **Resource Quotas:**  Use operating system features (e.g., cgroups on Linux) to limit the CPU and memory that the WFC process can use.

*   **7. Monitoring and Alerting:**
    *   **Monitor Resource Usage:**  Monitor the CPU and memory usage of the WFC process.
    *   **Alerting:**  Set up alerts to notify administrators if the resource usage exceeds predefined thresholds.

*   **8. Consider Alternative Algorithms (If Feasible):**
     * If performance and non-termination are persistent issues, explore alternative algorithms for generating similar outputs that might be less prone to these problems. This is a more drastic measure, but worth considering if the risks are too high.

### 4.4. Specific Code Examples (Illustrative - Language Agnostic)

While the specific implementation will depend on the programming language used, here are some illustrative examples of mitigation techniques:

**Constraint Consistency Checker (Pseudocode):**

```
function check_consistency(rules):
  // 1. Build Adjacency Graph:
  adjacency_graph = build_graph(rules)

  // 2. Check for Direct Contradictions:
  for each rule in rules:
    if rule directly contradicts another rule:
      return "Contradiction Found"

  // 3. Check for Indirect Contradictions (using graph traversal):
  for each tile in adjacency_graph:
    if depth_first_search(adjacency_graph, tile) finds a contradiction:
      return "Contradiction Found"

  // 4. Check for Rule Completeness:
  if not all_adjacencies_covered(adjacency_graph):
      return "Incomplete Ruleset"

  return "Consistent"

function depth_first_search(graph, start_tile):
    // ... (Implementation of DFS to detect cycles or contradictions) ...
```

**Maximum Iteration Limit (Rust-like):**

```rust
const MAX_ITERATIONS: usize = 10000;

fn run_wfc(rules: &Rules, tile_set: &TileSet) -> Result<Output, Error> {
    let mut iteration_count = 0;
    let mut output = initialize_output();

    while !output.is_collapsed() && iteration_count < MAX_ITERATIONS {
        // ... (WFC algorithm logic) ...
        iteration_count += 1;
    }

    if iteration_count == MAX_ITERATIONS {
        Err(Error::MaxIterationsReached)
    } else {
        Ok(output)
    }
}
```

**Stagnation Detection (Python-like):**

```python
STAGNATION_THRESHOLD = 0.01
STAGNATION_WINDOW = 100

def run_wfc(rules, tile_set):
    iteration_count = 0
    output = initialize_output()
    recent_entropy = []

    while not output.is_collapsed():
        # ... (WFC algorithm logic) ...
        iteration_count += 1
        recent_entropy.append(output.calculate_entropy())

        if len(recent_entropy) > STAGNATION_WINDOW:
            recent_entropy.pop(0)  # Remove oldest entropy value
            entropy_change = abs(recent_entropy[-1] - recent_entropy[0])
            if entropy_change < STAGNATION_THRESHOLD:
                return "Stagnated"

    return output
```

## 5. Conclusion

The "Infinite Loops / Non-Termination" attack surface is a serious vulnerability for applications using the `wavefunctioncollapse` library.  By implementing a combination of robust input validation, iteration limits, stagnation detection, timeouts, and code hardening techniques, developers can significantly reduce the risk of DoS attacks and ensure the stability and reliability of their applications.  The most critical mitigation is the **proactive detection of contradictory constraints** in the input rule set *before* the WFC algorithm begins.  Continuous monitoring and regular security audits are also essential to maintain a strong security posture.
