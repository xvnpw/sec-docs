# Deep Analysis of Wave Function Collapse (mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse) Attack Surface

## 1. Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to identify, categorize, and prioritize potential security vulnerabilities associated with the integration and use of the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library within our application.  We aim to understand how an attacker might exploit weaknesses in the library itself, or in our *use* of the library, to compromise the application's security.  This includes, but is not limited to, achieving:

*   **Confidentiality breaches:**  Unauthorized access to data processed or generated by the library.
*   **Integrity violations:**  Modification of data, rules, or the library's behavior itself.
*   **Availability disruptions:**  Denial-of-service attacks targeting the library or the application components that rely on it.
*   **Authentication/Authorization bypass:** Using the library to circumvent security controls.

Ultimately, this analysis will inform mitigation strategies and secure coding practices to minimize the risk associated with using this library.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library (https://github.com/mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse) and its interaction with our application.  The scope includes:

*   **The library's source code:**  Examining the Go code for vulnerabilities.
*   **Input validation and sanitization:**  How the library handles user-provided or externally-sourced data (e.g., tile sets, rules, constraints).
*   **Resource management:**  How the library handles memory, CPU, and other system resources.
*   **Error handling:**  How the library responds to unexpected conditions and errors.
*   **Dependencies:**  Analyzing the security posture of any libraries that `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` depends on.  (This is a crucial, often overlooked aspect).
*   **Our application's integration:** How *our* code interacts with the library, including the data we feed it and how we handle its output.  This is where many vulnerabilities arise, even if the library itself is well-written.

The scope *excludes* general application security concerns unrelated to the library (e.g., database security, network infrastructure), except where those concerns directly intersect with the library's functionality.

## 3. Methodology

We will employ a combination of the following techniques:

*   **Static Code Analysis (SAST):**  Using automated tools (e.g., `gosec`, `staticcheck`, potentially custom linters) to scan the library's source code for common vulnerabilities, coding errors, and security best practice violations.  We will also manually review the code, focusing on areas identified by SAST and areas deemed high-risk based on the library's functionality.
*   **Dependency Analysis:**  Identifying and assessing the security of the library's dependencies using tools like `go list -m all` and vulnerability databases (e.g., OSV, Snyk, GitHub Security Advisories).  We will prioritize dependencies with known vulnerabilities or a history of security issues.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing):**  Using fuzzing techniques to provide the library with a wide range of unexpected, malformed, or boundary-case inputs.  This will help identify potential crashes, memory leaks, or unexpected behavior that could be exploited.  We will focus on input vectors related to:
    *   Tile set definitions (image formats, metadata).
    *   Rule configurations (invalid rules, contradictory rules).
    *   Constraint specifications (unrealistic or impossible constraints).
    *   Output size and complexity parameters.
*   **Manual Code Review:**  A thorough, line-by-line examination of the library's code, focusing on areas identified as high-risk by the other techniques.  This will include looking for logic errors, race conditions, and potential side-channel vulnerabilities.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Developing threat models to understand how an attacker might attempt to exploit the library in the context of our application.  This will help us prioritize vulnerabilities and develop appropriate mitigations.
* **Review of Issues and Pull Requests:** Examining the project's GitHub issues and pull requests for any reported security vulnerabilities or discussions related to security concerns.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

Based on the "Key Attack Surface" provided, and the nature of the Wave Function Collapse algorithm, here's a breakdown of potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities:

**4.1. Input Validation and Sanitization (Critical)**

*   **Malformed Tile Sets (High):**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  The library likely relies on image parsing libraries (potentially external dependencies) to process tile sets.  Malformed image files (e.g., crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in image decoders) could lead to buffer overflows, arbitrary code execution, or denial-of-service.  This is a *classic* attack vector for image processing libraries.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Use a well-vetted, up-to-date image parsing library.  Implement strict input validation on image dimensions, color depths, and file formats.  Consider using a separate, sandboxed process for image processing to limit the impact of any exploits.  Fuzz the image parsing component extensively.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a specially crafted PNG file that triggers a buffer overflow in the underlying image library, allowing them to execute arbitrary code.

*   **Invalid Rule Configurations (High):**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  The library accepts rules that define how tiles can be placed next to each other.  An attacker could provide invalid, contradictory, or excessively complex rules that lead to:
        *   Infinite loops or excessive recursion, causing a denial-of-service.
        *   Memory exhaustion due to the algorithm exploring a vast, invalid state space.
        *   Logic errors that could potentially be exploited to influence the output in unexpected ways.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Implement strict validation of rule configurations.  Check for contradictions and inconsistencies.  Limit the complexity of rules (e.g., maximum number of conditions, maximum recursion depth).  Implement timeouts and resource limits to prevent infinite loops or excessive resource consumption.  Fuzz the rule parsing and validation logic.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a rule set that creates a circular dependency, causing the algorithm to loop indefinitely.

*   **Unbounded Constraint Specifications (High):**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Constraints (e.g., "at least 50% of the output must be water tiles") can be abused.  Unrealistic or impossible constraints could lead to similar issues as invalid rules: infinite loops, excessive resource consumption, or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Validate constraint specifications to ensure they are realistic and achievable.  Implement limits on the complexity and number of constraints.  Implement timeouts and resource limits.
    *   **Example:** An attacker specifies a constraint that is mathematically impossible to satisfy, causing the algorithm to run indefinitely without producing a valid output.

**4.2. Resource Management (High)**

*   **Memory Exhaustion (High):**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  The Wave Function Collapse algorithm can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive, especially for large output sizes or complex rule sets.  An attacker could provide inputs designed to maximize memory usage, leading to a denial-of-service.  This is particularly concerning if the library doesn't handle memory allocation failures gracefully.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Implement strict limits on the maximum output size and complexity.  Monitor memory usage and implement graceful degradation or error handling if limits are exceeded.  Use memory profiling tools to identify potential memory leaks.  Consider using a memory-safe language or memory management techniques (if feasible).
    *   **Example:** An attacker requests a very large output grid with a complex rule set, causing the application to run out of memory and crash.

*   **CPU Exhaustion (High):**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Similar to memory exhaustion, an attacker could provide inputs that maximize CPU usage, leading to a denial-of-service.  This could be achieved through complex rules, large output sizes, or by exploiting algorithmic inefficiencies.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Implement timeouts and resource limits on the algorithm's execution.  Profile the code to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize critical sections.  Consider using techniques like memoization or caching to reduce redundant computations.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a rule set that requires extensive backtracking, causing the algorithm to consume excessive CPU time.

**4.3. Error Handling (Medium)**

*   **Information Leakage (Medium):**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Poorly handled errors could reveal information about the internal state of the library or the application, potentially aiding an attacker in crafting further exploits.  This includes verbose error messages, stack traces, or timing differences that leak information.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Implement robust error handling that avoids revealing sensitive information.  Use generic error messages in production environments.  Log detailed error information securely for debugging purposes.
    *   **Example:** An error message reveals the path to a sensitive configuration file.

*   **Unhandled Exceptions (Medium):**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Unhandled exceptions could lead to crashes or unpredictable behavior, potentially creating opportunities for exploitation.
    *   **Mitigation:** Ensure that all potential exceptions are handled gracefully.  Use `try-catch` blocks (or equivalent constructs in Go) to catch and handle errors appropriately.
    *   **Example:** An unhandled exception during image processing causes the application to crash, leaving it in an unstable state.

**4.4. Dependencies (High)**

*   **Vulnerable Dependencies (High):**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  The `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library may depend on other libraries, which themselves may have known vulnerabilities.  This is a common source of security issues.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Regularly audit the library's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.  Use dependency management tools to track and update dependencies.  Consider vendoring dependencies to control the specific versions used.  Prioritize using well-maintained libraries with a strong security track record.
    *   **Example:** The library uses an outdated version of an image processing library with a known remote code execution vulnerability.

**4.5. Integration with Our Application (Critical)**

*   **Data Exposure (High):**
    *   **Vulnerability:** How *our* application uses the output of the library is crucial.  If the generated output is used in a security-sensitive context (e.g., generating passwords, cryptographic keys, or access control rules), vulnerabilities in the library could have severe consequences.  Even seemingly innocuous uses (e.g., generating game levels) could be exploited if the output influences other parts of the application.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Carefully consider the security implications of how the library's output is used.  Treat the output as potentially untrusted data and validate it accordingly.  Avoid using the library for security-critical tasks unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.  Implement strong separation of concerns between the library's output and security-sensitive components.
    *   **Example:** Our application uses the library to generate map layouts, and an attacker crafts an input that results in a map with a hidden, exploitable area.

*   **Side-Channel Attacks (Medium):**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Even if the library itself is secure, the *way* it's used could leak information through side channels (e.g., timing, power consumption).  This is a more advanced attack vector, but it's worth considering, especially for high-security applications.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Be aware of potential side-channel vulnerabilities.  Consider using constant-time algorithms where appropriate.  Monitor the application's performance and resource usage for anomalies.
    *   **Example:** An attacker observes subtle timing differences in the library's execution to infer information about the rule set being used.

2.  **Implement Security Testing:** Integrate the SAST, fuzzing, and dependency analysis tools into our CI/CD pipeline to continuously monitor the library's security posture.
3.  **Regularly Review and Update:**  Revisit this analysis periodically, especially when the library is updated or when our application's integration with the library changes.
4.  **Contribute Back (If Possible):** If we discover vulnerabilities in the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library, consider responsibly disclosing them to the maintainer or contributing patches to fix them. This benefits the entire community.
5. **Document Security Considerations:** Clearly document any security assumptions, limitations, and best practices related to the use of the library within our application.
