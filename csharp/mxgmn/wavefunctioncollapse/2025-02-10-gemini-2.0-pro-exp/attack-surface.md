## Attack Surface: [Key Attack Surface: Wave Function Collapse (mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse) - High & Critical Risks](./attack_surfaces/key_attack_surface_wave_function_collapse__mxgmnwavefunctioncollapse__-_high_&_critical_risks.md)

This list focuses on the most serious attack vectors directly related to the library's functionality.

## Attack Surface: [Attack Surface Element: Malicious Input Patterns](./attack_surfaces/attack_surface_element_malicious_input_patterns.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft specific input images, tile sets, or rule sets to trigger unexpected behavior, resource exhaustion, or exploit vulnerabilities within the `wavefunctioncollapse` algorithm itself.
    *   **Wavefunctioncollapse Contribution:** The library's core function is to process these inputs.  The algorithm's complexity and reliance on user-defined data create this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a tile set with inconsistent dimensions, a rule set with contradictory rules, or an image designed to trigger edge-case behavior in the constraint solver.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application crashes, potentially exploitable unexpected behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Enforce rigorous checks on all input data: image dimensions, color palettes, tile consistency (dimensions, data types), and rule set validity (well-formedness, no contradictions).
        *   **Input Fuzzing:** Use fuzzing tools to test the library with a wide range of malformed and unexpected inputs to identify vulnerabilities.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Consider processing untrusted inputs in an isolated environment (separate process or container) to limit the impact of exploits.

## Attack Surface: [Attack Surface Element: Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service)](./attack_surfaces/attack_surface_element_resource_exhaustion__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers provide inputs designed to consume excessive CPU, memory, or processing time, causing a denial-of-service.
    *   **Wavefunctioncollapse Contribution:** The algorithm's computational complexity can be high, especially with complex inputs and rule sets. Large output dimensions directly impact memory usage.
    *   **Example:** An attacker requests an extremely large output image (e.g., 100,000 x 100,000 pixels) or provides a rule set that causes extensive backtracking and long processing times.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, system instability, potential for complete system crash.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Output Size Limits:** Enforce strict, hard-coded limits on the maximum output dimensions (width, height, and depth for 3D).
        *   **Timeouts:** Implement strict timeouts for the generation process. Terminate if a solution isn't found within a reasonable time.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:** Continuously monitor CPU and memory usage during generation. Terminate the process if usage exceeds predefined thresholds.
        *   **Progressive Generation (if applicable):** Generate output in chunks to avoid allocating the entire output buffer at once.
        *   **Complexity Analysis (Advanced):** Analyze input complexity *before* processing to reject inputs predicted to be too computationally expensive.

## Attack Surface: [Attack Surface Element: Infinite Loops / Non-Termination](./attack_surfaces/attack_surface_element_infinite_loops__non-termination.md)

*   **Description:** The `wavefunctioncollapse` algorithm gets stuck in an infinite loop or fails to terminate due to contradictory rules or internal logic errors.
    *   **Wavefunctioncollapse Contribution:** The core of the library is a constraint satisfaction algorithm. Poorly defined constraints or bugs in the implementation can lead directly to non-termination.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a rule set where no valid solution is possible, or a combination of tiles and rules that create an unsolvable constraint.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application hangs indefinitely.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Maximum Iteration Limits:** Implement a hard limit on the number of iterations the algorithm can perform.
        *   **Contradiction Detection:** Implement robust checks for contradictions in the rule set *before* starting the generation process. This is crucial.
        *   **Stagnation Detection:** Monitor the algorithm's progress. If the output is not changing significantly over a period, it may be stuck.

## Attack Surface: [Attack Surface Element: Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/attack_surface_element_code_injection.md)

* **Description:** Attacker is able to inject and execute arbitrary code through crafted input.
    * **Wavefunctioncollapse Contribution:** Highly unlikely, but *if* the library has a vulnerability that allows interpreting parts of the input (e.g., the rule set) as executable code, this would be a direct and critical vulnerability.
    * **Example:** The library has a hidden, undocumented feature or a severe bug that allows executing code embedded within a specially crafted rule set (extremely unlikely, but the impact necessitates inclusion).
    * **Impact:** Complete system compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **No Dynamic Code Execution:** Ensure the library *never* executes arbitrary code based on user-provided input. The rule sets and other inputs should be treated strictly as data, *never* as executable code.
        *   **Rigorous Input Validation:** This is the primary defense. Even seemingly harmless data should be thoroughly validated to prevent any unexpected interpretation.
