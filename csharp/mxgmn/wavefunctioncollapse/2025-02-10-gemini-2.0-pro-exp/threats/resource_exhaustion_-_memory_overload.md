# Deep Analysis: Resource Exhaustion - Memory Overload (wavefunctioncollapse)

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Resource Exhaustion - Memory Overload" threat, identify specific vulnerabilities within the `wavefunctioncollapse` library and its integration into the application, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the initial high-level suggestions.  We aim to provide developers with a clear understanding of *how* and *why* this threat manifests, and *what* specific code changes or configurations are necessary to prevent it.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses on the following:

*   **The `wavefunctioncollapse` library itself:**  We'll examine the core algorithm's memory usage patterns, focusing on the `collapse` function and related data structures.  We'll consider different implementations and configurations of the library.
*   **Application-specific integration:** How the application uses the library, including input validation, output handling, and error management, will be scrutinized.  We'll assume the application uses the library to generate 2D or 3D grids.
*   **Attacker-controlled inputs:** We'll analyze how malicious or excessively large inputs can trigger memory exhaustion.  This includes output dimensions, constraint complexity, and input sample characteristics.
*   **Exclusion:** We will *not* focus on general system-level memory management or OS-level protections.  We assume the underlying operating system and hardware are reasonably configured.  We also won't delve into network-level DoS attacks unrelated to the library's memory usage.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Code Review:**  A detailed examination of the `wavefunctioncollapse` library's source code (specifically the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` repository on GitHub) to identify potential memory allocation hotspots and inefficiencies.
2.  **Static Analysis:**  Using static analysis tools (if applicable and available for the language the library is written in â€“ likely Rust or Python based on common usage) to detect potential memory leaks or unbounded allocations.
3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Profiling):**  Running the library with various inputs, including both benign and potentially malicious ones, while monitoring memory usage with profiling tools (e.g., `valgrind` for C/C++, memory profilers for Python, or built-in profiling tools for Rust).  This will help pinpoint specific code sections causing excessive memory consumption.
4.  **Fuzz Testing:**  Employing fuzzing techniques to automatically generate a wide range of inputs, including edge cases and invalid data, to test the library's robustness and identify inputs that trigger memory exhaustion.
5.  **Threat Modeling Refinement:**  Iteratively refining the initial threat model based on the findings from the code review, static/dynamic analysis, and fuzz testing.
6.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Based on the identified vulnerabilities, we will develop specific, actionable mitigation strategies, including code examples and configuration recommendations.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1. Potential Vulnerability Points in `wavefunctioncollapse`

Based on the algorithm's nature and the library's likely implementation, the following are key areas of concern:

*   **Output Grid Representation:** The primary data structure holding the output grid (the final generated image or 3D model) is a major memory consumer.  The memory required scales directly with the output dimensions (width * height * depth, potentially with additional factors for color channels or other data per cell).  A naive implementation might use a dense array, even if the output is sparse.
    *   **Example (Python):**  `output_grid = [[[0 for _ in range(depth)] for _ in range(height)] for _ in range(width)]`  This creates a nested list, which can be inefficient for large dimensions.
    *   **Example (Rust):** A `Vec<Vec<Vec<T>>>` would have similar issues.

*   **Wave Function Representation:**  The wave function, which tracks the possibilities for each cell in the output grid, can also consume significant memory.  This is especially true if the number of possible states (patterns or tiles) is large, or if the algorithm uses a dense representation to store probabilities for each state at each cell.
    *   **Example:** If there are 100 possible patterns and a 100x100 output grid, a naive wave function might store 100 probabilities for each of the 10,000 cells, leading to 1,000,000 floating-point values.

*   **Constraint Propagation:**  The process of propagating constraints (rules that limit which patterns can be adjacent to each other) can involve creating and manipulating large data structures to track valid combinations and update probabilities.  Inefficient constraint propagation algorithms can lead to temporary memory spikes.

*   **Backtracking/Retries:**  If the algorithm encounters a contradiction (no valid patterns remain for a cell), it may need to backtrack and retry with different choices.  Poorly managed backtracking can lead to excessive memory usage if intermediate states are not properly cleaned up.

*   **Input Sample Processing:**  The initial input sample (if used) is analyzed to determine the allowed patterns and their adjacency rules.  A very large or complex input sample could lead to a large number of patterns and complex constraints, indirectly increasing memory usage during the generation process.

### 2.2. Attacker-Controlled Input Exploitation

An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities by crafting specific inputs:

*   **Excessive Output Dimensions:**  The most direct attack is to request an extremely large output grid (e.g., width = 10000, height = 10000, depth = 1000).  This forces the allocation of a massive output grid and wave function.
*   **Complex Constraints:**  By providing a highly complex set of constraints or a large input sample with many intricate patterns, the attacker can increase the number of possible states and the complexity of the constraint propagation, leading to higher memory usage.
*   **Contradictory Constraints:**  Intentionally providing contradictory constraints can force the algorithm into extensive backtracking and retries, potentially leading to memory exhaustion if intermediate states are not managed efficiently.
*   **Large Input Sample with Many Unique Patterns:** A large input sample with a vast number of unique, small patterns can lead to a combinatorial explosion in the number of possible states, significantly increasing the memory required for the wave function.

### 2.3. Refined Mitigation Strategies

Building upon the initial mitigation strategies, we propose the following more specific and actionable steps:

1.  **Strict Output Size Limits (with User Feedback):**
    *   **Implementation:**  Implement hard limits on the output dimensions (width, height, depth) *before* any memory allocation occurs.  These limits should be configurable but have secure defaults.  Reject any requests exceeding these limits with a clear error message to the user (e.g., "Requested output size exceeds the maximum allowed dimensions.").
    *   **Example (Python):**
        ```python
        MAX_WIDTH = 512
        MAX_HEIGHT = 512
        MAX_DEPTH = 64  # Or 1 for 2D

        def generate_output(width, height, depth, ...):
            if width > MAX_WIDTH or height > MAX_HEIGHT or depth > MAX_DEPTH:
                raise ValueError("Requested output size exceeds maximum limits.")
            # ... rest of the generation logic ...
        ```
    *   **Rationale:** This prevents the most obvious attack vector.  The limits should be chosen based on the application's expected use cases and the available system resources.

2.  **Memory Monitoring and Circuit Breaker:**
    *   **Implementation:**  Integrate memory monitoring into the `collapse` function.  Periodically check the application's memory usage (e.g., using `psutil` in Python, `sysinfo` in Rust, or OS-specific APIs).  If memory usage exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 80% of available RAM), terminate the generation process gracefully.
    *   **Example (Python - using `psutil`):**
        ```python
        import psutil
        import os
        import signal

        MEMORY_LIMIT_PERCENTAGE = 80

        def check_memory_usage():
            process = psutil.Process(os.getpid())
            memory_percent = process.memory_percent()
            if memory_percent > MEMORY_LIMIT_PERCENTAGE:
                print(f"Memory usage exceeded limit ({memory_percent:.2f}%). Terminating.")
                os.kill(os.getpid(), signal.SIGTERM)  # Or raise a custom exception

        def generate_output(...):
            # ... inside the main loop of the collapse function ...
            check_memory_usage()
            # ...
        ```
    *   **Rationale:** This acts as a safety net, preventing the application from crashing due to memory exhaustion even if the attacker finds a way to bypass the size limits or trigger unexpected memory usage.

3.  **Sparse Data Structures (where applicable):**
    *   **Implementation:**  If the output is expected to be sparse (many cells with the same value or "empty" cells), consider using sparse matrix representations instead of dense arrays.  Libraries like `scipy.sparse` (Python) or `nalgebra` (Rust) provide efficient sparse matrix implementations.
    *   **Example (Python - using `scipy.sparse`):**
        ```python
        from scipy.sparse import lil_matrix  # Or other sparse matrix types

        # Instead of: output_grid = [[[0 for _ in range(depth)] for _ in range(height)] for _ in range(width)]
        output_grid = lil_matrix((width, height * depth)) # Adjust for 3D
        ```
    *   **Rationale:**  Sparse matrices only store non-zero (or non-default) values, significantly reducing memory usage when the output contains many repeated values.  This is particularly relevant for WFC applications generating large, mostly empty environments.

4.  **Input Sample Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Implementation:**  If the application uses input samples, implement checks to limit the size and complexity of the input.  This might involve:
        *   Limiting the dimensions of the input sample.
        *   Limiting the number of unique patterns in the input sample.
        *   Rejecting input samples that are clearly designed to cause excessive computation (e.g., samples with extremely high entropy or very intricate patterns).
    *   **Rationale:**  This prevents attackers from indirectly causing memory exhaustion by providing malicious input samples.

5.  **Profiling and Optimization:**
    *   **Implementation:**  Use profiling tools (as described in the Methodology) to identify specific code sections within the `wavefunctioncollapse` library and the application's integration that consume the most memory.  Focus optimization efforts on these areas.  This might involve:
        *   Using more efficient data structures.
        *   Optimizing algorithms (e.g., constraint propagation).
        *   Reducing unnecessary memory allocations and copies.
        *   Implementing lazy evaluation or generators where appropriate.
    *   **Rationale:**  Profiling provides concrete data to guide optimization efforts, ensuring that development time is spent on the most impactful changes.

6.  **Consider Resource Limits (ulimit, cgroups):**
    * **Implementation:** At the system level, consider using tools like `ulimit` (Linux) or control groups (cgroups) to limit the maximum memory a process can use. This provides an additional layer of defense, even if the application-level mitigations fail.
    * **Rationale:** System-level limits provide a final backstop, preventing a single runaway process from consuming all available system memory and affecting other applications.

7. **Regular Security Audits and Updates:**
    * **Implementation:** Regularly review the codebase for potential memory-related vulnerabilities. Stay updated with the latest version of the `wavefunctioncollapse` library, as it may include bug fixes and performance improvements that address memory issues.
    * **Rationale:** Continuous vigilance is crucial for maintaining security.
