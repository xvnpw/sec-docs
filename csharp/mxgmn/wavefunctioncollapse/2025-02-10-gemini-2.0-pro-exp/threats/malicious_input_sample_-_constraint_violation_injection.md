# Deep Analysis: Malicious Input Sample - Constraint Violation Injection

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the "Malicious Input Sample - Constraint Violation Injection" threat against the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) application (using the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library).  We aim to:

*   Understand the precise mechanisms by which this attack can be executed.
*   Identify the specific vulnerabilities within the code that enable the attack.
*   Assess the potential impact on the application and its users.
*   Refine and prioritize the proposed mitigation strategies.
*   Propose concrete implementation steps for the mitigations.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the threat of constraint violation injection.  It encompasses:

*   **Input Sources:**  All potential sources of input that define constraints, including:
    *   Input images (for adjacency rules).
    *   Configuration files (e.g., XML, JSON, YAML) specifying explicit rules or parameters.
    *   User interface inputs (if the application provides a UI for configuring WFC).
    *   API calls (if the application exposes an API).
*   **Affected Code:**  The analysis will primarily target the following components within the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library (and any related application-specific code):
    *   `adjacency_extraction`:  The module responsible for extracting adjacency rules from input samples.  This is a *critical* area.
    *   `constraints` (if a separate module exists): Any module explicitly handling constraint definitions.
    *   `core.py` (specifically the `collapse` function and related functions): The core WFC algorithm implementation.
    *   Any input parsing and validation routines.
*   **Impact Analysis:**  We will consider the impact on:
    *   **Application Availability:**  Denial-of-Service (DoS) due to infinite loops or resource exhaustion.
    *   **Application Integrity:**  Generation of corrupted or nonsensical output.
    *   **System Resources:**  Excessive CPU and memory usage.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review:**  A thorough examination of the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` codebase, focusing on the components identified in the Scope.  We will look for:
    *   Missing or inadequate input validation.
    *   Lack of error handling for constraint violations.
    *   Potential infinite loop conditions.
    *   Absence of timeouts or resource limits.
2.  **Static Analysis:** Use of static analysis tools (e.g., pylint, bandit, SonarQube) to identify potential vulnerabilities related to input handling and error management.
3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing):**  Development of a fuzzer to generate a wide range of malformed and edge-case input samples.  This will help us:
    *   Trigger potential constraint violations.
    *   Observe the application's behavior under stress.
    *   Identify specific input patterns that lead to failures.
4.  **Constraint Logic Analysis:**  Formal analysis of the constraint logic to identify potential contradictions and inconsistencies that could be exploited.  This may involve:
    *   Manual reasoning about the relationships between adjacency rules.
    *   Potentially using a constraint solver (e.g., Z3) to automate the detection of unsatisfiable constraints.
5.  **Mitigation Implementation and Testing:**  Based on the findings, we will implement the proposed mitigation strategies and rigorously test them to ensure their effectiveness.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1 Attack Vectors

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability through several attack vectors:

*   **Malformed Input Image:**  Providing an input image designed to create contradictory adjacency rules.  For example, an image with carefully placed pixels that imply A must be next to B, B must be next to C, and C must *not* be next to A.
*   **Manipulated Configuration File:**  If the application uses a configuration file (e.g., XML, JSON) to define constraints or parameters, the attacker could modify this file to introduce inconsistencies.  Examples include:
    *   Specifying overlapping tiles with incompatible rotations.
    *   Defining an output size smaller than the input tile size.
    *   Creating circular dependencies in adjacency rules.
*   **API Exploitation:**  If the application exposes an API, the attacker could send crafted API requests with malicious constraint data.
*   **UI Input Tampering:** If a user interface allows for constraint configuration, an attacker could manipulate the UI elements (e.g., using browser developer tools) to bypass client-side validation and submit invalid data.

### 2.2 Vulnerability Analysis (Code Review & Static Analysis)

This section will be filled in after performing the code review and static analysis.  However, we can anticipate potential vulnerabilities:

*   **`adjacency_extraction`:**
    *   **Lack of Rule Conflict Detection:** The code might extract all adjacency rules without checking for logical contradictions.  It might simply create a list of rules without verifying their consistency.
    *   **Insufficient Input Validation:**  The code might not properly handle edge cases in the input image, such as very small images, images with unusual color palettes, or images with ambiguous pixel arrangements.
*   **`core.py` (collapse function):**
    *   **Missing Timeout:** The `collapse` function might not have a mechanism to terminate if it fails to converge within a reasonable time.  This is the *primary* cause of the DoS vulnerability.
    *   **Inadequate Error Handling:**  The code might not gracefully handle situations where no valid tile can be placed at a given location due to constraint violations.  It might get stuck in an infinite loop or crash.
    *   **No Resource Limits:** There might be no limits on memory usage or the number of iterations, allowing the algorithm to consume excessive resources.
* **Input Parsing:**
    * **Missing schema validation:** If configuration is loaded from external file, there might be missing schema validation, allowing attacker to inject arbitrary data.
    * **Trusting user input:** Application might be vulnerable to prototype pollution or similar attacks.

### 2.3 Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing)

We will develop a fuzzer using a library like `Atheris` (for Python) or a custom script.  The fuzzer will generate:

*   **Randomly Corrupted Images:**  Images with random pixel changes, noise, and distortions.
*   **Images with Specific Patterns:**  Images designed to create contradictory adjacency rules (as described in the Attack Vectors section).
*   **Malformed Configuration Files:**  Files with invalid JSON/XML syntax, missing fields, incorrect data types, and contradictory constraint definitions.
*   **Edge-Case Inputs:**  Very small images, very large images, images with a single color, etc.

The fuzzer will run the WFC application with these inputs and monitor:

*   **CPU Usage:**  Detect excessive CPU consumption indicating potential infinite loops.
*   **Memory Usage:**  Detect memory leaks or excessive memory allocation.
*   **Application Output:**  Check for errors, crashes, or the generation of nonsensical output.
*   **Logs:**  Examine application logs for error messages related to constraint violations.

### 2.4 Constraint Logic Analysis

We will analyze the constraint logic to identify potential contradictions.  This involves:

1.  **Manual Rule Analysis:**  For a given set of input tiles, we will manually derive the adjacency rules and look for potential conflicts.
2.  **Automated Constraint Solving (Optional):**  For more complex scenarios, we can use a constraint solver like Z3.  We would:
    *   Represent the adjacency rules as logical constraints.
    *   Use Z3 to check if the set of constraints is satisfiable.
    *   If Z3 reports "unsat," we know there is a contradiction.

### 2.5 Refined Mitigation Strategies and Implementation

Based on the analysis, we refine the mitigation strategies and provide concrete implementation steps:

1.  **Robust Constraint Validation (Pre-processing):**

    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Adjacency Rule Consistency Check:**  *Before* starting the WFC algorithm, analyze the extracted adjacency rules.  Create a graph where nodes are tiles and edges represent allowed adjacencies.  Check for inconsistencies:
            *   **Transitive Closure:** If A can be next to B, and B can be next to C, check if the implied relationship between A and C is also valid.
            *   **Symmetry:** If A can be next to B, B should also be able to be next to A (unless explicitly defined as asymmetric).
            *   **Rotation Compatibility:**  Ensure that rotations of tiles are handled correctly and don't introduce contradictions.
        *   **Configuration File Validation:**  Use a schema validation library (e.g., `jsonschema` for JSON, `lxml` for XML) to enforce a strict schema for configuration files.  The schema should define:
            *   Required fields.
            *   Data types.
            *   Allowed values (e.g., ranges for output dimensions).
            *   Relationships between fields.
        *   **Input Image Validation:**
            *   Check image dimensions (minimum and maximum size).
            *   Check color palette (ensure it's within expected limits).
            *   Potentially use image processing techniques to detect ambiguous or contradictory patterns.
        *   **API Input Validation:**  Implement strict input validation for all API endpoints, using a framework like `FastAPI` or `Flask-RESTful` that provides built-in validation mechanisms.
        * **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all inputs to prevent injection of malicious code or unexpected characters.
    *   **Example (Python - Adjacency Rule Check):**

        ```python
        def check_adjacency_rules(rules):
            """Checks for contradictions in adjacency rules."""
            for tile_a, neighbors_a in rules.items():
                for neighbor_a in neighbors_a:
                    # Symmetry check
                    if tile_a not in rules.get(neighbor_a, []):
                        raise ValueError(f"Asymmetry: {tile_a} -> {neighbor_a}, but not vice versa")

                    # Transitive closure check (simplified example)
                    for neighbor_b in rules.get(neighbor_a, []):
                        if neighbor_b not in neighbors_a and neighbor_b != tile_a:
                            # Check if there's an explicit rule forbidding this connection
                            #  (This part requires more sophisticated logic)
                            pass # Implement more robust transitive closure check

            return True  # No contradictions found

        ```

2.  **Timeout Mechanism:**

    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Wrap the `collapse` function (or the main WFC loop) in a `try...except` block with a timeout.  Use the `signal` module in Python.
        *   Set a reasonable timeout value based on the expected complexity of the generation.
        *   If the timeout is reached, raise an exception and handle it gracefully (e.g., log an error, return an error code, or display an error message to the user).
    *   **Example (Python):**

        ```python
        import signal
        import time

        def timeout_handler(signum, frame):
            raise TimeoutError("WFC algorithm timed out")

        def run_wfc_with_timeout(input_data, timeout_seconds):
            signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, timeout_handler)
            signal.alarm(timeout_seconds)  # Set the alarm

            try:
                result = collapse(input_data)  # Assuming 'collapse' is your WFC function
                return result
            except TimeoutError:
                print("Error: WFC algorithm timed out due to constraint violation or complexity.")
                return None  # Or raise a custom exception
            finally:
                signal.alarm(0)  # Disable the alarm

        ```

3.  **Clear Error Messages:**

    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Whenever a constraint violation is detected (during validation or during the WFC process), raise a custom exception with a descriptive error message.
        *   The error message should clearly indicate:
            *   The type of constraint violation (e.g., "Contradictory adjacency rules," "Invalid output size").
            *   The specific rules or parameters involved (e.g., "Tile A cannot be adjacent to Tile B").
            *   The location of the error (if applicable, e.g., line number in a configuration file).
        *   Log these error messages to a file or console for debugging purposes.
        *   If the application has a user interface, display a user-friendly version of the error message.
    *   **Example (Python):**

        ```python
        class ConstraintViolationError(Exception):
            pass

        # ... inside your validation code ...
        if not check_adjacency_rules(rules):
            raise ConstraintViolationError("Contradictory adjacency rules detected.  Check your input image or configuration.")

        ```

4. **Resource Limits (Optional but Recommended):**

    * **Implementation:**
        * Consider using libraries or techniques to limit the memory and CPU usage of the WFC process. This can prevent a single malicious input from consuming all system resources.
        * For memory limits, you might explore using resource limits in Python (`resource` module) or running the WFC process in a separate container with limited resources (e.g., using Docker).

### 2.6 Testing

After implementing the mitigations, we will perform thorough testing:

*   **Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests for the validation functions to ensure they correctly identify various types of constraint violations.
*   **Integration Tests:**  Test the entire WFC pipeline with a range of valid and invalid inputs to verify that the mitigations work as expected.
*   **Fuzzing (Continued):**  Continue running the fuzzer to ensure that the implemented mitigations are robust against a wide variety of malformed inputs.
*   **Regression Tests:**  Ensure that the changes don't introduce any regressions in the application's functionality.

## 3. Conclusion

The "Malicious Input Sample - Constraint Violation Injection" threat poses a significant risk to the availability and integrity of the WFC application. By implementing robust constraint validation, a timeout mechanism, and clear error handling, we can effectively mitigate this threat and ensure the application's stability and reliability. The combination of code review, static analysis, fuzzing, and constraint logic analysis provides a comprehensive approach to identifying and addressing vulnerabilities.  Continuous testing is crucial to maintain the security of the application over time.
