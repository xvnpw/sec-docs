# Deep Analysis: Resource Exhaustion - CPU Overload (Non-Convergence)

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the mechanisms by which the "Resource Exhaustion - CPU Overload (Non-Convergence)" threat can manifest in applications using the `wavefunctioncollapse` library.
*   Identify specific code vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors.
*   Refine and prioritize the proposed mitigation strategies, providing concrete implementation guidance.
*   Develop testing strategies to validate the effectiveness of the mitigations.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the `wavefunctioncollapse` library (https://github.com/mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse) and its core algorithm.  It considers how an attacker might craft malicious input to trigger non-convergence and cause CPU overload.  The analysis *does not* cover:

*   Network-level DoS attacks (e.g., flooding the server with requests).
*   Vulnerabilities in other parts of the application stack (e.g., web server, database).
*   Memory exhaustion attacks (although prolonged CPU usage can indirectly lead to memory issues).

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review:**  Examine the `wavefunctioncollapse` library's source code, particularly the `collapse` function and related constraint propagation logic.  Identify areas where infinite loops or excessive recursion could occur.
*   **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools (if applicable to the language used - likely Python) to identify potential infinite loops or resource-intensive operations.
*   **Dynamic Analysis:**  Experimentally test the library with various inputs, including:
    *   Valid, well-formed inputs.
    *   Inputs with known contradictions.
    *   Inputs with large, complex rule sets.
    *   Inputs designed to maximize backtracking.
    *   Inputs with edge cases and boundary conditions.
*   **Threat Modeling Review:**  Revisit the original threat model to ensure all aspects of the threat are addressed.
*   **Mitigation Implementation Review:**  Evaluate the proposed mitigation strategies for feasibility, effectiveness, and potential performance impact.
*   **Testing:** Develop unit and integration tests to verify the implemented mitigations.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1. Code Review Findings

The core of the `wavefunctioncollapse` algorithm lies in the iterative process of:

1.  **Observation:** Selecting the cell with the lowest entropy (fewest possible tile options).
2.  **Collapse:**  Choosing a tile for that cell (randomly, based on weights).
3.  **Propagation:**  Updating the possible tile options for neighboring cells based on adjacency rules.
4.  **Backtracking:** If a contradiction is found (a cell has no possible tiles), undoing the last collapse and trying a different tile.

The primary vulnerability lies in the potential for **non-convergence**, where steps 3 and 4 cycle indefinitely or for an extremely long time.  This can happen due to:

*   **Contradictory Constraints:**  The input rules might be inherently impossible to satisfy.  For example, if tile A can only be next to tile B, and tile B can only be next to tile C, but tile C *cannot* be next to tile A, a closed loop of three cells would be impossible to fill.
*   **Insufficient Adjacency Rules:**  The rules might be too permissive, allowing many possibilities but not providing enough constraints to guide the algorithm towards a solution.  This can lead to excessive backtracking.
*   **Large Output Size and Complex Rules:**  Even with valid rules, a very large output grid combined with a complex rule set can significantly increase the search space and the likelihood of long backtracking chains.
*   **Edge Cases:**  Specific combinations of tiles and rules at the edges of the output grid might create local contradictions that are difficult to resolve.

Looking at the likely implementation (based on the library's description and common WFC implementations), the `collapse` function will likely have a main loop that continues until all cells are filled or a contradiction is detected.  The backtracking mechanism is crucial.  If backtracking is not implemented efficiently or has bugs, it could lead to exponential time complexity in the worst case.

### 2.2. Dynamic Analysis Results (Hypothetical - Requires Actual Testing)

We would expect the following results from dynamic analysis:

*   **Valid Inputs:**  The algorithm should converge quickly for well-formed inputs with reasonable size and complexity.
*   **Contradictory Inputs:**  Without mitigations, the algorithm should hang or run for a very long time.  With a timeout, it should terminate and report the timeout.
*   **Large/Complex Inputs:**  Execution time should increase significantly, potentially hitting the timeout even with valid rules.  This highlights the need for careful configuration of the timeout and iteration limits.
*   **Edge Case Inputs:**  These tests are crucial for identifying subtle bugs in the backtracking or constraint propagation logic.  We might observe unexpected behavior or long runtimes even with seemingly valid rules.

### 2.3. Mitigation Strategy Refinement and Implementation Guidance

The proposed mitigation strategies are generally sound.  Here's a refined approach with implementation details:

1.  **Strict Timeout Mechanism:**

    *   **Implementation:** Use a timer (e.g., `time.time()` in Python) at the beginning of the `collapse` function.  Inside the main loop, check if the elapsed time exceeds a configurable threshold (e.g., `MAX_EXECUTION_TIME`).  If it does, raise a custom exception (e.g., `TimeoutError`).
    *   **Configuration:**  `MAX_EXECUTION_TIME` should be a parameter that can be set by the user of the library or application.  Provide a sensible default (e.g., 10 seconds).
    *   **Error Handling:**  Catch the `TimeoutError` and return an appropriate error message to the user, indicating that the generation failed due to a timeout.  Log the timeout event with details (input size, rules, etc.).

2.  **Maximum Iteration Count:**

    *   **Implementation:**  Maintain a counter (`iteration_count`) inside the main loop of the `collapse` function.  Increment it after each iteration (observation, collapse, propagation).  If `iteration_count` exceeds a configurable limit (`MAX_ITERATIONS`), raise a custom exception (e.g., `MaxIterationsExceeded`).
    *   **Configuration:**  `MAX_ITERATIONS` should be a configurable parameter.  The default value should be carefully chosen based on the expected complexity of the input and the desired performance.  It might need to be adjusted dynamically based on the output size.
    *   **Error Handling:**  Similar to the timeout, catch the exception, return an error message, and log the event.

3.  **Input Validation (Pre-processing):**

    *   **Implementation:**  This is the most complex mitigation.  It requires analyzing the adjacency rules *before* starting the generation process.
        *   **Basic Checks:**  Ensure that all tiles referenced in the adjacency rules actually exist.  Check for obvious contradictions (e.g., tile A cannot be next to tile A).
        *   **Constraint Solver (Optional but Recommended):**  For more robust validation, consider using a constraint solver library (e.g., `python-constraint`).  Represent the adjacency rules as constraints and attempt to find a solution.  If the solver finds no solution, the input is contradictory.  This can be computationally expensive, so it might be optional or limited to smaller input sizes.
        *   **Connectivity Check:** Ensure that the rules allow for a connected solution. If the tileset can be partitioned into groups that cannot connect, the algorithm will never converge.
    *   **Error Handling:**  If validation fails, return a clear error message to the user, explaining the nature of the contradiction or inconsistency.  Do *not* start the generation process.

4.  **Informative Error Messages and Logging:**

    *   **Implementation:**  Throughout the `collapse` function and the mitigation code, use descriptive error messages and logging statements.  Include information about:
        *   The type of error (timeout, maximum iterations, constraint violation).
        *   The current state of the algorithm (e.g., iteration count, number of collapsed cells).
        *   The input parameters (output size, rules).
        *   Any relevant stack traces (for debugging).
    *   **Logging Levels:**  Use different logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) to control the verbosity of the output.

### 2.4. Testing Strategies

Thorough testing is essential to ensure the effectiveness of the mitigations.

*   **Unit Tests:**
    *   Test the timeout mechanism with various timeout values and inputs that should trigger the timeout.
    *   Test the maximum iteration count with various limits and inputs.
    *   Test the input validation logic with valid and invalid rule sets, including edge cases and known contradictions.
    *   Test the error handling and logging for each mitigation.
*   **Integration Tests:**
    *   Test the entire `collapse` function with a range of inputs, including those designed to stress the mitigations.
    *   Test the interaction between the `wavefunctioncollapse` library and the application that uses it, ensuring that errors are handled correctly.
* **Performance Tests:**
    * Measure execution time with and without mitigations.
    * Ensure mitigations don't introduce significant performance overhead.
* **Fuzzing (Optional):**
    * Use a fuzzer to generate random or semi-random inputs to the `collapse` function. This can help uncover unexpected edge cases and vulnerabilities.

## 3. Conclusion

The "Resource Exhaustion - CPU Overload (Non-Convergence)" threat is a serious concern for applications using the `wavefunctioncollapse` library.  By implementing the refined mitigation strategies (timeout, maximum iterations, input validation, and informative error handling) and rigorously testing them, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of denial-of-service attacks.  The key is to prevent the algorithm from running indefinitely and to provide clear feedback to the user when generation fails.  The optional use of a constraint solver during input validation can provide an extra layer of protection against malicious or poorly designed inputs. Continuous monitoring and testing are crucial for maintaining the security and stability of the application.
