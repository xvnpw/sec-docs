# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.3.1: Provide Complex Tileset with Many Constraints

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the security implications of an attacker providing a complex tileset with many constraints to a WFC-based application.  We aim to identify potential vulnerabilities, assess the likelihood and impact of a successful attack, and propose mitigation strategies.  Specifically, we're looking at how this attack vector can lead to denial-of-service (DoS) or potentially other unexpected behaviors.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on applications utilizing the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library (or similar WFC implementations) where user-provided input (the tileset and its constraints) directly influences the algorithm's execution.  The scope includes:

*   **Input Validation:** How the application handles user-supplied tilesets and constraints.
*   **Resource Consumption:**  The impact of complex tilesets on CPU usage, memory allocation, and execution time.
*   **Error Handling:**  How the application responds to situations where the WFC algorithm fails to converge or encounters excessive resource demands.
*   **Downstream Effects:**  Potential consequences of a stalled or excessively long WFC process on other parts of the application or system.
* **Library specific:** Analysis of `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review:**  Examine the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library's source code (and the application's code if available) to understand how tilesets and constraints are processed.  We'll pay close attention to loops, recursion, and data structures used to manage constraints.
*   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools (if applicable) to identify potential performance bottlenecks and vulnerabilities related to input processing.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**  Construct deliberately complex tilesets with varying degrees of constraint complexity.  We will then run the WFC algorithm with these tilesets and monitor:
    *   CPU utilization
    *   Memory usage
    *   Execution time
    *   Success/failure rate of the algorithm
    *   Application responsiveness
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Consider the attacker's motivations and capabilities.  This helps us assess the likelihood of this attack being exploited in a real-world scenario.
* **Library specific analysis:** Analyze `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` for potential vulnerabilities.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.3.1

### 4.1. Threat Description

The attacker provides a maliciously crafted tileset designed to maximize the computational complexity of the WFC algorithm.  This is achieved by:

*   **High Constraint Count:**  Each tile has numerous rules dictating its valid neighbors.
*   **Complex Constraint Logic:**  The rules themselves might involve multiple conditions or dependencies, making them computationally expensive to evaluate.
*   **Conflicting Constraints:**  The attacker might introduce constraints that are difficult or impossible to satisfy simultaneously, leading to extensive backtracking and potentially infinite loops.
*   **Large Tileset Size:**  A larger number of tiles, even with simple constraints, can increase the search space exponentially.

### 4.2. Vulnerability Analysis

The core vulnerability lies in the WFC algorithm's inherent sensitivity to the complexity of the input tileset.  The algorithm's performance is not always predictable and can degrade significantly with complex constraints.  Specific vulnerabilities include:

*   **Algorithmic Complexity:**  The WFC algorithm, in the worst case, can have exponential time complexity.  A complex tileset can push the algorithm towards this worst-case scenario.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:**  The algorithm may consume excessive CPU cycles and memory while attempting to resolve the complex constraints.  This can lead to:
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to resource starvation.
    *   **System Instability:**  On a shared system, the excessive resource consumption could impact other applications or the operating system itself.
*   **Infinite Loops/Stalling:**  If the constraints are contradictory or the algorithm gets trapped in a local minimum, it might never converge, leading to a hung process.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** If the application doesn't adequately validate the complexity of the input tileset, it's more susceptible to this attack.  Validation might include:
    *   Limits on the number of tiles.
    *   Limits on the number of constraints per tile.
    *   Limits on the complexity of constraint logic.
    *   Timeouts for the WFC algorithm.
* **mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse specific:**
    - **Overlapping Model:** If Overlapping Model is used, attacker can create tileset that will cause exponential growth of possible patterns.
    - **Simpletiled Model:** If Simpletiled Model is used, attacker can create tileset with many constraints, that will cause long execution time.
    - **Lack of timeouts:** Library itself does not have any timeouts, so it is responsibility of developer to implement them.

### 4.3. Impact Analysis

The impact of a successful attack can range from minor inconvenience to complete system failure:

*   **Availability (High):**  The primary impact is on the availability of the application.  A DoS attack can render the application unusable.
*   **Integrity (Low/Medium):**  While the attack primarily targets availability, there's a potential for indirect integrity issues.  For example, if the application uses the WFC output for critical decisions, a stalled or incorrect result could lead to data corruption or incorrect behavior.
*   **Confidentiality (Low):**  This attack vector is unlikely to directly compromise confidentiality.  However, if the application handles sensitive data, a DoS attack could prevent access to that data.

### 4.4. Likelihood Analysis

The likelihood of this attack depends on several factors:

*   **Attacker Motivation:**  Is there a reason someone would want to disrupt the application?  This could be for competitive reasons, activism, or simply malicious intent.
*   **Application Exposure:**  Is the application publicly accessible?  A publicly exposed application is more likely to be targeted.
*   **Ease of Exploitation:**  Creating a complex tileset is relatively easy, making this attack technically feasible for many attackers.
* **Lack of documentation:** If application using this library does not have proper documentation, it is more likely that developer will not implement proper security measures.

Given the ease of exploitation and the potential for significant impact, the likelihood is considered **Medium to High**, especially for publicly accessible applications.

### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies

Several mitigation strategies can be employed to reduce the risk:

*   **Input Validation (Crucial):**
    *   **Limit Tileset Size:**  Restrict the maximum number of tiles allowed.
    *   **Limit Constraint Count:**  Restrict the number of constraints per tile.
    *   **Constraint Complexity Analysis:**  Implement checks to detect and reject overly complex constraint logic.  This might involve analyzing the structure of the constraints or using heuristics to estimate their computational cost.
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Constraints:**  Instead of trying to blacklist complex constraints, define a whitelist of allowed constraint types and structures.
*   **Resource Limits:**
    *   **Timeouts:**  Implement a strict timeout for the WFC algorithm.  If the algorithm doesn't converge within the timeout, terminate it and return an error.
    *   **Memory Limits:**  Monitor memory usage and terminate the algorithm if it exceeds a predefined limit.
    *   **CPU Limits:** Consider using techniques like process prioritization or containerization to limit the CPU resources available to the WFC process.
*   **Algorithm Optimization:**
    *   **Heuristics:**  Explore using more sophisticated heuristics within the WFC algorithm to guide the search process and avoid getting stuck in local minima.
    *   **Constraint Propagation:**  Implement efficient constraint propagation techniques to quickly identify and eliminate invalid tile combinations.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   **Graceful Degradation:**  If the WFC algorithm fails (due to timeout or resource exhaustion), provide a fallback mechanism.  This might involve returning a default output, displaying an error message, or using a simplified tileset.
    *   **Logging:**  Log detailed information about WFC failures, including the input tileset and the reason for failure.  This helps with debugging and identifying malicious inputs.
*   **Sandboxing:**  Run the WFC algorithm in a separate, isolated process or container.  This limits the impact of a successful attack on the rest of the application.
* **Library specific:**
    - Use `Propagator.Run` with context and timeout.
    - Analyze tileset before passing it to library.

### 4.6. Conclusion

The attack vector of providing a complex tileset with many constraints poses a significant threat to WFC-based applications.  The inherent complexity of the algorithm makes it vulnerable to resource exhaustion and denial-of-service attacks.  However, by implementing robust input validation, resource limits, and appropriate error handling, the risk can be significantly mitigated.  A proactive approach to security, including thorough code review, testing, and threat modeling, is essential to ensure the resilience of applications using the Wave Function Collapse algorithm.
