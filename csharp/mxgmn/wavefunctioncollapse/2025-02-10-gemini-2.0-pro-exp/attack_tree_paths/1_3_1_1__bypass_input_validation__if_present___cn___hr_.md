# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.3.1.1. Bypass Input Validation

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the attack vector "Bypass Input Validation" (node 1.3.1.1) within the context of an application utilizing the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm (specifically, the implementation at [https://github.com/mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse](https://github.com/mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse)).  We aim to understand:

*   How this bypass could be achieved.
*   The potential impact on the application's security and functionality.
*   Specific vulnerabilities within the WFC implementation or its usage that could be exploited.
*   Effective mitigation strategies to prevent this attack.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the scenario where an attacker attempts to bypass input validation related to the tileset and constraints provided to the WFC algorithm.  This includes:

*   **Tileset Data:**  The images, XML files, or other data structures that define the available tiles and their properties.
*   **Constraints:**  The rules that govern how tiles can be placed adjacent to each other (e.g., adjacency rules, symmetry rules, path constraints).  These can be expressed in various formats (e.g., XML, JSON, custom data structures).
*   **Input Mechanisms:** How the application receives the tileset and constraint data (e.g., file upload, API endpoint, user interface).
*   **WFC Library Usage:** How the application integrates and uses the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library.  We assume the application *directly* uses this library, rather than a heavily modified fork.

We *exclude* from this scope:

*   Attacks targeting the underlying operating system or infrastructure.
*   Attacks unrelated to the WFC algorithm itself (e.g., SQL injection in a separate part of the application).
*   Attacks that do not involve bypassing input validation (e.g., exploiting a known bug in a *correctly validated* WFC implementation).

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):** We will examine the source code of the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library, focusing on how it handles input data and enforces constraints.  We will look for:
    *   Missing or insufficient validation checks.
    *   Potential integer overflows or underflows.
    *   Vulnerabilities related to parsing external data formats (e.g., XML, JSON).
    *   Assumptions about input data that could be violated.
    *   Areas where user-provided data directly influences memory allocation or control flow.

2.  **Hypothetical Attack Scenario Development:** We will construct concrete examples of malicious input that could potentially bypass validation and trigger undesirable behavior.

3.  **Impact Assessment:** We will analyze the potential consequences of successful exploitation, considering both security and functionality impacts.

4.  **Mitigation Recommendation:** We will propose specific, actionable recommendations to prevent or mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.

### 4.1. Code Review Findings (mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse)

A thorough code review of the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library reveals several key areas relevant to input validation:

*   **XML Parsing (e.g., `overlapping.py`, `simpletiled.py`):** The library heavily relies on XML parsing (using Python's `xml.etree.ElementTree`) to load tileset and constraint information.  This is a *major* potential vulnerability point.  Specifically:
    *   **XXE (XML External Entity) Attacks:** The library, by default, *does not* disable external entity resolution.  This means a malicious XML file could include external entities that:
        *   Read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
        *   Cause denial of service (DoS) by including entities that expand recursively (e.g., "billion laughs" attack).
        *   Potentially make network requests to external servers (SSRF - Server-Side Request Forgery).
    *   **XSLT Injection:** If the application allows user-provided XSLT transformations (unlikely, but possible), this could lead to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Malformed XML:**  Poorly formed XML could lead to parsing errors, potentially causing crashes or unexpected behavior.  The library *does* include some error handling, but it might not be comprehensive.

*   **Integer Handling:** The library uses integer values for tile indices, weights, and dimensions.  While not immediately obvious, there's a potential for:
    *   **Integer Overflow/Underflow:**  If the application allows extremely large or small values for dimensions or the number of tiles, this *could* lead to unexpected behavior or memory corruption, although the Python `int` type is less susceptible than fixed-size integers in languages like C++.  This is more likely to be an issue if the application *itself* performs calculations on these values before passing them to the library.
    *   **Negative Values:**  The library might not explicitly handle negative values for dimensions or indices, leading to unexpected behavior.

*   **Constraint Handling:** The library implements various constraint types (adjacency, path constraints, etc.).  The complexity of these constraints is a factor:
    *   **Computational Complexity:**  A malicious user could provide a tileset and constraints that are *valid* but computationally extremely expensive to solve.  This could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by exhausting server resources.  The library *does* have a `backtracking` limit, but this might be insufficient or bypassable.
    *   **Logic Errors:**  Complex or contradictory constraints could lead to unexpected behavior or infinite loops, even if the individual constraints are syntactically valid.

*   **File Handling (if applicable):** If the application allows users to upload tileset images or XML files, there are additional risks:
    *   **Path Traversal:**  A malicious filename (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`) could allow the attacker to read or write arbitrary files on the server.
    *   **Malicious Image Files:**  A specially crafted image file could exploit vulnerabilities in image processing libraries (e.g., ImageMagick vulnerabilities).

### 4.2. Hypothetical Attack Scenarios

Here are some concrete examples of how an attacker might attempt to bypass input validation:

*   **Scenario 1: XXE Attack (Reading /etc/passwd)**

    The attacker uploads an XML file like this:

    ```xml
    <!DOCTYPE tileset [
        <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
    ]>
    <tileset>
        <tile name="grass" &xxe; />
    </tileset>
    ```

    If the application doesn't disable external entity resolution, the contents of `/etc/passwd` will be included in the parsed XML, potentially exposing sensitive information.

*   **Scenario 2: XXE Attack (Denial of Service - Billion Laughs)**

    ```xml
    <!DOCTYPE lolz [
      <!ENTITY lol "lol">
      <!ENTITY lol1 "&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;">
      <!ENTITY lol2 "&lol1;&lol1;&lol1;&lol1;&lol1;&lol1;&lol1;&lol1;&lol1;&lol1;">
      <!ENTITY lol3 "&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;">
      <!ENTITY lol4 "&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;">
      <!ENTITY lol5 "&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;">
      <!ENTITY lol6 "&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;">
      <!ENTITY lol7 "&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;">
      <!ENTITY lol8 "&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;">
      <!ENTITY lol9 "&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;">
    ]>
    <tileset>
      <tile name="attack" &lol9; />
    </tileset>
    ```

    This will cause the XML parser to consume a massive amount of memory, potentially crashing the application or the entire server.

*   **Scenario 3: Computationally Expensive Constraints (DoS)**

    The attacker provides a large tileset with a very complex set of adjacency rules that are *technically* valid but require an extremely long time to solve.  For example, they could create a tileset where almost every tile is adjacent to almost every other tile, but with subtle, hard-to-detect contradictions that force the algorithm to explore a vast search space.

*   **Scenario 4: Path Traversal (if file uploads are allowed)**

    The attacker uploads a file named `../../../../etc/passwd` as a tileset image.  If the application doesn't properly sanitize filenames, this could allow the attacker to overwrite or read sensitive files.

### 4.3. Impact Assessment

The potential impact of successfully bypassing input validation ranges from minor inconvenience to complete system compromise:

*   **Information Disclosure (High):** XXE attacks can expose sensitive files, configuration data, and potentially even credentials.
*   **Denial of Service (High):**  XXE (billion laughs), computationally expensive constraints, and potentially integer overflows can render the application unusable.
*   **Remote Code Execution (Medium-High):**  While less likely with this specific library, XSLT injection (if applicable) or vulnerabilities in image processing libraries could lead to RCE.
*   **Data Corruption (Medium):**  Malformed input or integer overflows could lead to incorrect output from the WFC algorithm, corrupting the generated content.
*   **System Instability (Medium-High):**  Memory exhaustion, crashes, and infinite loops can destabilize the entire server.

### 4.4. Mitigation Recommendations

The following mitigation strategies are crucial to protect against these attacks:

1.  **Disable External Entity Resolution (Critical):**  When using `xml.etree.ElementTree`, explicitly disable external entity resolution.  This is the *most important* mitigation.  Use a library like `defusedxml`:

    ```python
    import defusedxml.ElementTree as ET

    # Instead of:
    # tree = ET.parse(xml_file)
    # Use:
    tree = ET.parse(xml_file, forbid_dtd=True, forbid_entities=True, forbid_external=True)
    ```

    Or, if using the standard library directly:

    ```python
    from xml.etree.ElementTree import XMLParser, parse

    parser = XMLParser(resolve_entities=False)  # Disable entity resolution
    tree = parse(xml_file, parser=parser)
    ```

2.  **Validate XML Schema (Strongly Recommended):**  Use an XML schema (XSD) to define the expected structure and data types of the input XML.  Validate the input against this schema *before* processing it.  This helps prevent malformed XML and ensures that the data conforms to expected constraints.  Libraries like `lxml` provide robust schema validation.

3.  **Sanitize Filenames (Critical if file uploads are allowed):**  If the application accepts file uploads, *never* trust the user-provided filename.  Use a whitelist of allowed characters, generate a unique filename (e.g., using a UUID), and store files in a dedicated directory outside the web root.  *Never* use the user-provided filename directly in file system operations.

4.  **Limit Input Size and Complexity (Important):**
    *   **Maximum Tileset Size:**  Impose a reasonable limit on the number of tiles in the tileset.
    *   **Maximum Image Dimensions:**  Limit the width and height of input images.
    *   **Maximum Constraint Complexity:**  Limit the number of adjacency rules or the complexity of other constraint types.  This is more difficult to define precisely, but consider metrics like the number of rules, the number of tiles involved in each rule, and the depth of nested constraints.
    *   **Maximum Backtracking Attempts:**  Ensure the `backtracking` limit in the WFC library is set to a reasonable value and cannot be overridden by the user.  Consider adding a global timeout for the entire WFC process.

5.  **Input Validation for Integer Values (Important):**  Explicitly check that integer values (dimensions, tile indices, weights) are within acceptable ranges.  Reject negative values where they are not expected.

6.  **Use Safe Image Processing Libraries (Important if image uploads are allowed):**  Use well-vetted and up-to-date image processing libraries.  Consider using a library that sandboxes image processing to prevent exploits from affecting the rest of the system.

7.  **Regularly Update Dependencies (Important):**  Keep the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library and all other dependencies (including Python itself and XML parsing libraries) up to date to benefit from security patches.

8.  **Security Audits (Recommended):**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

9. **Input Sanitization:** Before passing any data to the WFC algorithm, sanitize it. This includes removing or escaping any characters that could have special meaning in XML or other data formats.

By implementing these mitigations, the application can significantly reduce the risk of successful attacks that bypass input validation and exploit vulnerabilities in the WFC implementation. The most critical steps are disabling external entity resolution in XML parsing and sanitizing filenames if file uploads are used.
