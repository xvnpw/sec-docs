# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.3. Excessive CPU Consumption

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the "Excessive CPU Consumption" attack vector against an application leveraging the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library.  We aim to understand how an attacker could exploit the WFC algorithm's inherent computational complexity to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) or significant performance degradation.  This includes identifying specific vulnerabilities, potential attack methods, and proposing concrete mitigation strategies.  The "[HR]" designation likely indicates "High Risk," reinforcing the importance of this analysis.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library and its potential for CPU exhaustion.  The scope includes:

*   **Code Review:** Examining the library's source code (https://github.com/mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse) for potential performance bottlenecks, inefficient algorithms, and exploitable logic.
*   **Algorithm Analysis:** Understanding the theoretical computational complexity of the WFC algorithm and how different parameters and input configurations can impact CPU usage.
*   **Input Manipulation:** Identifying input parameters or data structures that could be crafted by an attacker to trigger excessive CPU consumption.
*   **Resource Monitoring:** Defining metrics and methods for monitoring CPU usage during WFC execution to detect potential attacks.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Proposing practical and effective countermeasures to prevent or mitigate CPU exhaustion attacks.

This analysis *excludes* general system-level DoS attacks (e.g., network flooding) that are not directly related to the WFC algorithm itself.  It also excludes vulnerabilities in the application *using* the library, except where those vulnerabilities directly interact with the WFC algorithm's execution.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow a structured approach:

1.  **Static Code Analysis:**
    *   Review the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` codebase on GitHub.
    *   Identify computationally intensive functions and loops.
    *   Analyze the use of recursion, nested loops, and data structures.
    *   Look for potential infinite loops or uncontrolled recursion.
    *   Use static analysis tools (if applicable and available) to identify potential performance issues.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Profiling):**
    *   Instrument the code (or use a profiler) to measure the execution time of different functions and code sections.
    *   Run the WFC algorithm with various input parameters (size, complexity, constraints) to observe CPU usage patterns.
    *   Identify performance hotspots and bottlenecks.

3.  **Input Fuzzing:**
    *   Develop a fuzzer (or use an existing one) to generate a wide range of input parameters and data structures.
    *   Feed these inputs to the WFC algorithm and monitor CPU usage.
    *   Identify inputs that trigger unusually high CPU consumption.

4.  **Theoretical Complexity Analysis:**
    *   Research the theoretical complexity of the WFC algorithm (e.g., Big O notation).
    *   Determine how the complexity scales with input size and other parameters.
    *   Identify worst-case scenarios that could lead to exponential or factorial time complexity.

5.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**
    *   Based on the findings from the previous steps, propose specific mitigation techniques.
    *   Prioritize mitigations based on their effectiveness and feasibility.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.3. Excessive CPU Consumption

This section details the findings and analysis based on the methodology outlined above.

### 4.1 Static Code Analysis Findings

Reviewing the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` code reveals several key areas of potential concern:

*   **`Model.Run()` Function:** This is the core function that drives the WFC algorithm. It contains a `while` loop that continues until the algorithm converges or a contradiction is found.  This loop is the primary target for CPU exhaustion attacks.
*   **`Propagate()` Function:** This function enforces constraints and propagates changes throughout the grid. It involves iterating over neighboring cells and updating their possibilities.  Nested loops within this function could contribute to high CPU usage.
*   **`Observe()` Function:** This function selects the next cell to collapse based on entropy.  The efficiency of this selection process can impact performance.
*   **Data Structures:** The library uses arrays and lists to represent the grid and tile possibilities.  The size and organization of these data structures can affect memory access patterns and overall performance.
* **Backtracking:** The algorithm inherently uses backtracking. If a contradiction is found, the algorithm needs to revert to a previous state. Deep backtracking, especially with large grids and complex rules, can be very CPU intensive.

### 4.2 Dynamic Analysis (Profiling) Results

(Note:  This section would contain actual profiling data in a real-world scenario.  We'll provide hypothetical examples here.)

Hypothetical profiling results might show:

*   **`Propagate()` consistently consumes a significant portion of CPU time,** especially with complex constraint rules.
*   **Large grid sizes (e.g., 100x100 or larger) lead to a dramatic increase in CPU usage,** potentially exhibiting exponential growth.
*   **Specific tile sets and constraint rules cause significantly longer execution times** compared to others, even with the same grid size.
*   **Deep backtracking events correlate with spikes in CPU usage.**

### 4.3 Input Fuzzing Results

(Again, this section would contain real-world fuzzing results.  We'll provide hypothetical examples.)

Hypothetical fuzzing might reveal:

*   **Extremely large grid dimensions (e.g., 1000x1000) cause the application to become unresponsive.**
*   **Highly constrained tile sets (where few tiles can be placed next to each other) lead to frequent contradictions and extensive backtracking,** resulting in high CPU usage.
*   **Input files with corrupted or invalid data cause the algorithm to enter an infinite loop or crash.**
*   **Specially crafted input files that maximize the number of possible tile combinations at each step** can significantly slow down the `Observe()` function.

### 4.4 Theoretical Complexity Analysis

The WFC algorithm's complexity is highly dependent on the specific implementation and the input parameters.  In the worst-case scenario, it can exhibit exponential time complexity (O(c^n), where 'c' is a constant related to the number of tile possibilities and 'n' is the number of cells in the grid).  This is because the algorithm explores a search space of possible tile configurations.

Key factors influencing complexity:

*   **Grid Size (n):**  The number of cells in the grid directly impacts the size of the search space.
*   **Number of Tiles (t):**  More tiles mean more possibilities to consider at each step.
*   **Constraint Complexity:**  Complex rules that restrict tile placement increase the likelihood of contradictions and backtracking.
*   **Contradiction Rate:**  Frequent contradictions force the algorithm to backtrack, significantly increasing computation time.

### 4.5 Mitigation Strategies

Based on the analysis, the following mitigation strategies are recommended:

1.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Strictly limit the maximum grid size.**  Implement a hard limit on the dimensions of the input grid (e.g., 256x256).  This is the most crucial mitigation.
    *   **Validate the input tile set and constraint rules.**  Ensure that the input data is well-formed and does not contain inconsistencies or errors.
    *   **Reject excessively complex constraint rules.**  Implement a heuristic to measure the complexity of the rules and reject those that exceed a predefined threshold.

2.  **Timeouts and Resource Limits:**
    *   **Implement a timeout mechanism.**  Terminate the WFC algorithm if it does not converge within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 30 seconds).  This prevents the application from becoming indefinitely unresponsive.
    *   **Limit the maximum CPU usage.**  Use operating system features (e.g., `ulimit` on Linux) or programming language constructs to restrict the amount of CPU time the WFC process can consume.

3.  **Algorithm Optimization (If Possible and Within Scope):**
    *   **Optimize the `Propagate()` function.**  Explore alternative algorithms or data structures to improve the efficiency of constraint propagation.
    *   **Improve the `Observe()` function.**  Consider using more sophisticated entropy calculation methods or heuristics to select the next cell to collapse.
    *   **Implement caching or memoization.**  Store the results of intermediate calculations to avoid redundant computations.
    * **Consider using a more efficient data structure for representing the grid and tile possibilities.** For example, bitsets could be used to represent tile possibilities, potentially leading to faster constraint checking.

4.  **Backtracking Optimization:**
    *   **Limit the depth of backtracking.**  If the algorithm backtracks too many times, it's likely stuck in a difficult configuration.  Terminate the process or try a different random seed.
    *   **Implement more intelligent backtracking strategies.**  Explore techniques like constraint learning or conflict-directed backjumping to reduce the amount of backtracking required.

5.  **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    *   **Continuously monitor CPU usage during WFC execution.**  Use system monitoring tools or libraries to track CPU time.
    *   **Set up alerts for excessive CPU consumption.**  Trigger an alert if CPU usage exceeds a predefined threshold for a sustained period.

6.  **Asynchronous Processing:**
    *   **Offload the WFC computation to a separate thread or process.** This prevents the main application thread from becoming blocked, improving responsiveness.  Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms to handle communication between the main thread and the WFC thread.

7. **Rate Limiting:**
    * If the WFC generation is triggered by user requests, implement rate limiting to prevent an attacker from submitting a large number of requests in a short period.

## 5. Conclusion

The `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library, while powerful, is susceptible to CPU exhaustion attacks due to the inherent computational complexity of the WFC algorithm.  Attackers can exploit this by providing carefully crafted inputs (large grids, complex constraints) to cause excessive CPU consumption, leading to denial-of-service.  The mitigation strategies outlined above, particularly input validation, timeouts, and resource limits, are crucial for protecting applications that use this library.  A combination of these techniques is recommended to provide a robust defense against CPU exhaustion attacks.  Regular security audits and code reviews are also essential to identify and address any new vulnerabilities that may arise.
