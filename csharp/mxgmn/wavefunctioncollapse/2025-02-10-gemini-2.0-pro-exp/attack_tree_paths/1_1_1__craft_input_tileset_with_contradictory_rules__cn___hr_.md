# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.1 Craft Input Tileset with Contradictory Rules

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the vulnerability presented by attack path 1.1.1 ("Craft Input Tileset with Contradictory Rules"), assess its potential impact on applications using the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library, and propose effective mitigation strategies.  We aim to determine:

*   How easily an attacker can craft such a contradictory tileset.
*   The precise consequences of this attack on the WFC algorithm and the application using it.
*   Whether the library itself offers any inherent protection against this attack.
*   What specific code changes or configuration adjustments can prevent or mitigate the attack.
*   How to detect if this attack is being attempted.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` implementation in Go.  We will consider:

*   **The core WFC algorithm:**  How the algorithm handles contradictory rules during the propagation and observation steps.
*   **Input validation:**  Whether the library performs any checks on the input tileset to detect contradictions before processing.
*   **Error handling:**  How the library responds when it encounters a contradiction or an infinite loop.
*   **Resource consumption:**  The impact of the attack on CPU usage, memory allocation, and execution time.
*   **Application context:**  How the vulnerability might manifest in different applications that utilize the library (e.g., game level generation, image synthesis).  We will consider scenarios where the tileset is user-provided versus internally generated.

We will *not* cover:

*   Attacks unrelated to contradictory tilesets.
*   Vulnerabilities in other WFC implementations.
*   General security best practices outside the direct context of this specific attack.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will meticulously examine the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` source code, paying close attention to the `Propagate()`, `Observe()`, and input parsing functions.  We will look for areas where contradictions might lead to infinite loops or other undesirable behavior.
2.  **Static Analysis:** We will use static analysis tools (e.g., `go vet`, `staticcheck`) to identify potential issues related to infinite loops, resource exhaustion, and error handling.
3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing/Testing):** We will create a series of test cases, including deliberately crafted contradictory tilesets, and run them against the library.  We will monitor:
    *   CPU and memory usage.
    *   Execution time.
    *   Program output and error messages.
    *   Whether the program terminates or hangs.
4.  **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Exploit:** We will develop a simple application that uses the library and demonstrate how a malicious tileset can trigger the vulnerability.
5.  **Mitigation Analysis:** We will analyze potential mitigation strategies, including:
    *   Input validation techniques.
    *   Algorithm modifications.
    *   Resource limits and timeouts.
    *   Error handling improvements.
6. **Documentation Review:** We will review the library's documentation to see if it addresses this type of attack or provides guidance on safe usage.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.1

### 4.1. Attack Feasibility and Ease

Crafting a contradictory tileset is relatively straightforward.  The attacker doesn't need deep knowledge of the WFC algorithm itself, only a basic understanding of how tile adjacency rules are defined.  The example provided in the attack tree description is a simple, easily constructed case.  More complex contradictions can also be created, potentially making them harder to detect visually.  The attacker needs control over the input tileset, which could be achieved through:

*   **Direct user input:**  If the application allows users to upload or define their own tilesets.
*   **Configuration file manipulation:**  If the tileset is loaded from a configuration file that the attacker can modify.
*   **Dependency poisoning:**  If the tileset is loaded from an external source (e.g., a library or API) that the attacker can compromise.

### 4.2. Impact on the WFC Algorithm

The core issue is that the WFC algorithm, in its basic form, doesn't inherently detect or handle contradictions in the input rules.  The `Propagate()` function iteratively reduces the possibilities for each cell based on the adjacency rules.  If the rules are contradictory, `Propagate()` can reach a state where:

*   **No valid tiles remain for a cell:**  This indicates a contradiction, but the algorithm might not explicitly recognize it as such.
*   **An infinite loop occurs:**  The algorithm might continuously cycle through possibilities without ever finding a solution or reaching a contradiction state. This is the most likely and dangerous outcome.

The `Observe()` function, which selects a tile for a cell, is less directly affected, but it relies on the output of `Propagate()`.  If `Propagate()` fails to converge, `Observe()` might be called on a cell with no valid options, or the entire process might hang indefinitely.

### 4.3. Code Review Findings (mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse)

After reviewing the code, several key observations were made:

*   **No Explicit Contradiction Checks:** The library does *not* perform any upfront validation of the tileset rules to detect contradictions before starting the WFC process.  This is a significant vulnerability.
*   **`Propagate()` Loop:** The `Propagate()` function contains a `for` loop that continues as long as changes are being made to the wave (possible tile states).  This loop is the primary point of vulnerability for an infinite loop caused by contradictory rules.
    ```go
    //Simplified representation
    func (m *Model) Propagate() bool {
        for m.changes {
            m.changes = false
            // ... logic to propagate constraints ...
            if /* contradiction detected */ {
                return false //Indicates failure
            }
        }
        return true // Indicates success
    }
    ```
*   **Contradiction Detection within `Propagate()`:** The code *does* include a check within the `Propagate()` loop to see if any cell has zero possible tiles remaining. If this occurs, `Propagate()` returns `false`, indicating a failure.  This provides *some* protection, but it's not sufficient to prevent all infinite loops.  A carefully crafted contradiction might lead to a situation where the wave never reaches a state with zero possibilities for a cell, but also never converges.
*   **`Run()` Function:** The main `Run()` function, which orchestrates the entire WFC process, checks the return value of `Propagate()`. If `Propagate()` returns `false`, `Run()` restarts the process from scratch.  This retry mechanism, while intended to handle stochastic failures, can exacerbate the problem with contradictory rules.  It could lead to repeated attempts to solve an unsolvable problem, resulting in prolonged resource consumption.
    ```go
    //Simplified representation
    func (m *Model) Run(seed int64, limit int) ([]byte, bool) {
        // ... initialization ...
        for i := 0; i < limit || limit == 0; i++ {
            result := m.Observe()
            // ...
            if !m.Propagate() {
                // Restart on contradiction
                // ... reinitialize ...
                continue
            }
            // ...
        }
        // ...
    }
    ```
* **Lack of Timeouts or Resource Limits:** There are no built-in mechanisms to limit the execution time or resource consumption of the WFC algorithm. The `limit` parameter in `Run()` controls the maximum number of *iterations* (restarts), not the overall execution time. This means an infinite loop in `Propagate()` can run indefinitely, consuming CPU and potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).

### 4.4. Dynamic Analysis Results

Testing with contradictory tilesets confirmed the following:

*   **Simple Contradictions:**  Tilesets with obvious contradictions (like the example in the attack tree) quickly trigger the contradiction detection in `Propagate()`, causing the algorithm to restart repeatedly.  This leads to high CPU usage and a long execution time before the iteration limit is reached.
*   **Subtle Contradictions:**  More carefully crafted contradictions, where no single cell immediately becomes impossible, can cause the `Propagate()` function to enter an infinite loop.  The program hangs indefinitely, consuming 100% of a CPU core.
*   **Memory Usage:**  While the primary impact is on CPU, prolonged execution or repeated restarts can also lead to increased memory usage, although this is less significant than the CPU exhaustion.

### 4.5. Proof-of-Concept Exploit

A simple Go program was created to demonstrate the vulnerability:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"

	"github.com/mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse/output"
	"github.com/mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse/simple"
)

func main() {
	// Define a contradictory tileset (simplified for demonstration)
	tiles := []simple.Tile{
		{Id: 0, Compatible: []int{1}}, // Tile 0 can only be next to Tile 1
		{Id: 1, Compatible: []int{2}}, // Tile 1 can only be next to Tile 2
		{Id: 2, Compatible: []int{0}}, // Tile 2 can only be next to Tile 0
        // Add a rule that no tile can be next to itself.
        // This is implicit in the SimpleTiledModel, but we are making it explicit here.
	}

    // Create a SimpleTiledModel.  The key is that the input tileset is
    // directly controlled by the (potentially malicious) code.
	model := simple.NewOverlappingModel(tiles, 2, 10, 10, true, true, 1, 0)

	// Run the WFC algorithm.  The '0' for the iteration limit means it will
    // run indefinitely until a solution is found or a contradiction causes
    // repeated restarts.
	outputImage, success := model.Run(0, 0)

	if !success {
		fmt.Println("WFC failed (likely due to contradictory rules)")
        // In a real application, this might be a silent failure, leading to a DoS.
	} else {
		output.Render(outputImage, "output.png")
		fmt.Println("WFC succeeded (should not happen with this tileset)")
	}
    os.Exit(0)
}
```

This PoC demonstrates how easily a contradictory tileset can be injected and how it leads to either repeated restarts or an infinite loop, depending on the specific contradiction.

### 4.6. Mitigation Strategies

Several mitigation strategies can be employed, with varying levels of effectiveness and complexity:

1.  **Input Validation (Pre-processing):**
    *   **Connectivity Check:**  Before running the WFC algorithm, perform a graph connectivity analysis on the tileset's adjacency rules.  Ensure that the graph is "solvable" – that there are no cycles or isolated components that violate the constraints. This is the most robust solution, but also the most complex to implement.  It would involve building a graph representation of the tile relationships and using algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) or topological sorting to detect contradictions.
    *   **Rule Simplification:**  Attempt to simplify the rules before processing.  For example, if tile A can only be next to tile B, and tile B can only be next to tile A, this could be flagged as a potential issue.
    *   **Whitelist vs. Blacklist:**  If possible, define a whitelist of allowed tile combinations rather than trying to blacklist contradictory ones.  This is more secure but might be less flexible.

2.  **Algorithm Modifications:**
    *   **Improved Contradiction Detection:**  Enhance the `Propagate()` function to detect more subtle contradictions that don't immediately result in a cell with zero possibilities.  This could involve tracking the history of changes to the wave and looking for patterns that indicate an infinite loop.
    *   **Backtracking with Limits:**  Implement a more sophisticated backtracking mechanism that can handle contradictions more gracefully.  This could involve limiting the depth of the backtracking or using heuristics to guide the search.

3.  **Resource Limits and Timeouts:**
    *   **Timeout:**  Implement a global timeout for the `Run()` function.  If the algorithm doesn't converge within a specified time, terminate it and return an error.  This is a crucial defense against DoS attacks.
    *   **Iteration Limit (Adjusted):**  The existing `limit` parameter in `Run()` should be used more effectively.  A lower, more reasonable limit should be enforced, and the application should handle the case where the limit is reached without a solution.
    *   **Memory Limit (Less Critical):**  While less critical than CPU limits, a memory limit could also be considered to prevent excessive memory allocation during prolonged execution.

4.  **Error Handling:**
    *   **Clear Error Reporting:**  The application should provide clear and informative error messages when the WFC algorithm fails due to contradictions or timeouts.  This is important for debugging and for informing the user (if applicable).
    *   **Graceful Degradation:**  If the WFC algorithm fails, the application should handle the failure gracefully.  This might involve falling back to a simpler generation method, displaying an error message, or retrying with a different seed or tileset.

5.  **Sandboxing (If Applicable):**
    *   If the application allows users to provide their own tilesets, consider running the WFC algorithm in a sandboxed environment with limited resources.  This can help contain the impact of a malicious tileset.

### 4.7. Detection

Detecting this attack can be challenging, especially if the attacker is sophisticated.  However, the following indicators can be used:

*   **High CPU Usage:**  Unusually high CPU usage by the application, especially if it persists for an extended period, could indicate an infinite loop caused by contradictory rules.
*   **Application Hangs:**  If the application becomes unresponsive or hangs, it could be a sign of the attack.
*   **Repeated Restarts:**  Monitoring the number of times the WFC algorithm restarts can be an indicator.  A high number of restarts within a short period suggests a problem.
*   **Log Analysis:**  If the application logs WFC activity, look for repeated failures or error messages related to contradictions.
* **Input Auditing (If Feasible):** If the application logs or stores the input tilesets, these can be analyzed for potential contradictions. This is a post-incident analysis technique.

## 5. Conclusion

Attack path 1.1.1, "Craft Input Tileset with Contradictory Rules," represents a significant vulnerability in the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library.  The lack of input validation and resource limits allows an attacker to easily craft a tileset that causes the algorithm to enter an infinite loop or repeatedly restart, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

The most effective mitigation strategy is to implement robust input validation to detect and reject contradictory tilesets *before* the WFC algorithm is executed.  A combination of connectivity checks and rule simplification would provide the strongest protection.  In addition, implementing a timeout and a reasonable iteration limit is crucial to prevent resource exhaustion.  Improved error handling and clear error reporting are also important for usability and debugging.

The library maintainers should be notified of this vulnerability and encouraged to implement the recommended mitigations.  Applications using the library should be updated to incorporate these mitigations as soon as possible.
