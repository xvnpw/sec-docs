# Deep Analysis: Infinite Loop / Non-Termination Attack on WFC Application

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the potential for an attacker to trigger an infinite loop or non-termination condition within an application leveraging the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library.  This includes identifying specific vulnerabilities, assessing the likelihood and impact of such an attack, and proposing concrete mitigation strategies.  We aim to answer the following key questions:

*   **How** can an attacker specifically cause the WFC algorithm to enter an infinite loop or fail to terminate?
*   **What** are the specific code paths and input conditions that contribute to this vulnerability?
*   **What** is the impact on the application and its users if this attack is successful?
*   **How** can we effectively prevent or mitigate this vulnerability?

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library and its interaction with a hypothetical application.  We will consider:

*   **Input Data:**  The primary attack vector is assumed to be through malicious or crafted input data provided to the WFC algorithm. This includes:
    *   **Tile Sets:**  Malformed or contradictory tile definitions.
    *   **Adjacency Rules:**  Inconsistent or impossible adjacency rules.
    *   **Input Images (for Overlapping Model):**  Images designed to trigger edge cases or contradictions.
    *   **Weights:**  Manipulated weights that bias the algorithm towards non-terminating states.
    *   **Output Dimensions:** Extremely large or invalid output dimensions.
*   **Library Code:**  We will examine the core WFC algorithm implementation within the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library, focusing on:
    *   `Model` class (base class)
    *   `OverlappingModel` class
    *   `SimpleTiledModel` class
    *   The main `run` or `generate` methods (depending on the specific class).
    *   Iteration logic and termination conditions.
    *   Contradiction detection and handling.
*   **Application Integration:**  While we won't analyze a specific application, we will consider how the application *uses* the library, particularly:
    *   How input data is generated and validated.
    *   How the application handles potential exceptions or errors from the library.
    *   How the application utilizes the output of the WFC algorithm.

We will *not* cover:

*   Attacks unrelated to the WFC algorithm itself (e.g., network-level attacks, OS vulnerabilities).
*   Attacks that require direct access to the application's server or code.
*   Generic denial-of-service attacks not specific to the WFC algorithm's logic.

## 3. Methodology

Our analysis will follow a structured approach:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will perform a detailed static analysis of the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library's source code, focusing on the areas identified in the Scope.  We will use a combination of manual inspection and potentially static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.
2.  **Input Fuzzing (Conceptual):**  We will conceptually design fuzzing strategies to generate malicious input data that could trigger infinite loops.  This will involve creating invalid tile sets, contradictory adjacency rules, and edge-case input images.  We won't implement a full fuzzer, but we will describe the types of inputs that would be most effective.
3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual):** We will conceptually describe how dynamic analysis (e.g., using a debugger) could be used to trace the execution of the WFC algorithm with malicious input and pinpoint the exact location of the infinite loop.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  We will evaluate the potential consequences of a successful infinite loop attack, considering resource exhaustion, application unavailability, and potential user impact.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  We will propose specific, actionable recommendations to prevent or mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.  These recommendations will cover both code-level changes to the library and best practices for application developers using the library.

### 4.1. Potential Vulnerabilities and Attack Vectors

Based on the structure of WFC algorithms and the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` implementation, here are the primary areas of concern:

*   **Contradiction Resolution Failure:** The core of the WFC algorithm involves iteratively reducing the possibilities (entropy) of each cell in the output grid.  If the algorithm encounters a contradiction (no valid tiles remain for a cell), it typically backtracks.  However, if the backtracking mechanism is flawed or if the input rules are inherently contradictory, the algorithm might get stuck in an infinite loop of contradiction and backtracking.
    *   **Malicious Adjacency Rules:**  The most likely attack vector.  An attacker could craft a set of adjacency rules that are impossible to satisfy.  For example:
        *   Tile A can only be next to Tile B.
        *   Tile B can only be next to Tile C.
        *   Tile C can only be next to Tile A.
        *   *No other tiles exist.*  This creates a closed loop with no valid starting point.
        *   More subtly, rules could be designed to create extremely long chains of dependencies that exhaust the backtracking stack or take an impractically long time to resolve.
    *   **Malformed Tile Definitions:**  Incorrectly defined tiles (e.g., missing rotations, inconsistent edge definitions) could lead to contradictions that the algorithm cannot resolve.
    *   **Edge Case Input Images (Overlapping Model):**  For the `OverlappingModel`, an input image could be crafted to contain patterns that, when combined with the adjacency rules, lead to unavoidable contradictions.  This is harder to achieve than manipulating adjacency rules directly but still possible.
    * **Weights manipulation:** If weights are extremely skewed, it can lead to a situation where the algorithm repeatedly selects and then rejects the same tiles, leading to a near-infinite loop or extremely slow progress.

*   **Backtracking Stack Overflow:**  The `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library likely uses recursion (either explicitly or implicitly through function calls) to implement backtracking.  If the algorithm needs to backtrack excessively due to a complex or contradictory input, this could lead to a stack overflow, effectively crashing the application (which, while not an *infinite* loop, is a form of denial of service).  This is more likely with very large output grids or deeply nested contradictions.

*   **Integer Overflow/Underflow (Less Likely):**  While less likely, it's theoretically possible that extremely large output dimensions or a very large number of tiles could lead to integer overflows or underflows in the indexing or counting logic within the algorithm.  This could potentially disrupt the termination conditions or cause unexpected behavior.

*   **Infinite Recursion in Helper Functions:**  It's crucial to examine any helper functions used for tasks like pattern matching, neighbor finding, or constraint propagation.  A bug in one of these functions could lead to infinite recursion, even if the main WFC loop is correctly implemented.

### 4.2. Code-Level Analysis (Conceptual Examples)

Let's consider some hypothetical code snippets and how they might be vulnerable (these are *not* direct excerpts from the library, but illustrative examples):

**Example 1: Contradiction Handling (Simplified)**

```python
def propagate_constraints(grid, x, y):
    possible_tiles = get_possible_tiles(grid, x, y)
    if not possible_tiles:
        # Contradiction! Backtrack.
        if not backtrack(grid):
            # Backtracking failed!  Infinite loop?
            while True:  # <--- VULNERABILITY
                pass
    else:
        grid[x][y] = choose_tile(possible_tiles)
        # ... propagate to neighbors ...

def backtrack(grid):
    # ... (implementation to revert changes) ...
    # ... (logic to find a previous decision point) ...
    # ... (return True if successful, False if no more backtracking possible) ...
    return False # <--- Always fails, leading to infinite loop
```

In this simplified example, if the `backtrack` function always returns `False` (perhaps due to a bug or a misconfiguration), the `propagate_constraints` function will enter an infinite loop.

**Example 2:  Overlapping Model Pattern Matching (Simplified)**

```python
def find_matching_patterns(input_image, pattern_size):
    patterns = []
    for y in range(input_image.height):
        for x in range(input_image.width):
            pattern = extract_pattern(input_image, x, y, pattern_size)
            if pattern not in patterns:
                patterns.append(pattern) # Potentially slow if many similar patterns
    return patterns

def extract_pattern(input_image, x, y, pattern_size):
  # ... logic to extract a pattern ...
  # Potential bug: incorrect boundary handling could lead to infinite recursion
  # if x or y goes out of bounds and wraps around incorrectly.
  if x < 0:
      x = input_image.width - 1 # Incorrect wrapping
  # ...
```
Here, an incorrect boundary condition in `extract_pattern` could cause it to call itself repeatedly with invalid indices, leading to infinite recursion.

**Example 3: Weight-Based Selection**
```python
def choose_tile(possible_tiles, weights):
    # ... logic to select a tile based on weights ...
    # If all weights are zero or negative, this might loop indefinitely
    # or raise an exception that isn't handled.
    total_weight = sum(weights.get(tile, 0) for tile in possible_tiles)
    if total_weight <= 0:
        # What happens here?  Should there be a fallback?
        return None # <--- Could lead to a contradiction later, and potentially a loop.
```
If the weights are manipulated such that no tile has a positive weight, the selection logic might fail, leading to a contradiction and potentially an infinite loop if the contradiction handling is not robust.

### 4.3. Fuzzing Strategy (Conceptual)

A fuzzing strategy would focus on generating inputs that stress the identified vulnerability points:

1.  **Adjacency Rule Fuzzer:**
    *   **Random Rule Generation:**  Generate random adjacency rules, varying the number of tiles and the density of connections.  Prioritize generating rules that create cycles or near-cycles.
    *   **Mutational Fuzzing:**  Start with a valid set of rules and introduce small, random changes (e.g., adding, removing, or modifying rules).
    *   **Grammar-Based Fuzzing:**  Define a grammar for adjacency rules and use it to generate syntactically valid but semantically contradictory rules.
2.  **Tile Set Fuzzer:**
    *   **Random Tile Generation:**  Generate tiles with random shapes and edge configurations.
    *   **Inconsistent Edge Definitions:**  Create tiles where the edges do not match up correctly (e.g., different colors or patterns on supposedly compatible edges).
3.  **Input Image Fuzzer (Overlapping Model):**
    *   **Random Noise:**  Generate images with random noise.
    *   **Repetitive Patterns:**  Create images with highly repetitive patterns that might lead to contradictions when combined with specific adjacency rules.
    *   **Edge Case Patterns:**  Design patterns that are specifically intended to create conflicts at the boundaries of the output grid.
4. **Weight Fuzzer:**
    * **Zero/Negative Weights:** Set all or most weights to zero or negative values.
    * **Extremely Large/Small Weights:** Use very large or very small weights to create imbalances.
    * **NaN/Infinity:** Introduce NaN (Not a Number) or Infinity values into the weights.
5. **Output Dimension Fuzzer:**
    * **Extremely Large Dimensions:** Test with very large output widths and heights.
    * **Zero/Negative Dimensions:** Test with invalid dimensions (zero or negative).

### 4.4. Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual)

Dynamic analysis would involve running the WFC algorithm with the generated fuzzed inputs and using a debugger to:

1.  **Set Breakpoints:**  Place breakpoints in the core WFC loop, the contradiction handling logic, and the backtracking functions.
2.  **Step Through Execution:**  Carefully step through the code to observe the state of the algorithm (e.g., the contents of the `grid`, the `possible_tiles` sets, the backtracking stack).
3.  **Inspect Variables:**  Examine the values of key variables to identify the point at which the algorithm enters an infinite loop or encounters a stack overflow.
4.  **Identify the Root Cause:**  Trace the execution path back from the point of failure to determine the specific input condition or code bug that triggered the problem.

### 4.5. Impact Assessment

A successful infinite loop attack would have the following impacts:

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact.  The application would become unresponsive, consuming CPU resources and potentially memory until it is terminated (either manually or by the operating system).
*   **Resource Exhaustion:**  The attack could exhaust server resources (CPU, memory, potentially disk space if logging is enabled), impacting other applications or users on the same system.
*   **Application Unavailability:**  Users would be unable to use the application's features that rely on the WFC algorithm.
*   **Potential Data Loss (Indirect):**  If the application does not handle the error gracefully, it might crash without saving data, leading to data loss for the user.
* **Reputational Damage:** A successful DoS attack could damage the reputation of the application and its developers.

### 4.6. Mitigation Recommendations

Here are concrete steps to mitigate the risk of infinite loops:

1.  **Input Validation:**
    *   **Adjacency Rule Validation:**  Implement rigorous validation of adjacency rules *before* running the WFC algorithm.  This should include:
        *   **Connectivity Checks:**  Ensure that the rules form a connected graph (i.e., it's possible to reach any tile from any other tile, directly or indirectly).  Use graph traversal algorithms (e.g., Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search) to detect disconnected components.
        *   **Cycle Detection:**  Detect and reject rule sets that contain unavoidable cycles (as described in the vulnerability section).
        *   **Rule Consistency Checks:**  Verify that rules are consistent with each other (e.g., if Tile A can be above Tile B, then Tile B must be allowed below Tile A).
    *   **Tile Set Validation:**  Ensure that tile definitions are consistent and complete (e.g., all edges are defined, rotations are handled correctly).
    *   **Input Image Validation (Overlapping Model):**  Validate the dimensions and format of the input image.  Consider limiting the complexity of input images (e.g., restricting the number of unique colors or patterns).
    *   **Weight Validation:**  Ensure that weights are within a valid range (e.g., positive and finite).  Provide a default weight if a tile is missing from the weights dictionary.
    * **Output Dimension Validation:**  Enforce reasonable limits on the output dimensions.  Reject excessively large or invalid dimensions.

2.  **Robust Contradiction Handling:**
    *   **Backtracking Limit:**  Implement a limit on the maximum number of backtracking steps.  If this limit is reached, the algorithm should terminate with an error, rather than continuing indefinitely.
    *   **Random Restart:**  If a contradiction is encountered, consider restarting the algorithm with a different random seed.  This can help to avoid getting stuck in local minima.
    *   **Early Termination:**  If the algorithm is taking an excessively long time to converge, consider terminating it with an error.  This can be based on a time limit or a limit on the number of iterations.

3.  **Code Hardening:**
    *   **Defensive Programming:**  Use assertions and checks to ensure that internal data structures are in a consistent state.  Handle potential exceptions (e.g., `IndexError`, `KeyError`) gracefully.
    *   **Integer Overflow/Underflow Protection:**  Use appropriate data types (e.g., `long` or `BigInteger` if necessary) to prevent integer overflows or underflows.  Check for potential overflows before performing arithmetic operations.
    *   **Recursion Depth Limit:** If recursion is used, consider implementing a recursion depth limit to prevent stack overflows.

4.  **Library Updates:**
    *   **Contribute to `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse`:**  If specific vulnerabilities are found in the library, consider contributing patches or opening issues on GitHub to address them.

5.  **Application-Level Handling:**
    *   **Error Handling:**  The application should handle potential errors from the WFC library gracefully.  This includes catching exceptions, logging errors, and providing informative feedback to the user.
    *   **Timeout Mechanism:**  Implement a timeout mechanism to prevent the application from hanging indefinitely if the WFC algorithm fails to terminate.
    *   **Asynchronous Execution:**  Consider running the WFC algorithm in a separate thread or process to prevent it from blocking the main application thread.

6. **Testing:**
    * **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests to specifically target the areas of concern, such as contradiction handling, backtracking, and pattern matching.
    * **Integration Tests:** Test the integration of the WFC library with the application, using a variety of valid and invalid inputs.
    * **Fuzz Testing:** Implement a fuzzer (as described above) to automatically generate a wide range of inputs and test the robustness of the algorithm.

By implementing these mitigation strategies, the risk of an infinite loop attack can be significantly reduced, making the application more secure and reliable.
