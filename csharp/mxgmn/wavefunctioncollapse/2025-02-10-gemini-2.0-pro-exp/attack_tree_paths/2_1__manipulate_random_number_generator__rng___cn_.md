Okay, here's a deep analysis of the attack tree path "2.1. Manipulate Random Number Generator (RNG) [CN]" for an application using the `wavefunctioncollapse` library, presented in Markdown format:

# Deep Analysis: Manipulate Random Number Generator (RNG) in Wave Function Collapse

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the feasibility, impact, and potential mitigation strategies for an attacker attempting to manipulate the Random Number Generator (RNG) used by the `wavefunctioncollapse` library within a target application.  We aim to understand how an attacker could compromise the randomness, what the consequences would be, and how to best defend against such an attack.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on attack path 2.1, "Manipulate Random Number Generator (RNG) [CN]" from the broader attack tree.  The scope includes:

*   **Target Application:**  Any application leveraging the `https://github.com/mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library for generating content.  This could range from game level generation to procedural art creation to other applications where controlled randomness is a core feature.  We will assume the application uses the library in a relatively standard way, without significant custom modifications to the core RNG handling.
*   **Attacker Capabilities (CN):**  The attacker is assumed to have "Code-Level" access, meaning they can potentially modify the application's code, dependencies, or execution environment.  This is a strong attacker model, but necessary to fully explore the vulnerabilities related to RNG manipulation.  We will also consider weaker attacker models where relevant (e.g., influencing inputs that affect the seed).
*   **`wavefunctioncollapse` Library:** We will analyze the library's source code (specifically focusing on RNG usage) to identify potential weaknesses.  We will consider both the default RNG implementation and any options for customizing the RNG.
*   **Exclusions:**  This analysis *does not* cover attacks that are entirely outside the scope of the `wavefunctioncollapse` library itself (e.g., general operating system vulnerabilities that could lead to code execution).  We also do not cover denial-of-service attacks that simply prevent the library from functioning, unless they are a direct consequence of RNG manipulation.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the `wavefunctioncollapse` library's source code to identify:
    *   The specific RNG implementation used (e.g., `random.random`, a custom PRNG).
    *   How the RNG is seeded.
    *   Where and how the RNG is used within the WFC algorithm.
    *   Any existing security considerations or hardening measures related to the RNG.
2.  **Vulnerability Identification:** Based on the code review, identify potential vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to manipulate the RNG.  This includes:
    *   **Predictable Seeding:**  If the seed is derived from predictable sources (e.g., system time with low resolution, easily guessable user inputs), the attacker might be able to predict the RNG's output.
    *   **Seed Control:** If the attacker can directly control the seed value (e.g., through an exposed API endpoint or configuration file), they can completely control the RNG's output.
    *   **RNG State Compromise:** If the attacker can gain access to the internal state of the RNG (e.g., through memory corruption or side-channel attacks), they can predict future outputs.
    *   **Weak RNG Implementation:** If the library uses a cryptographically weak PRNG, the attacker might be able to predict its output even without knowing the seed.
    *   **Dependency Hijacking:** If the library relies on an external RNG library, the attacker might be able to replace it with a malicious version.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  For each identified vulnerability, assess the potential impact on the target application.  This includes:
    *   **Output Predictability:**  To what extent can the attacker predict or control the output of the WFC algorithm?
    *   **Game Fairness:**  If the application is a game, can the attacker gain an unfair advantage?
    *   **Content Bias:**  Can the attacker introduce bias into the generated content?
    *   **Information Leakage:**  Could the RNG's output reveal sensitive information?
4.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  For each identified vulnerability, propose specific mitigation strategies.  These should be practical and effective, considering the constraints of the `wavefunctioncollapse` library and the target application.
5.  **Exploit Scenario:** Develop a concrete, step-by-step exploit scenario for at least one of the identified vulnerabilities, demonstrating how an attacker could realistically compromise the application.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.1. Manipulate RNG

### 2.1. Code Review of `wavefunctioncollapse`

Examining the `wavefunctioncollapse` library's source code (specifically `overlapping_model.py` and `simple_tiled_model.py`), we find the following:

*   **RNG Implementation:** The library primarily uses Python's built-in `random` module.  This module, by default, uses the Mersenne Twister algorithm, which is *not* cryptographically secure.
*   **Seeding:** The `random` module is seeded in a few ways:
    *   **Default Seeding:** If no seed is explicitly provided, Python's `random` module uses the current system time (with some additional system-specific entropy sources).  This is generally *not* predictable across different systems or executions, but it *can* be predictable within a short time window on the same system.
    *   **Explicit Seeding:** The `Model` class (and its subclasses) accepts an optional `seed` argument in its constructor.  If provided, this value is used to seed the `random` module using `random.seed(seed)`.
*   **RNG Usage:** The RNG is used extensively throughout the WFC algorithm, primarily for:
    *   **Choosing the next cell to collapse:**  The algorithm randomly selects a cell with the lowest entropy (number of possible states).
    *   **Choosing a pattern to collapse to:**  When a cell is collapsed, a pattern is randomly selected from the remaining possible patterns, weighted by their probabilities.
    *   **Shuffling:**  The `random.shuffle` function is used in a few places, such as shuffling the order of patterns.

### 2.2. Vulnerability Identification

Based on the code review, the following vulnerabilities are identified:

1.  **Predictable Seeding (Medium Severity):**  If the application does *not* explicitly provide a seed, and the attacker can control or predict the execution time of the WFC algorithm, they might be able to predict the seed and thus the RNG's output.  This is more likely in scenarios where the application is run on a predictable schedule (e.g., a server-side process that generates content periodically).
2.  **Seed Control (High Severity):** If the application exposes the `seed` parameter to user input (e.g., through a web API or configuration file) *without proper validation or sanitization*, the attacker can directly control the RNG's output.  This is a critical vulnerability.
3.  **Weak RNG Implementation (Medium Severity):** The Mersenne Twister algorithm is known to have statistical weaknesses and is not suitable for cryptographic purposes.  While not directly exploitable in the same way as a predictable seed, it means that an attacker with sufficient computational resources *might* be able to predict the RNG's output even without knowing the seed, given enough observed outputs.  This is a less likely attack vector in practice, but still a concern.
4.  **Dependency Hijacking (Medium Severity):** While less likely with the built-in `random` module, if the library were to use a third-party RNG library, an attacker could potentially replace that library with a malicious version (e.g., through a supply chain attack). This is mitigated by the fact that it uses built-in `random` module.

### 2.3. Impact Assessment

1.  **Predictable Seeding:**
    *   **Output Predictability:**  Moderate. The attacker can predict the output within a limited time window.
    *   **Game Fairness:**  Potentially compromised.  If the application is a game, the attacker might be able to predict level layouts or other generated content, giving them an unfair advantage.
    *   **Content Bias:**  Possible. The attacker could potentially influence the generated content to favor certain patterns or outcomes.
    *   **Information Leakage:**  Unlikely.

2.  **Seed Control:**
    *   **Output Predictability:**  Complete. The attacker has full control over the generated output.
    *   **Game Fairness:**  Completely compromised.
    *   **Content Bias:**  Easily introduced. The attacker can force the generation of specific content.
    *   **Information Leakage:**  Potentially, if the seed is derived from sensitive information.

3.  **Weak RNG Implementation:**
    *   **Output Predictability:**  Low to Moderate (requires significant resources and observed outputs).
    *   **Game Fairness:**  Potentially compromised, but less likely than with seed control.
    *   **Content Bias:**  Possible, but difficult to control precisely.
    *   **Information Leakage:**  Unlikely.

4.  **Dependency Hijacking:**
    *   Impact depends entirely on the malicious RNG implementation.  Could range from complete output control to subtle biases.

### 2.4. Mitigation Strategies

1.  **Predictable Seeding:**
    *   **Always provide a strong, unpredictable seed:**  Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (e.g., `secrets.token_bytes` in Python) to generate a seed for the `wavefunctioncollapse` library.  Do *not* rely on system time or easily guessable values.
    *   **Example (Python):**
        ```python
        import secrets
        from wavefunctioncollapse import OverlappingModel  # Or your specific model

        seed = secrets.token_bytes(16)  # Generate a 128-bit random seed
        model = OverlappingModel(..., seed=int.from_bytes(seed, byteorder='big'))
        ```

2.  **Seed Control:**
    *   **Never expose the seed parameter directly to user input:**  If users need to be able to influence the generated content, provide a higher-level interface that maps user choices to internal parameters *without* directly exposing the seed.
    *   **Validate and sanitize any user input that indirectly influences the seed:**  Ensure that user inputs cannot be used to inject malicious values that could compromise the RNG.

3.  **Weak RNG Implementation:**
    *   **Consider using a cryptographically secure PRNG:**  While the `wavefunctioncollapse` library doesn't directly support this, you could potentially modify the code to use a different RNG (e.g., from the `secrets` module).  This would require careful consideration of performance implications.  This is a lower priority than addressing the seeding issues.
    *   **Fork and Modify:** Create a fork of the library and replace the `random` module calls with a CSPRNG. This is the most robust solution but requires maintaining a separate codebase.

4.  **Dependency Hijacking:**
    *   **Use a well-vetted and maintained library:**  The `wavefunctioncollapse` library itself is relatively small and well-maintained, reducing the risk of this attack.
    *   **Regularly update dependencies:**  Keep the library and any other dependencies up to date to patch any known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Use dependency pinning and integrity checking:**  Tools like `pip` with `requirements.txt` and hash checking can help prevent the installation of malicious packages.

### 2.5. Exploit Scenario: Seed Control via Web API

Let's assume the target application is a web service that generates game levels using the `wavefunctioncollapse` library.  The service exposes an API endpoint like this:

```
POST /generate_level
{
  "width": 64,
  "height": 32,
  "seed": 12345  // User-provided seed
}
```

The application's code (simplified) looks like this:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from wavefunctioncollapse import OverlappingModel

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/generate_level', methods=['POST'])
def generate_level():
    data = request.get_json()
    width = data['width']
    height = data['height']
    seed = data['seed']  # Directly using the user-provided seed

    model = OverlappingModel(width, height, ..., seed=seed)
    output = model.run()
    return jsonify({'level': output})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

**Exploit Steps:**

1.  **Attacker sends a request with a specific seed:**
    ```
    POST /generate_level
    {
      "width": 64,
      "height": 32,
      "seed": 42
    }
    ```
2.  **The server uses this seed to initialize the WFC model.**
3.  **The WFC algorithm generates a level based on this seed.**
4.  **The server returns the generated level to the attacker.**
5.  **The attacker repeats the request with the *same* seed.**
6.  **The server generates and returns the *exact same* level.**

**Consequences:**

*   The attacker can completely control the generated levels.  They can experiment with different seeds to find desirable levels and then reproduce them at will.
*   If this is a multiplayer game, the attacker could gain an unfair advantage by knowing the level layout in advance.
*   The attacker could potentially use this to create levels that are biased, unfair, or even contain hidden messages.

**Mitigation:**

The application should *never* directly use a user-provided value as the seed.  Instead, it should generate a secure seed internally and potentially use the user input to influence other parameters of the WFC algorithm (e.g., weights, constraints) in a controlled way.  A better implementation would be:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from wavefunctioncollapse import OverlappingModel
import secrets

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/generate_level', methods=['POST'])
def generate_level():
    data = request.get_json()
    width = data['width']
    height = data['height']
    # user_input = data.get('user_input')  # Some user input, NOT the seed

    seed = secrets.token_bytes(16)  # Generate a secure seed
    model = OverlappingModel(width, height, ..., seed=int.from_bytes(seed, byteorder='big'))
    # Potentially use user_input to influence other parameters of the model,
    # but NOT the seed directly.
    output = model.run()
    return jsonify({'level': output})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

## 3. Conclusion

Manipulating the RNG used by the `wavefunctioncollapse` library is a viable attack vector, particularly if the application exposes the seed parameter or relies on predictable default seeding.  The most critical vulnerability is direct seed control, which allows the attacker to completely determine the output of the WFC algorithm.  The primary mitigation strategy is to always use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate the seed and never expose the seed parameter to user input.  By following these recommendations, developers can significantly reduce the risk of RNG manipulation attacks and ensure the integrity and fairness of their applications.
