# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.1.1.1. Exploit Weak Seed Generation or Storage [CN]

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the potential vulnerabilities related to seed generation and storage within the context of the `mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse` application, specifically focusing on how an attacker could exploit weaknesses in these areas to compromise the application's intended functionality or security.  We aim to identify specific attack vectors, assess their feasibility and impact, and propose mitigation strategies.  The "[CN]" designation likely indicates a "Compromise Node," meaning successful exploitation leads to a significant compromise.

## 2. Scope

This analysis is limited to the following:

*   **Target Application:** The `mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse` Go implementation found at [https://github.com/mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse](https://github.com/mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse).
*   **Attack Path:**  Specifically, attack path 2.1.1.1, "Exploit Weak Seed Generation or Storage [CN]".
*   **Code Review:**  Static analysis of the provided Go code.  We will not be performing dynamic analysis (running the code with various inputs) in this phase, although that would be a valuable follow-up.
*   **Assumptions:** We assume the attacker has some level of access to the system running the WFC application, potentially including:
    *   Ability to observe outputs of the WFC algorithm.
    *   Ability to read configuration files (if applicable).
    *   Potential access to memory or temporary files (depending on the specific attack vector).
    *   No direct access to modify the source code itself (that would be a different attack path).

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Examination:**  We will meticulously examine the `mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse` codebase, paying close attention to:
    *   How the random number generator (RNG) is seeded.
    *   Where and how the seed is stored (if at all).
    *   Any potential side-channel leaks of seed information.
    *   Dependencies related to random number generation.
2.  **Vulnerability Identification:** Based on the code examination, we will identify potential vulnerabilities related to weak seed generation or storage.  This will include considering common RNG weaknesses.
3.  **Attack Vector Description:** For each identified vulnerability, we will describe a plausible attack vector, outlining the steps an attacker might take.
4.  **Impact Assessment:** We will assess the potential impact of each attack vector, considering what an attacker could achieve by exploiting the vulnerability.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  We will propose specific mitigation strategies to address each identified vulnerability and reduce the risk of exploitation.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 2.1.1.1

Let's dive into the code analysis and vulnerability identification.

### 4.1 Code Examination

After reviewing the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` repository, several key areas related to seed generation and storage are identified:

*   **`NewModel` Function (and its variants):**  Most of the model creation functions (e.g., `NewOverlappingModel`, `NewSimpleTiledModel`) take a `seed` parameter of type `int64`. This is the primary mechanism for controlling the randomness.
*   **`rand.NewSource(seed)`:**  The `seed` value is used to create a new random number source using Go's standard library `rand.NewSource(seed)`. This source is then used to create a new `rand.Rand` instance.
*   **`rand.Seed()` (Implicit Default):** If a user *doesn't* provide a seed (e.g., by passing 0), Go's `rand` package uses a default seed.  Prior to Go 1.20, this default seed was a constant value (1), making the output completely predictable.  Go 1.20 and later automatically seeds the global `rand` source with a random value at program startup.  This is a *critical* distinction.
*   **No Explicit Seed Storage:** The code *doesn't* appear to store the seed value persistently anywhere after the `rand.Rand` instance is created.  This is generally good from a security perspective, as it reduces the attack surface.
* **math/rand vs crypto/rand:** The code uses `math/rand`, which is *not* cryptographically secure. This is a crucial point.

### 4.2 Vulnerability Identification

Based on the code examination, the following vulnerabilities are identified:

*   **Vulnerability 1: Predictable Output with Default Seed (Pre-Go 1.20):** If the application is compiled and run with a Go version *prior* to 1.20, and the user does *not* explicitly provide a seed, the output of the WFC algorithm will be *identical* every time the program runs.  This is because the global `rand` instance will be seeded with the constant value 1.

*   **Vulnerability 2: Predictable Output with User-Supplied Weak Seed:** If the user provides a seed, but that seed is easily guessable (e.g., a small integer, a timestamp with low resolution, a common word), an attacker could potentially brute-force the seed value by trying different seeds and comparing the outputs.

*   **Vulnerability 3:  Non-Cryptographic RNG:** The use of `math/rand` means that even with a strong seed, the generated random numbers are not suitable for security-sensitive applications.  While WFC is often used for procedural generation (not inherently security-sensitive), if the output is used in a context where unpredictability is *required* for security, this is a vulnerability.  For example, if the WFC output were used to generate keys, passwords, or nonces, this would be a major flaw.

*   **Vulnerability 4:  Seed Recovery via Side Channels (Theoretical):** Although the seed itself isn't stored, it's theoretically possible that information about the seed could leak through side channels.  Examples include:
    *   **Timing Attacks:**  If the execution time of the WFC algorithm depends significantly on the seed value, an attacker might be able to infer information about the seed by measuring execution times. This is unlikely to be a practical attack in this specific case, but it's worth mentioning.
    *   **Memory Analysis:** If the seed value remains in memory for an extended period, a sophisticated attacker with memory access might be able to recover it.  This is also unlikely, as the seed is likely to be overwritten quickly.

### 4.3 Attack Vector Description

Here are example attack vectors for the identified vulnerabilities:

*   **Attack Vector 1 (Predictable Default Seed):**
    1.  Attacker obtains a copy of the compiled application (built with Go < 1.20).
    2.  Attacker runs the application without providing a seed.
    3.  Attacker observes the output.
    4.  Attacker now knows the *exact* output that will be generated every time the application is run without a seed on a similar system.

*   **Attack Vector 2 (Brute-Force Weak Seed):**
    1.  Attacker observes *some* output from the WFC application, knowing that a user-supplied seed was used.
    2.  Attacker suspects the user used a weak seed (e.g., a timestamp).
    3.  Attacker writes a script to run the WFC application repeatedly with different candidate seeds (e.g., a range of timestamps).
    4.  Attacker compares the output of their script with the observed output.
    5.  If a match is found, the attacker has recovered the seed.

*   **Attack Vector 3 (Non-Cryptographic RNG - Hypothetical):**
    1.  Assume the WFC output is (incorrectly) used to generate a cryptographic key.
    2.  Attacker knows the algorithm used and that `math/rand` is the source of randomness.
    3.  Attacker uses techniques for predicting `math/rand` output (which are well-studied) to significantly reduce the keyspace they need to search.
    4.  Attacker brute-forces the remaining possibilities, potentially recovering the key.

### 4.4 Impact Assessment

The impact of these vulnerabilities varies:

*   **Predictable Default Seed (Pre-Go 1.20):**  The impact is high if the application relies on the WFC output being unpredictable.  The attacker can completely control the output.
*   **Brute-Force Weak Seed:** The impact depends on the strength of the seed and the computational resources available to the attacker.  If the seed is very weak, the impact is high.
*   **Non-Cryptographic RNG:**  The impact is *extremely high* if the output is used in a security-sensitive context.  It completely undermines the security of that context.
*   **Side-Channel Attacks:** The impact is likely low in practice, but could be high in specific, contrived scenarios.

### 4.5 Mitigation Recommendations

Here are the recommended mitigations:

*   **Mitigation 1 (Always Require Explicit Seed):**  Modify the application code to *require* the user to provide a seed.  Do not allow a default seed to be used.  This forces the user to make a conscious decision about the seed.

*   **Mitigation 2 (Seed Strength Guidance):**  Provide clear documentation and guidance to users on how to choose a strong seed.  Recommend using a large, randomly generated number (e.g., from `/dev/urandom` on Unix-like systems, or using Go's `crypto/rand` package).

*   **Mitigation 3 (Use `crypto/rand` if Security is Required):** If the WFC output *is* used in a security-sensitive context, *replace* `math/rand` with `crypto/rand`.  This is crucial for any application where unpredictability is essential for security.  For example:

    ```go
    import (
        "crypto/rand"
        "encoding/binary"
    	"math/rand"
    )

    func generateSecureSeed() int64 {
        var seed int64
        err := binary.Read(rand.Reader, binary.BigEndian, &seed)
        if err != nil {
            // Handle the error appropriately.  In a real application,
            // you might want to panic or return an error.
            panic(err)
        }
        return seed
    }

    // ... later, in your model creation function ...
    // seed := generateSecureSeed() // Use this instead of user-provided seed
    // source := rand.NewSource(seed)
    // rnd := rand.New(source)
    ```

*   **Mitigation 4 (Consider Seed Hashing):**  If you want to allow users to provide seeds that might be easier to remember (e.g., passphrases), consider hashing the user-provided seed with a strong cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256) *before* using it to seed the RNG.  This makes brute-force attacks more difficult.

*   **Mitigation 5 (Go Version Check):** Add a check at the start of the application to ensure it's being run with Go 1.20 or later. If not, print a warning message or exit.

    ```go
    import (
        "fmt"
        "runtime"
        "strconv"
        "strings"
    )

    func checkGoVersion() {
        version := runtime.Version()
        if strings.HasPrefix(version, "go") {
            versionParts := strings.Split(version[2:], ".")
            if len(versionParts) >= 2 {
                major, _ := strconv.Atoi(versionParts[0])
                minor, _ := strconv.Atoi(versionParts[1])
                if major < 1 || (major == 1 && minor < 20) {
                    fmt.Println("WARNING: This application should be run with Go 1.20 or later for improved security.")
                    fmt.Println("The default random number generator seed is predictable in older Go versions.")
                    // Consider exiting here: os.Exit(1)
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```
* **Mitigation 6 (Input Validation):** If user is providing seed, validate that input is of correct type (int64).

By implementing these mitigations, the risk of exploiting weak seed generation or storage in the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` application can be significantly reduced. The most important mitigations are to require a strong, explicit seed and to use `crypto/rand` if the output is used in any security-sensitive context.
