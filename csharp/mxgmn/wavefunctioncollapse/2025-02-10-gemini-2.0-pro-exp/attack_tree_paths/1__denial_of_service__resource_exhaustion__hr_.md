# Deep Analysis: Denial of Service / Resource Exhaustion of WFC Algorithm

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the feasibility and potential impact of a Denial of Service (DoS) attack targeting the resource consumption of the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm, specifically as implemented in the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` GitHub repository.  We aim to identify specific vulnerabilities and propose mitigation strategies.  This analysis focuses on preventing the application from becoming unresponsive due to excessive resource utilization triggered by malicious input or configurations.

## 2. Scope

This analysis is limited to the following:

*   **Target Implementation:** The `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` repository on GitHub (https://github.com/mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse).  We will consider the core algorithm, example implementations, and any provided utilities.  We will *not* analyze specific application deployments *unless* they directly expose the WFC algorithm's parameters to untrusted input.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Denial of Service through resource exhaustion.  We will focus on CPU and memory consumption.  We will *not* analyze network-based DoS attacks, distributed DoS (DDoS), or attacks targeting other system components outside the WFC algorithm itself.
*   **Input Manipulation:**  We will consider how malicious actors might craft input data (e.g., sample images, constraint rules, output dimensions) to trigger excessive resource usage.
*   **Configuration Exploitation:** We will examine how attackers might manipulate configuration parameters (e.g., `N`, `width`, `height`, `periodicInput`, `periodicOutput`, `symmetry`, `ground`) to cause resource exhaustion.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review:**  A thorough examination of the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` codebase, focusing on:
    *   Loop structures and recursion: Identifying potential infinite loops or excessive recursion depths.
    *   Memory allocation:  Analyzing how memory is allocated and deallocated, looking for potential memory leaks or unbounded memory growth.
    *   Data structure usage:  Evaluating the efficiency of data structures used to represent the wave, tiles, and constraints.
    *   Constraint propagation logic:  Examining the complexity and potential for exponential behavior in the constraint propagation mechanism.
    *   Input validation: Checking for the presence and effectiveness of input validation to prevent malicious input.

2.  **Static Analysis:**  Using static analysis tools (if applicable and available for the language used in the repository - primarily C#) to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities, such as:
    *   Unbounded loops
    *   Memory leaks
    *   Resource exhaustion vulnerabilities

3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing/Targeted Testing):**  Developing and executing targeted tests and fuzzing campaigns to:
    *   Provide a wide range of input images, including edge cases and potentially problematic patterns.
    *   Vary configuration parameters to extreme values (very large dimensions, high symmetry, complex constraints).
    *   Monitor CPU and memory usage during execution to identify resource spikes and potential exhaustion scenarios.
    *   Specifically test for scenarios that lead to contradictions and backtracking, as these can be computationally expensive.

4.  **Worst-Case Complexity Analysis:**  Attempting to determine the theoretical worst-case time and space complexity of the algorithm, considering different input parameters and configurations.  This will help identify scenarios that could lead to exponential behavior.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Denial of Service / Resource Exhaustion

**Attack Path:**  Denial of Service / Resource Exhaustion [HR]

**Description:** The attacker aims to cause the WFC algorithm to run indefinitely, consuming resources and preventing the application from functioning.

**4.1 Potential Vulnerabilities and Exploitation Scenarios:**

Based on the nature of the WFC algorithm and the likely implementation, several potential vulnerabilities could lead to resource exhaustion:

*   **4.1.1  Unsolvable Configurations (Infinite Loop/Excessive Backtracking):**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  The core of the WFC algorithm involves iteratively propagating constraints and resolving contradictions.  If the input image and constraints are designed such that no valid solution exists, or if the constraints are overly restrictive, the algorithm might enter a state of continuous backtracking and constraint propagation, never reaching a solution or a definitive failure state.  This can lead to an effective infinite loop, consuming CPU and potentially memory.
    *   **Exploitation:**  An attacker could craft a malicious input image with carefully placed patterns and combine it with restrictive constraints (e.g., requiring specific tile adjacencies that are impossible to satisfy globally).  They could also manipulate the `symmetry` parameter to create conflicting requirements.
    *   **Example (Conceptual):**  Imagine an input image with two tiles, A and B.  The attacker sets constraints such that A can only be next to B, and B can only be next to A.  However, they also introduce a third tile, C, which cannot be adjacent to either A or B.  If the output grid is large enough, the algorithm might spend an excessive amount of time trying to find a solution that doesn't exist.

*   **4.1.2  Exponential Backtracking:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Even if a solution *does* exist, a poorly designed input or overly complex constraints can lead to a combinatorial explosion in the number of backtracking steps required.  The algorithm might explore a vast number of invalid configurations before finding a valid one.
    *   **Exploitation:**  Similar to the unsolvable configuration scenario, the attacker crafts an input that forces the algorithm to explore a large search space.  This might involve creating many small, conflicting patterns or using a high degree of symmetry with complex constraints.
    *   **Example (Conceptual):**  An input image with many small, disconnected regions, each with its own set of allowed tiles, could force the algorithm to try many combinations before finding a globally consistent solution.

*   **4.1.3  Large Output Dimensions:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  The memory required to store the wave (the superposition of possible tiles at each location) scales with the output dimensions (`width` and `height`).  Very large output dimensions can lead to excessive memory allocation, potentially exceeding available RAM and causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.
    *   **Exploitation:**  An attacker could provide extremely large values for `width` and `height`, forcing the algorithm to allocate a massive array.
    *   **Example (Conceptual):**  Setting `width` and `height` to values in the tens of thousands or higher could easily exhaust available memory on many systems.

*   **4.1.4  High Tile Count and Complexity:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  A large number of distinct tiles and complex adjacency rules increase the computational cost of constraint propagation and backtracking.
    *   **Exploitation:** The attacker provides an input image with a very high number of unique tiles, each with many complex adjacency rules.
    *   **Example (Conceptual):** An input image with hundreds or thousands of distinct tiles, each with specific rules about which tiles can be placed next to it, would significantly increase the computational burden.

*   **4.1.5  Memory Leaks (Implementation-Specific):**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  If the implementation has memory leaks (e.g., failing to release memory allocated for temporary data structures during backtracking), repeated attempts to generate an output, or even a single attempt with a difficult configuration, could gradually consume all available memory.
    *   **Exploitation:** This is less about a specific input and more about a flaw in the code.  However, an attacker could trigger this by repeatedly submitting requests with configurations that cause significant backtracking.
    *   **Example (Conceptual):** If memory allocated for storing a partial solution during backtracking is not properly released when that branch of the search is abandoned, the memory usage will steadily increase.

* **4.1.6 Periodic Input with Incompatible Constraints:**
    * **Vulnerability:** If `periodicInput` is set to `true`, the input image is treated as tiling. If the input image has inherent contradictions when tiled, this could lead to an unsolvable configuration.
    * **Exploitation:** The attacker provides an input image that, when tiled, creates impossible adjacencies.
    * **Example (Conceptual):** An input image where the left edge cannot be adjacent to the right edge, but `periodicInput` is `true`.

* **4.1.7 Ground Parameter Misuse:**
    * **Vulnerability:** The `ground` parameter specifies a specific tile to be used on the bottom edge. If this tile is incompatible with the rest of the input image or constraints, it could lead to an unsolvable configuration.
    * **Exploitation:** The attacker sets the `ground` parameter to a tile that cannot be legally placed adjacent to any other tiles in the input image, given the constraints.

**4.2 Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **4.2.1  Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Strict Size Limits:**  Impose strict limits on the `width` and `height` parameters to prevent excessively large output grids.  These limits should be based on the available system resources and the expected use cases.
    *   **Tile Count Limits:**  Limit the number of distinct tiles allowed in the input image.
    *   **Constraint Complexity Limits:**  Potentially limit the complexity of adjacency rules (e.g., the number of allowed neighbors for each tile). This is more difficult to implement effectively.
    *   **Input Image Analysis:**  Before starting the WFC algorithm, analyze the input image and constraints to detect potential contradictions or inconsistencies.  This could involve checking for basic tile compatibility and ensuring that the constraints are not inherently unsolvable. This is a complex task, but even simple checks can help.

*   **4.2.2  Timeout Mechanism:**
    *   **Iteration/Time Limits:**  Implement a timeout mechanism that limits the maximum number of iterations or the maximum execution time of the WFC algorithm.  If the algorithm exceeds this limit, it should terminate and return an error, indicating that a solution could not be found within the allowed time. This is crucial for preventing infinite loops and excessive backtracking.

*   **4.2.3  Resource Monitoring and Throttling:**
    *   **Memory Usage Monitoring:**  Monitor the memory usage of the algorithm during execution.  If memory usage exceeds a predefined threshold, terminate the algorithm and return an error.
    *   **CPU Usage Monitoring:** Monitor CPU usage. While less precise than memory monitoring, excessive CPU usage over a period can indicate a runaway process.

*   **4.2.4  Progressive Generation (If Applicable):**
    *   **Partial Solutions:**  If possible, modify the algorithm to generate partial solutions or to provide feedback on its progress.  This can help users identify if the algorithm is stuck or making slow progress.

*   **4.2.5  Code Optimization:**
    *   **Efficient Data Structures:**  Use efficient data structures for representing the wave, tiles, and constraints.  For example, use sparse matrices or sets to represent adjacency rules efficiently.
    *   **Optimized Constraint Propagation:**  Optimize the constraint propagation logic to minimize redundant computations and unnecessary backtracking.
    *   **Memory Management:**  Ensure that memory is allocated and deallocated efficiently, avoiding memory leaks.

*   **4.2.6  Configuration Hardening:**
    * **Default Safe Values:** Set default values for configuration parameters (e.g., `N`, `width`, `height`, `symmetry`) that are known to be safe and unlikely to cause resource exhaustion.
    * **Restrict User Input:** If the application exposes these parameters to users, provide clear guidance and warnings about the potential impact of extreme values. Consider using sliders or dropdown menus to limit the range of possible values.

* **4.2.7  Fuzzing and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Regular Testing:** Regularly conduct fuzzing and penetration testing to identify new vulnerabilities and ensure the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.

## 5. Conclusion

The Wave Function Collapse algorithm, while powerful, is susceptible to Denial of Service attacks through resource exhaustion.  By carefully crafting input data and manipulating configuration parameters, attackers can cause the algorithm to consume excessive CPU and memory, leading to application unresponsiveness or crashes.  The mitigation strategies outlined above, including input validation, timeouts, resource monitoring, and code optimization, are essential for building a robust and secure implementation of the WFC algorithm.  Regular security testing is crucial to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of these defenses.
