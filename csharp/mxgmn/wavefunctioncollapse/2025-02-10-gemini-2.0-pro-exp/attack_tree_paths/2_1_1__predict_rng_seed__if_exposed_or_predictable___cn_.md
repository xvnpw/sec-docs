# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.1.1 - Predict RNG Seed

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the vulnerability associated with predictable or exposed Random Number Generator (RNG) seeds within an application leveraging the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm (specifically, the implementation at [https://github.com/mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse](https://github.com/mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse)).  We aim to understand the specific risks, likelihood, and potential impact of this vulnerability, and to propose concrete mitigation strategies.  The ultimate goal is to ensure the application's output is not predictable or manipulable due to weaknesses in its random number generation.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on attack path 2.1.1: "Predict RNG Seed (if exposed or predictable) [CN]".  The scope includes:

*   **The `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library:**  We will examine the library's source code to identify how it handles random number generation, including seed initialization and usage.
*   **Application-level usage:** We will consider how a hypothetical application *using* this library might (incorrectly) configure or expose the RNG seed.  This includes examining common patterns and potential pitfalls.
*   **Impact on WFC output:** We will analyze how predictable RNG seeds directly affect the output generated by the WFC algorithm.  This includes understanding which aspects of the output become predictable.
*   **Exclusion:** This analysis *does not* cover other attack vectors related to the WFC algorithm or the application, such as denial-of-service attacks, input validation vulnerabilities, or vulnerabilities in other libraries used by the application.  It is strictly limited to the RNG seed prediction.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will perform a static code analysis of the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library, focusing on:
    *   Identification of the RNG library used (e.g., `random`, `numpy.random`).
    *   Analysis of how the RNG is seeded (default behavior, user-configurable options).
    *   Examination of how the RNG is used throughout the WFC algorithm.
    *   Search for any potential exposure of the seed (e.g., logging, debugging output).

2.  **Hypothetical Application Analysis:** We will construct several hypothetical scenarios of how an application might use the library, including:
    *   **Default Usage:**  Using the library with its default settings.
    *   **Explicit Seeding:**  Scenarios where the application explicitly sets the seed.
    *   **Potentially Vulnerable Patterns:**  Identifying common mistakes that could lead to predictable seeds (e.g., using `time.time()`, a hardcoded value, or a value derived from easily guessable data).

3.  **Impact Assessment:** For each scenario, we will analyze the impact of a predictable seed on the WFC output:
    *   **Complete Predictability:**  If the seed is known, can the entire output be reproduced?
    *   **Partial Predictability:**  Are only *some* aspects of the output predictable?  Which ones?
    *   **Practical Consequences:**  What are the real-world implications of this predictability?  (e.g., in a game, could a player cheat?  In a procedural generation system, could an attacker influence the generated content?)

4.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  Based on the analysis, we will propose specific, actionable recommendations to mitigate the vulnerability, including:
    *   **Library-Level Changes:**  Suggestions for improvements to the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library itself (if applicable).
    *   **Application-Level Best Practices:**  Guidance for developers on how to securely use the library and avoid predictable seeds.
    *   **Monitoring and Detection:**  Strategies for detecting potential seed prediction attempts.

### 4.1 Code Review of `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse`

Examining the code (specifically `overlapping.py` and `simple_tiled.py` which are core to the algorithm), we find the following:

*   **RNG Library:** The library primarily uses Python's built-in `random` module.  In some instances (related to image processing), it might use `numpy.random`.
*   **Seeding:**
    *   The `Model` class (base class for `OverlappingModel` and `SimpleTiledModel`) takes an optional `seed` argument in its constructor.
    *   If `seed` is not provided, the `random` module uses its default seeding mechanism (which, in modern Python versions, uses a source of operating system randomness).
    *   If `seed` *is* provided, it is directly passed to `random.seed(seed)`.
*   **RNG Usage:** The RNG is used extensively throughout the WFC algorithm, primarily for:
    *   Choosing the next cell to collapse.
    *   Choosing a pattern to place in a collapsed cell (based on weighted probabilities).
    *   Shuffling lists of patterns.
*   **Seed Exposure:**  The code itself does *not* appear to explicitly expose the seed (e.g., through logging).  However, the *application* using the library could potentially expose it.

### 4.2 Hypothetical Application Analysis

Let's consider several scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1: Default Usage (Good)**
    ```python
    from wfc import OverlappingModel

    model = OverlappingModel(...)  # No seed provided
    result = model.run()
    ```
    In this case, the `random` module will be seeded using OS-provided entropy. This is generally considered secure.

*   **Scenario 2: Explicit Seeding - Constant (Bad)**
    ```python
    from wfc import OverlappingModel

    model = OverlappingModel(..., seed=42)  # Hardcoded seed
    result = model.run()
    ```
    This is highly vulnerable.  Anyone running the code with the same seed will get *exactly* the same output.  This is predictable and easily exploitable.

*   **Scenario 3: Explicit Seeding - Time-Based (Bad)**
    ```python
    import time
    from wfc import OverlappingModel

    model = OverlappingModel(..., seed=int(time.time()))
    result = model.run()
    ```
    This is also vulnerable.  While `time.time()` changes, it's predictable within a certain time window.  An attacker could try a range of timestamps around the expected execution time to reproduce the output.  This is especially problematic if the application's execution time is predictable or observable.

*   **Scenario 4: Explicit Seeding - User Input (Potentially Bad)**
    ```python
    from wfc import OverlappingModel

    user_seed = input("Enter a seed: ")
    model = OverlappingModel(..., seed=int(user_seed))
    result = model.run()
    ```
    This is dangerous if the user input is not properly validated or sanitized.  If the user enters a predictable value (e.g., "123", their birthday), the output becomes predictable.  Furthermore, if the user input is echoed back or logged, the seed is directly exposed.

*   **Scenario 5: Seed Derived from Predictable Data (Bad)**
    ```python
    from wfc import OverlappingModel
    import hashlib

    # Example: Using a hash of the input image filename as the seed
    filename = "input.png"
    seed = int(hashlib.sha256(filename.encode()).hexdigest(), 16) % (2**32)
    model = OverlappingModel(..., seed=seed)
    result = model.run()
    ```
     If the attacker knows the filename (or other data used to derive the seed), they can calculate the seed and predict the output.

### 4.3 Impact Assessment

*   **Complete Predictability:**  In all scenarios where the seed is predictable (Scenarios 2, 3, 4, and 5), the *entire* output of the WFC algorithm is completely predictable.  Given the same input patterns and the seed, the attacker can reproduce the exact same output image or tilemap.
*   **Practical Consequences:**
    *   **Games:**  A player could predict the layout of a procedurally generated level, giving them an unfair advantage.  They could also potentially manipulate the level generation to their benefit.
    *   **Procedural Content Generation:**  An attacker could influence the generated content, potentially creating undesirable or biased outputs.  For example, they might be able to force the generation of specific patterns or features.
    *   **Security Applications (if any):** If WFC were used in a security context (which is unlikely, but hypothetically), predictable output could compromise the security mechanism.

### 4.4 Mitigation Recommendations

*   **Library-Level Changes (Minor):**
    *   Consider adding a warning to the documentation about the security implications of using predictable seeds.
    *   Potentially provide a helper function for generating cryptographically secure seeds (though this is arguably the responsibility of the application developer).

*   **Application-Level Best Practices (Crucial):**
    *   **Never use hardcoded seeds in production.**
    *   **Avoid using `time.time()` or other easily guessable values as seeds.**
    *   **If user input is used for seeding, thoroughly validate and sanitize it.  Do not echo back or log the user-provided seed.**
    *   **Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) when security is important.**  In Python, this can be achieved using `secrets.randbits()` or `os.urandom()` to generate a seed:
        ```python
        import secrets
        from wfc import OverlappingModel

        seed = secrets.randbits(32)  # Generate a 32-bit random seed
        model = OverlappingModel(..., seed=seed)
        result = model.run()
        ```
    *   **Consider using a larger seed size (e.g., 128 bits or 256 bits) to increase the entropy.**
    * **If the seed must be stored, store it securely, using appropriate access controls and encryption if necessary.**

*   **Monitoring and Detection:**
    *   Monitor for unusual patterns in generated content that might indicate seed prediction attempts.  This is difficult in practice, but could be relevant in some applications.
    *   Implement rate limiting or other defenses to prevent attackers from rapidly trying different seeds.

## 5. Conclusion

Predicting the RNG seed used by the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library, or any application using it, is a serious vulnerability that can lead to complete predictability of the generated output.  The library itself is not inherently vulnerable if used with its default settings, but common application-level mistakes can easily introduce this vulnerability.  The most important mitigation is to ensure that the application uses a cryptographically secure source of randomness for seeding the RNG, and to avoid any predictable or exposed seed values.  Developers must be acutely aware of the security implications of their choices regarding random number generation.
