Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Bias Output Distribution" attack path from an attack tree targeting an application using the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm (specifically, the implementation at https://github.com/mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse).

## Deep Analysis: Bias Output Distribution (Attack Path 2.3)

### 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly understand the vulnerabilities, potential attack vectors, and mitigation strategies related to an attacker intentionally biasing the output distribution of a WFC-based application.  This means understanding *how* an attacker could manipulate the system to produce outputs that favor certain patterns, tiles, or overall configurations, deviating from the intended, statistically balanced output distribution expected from a properly configured WFC algorithm.  The goal is to identify weaknesses that could lead to predictable, exploitable, or otherwise undesirable outcomes.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on the following aspects:

*   **WFC Algorithm Implementation:**  We'll primarily consider the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` implementation, but general WFC principles will also be relevant.
*   **Input Manipulation:**  How an attacker might modify the inputs to the WFC algorithm to achieve biased outputs. This includes the sample image, constraints, and any configuration parameters.
*   **Code-Level Vulnerabilities:**  Potential bugs or weaknesses in the WFC implementation itself that could be exploited to influence the output.
*   **Application Context:**  We'll consider how biasing the output might be used in different application scenarios (e.g., game level generation, image synthesis, texture creation).  The specific impact and exploitability depend heavily on how the WFC output is *used*.
*   **Exclusion:** We will *not* focus on attacks that are unrelated to the WFC algorithm itself (e.g., general denial-of-service attacks against the server hosting the application). We are specifically interested in manipulating the *probabilistic nature* of WFC.

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Understanding the WFC Algorithm:**  A brief review of the core principles of WFC to establish a baseline understanding.
2.  **Input Analysis:**  Detailed examination of how each input parameter to the WFC algorithm affects the output distribution.
3.  **Vulnerability Identification:**  Identification of potential attack vectors based on input manipulation and code-level weaknesses.
4.  **Exploit Scenarios:**  Hypothetical examples of how an attacker might exploit these vulnerabilities in real-world applications.
5.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  Recommendations for preventing or mitigating the identified vulnerabilities.
6.  **Code Review (Targeted):**  A focused review of specific parts of the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` code related to the identified vulnerabilities.

### 4. Deep Analysis

#### 4.1. Understanding the WFC Algorithm (Brief Review)

The Wave Function Collapse algorithm is a constraint-based algorithm inspired by quantum mechanics.  It works by:

1.  **Initialization:**  Starting with a grid (the "output") where each cell ("tile") can potentially be any of the possible tiles from the input sample.  Each tile has a "superposition" of states (possible tiles).
2.  **Observation:**  Selecting a tile with the lowest "entropy" (the fewest remaining possibilities).  This is often a tile with the fewest possible tile options remaining.
3.  **Collapse:**  Randomly choosing one of the remaining possible tiles for the observed cell, based on the weights derived from the input sample.  This "collapses" the superposition to a single state.
4.  **Propagation:**  Updating the possibilities of neighboring tiles based on the constraints defined by the chosen tile and the adjacency rules learned from the input sample.  This reduces the entropy of neighboring tiles.
5.  **Iteration:**  Repeating steps 2-4 until all tiles have been collapsed (or a contradiction is reached, requiring backtracking or restarting).

The key to understanding bias is that the probabilities at the "Collapse" step, and the constraints enforced during "Propagation," are *entirely derived from the input sample*.

#### 4.2. Input Analysis

The `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` implementation (and WFC in general) has several key inputs that an attacker could manipulate:

*   **Input Sample Image:** This is the *primary* source of bias.  The algorithm learns the frequency of tile occurrences and adjacency rules from this image.
    *   **Tile Frequencies:**  If certain tiles appear more frequently in the input sample, they will be more likely to be chosen during the collapse step.  An attacker could create a sample image where a desired tile is overwhelmingly present.
    *   **Adjacency Rules:**  The algorithm learns which tiles can be placed next to each other based on the input sample.  An attacker could craft a sample where a desired tile is *always* adjacent to another specific tile, forcing that combination to appear frequently.
    *   **Edge Cases:**  The way the algorithm handles the edges of the input sample can be manipulated.  For example, if a specific tile only appears at the edge of the input sample, the algorithm might learn that it *only* belongs at the edge of the output.
    *   **Subtle Patterns:** Even seemingly minor variations in the input sample can have a significant impact on the output distribution, especially over large output grids.  An attacker could introduce subtle, repeating patterns that are not immediately obvious but bias the overall output.

*   **`width` and `height` (Output Dimensions):** While not directly biasing the *tile* distribution, these parameters can influence the *overall structure* of the output.  For example, a very narrow output might force certain patterns to be repeated horizontally.

*   **`N` (Tile Size):**  This parameter determines the size of the tiles extracted from the input sample.  A larger `N` captures more complex relationships but can also make the algorithm more sensitive to small variations in the input.

*   **`periodicInput`:**  This boolean determines whether the input sample is treated as periodic (wrapping around at the edges).  Manipulating this can affect the learned adjacency rules, especially near the edges of the output.

*   **`periodicOutput`:**  This boolean determines whether the output is treated as periodic.  If set to `true`, the algorithm will try to ensure that the output wraps around seamlessly.  An attacker might try to create an input sample that is *impossible* to make periodic, leading to contradictions or unexpected behavior.

*   **`symmetry`:** This parameter controls how many rotated and flipped versions of each tile are considered.  An attacker might try to exploit asymmetries in the input sample to bias the output.

*   **`ground`:** This parameter (specific to the `OverlappingModel`) allows specifying a "ground" level, influencing the vertical distribution of tiles.  An attacker could manipulate this to force certain tiles to appear at the bottom of the output.

*   **`limit`:** While primarily for performance, setting a low iteration `limit` could prematurely terminate the algorithm, potentially leading to a biased, incomplete output.

#### 4.3. Vulnerability Identification

Based on the input analysis, here are some potential attack vectors:

*   **V1: Dominant Tile Injection:**  Creating an input sample where a specific tile (or a small set of tiles) is overwhelmingly dominant, forcing it to appear much more frequently than other tiles in the output.
*   **V2: Forced Adjacency Manipulation:**  Crafting an input sample where specific tile combinations are forced to appear together, creating predictable patterns in the output.
*   **V3: Edge Constraint Exploitation:**  Manipulating the edges of the input sample to influence the placement of tiles at the edges of the output, potentially creating a "frame" of a specific tile.
*   **V4: Periodicity Contradiction:**  Creating an input sample that is inherently non-periodic, but setting `periodicOutput` to `true`, leading to contradictions and potentially biased or incomplete outputs.
*   **V5: Symmetry Exploitation:**  Using an asymmetric input sample and manipulating the `symmetry` parameter to create predictable biases in the output orientation.
*   **V6: Ground Level Manipulation:** (OverlappingModel only)  Using the `ground` parameter to force specific tiles to appear at the bottom of the output, creating an uneven vertical distribution.
*   **V7: Iteration Limit Exhaustion:** Setting a low `limit` and crafting an input that requires many iterations, leading to a biased, incomplete output.
*   **V8: Code-Level Bugs (Hypothetical):**
    *   **Incorrect Probability Calculation:**  A bug in the code that calculates the probabilities during the collapse step could lead to biased tile selection.
    *   **Constraint Enforcement Errors:**  A bug in the constraint propagation logic could allow invalid tile combinations to occur, or prevent valid combinations, leading to bias.
    *   **Random Number Generator Bias:** If the random number generator used for tile selection is not truly random (or has a predictable seed), the output could be biased.
    *   **Integer Overflow/Underflow:** In extreme cases, very large or very small weights (derived from the input sample) could lead to integer overflow or underflow, causing unexpected behavior.

#### 4.4. Exploit Scenarios

*   **Scenario 1: Game Level Design:**  In a game that uses WFC to generate levels, an attacker could craft an input sample that forces the creation of levels with specific features, such as:
    *   **Unwinnable Levels:**  Creating a level with no path to the exit.
    *   **Trivial Levels:**  Creating a level with a very short and easy path to the exit.
    *   **Resource Imbalance:**  Creating a level with an abundance of resources in a specific area, giving the attacker an unfair advantage.
    *   **Hidden Passages/Traps:**  Creating a level with hidden passages or traps that are not apparent from the input sample.

*   **Scenario 2: Image Synthesis:**  In an application that uses WFC to generate images or textures, an attacker could:
    *   **Watermarking:**  Introduce subtle biases that create a hidden watermark in the generated images.
    *   **Copyright Infringement:**  Create an input sample that is similar to a copyrighted image, but different enough to avoid direct detection, and then use WFC to generate images that are "close enough" to infringe on the copyright.
    *   **Offensive Content:**  Introduce subtle biases that create offensive or inappropriate content in the generated images.

*   **Scenario 3: Procedural Content Generation:** More generally, any application using WFC for procedural content generation could be vulnerable to biased output, leading to predictable, repetitive, or undesirable results.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies

*   **M1: Input Sanitization and Validation:**
    *   **Tile Frequency Limits:**  Enforce limits on the maximum frequency of any single tile in the input sample.
    *   **Adjacency Rule Validation:**  Check for unusual or overly restrictive adjacency rules learned from the input sample.
    *   **Edge Case Handling:**  Carefully consider how the edges of the input sample are handled, and potentially add padding or other techniques to mitigate edge effects.
    *   **Periodicity Checks:**  If `periodicOutput` is `true`, verify that the input sample is actually periodic (or can be made periodic without significant distortion).
    *   **Symmetry Awareness:**  Be aware of the potential for symmetry exploitation, and consider using a diverse set of input samples with different symmetries.
    *   **Input Sample Diversity:** Encourage (or require) the use of diverse and varied input samples to prevent attackers from easily crafting biased inputs.

*   **M2: Code Hardening:**
    *   **Thorough Code Review:**  Conduct a thorough code review of the WFC implementation, focusing on the areas identified as potential vulnerabilities (probability calculation, constraint enforcement, random number generation).
    *   **Unit Testing:**  Write comprehensive unit tests to verify the correctness of the algorithm and its resistance to biased inputs.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:**  Use fuzz testing to generate a large number of random or semi-random inputs and test the algorithm's behavior under unexpected conditions.
    *   **Secure Random Number Generator:**  Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) for tile selection.
    *   **Integer Overflow/Underflow Protection:**  Use appropriate data types and checks to prevent integer overflow or underflow.

*   **M3: Output Monitoring and Analysis:**
    *   **Statistical Analysis:**  Analyze the output distribution of the generated content to detect any unexpected biases.
    *   **Entropy Monitoring:**  Monitor the entropy of the tiles during the generation process to detect any unusual patterns.
    *   **Visual Inspection:**  Visually inspect the generated content for any obvious signs of bias or manipulation.

*   **M4: Application-Specific Safeguards:**
    *   **Game Level Validation:**  In a game, implement checks to ensure that generated levels are playable and meet certain criteria (e.g., connectivity, resource distribution).
    *   **Image Quality Control:**  In an image synthesis application, implement checks to ensure that generated images meet certain quality standards and do not contain offensive or inappropriate content.
    *   **User Input Restrictions:**  Limit the user's ability to directly manipulate the input parameters to the WFC algorithm.

#### 4.6. Code Review (Targeted)

Let's examine some relevant snippets from the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` repository, focusing on potential areas of concern:

**1. `OverlappingModel.cs` (Probability Calculation):**

```csharp
// ... inside OverlappingModel.cs
private double[] CalculateWaveFrequencies()
{
    double[] result = new double[patterns.Length];
    for (int i = 0; i < patterns.Length; i++) result[i] = 1; // Initialize to 1

    // ... (code to count pattern occurrences in the input sample) ...

    double sum = result.Sum();
    for (int i = 0; i < result.Length; i++) result[i] /= sum; // Normalize

    return result;
}
```

*   **Potential Issue:** The initialization to `1` for all patterns is a crucial detail.  This ensures that even if a pattern doesn't appear in the input, it still has a *non-zero* probability.  This is a good practice to prevent zero-probability issues. However, an attacker could still heavily bias the output by making one pattern overwhelmingly frequent.
*   **Mitigation:**  The `M1: Tile Frequency Limits` mitigation is directly relevant here.  We should add a check *after* counting pattern occurrences to ensure that no single pattern's count exceeds a predefined threshold relative to the total count.

**2. `OverlappingModel.cs` (Constraint Propagation):**

```csharp
// ... inside OverlappingModel.cs
private void Propagate()
{
    while (stack.Count > 0)
    {
        var (x, y) = stack.Pop();
        // ... (code to get neighboring tiles) ...

        for (int neighbor = 0; neighbor < dx.Length; neighbor++)
        {
            // ... (code to calculate neighbor coordinates) ...

            if (nx < 0 || nx >= width || ny < 0 || ny >= height) continue; // Boundary check

            // ... (code to update possible patterns for the neighbor) ...
        }
    }
}
```

*   **Potential Issue:** The boundary check (`nx < 0 || nx >= width || ny < 0 || ny >= height`) is essential for preventing out-of-bounds access.  However, the *way* these boundaries are handled (simply skipping the neighbor) can influence the output distribution, especially if `periodicOutput` is false.
*   **Mitigation:**  `M1: Edge Case Handling` is key.  Consider alternative boundary handling strategies, such as:
    *   **Padding:**  Adding a "border" of specific tiles around the input sample to provide a consistent context for edge tiles.
    *   **Wrapping (for periodicOutput):**  Ensuring that the wrapping logic is correct and consistent.
    *   **Special Edge Tiles:**  Defining specific tiles that are only allowed at the edges of the output.

**3. `SimpleTiledModel.cs` (Similar logic):**

The `SimpleTiledModel` also has similar probability calculation and constraint propagation logic, and the same mitigations apply. The key difference is that `SimpleTiledModel` uses explicit tile definitions and adjacency rules, rather than learning them from an overlapping pattern.  This makes it potentially *easier* for an attacker to manipulate the adjacency rules directly.

**4. Random Number Generation:**

The code uses `System.Random`.

* **Potential Issue:** `System.Random` is *not* cryptographically secure. While it's generally sufficient for non-security-critical applications, a determined attacker *could* potentially predict its output if they know the seed.
* **Mitigation:** `M2: Secure Random Number Generator` is crucial for high-security applications. Replace `System.Random` with `System.Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator` to ensure unpredictable random numbers.

### 5. Conclusion

The "Bias Output Distribution" attack path against a WFC-based application is a significant concern.  By carefully crafting the input sample and exploiting potential code-level vulnerabilities, an attacker could manipulate the output of the algorithm to achieve predictable, exploitable, or otherwise undesirable results.  The mitigations outlined above, including input sanitization, code hardening, output monitoring, and application-specific safeguards, are essential for building secure and robust WFC-based applications.  A combination of these techniques is necessary to provide a strong defense against this type of attack. The most important mitigations are input validation (to prevent crafted inputs) and using a secure random number generator. The code review highlights specific areas where these mitigations should be applied.
