# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.3.3.1 - Bypass Input Validation (Output Dimensions)

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the potential for an attacker to bypass input validation mechanisms related to the output dimensions (width and height) specified for the WFC algorithm, and to understand the consequences and mitigation strategies for such a bypass.  We aim to identify specific vulnerabilities, assess their impact, and propose concrete remediation steps.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Target Application:**  Any application that utilizes the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library (https://github.com/mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse) and exposes user-configurable output dimensions (width and height) for the generated output.  This includes web applications, desktop applications, or any other context where user input directly or indirectly controls these parameters.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Bypassing input validation checks related to the *size* of the output dimensions.  We are *not* focusing on other aspects of WFC input, such as the input pattern, tile weights, or adjacency rules, *except* insofar as they might interact with the output dimension vulnerability.
*   **Library Version:** While the analysis is general, we will consider the current state of the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` repository as a reference point.  We will note if specific vulnerabilities are tied to particular versions or commits.
*   **Exclusion:** We are excluding attacks that do not directly involve manipulating the output dimensions.  For example, attacks targeting the underlying image processing library (e.g., PIL in Python) are out of scope unless they are a direct consequence of the output dimension bypass.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will examine the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library's source code, particularly the parts responsible for:
    *   Handling user-provided output dimensions (width and height).
    *   Allocating memory for the output image/array.
    *   Performing the WFC algorithm itself.
    *   Any error handling or exception handling related to dimensions.
2.  **Input Validation Analysis:** We will identify any existing input validation checks on the output dimensions within the library and the example code provided.  We will assess the strength and completeness of these checks.
3.  **Hypothetical Attack Scenarios:** We will develop specific attack scenarios where an attacker might attempt to bypass input validation.  This will involve crafting malicious input values for the width and height.
4.  **Impact Assessment:** For each scenario, we will analyze the potential impact, including:
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Can the attack cause the application to crash, hang, or consume excessive resources (memory, CPU)?
    *   **Information Disclosure:**  Can the attack lead to the leakage of sensitive information (e.g., memory contents)?
    *   **Code Execution (Remote or Local):**  Is there any possibility, however remote, of achieving code execution through this vulnerability?
    *   **Application-Specific Impacts:**  Are there any other negative consequences specific to the application using the WFC library?
5.  **Mitigation Recommendations:** We will propose concrete and actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.  These recommendations will include:
    *   **Input Validation Improvements:**  Specific checks and constraints to be applied to the output dimensions.
    *   **Code Hardening:**  Defensive programming techniques to make the application more resilient to unexpected input.
    *   **Error Handling:**  Robust error handling to gracefully handle invalid input and prevent crashes.
    *   **Resource Limits:**  Implementing limits on memory allocation and processing time.
6.  **Testing:** We will outline testing strategies to verify the effectiveness of the proposed mitigations.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.3.3.1

**4.1 Code Review (mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse)**

The core WFC logic resides primarily in `wfc_core.py` and `overlapping_wfc.py` / `simpletiled_wfc.py`.  Key areas of interest:

*   **`wfc_core.py`:**  The `run` function (and similar functions in the derived classes) takes `width` and `height` as arguments.  These are used to initialize the output array: `self.wave = np.zeros((self.FMY, self.FMX, self.T), dtype=bool)`.  `FMX` and `FMY` are derived from the input `width` and `height`.
*   **Memory Allocation:** The size of the `self.wave` array (and other related arrays) is directly proportional to `width * height * T` (where `T` is the number of tile types).  This is a crucial point for potential DoS attacks.
*   **Lack of Explicit Checks:**  A quick review of the library code *does not reveal any explicit checks on the maximum values of `width` and `height`*.  There are checks for positive values, but no upper bounds. This is a significant finding.
*   **Example Code:** The provided example scripts (e.g., `overlapping_*.py`, `simpletiled_*.py`) typically take width and height as command-line arguments.  These examples *also* generally lack robust input validation on these dimensions.

**4.2 Input Validation Analysis**

*   **Existing Checks (Library):**  As noted above, the library itself primarily checks for positive values, but not for excessively large values.
*   **Existing Checks (Examples):** The example scripts often use basic argument parsing (e.g., with `argparse`) but do not impose limits on the size of the dimensions.
*   **Missing Checks:**  The critical missing check is an upper bound on `width` and `height`.  This bound should be determined based on:
    *   Available system memory.
    *   Reasonable limits for the application's intended use case.
    *   Potential for integer overflows (if applicable, depending on the data types used).

**4.3 Hypothetical Attack Scenarios**

*   **Scenario 1: Denial of Service (Memory Exhaustion):**
    *   **Attacker Input:**  `width = 100000`, `height = 100000` (or even larger values).
    *   **Mechanism:** The attacker provides extremely large values for the output dimensions.  The application attempts to allocate a massive array (`self.wave`) that exceeds available memory.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** The application crashes due to an `OutOfMemoryError` (or similar) or becomes unresponsive due to excessive memory swapping.

*   **Scenario 2: Denial of Service (CPU Exhaustion):**
    *   **Attacker Input:**  `width = 5000`, `height = 5000` (large, but potentially not enough to cause immediate memory exhaustion).
    *   **Mechanism:**  The attacker provides large, but not immediately fatal, dimensions.  The WFC algorithm itself, with its iterative nature and potentially complex tile interactions, consumes an excessive amount of CPU time, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** The application becomes unresponsive or extremely slow, effectively denying service to legitimate users.

*   **Scenario 3: Integer Overflow (Less Likely, but Worth Considering):**
    *   **Attacker Input:**  `width = 2**31 - 1`, `height = 2` (or other values that, when multiplied, exceed the maximum value of the integer type used for calculations).
    *   **Mechanism:**  If the internal calculations involving `width` and `height` use a fixed-size integer type (e.g., 32-bit), an integer overflow could occur.  This could lead to unexpected behavior, potentially wrapping around to a small positive value and causing a smaller-than-expected allocation, or other unpredictable results.
    *   **Expected Outcome:**  Difficult to predict without detailed analysis of the specific integer types and calculations used.  Could range from no effect to a crash or unexpected output.  This is less likely than the DoS scenarios, but should be investigated.

**4.4 Impact Assessment**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  High impact.  Both memory exhaustion and CPU exhaustion scenarios can easily render the application unusable.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Low probability.  While a crash might expose some stack trace information, it's unlikely to leak sensitive data directly.  However, if the crash occurs *after* partial image generation, there's a very small chance that some internal state could be exposed.
*   **Code Execution:**  Extremely low probability.  This vulnerability primarily affects memory allocation and CPU usage.  There's no obvious path to code execution without a secondary vulnerability (e.g., a buffer overflow in the image processing library).
*   **Application-Specific Impacts:**  Depends on the application.  If the WFC generation is a critical component, any disruption will have a significant impact.  For example, if it's used for a real-time game or interactive application, even a short delay could be unacceptable.

**4.5 Mitigation Recommendations**

1.  **Strict Input Validation:**
    *   **Maximum Dimensions:**  Implement hard-coded maximum limits for `width` and `height`.  These limits should be based on the application's requirements and the available resources.  For example:
        ```python
        MAX_WIDTH = 2048
        MAX_HEIGHT = 2048

        if width > MAX_WIDTH or height > MAX_HEIGHT:
            raise ValueError(f"Dimensions exceed maximum allowed ({MAX_WIDTH}x{MAX_HEIGHT})")
        ```
    *   **Reasonable Defaults:**  Provide sensible default values for `width` and `height` if the user doesn't provide them.
    *   **Type Checking:** Ensure that `width` and `height` are integers.

2.  **Resource Limits (Application Level):**
    *   **Memory Limits:**  Consider using techniques to limit the total memory usage of the application.  This can be done at the operating system level (e.g., using `ulimit` on Linux) or within the application itself (e.g., using a memory profiler and setting thresholds).
    *   **Timeouts:**  Implement a timeout for the WFC generation process.  If the algorithm takes too long, terminate it and return an error.  This prevents CPU exhaustion attacks.

3.  **Error Handling:**
    *   **Catch `OutOfMemoryError`:**  Specifically catch `OutOfMemoryError` (or the equivalent in other languages) and handle it gracefully.  This might involve returning an error message to the user, logging the error, and releasing any allocated resources.
    *   **General Exception Handling:**  Use a broad `try...except` block to catch any unexpected exceptions during WFC execution and handle them appropriately.

4.  **Code Hardening:**
    *   **Integer Overflow Checks:**  If using fixed-size integer types, explicitly check for potential integer overflows before performing calculations involving `width` and `height`.  Consider using larger integer types (e.g., 64-bit) if necessary.
    *   **Defensive Programming:**  Review the code for any other potential vulnerabilities that might be triggered by unexpected input.

5. **Contribute to Upstream:**
    *   After implementing the mitigations in your application, consider creating a pull request to the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` repository to add input validation to the library itself. This benefits all users of the library.

**4.6 Testing**

*   **Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests to specifically test the input validation logic.  These tests should include:
    *   Valid input within the allowed range.
    *   Input exceeding the maximum `width` and `height`.
    *   Non-integer input.
    *   Zero and negative input.
    *   Boundary conditions (e.g., `width = 1`, `height = 1`).
*   **Integration Tests:**  Test the entire WFC generation process with various input dimensions, including large values that approach the defined limits.
*   **Fuzz Testing:**  Consider using a fuzzing tool to automatically generate a wide range of input values and test the application's robustness.
*   **Performance Testing:**  Measure the performance (memory usage, CPU time) of the WFC generation with different input dimensions to ensure that the limits are set appropriately.
* **Manual testing:** Try to break application with different inputs.

## 5. Conclusion

The lack of robust input validation on output dimensions in applications using the `mxgmn/wavefunctioncollapse` library presents a significant vulnerability, primarily leading to denial-of-service attacks.  By implementing the recommended mitigations, developers can significantly improve the security and stability of their applications.  The most crucial step is to add strict input validation with maximum dimension limits. Contributing these improvements back to the upstream library is highly recommended.
