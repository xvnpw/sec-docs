# Threat Model Analysis for serilog/serilog-sinks-console

## Threat: [Accidental Logging of Sensitive Data](./threats/accidental_logging_of_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might gain access to console output where the application, utilizing `serilog-sinks-console`, has unintentionally written sensitive information like passwords, API keys, personal data, or internal system details directly to the console. This is a direct consequence of the sink's function of outputting provided log messages.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of sensitive credentials, unauthorized access to systems or data, violation of privacy regulations, reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** The core functionality of the `serilog-sinks-console` sink, specifically the mechanism that writes log messages to the console output stream.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust filtering and masking of sensitive data *before* passing it to the Serilog logger. This prevents the sink from ever receiving the sensitive data.
        *   Avoid constructing log messages by directly embedding sensitive data. Utilize structured logging and property enrichment instead.
        *   Educate developers on secure logging practices and the risks of exposing sensitive information through console output.
        *   Regularly review log output (in non-production environments) to identify instances where sensitive data might be inadvertently logged via the console sink.

## Threat: [Leaving Console Logging Enabled in Production](./threats/leaving_console_logging_enabled_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might unintentionally leave the `serilog-sinks-console` enabled in production environments. This directly exposes the application's log output to the console, making it a potential source of information leakage and potentially impacting performance due to unnecessary I/O operations performed by the sink.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data logged by the application through the console sink, performance degradation due to the sink's continuous operation in production.
    *   **Affected Component:** The configuration and activation of the `serilog-sinks-console` sink within the application's Serilog setup.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement clear configuration management practices to disable or remove the `serilog-sinks-console` sink in production environments.
        *   Use environment-specific configurations for Serilog sinks, ensuring the console sink is not included in production builds or configurations.
        *   Regularly review the active Serilog sinks in production environments to ensure the console sink is not present.
        *   Automate the deployment process to enforce correct logging configurations, excluding the console sink in production.
