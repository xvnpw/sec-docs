# Attack Surface Analysis for serilog/serilog-sinks-console

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Console Output](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_console_output.md)

* **Description:** Sensitive information intended for internal use or restricted access is inadvertently logged and displayed on the console.
    * **How serilog-sinks-console Contributes:** This sink's primary function is to write log messages directly to the console output stream, making any logged data immediately visible.
    * **Example:** An application logs a database connection string (including username and password) or API keys to the console for debugging purposes, and this console output is accessible in a production environment or through container logs.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of confidential data can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and compromise of the application or related systems.
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the exposed data).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid using the console sink in production environments.** Utilize more secure and controlled logging sinks like file sinks with restricted access or dedicated logging services.
        * **Implement robust filtering and scrubbing of sensitive data before logging.** Use Serilog's features to remove or mask sensitive information from log messages.
        * **Carefully review and control the log levels used with the console sink.** Avoid logging highly detailed or debug-level information in non-development environments.
        * **Restrict access to console output streams.** Ensure that only authorized personnel can view console logs in environments where the sink is used.
