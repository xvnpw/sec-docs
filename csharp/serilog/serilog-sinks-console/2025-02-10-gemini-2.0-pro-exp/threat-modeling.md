# Threat Model Analysis for serilog/serilog-sinks-console

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure via Console](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_via_console.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure via Console

    *   **Description:** An attacker with access to the console (physical, remote, or through compromised processes) observes sensitive information (passwords, API keys, PII, internal network details) that has been inadvertently logged to the console output. The attacker might be a malicious insider, someone who has gained unauthorized access to the system, or a process capturing console output. The `Serilog.Sinks.Console` sink directly outputs this sensitive data to the vulnerable console.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromise of user accounts.
        *   Unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data.
        *   Data breaches and regulatory violations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
        *   Reputational damage.
        *   Financial loss.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire `Serilog.Sinks.Console` sink, specifically its output mechanism (writing to the standard output stream). The core issue is the *destination* of the log messages and the sink's role in sending data there.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never log sensitive data:** Implement a strict logging policy prohibiting the logging of sensitive information.
        *   **Filtering:** Use Serilog's filtering capabilities (`MinimumLevel`, `Filter.ByExcluding()`, custom filters) to prevent sensitive data from reaching the console sink.
        *   **Redaction:** Employ a redaction enricher to mask sensitive data before logging.
        *   **Controlled Destructuring:** Avoid destructuring objects containing sensitive data if the output goes to the console.
        *   **Code Review:** Regularly review code and logging configurations to ensure compliance with the logging policy.
        *   **Secure Monitoring:** If console output is captured by a monitoring system, secure that system appropriately.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (via Excessive Logging)](./threats/denial_of_service__via_excessive_logging_.md)

* **Threat:** Denial of Service (via Excessive Logging) - *Re-evaluated and included, with caveats*

    *   **Description:** While the *sink itself* is generally fast, *excessive logging directed to the console by Serilog.Sinks.Console* could contribute to a denial-of-service. This is *most relevant* if the console output is being *redirected* to a file, another process, or a system with limited I/O capacity. The sink's role is in generating the high volume of log data. The vulnerability isn't *solely* the sink, but the sink is a necessary component.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Performance degradation of the application or the system.
        *   Potential denial of service if the console output is redirected to a resource-constrained target.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `Serilog.Sinks.Console` sink, in its role as the *source* of the log data being written to the console output stream. The impact depends on the configuration and environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Conditional - depends heavily on the environment and redirection of output. It's raised from "Low" in the previous list because, while less likely than data exposure, the *sink itself* is directly involved in generating the potentially problematic output.)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Appropriate Logging Levels:** Use appropriate logging levels (avoid `Verbose` or `Debug` in production).
        *   **Rate Limiting (External):** If console output is being processed by another system, implement rate limiting on *that* system. This is an external mitigation, but addresses the *consequence* of the sink's output.
        *   **Asynchronous Logging:** Use asynchronous logging (if supported by the overall Serilog configuration) to minimize the impact on the application's performance.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor console output performance and adjust logging levels as needed.
