## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exfiltrate Sensitive Data [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exfiltrate_sensitive_data__high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This is the most critical threat category, focusing on unauthorized access to sensitive information logged to the console.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Misconfigured Output Template [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__misconfigured_output_template__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  The `outputTemplate` in Serilog configuration controls the format of log messages.  If misconfigured, it can expose sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Accidental Inclusion of Sensitive Properties [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__accidental_inclusion_of_sensitive_properties__critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  Developers might inadvertently include sensitive properties (e.g., passwords, API keys, PII) in the `outputTemplate`, either directly or by logging entire objects that contain sensitive data.
            *   **Action:** Review and restrict properties included in the output template. Use structured logging and avoid logging raw objects directly. Use Serilog's destructuring operators (@, $) appropriately.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common mistake)
            *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Depends on the data)
            *   **Effort:** Very Low (Just needs to read the logs)
            *   **Skill Level:** Very Low (No special skills needed)
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires log review, might be missed)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Console Output Interception [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__console_output_interception__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  If an attacker can gain access to the console output, they can potentially see all logged information.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.1. Shared Server Environment [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_1__shared_server_environment__critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  In a shared server environment (e.g., a shared hosting provider, a multi-user system), other users or processes might have access to the console output of the application.
            *   **Action:** Avoid using the console sink in shared server environments where other users/processes might have access to the console output. Use a more secure sink (e.g., file, database) with appropriate access controls.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (If using a shared environment)
            *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Full access to logged data)
            *   **Effort:** Low (If already has access to the shared environment)
            *   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic system access)
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High (Depends on monitoring)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Environment Variable Exposure [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_environment_variable_exposure__high_risk_.md)

* **Description:** Sensitive data stored in environment variables can be inadvertently logged.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1 Sensitive data logged via environment variables [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_sensitive_data_logged_via_environment_variables__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might log entire environment variables, or parts of them, which can contain secrets like API keys, database credentials, or other sensitive configuration data.
            *   **Action:** Avoid logging entire environment variables. If necessary, sanitize or redact sensitive information before logging.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common mistake)
            *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Depends on the data in environment variables)
            *   **Effort:** Very Low (Just needs to read the logs)
            *   **Skill Level:** Very Low (No special skills needed)
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires log review, might be missed)

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Disrupt Application Availability](./attack_tree_paths/2__disrupt_application_availability.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This category focuses on attacks that aim to make the application unavailable or unresponsive.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Logging](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__denial_of_service__dos__via_excessive_logging.md)

*   **Description:**  Excessive logging can consume system resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O), leading to performance degradation or application crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1. Uncontrolled Log Volume [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1__uncontrolled_log_volume__critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  If logging levels are not properly configured (e.g., using `Debug` or `Verbose` in production), or if the application generates an excessive number of log messages, it can overwhelm the system.
            *   **Action:** Implement logging level controls (e.g., `MinimumLevel` in Serilog). Use appropriate logging levels (e.g., `Information`, `Warning`, `Error`) and avoid excessive logging at lower levels (e.g., `Debug`, `Verbose`) in production environments. Consider using sampling or rate limiting if necessary.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (If logging is not properly configured)
            *   **Impact:** Medium (Performance degradation, potential unavailability)
            *   **Effort:** Very Low (Just needs to trigger excessive logging)
            *   **Skill Level:** Very Low (No special skills needed)
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium (Performance monitoring should detect)
