# Attack Surface Analysis for serilog/serilog-sinks-console

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Console Output](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_console_output.md)

**Description:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data logged to the console.

**Serilog-sinks-console Contribution:** This sink *directly* writes log events to the standard output (console), making the data potentially accessible to anyone who can view the console. This is the *core* functionality of the sink and the primary source of risk.

**Example:** An application logs a user's session token to the console. An attacker with access to the server's console (e.g., through a compromised account or a misconfigured container) can see the token and use it to impersonate the user.

**Impact:** Loss of confidentiality, potential for account takeover, data breaches, regulatory violations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if sensitive data is logged) or High (if potentially sensitive data is logged).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Logging Sensitive Data:** The most effective mitigation.  Do not log PII, authentication tokens, API keys, or other confidential information to the console.
    *   **Data Redaction/Masking:** If sensitive data *must* be logged for debugging, redact or mask it before logging.  For example, log only the first and last few characters of a token.
    *   **Structured Logging:** Use Serilog's structured logging features (message templates and properties) to control which data is logged.  Avoid logging entire objects that might contain sensitive fields.
    *   **Restrict Console Access:** Implement strict access controls on the server and container environment to limit who can view the console output.  Use the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Secure Container Logging:** If using containers, ensure that access to container logs (e.g., `docker logs`, `kubectl logs`) is properly secured and restricted to authorized users.
    *   **Log Rotation and Deletion:** If console output is redirected to a file, implement log rotation and deletion policies to limit the amount of historical data available.
    *   **Use a Different Sink:** For sensitive logs, consider using a more secure sink, such as a dedicated log aggregation service with robust access controls and encryption.

## Attack Surface: [CI/CD Pipeline Log Exposure](./attack_surfaces/cicd_pipeline_log_exposure.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information logged to the console during CI/CD pipeline execution is exposed due to insufficient access controls on pipeline logs.

**Serilog-sinks-console Contribution:** If the application uses `serilog-sinks-console` during CI/CD builds or deployments, any sensitive data logged *will be captured* in the pipeline logs. The sink's direct output to the console is the mechanism of exposure.

**Example:** A CI/CD pipeline runs unit tests that log database connection strings (a bad practice) to the console.  Anyone with access to the pipeline logs can view these connection strings.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive configuration data, potential for unauthorized access to development or production systems.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict Access to Pipeline Logs:** Implement strict access controls on CI/CD pipeline logs, limiting access to authorized personnel only.
    *   **Avoid Logging Sensitive Data in Pipelines:** Do not log any sensitive information (passwords, API keys, connection strings, etc.) during CI/CD pipeline execution.
    *   **Use Secrets Management:** Use a secrets management tool (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to securely store and inject sensitive data into the pipeline environment, rather than hardcoding it or logging it.
    *   **Review Pipeline Configuration:** Regularly review and audit CI/CD pipeline configurations to ensure that sensitive data is not being logged or exposed.
    *   **Use a Dedicated CI/CD Logging Sink:** Consider using a separate Serilog sink specifically for CI/CD pipelines, configured to avoid logging sensitive information.
