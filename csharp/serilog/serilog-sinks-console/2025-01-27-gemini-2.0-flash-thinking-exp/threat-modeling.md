# Threat Model Analysis for serilog/serilog-sinks-console

## Threat: [Accidental Logging of Sensitive Data](./threats/accidental_logging_of_sensitive_data.md)

Description: Developers may unknowingly log sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys, personal data) within application code. An attacker gaining access to console output (directly or indirectly through captured logs) can read this sensitive data. This could happen through direct console access, access to container logs, or monitoring system logs.
Impact: Information Disclosure, potential data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive information.
Affected Component: Sink Configuration, Log Formatting, Output Stream (Console)
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Establish and enforce clear logging policies that define what data is permissible to log and what is considered sensitive.
    * Utilize Serilog's filtering and masking features to prevent logging of sensitive data based on properties or message templates.
    * Conduct regular code reviews with a focus on identifying and removing accidental logging of sensitive information.
    * Provide security awareness training to developers on secure logging practices.

## Threat: [Console Output Capture and Exposure](./threats/console_output_capture_and_exposure.md)

Description: Console output, including logs written by `serilog-sinks-console`, is often captured and stored in various environments (e.g., container logs, CI/CD pipelines, server logs, monitoring systems). If these storage locations are not properly secured, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to these logs and read sensitive information that was logged to the console.
Impact: Information Disclosure, potential data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive information, depending on the content of the logs and the sensitivity of the environment.
Affected Component: Sink Output (Console Stream), External Log Capture Systems
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement strong access controls and authentication mechanisms for all systems and environments where console output is captured and stored.
    * Regularly audit access logs to identify and investigate any unauthorized access attempts to console output and related log storage.
    * Consider using dedicated and more secure logging sinks (e.g., to a database, SIEM system, or secure file storage) for sensitive environments instead of relying solely on console output in production.
    * Encrypt log data at rest and in transit if stored persistently.

## Threat: [Log Injection/Flooding via Console](./threats/log_injectionflooding_via_console.md)

Description: While less direct, if an attacker can influence the application to generate a large volume of log messages that are written to the console (e.g., by manipulating input parameters that are logged), it could potentially lead to resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, I/O) on the system running the application. This is more likely if logging is very verbose or if log messages are complex and resource-intensive to format. This can lead to a denial of service.
Impact: Denial of Service (DoS), performance degradation, application instability or crash.
Affected Component: Sink Output (Console Stream), Logging Pipeline, Application Logic (if vulnerable to log injection)
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent attackers from injecting arbitrary content into log messages.
    * Implement rate limiting or throttling mechanisms for logging, especially for events that could be triggered by external inputs.
    * Monitor application performance and resource usage, paying attention to logging overhead.
    * Use appropriate logging levels and avoid excessively verbose logging, especially in performance-critical sections of the application.
    * Consider using asynchronous logging to minimize the performance impact of logging operations on the main application thread.
