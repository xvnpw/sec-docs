# Attack Surface Analysis for serilog/serilog-sinks-console

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Console Output](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_console_output.md)

**Description:** The application inadvertently logs sensitive information directly to the console.

**How `serilog-sinks-console` Contributes:** This sink is responsible for writing the log messages to the console output stream, making any logged data directly visible.

**Example:** An exception occurs, and the stack trace, which includes database connection strings with passwords, is logged to the console.

**Impact:** Exposure of confidential data, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or compliance violations.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict filtering and scrubbing of log data: Ensure sensitive information like passwords, API keys, and personal data are removed or masked before logging.
* Avoid logging sensitive data to the console in production environments:  Opt for more secure sinks for sensitive information, such as dedicated logging services or secure file storage with restricted access.
* Review and audit log configurations regularly: Ensure that logging levels and filters are appropriate and don't inadvertently expose sensitive data.
* Educate developers on secure logging practices: Emphasize the importance of avoiding logging sensitive information and using secure logging mechanisms.

## Attack Surface: [Console Injection Attacks](./attack_surfaces/console_injection_attacks.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious control characters or ANSI escape codes into log messages that are then interpreted by the console, potentially leading to unintended behavior or information manipulation.

**How `serilog-sinks-console` Contributes:** This sink directly outputs the log message content to the console, including any injected control characters or escape sequences.

**Example:** An attacker crafts an input that, when logged, includes ANSI escape codes to clear the screen or display misleading information in the console output.

**Impact:** Denial of Service on the terminal, obfuscation of legitimate logs, potential for exploiting vulnerabilities in specific terminal emulators.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Sanitize or escape log messages before writing to the console:**  Implement mechanisms to remove or escape potentially harmful control characters and ANSI escape codes.
* Avoid displaying untrusted data directly on the console:** If displaying user-provided data, ensure it's properly sanitized before logging.
* Configure terminal emulators with security in mind:**  Use terminal emulators that offer options to disable or restrict the interpretation of certain escape sequences.
