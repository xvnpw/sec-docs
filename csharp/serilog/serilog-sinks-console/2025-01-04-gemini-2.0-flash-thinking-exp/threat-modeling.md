# Threat Model Analysis for serilog/serilog-sinks-console

## Threat: [Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Data](./threats/accidental_exposure_of_sensitive_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker, or unauthorized personnel, could gain access to sensitive information that is inadvertently logged to the console output *via the `serilog-sinks-console` library*. This might occur due to developers logging variables containing credentials, API keys, personal data, or internal system details without proper sanitization or awareness, and this information is then written to the console using the sink. The attacker might observe the console output directly on a server, through container logs, or via screenshots/recordings.

**Impact:**  Compromise of credentials leading to unauthorized access, data breaches resulting in financial loss or reputational damage, violation of privacy regulations, and exposure of internal system vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** The core functionality of the `ConsoleSink` module, specifically the methods responsible for formatting and writing log messages to the console output stream (e.g., `Emit`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict logging policies that explicitly prohibit logging sensitive data.
*   Educate developers on secure logging practices and the risks of exposing sensitive information *through console logging*.
*   Utilize structured logging and carefully select which properties to log, avoiding the logging of entire objects that might contain sensitive data *that will be output to the console*.
*   Implement data sanitization or redaction techniques *before passing data to the Serilog logger*. Consider using formatters within Serilog to mask or remove sensitive information before logging to the console.
*   Regularly review log output in development and testing environments to identify and eliminate accidental logging of sensitive data *being output by the console sink*.
*   Consider using more secure sinks for production environments if console output is easily accessible to unauthorized individuals.
