# Threat Model Analysis for serilog/serilog

## Threat: [Logging Sensitive Data in Plain Text](./threats/logging_sensitive_data_in_plain_text.md)

Description: An attacker could gain unauthorized access to highly sensitive information (passwords, API keys, PII, financial data) by accessing log files or log sinks where this data has been inadvertently logged in plain text by Serilog. This occurs when developers directly log sensitive variables or data structures without proper sanitization or masking using Serilog.
Impact: Information Disclosure, Critical Data Breach, Severe Compliance Violations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), Significant Reputational Damage, Legal repercussions.
Serilog Component Affected: Core Logging Pipeline, Application Code using Serilog.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
* Mandatory Data Masking and Filtering: Implement robust data masking and filtering within Serilog configuration using features like `Destructure.ByTransform`, `ForContext`, and custom formatters to automatically redact or remove sensitive data before logging.
* Strict Structured Logging Policies: Enforce structured logging practices and strictly prohibit embedding sensitive data directly within free-text message templates. Utilize properties and context enrichment for logging data, allowing for targeted filtering.
* Mandatory Code Reviews with Security Focus: Implement mandatory code reviews specifically focused on identifying and preventing the logging of sensitive information. Utilize static analysis tools to detect potential sensitive data logging.
* Comprehensive Developer Training: Provide comprehensive and ongoing developer training on secure logging practices, emphasizing the critical risks of exposing sensitive data in logs and demonstrating Serilog's security features.
* Secure Log Storage and Access Control:  Store logs in highly secure, dedicated storage locations with stringent access controls, encryption at rest and in transit, and regular security audits.

## Threat: [Logs Stored in Insecure Locations](./threats/logs_stored_in_insecure_locations.md)

Description: An attacker could critically compromise highly sensitive log data by gaining access to insecurely configured log sinks used by Serilog. This includes scenarios where logs are written to publicly accessible file shares, unencrypted databases, or cloud storage with severely weak or misconfigured access controls.
Impact: Critical Information Disclosure, Catastrophic Data Breach, Complete Loss of Audit Trail Integrity, Full System Compromise if logs contain system access information, Severe Compliance Violations, Irreversible Reputational Damage.
Serilog Component Affected: Sinks (File, Database, Cloud Sinks), Serilog Configuration.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
* Mandatory Secure Log Storage Infrastructure: Mandate the use of hardened and dedicated secure log storage infrastructure.
* Implement Strongest Access Controls: Implement the strongest possible access controls (multi-factor authentication, role-based access control, principle of least privilege) for all log sinks and storage locations.
* Enforce Encryption Everywhere: Enforce encryption of log data at rest and in transit for all sinks without exception.
* Continuous Security Monitoring and Auditing: Implement continuous security monitoring and regular security audits of all log sinks and storage configurations to detect and remediate any misconfigurations or vulnerabilities immediately.
* Automated Security Configuration Validation: Utilize automated tools to validate and enforce secure configuration of Serilog sinks and related infrastructure.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Serilog or Sink Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_serilog_or_sink_dependencies.md)

Description: Critical vulnerabilities within Serilog itself or its sink dependencies could be exploited by attackers to compromise the application or the entire logging infrastructure. This could lead to remote code execution, complete system takeover, or massive data breaches if vulnerabilities allow access to logged sensitive data.
Impact: Full Application Compromise, Complete Logging Infrastructure Takeover, Critical Information Disclosure, Catastrophic Data Breach, Denial of Service, Supply Chain Attack.
Serilog Component Affected: Serilog Core Library, Sink Packages, Dependency Libraries.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
* Proactive Dependency Management and Patching: Implement a proactive dependency management strategy, including continuous monitoring for security advisories and immediate patching of Serilog and all sink dependencies upon vulnerability disclosure.
* Automated Vulnerability Scanning: Utilize automated vulnerability scanning tools integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to continuously scan Serilog and its dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
* Security Audits and Penetration Testing: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting the logging infrastructure and Serilog integration to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities proactively.
* Stay Updated with Security Best Practices: Continuously monitor and adapt to security best practices related to dependency management and secure software development lifecycle for logging libraries.
* Consider using only officially maintained and vetted sinks: Limit the usage to well-maintained and officially vetted Serilog sinks to reduce the risk of using sinks with unknown or unaddressed vulnerabilities.
