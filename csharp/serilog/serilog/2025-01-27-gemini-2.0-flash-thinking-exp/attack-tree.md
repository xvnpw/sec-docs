## Attack Tree Path: [1. Inject Malicious Sink Configuration (Node 1.1.1)](./attack_tree_paths/1__inject_malicious_sink_configuration__node_1_1_1_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attacker gains access to application configuration mechanisms (e.g., environment variables, configuration files, command-line arguments).
    *   Attacker injects or modifies the Serilog configuration to add a new sink.
    *   This malicious sink is configured to send logs to a server controlled by the attacker.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Sensitive data exfiltration: Logs containing sensitive information (credentials, PII, business data) are sent to the attacker's server.
    *   Information gathering: Attacker gains insights into application behavior and internal workings from the logs.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Configuration Sources:** Use secure configuration management systems and avoid storing sensitive configuration in easily accessible locations.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize all configuration inputs to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant minimal necessary permissions to modify application configurations.
    *   **Configuration Monitoring:** Monitor configuration changes for unauthorized modifications.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Formatters or Enrichers (Node 2.1.2)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_custom_formatters_or_enrichers__node_2_1_2_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Application developers create custom Serilog formatters or enrichers to modify log output.
    *   These custom components contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., injection flaws, buffer overflows, logic errors).
    *   Attacker triggers logging events that exploit these vulnerabilities.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE): Vulnerabilities in formatters/enrichers could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the application server.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Vulnerabilities could lead to application crashes or performance degradation.
    *   Information Disclosure: Vulnerabilities could expose sensitive data from the application's memory or environment.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Apply secure coding principles when developing custom formatters and enrichers.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews of custom components to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Testing:** Perform security testing (static and dynamic analysis) on custom formatters and enrichers.

*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Sensitive Data Breach: Logs containing sensitive information are exposed to the attacker.
    *   Compliance Violations: Insecure log storage can violate regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
    *   Reputational Damage: Data breaches can lead to significant reputational damage.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Encrypt Logs at Rest:** Encrypt log files stored on disk.
    *   **Secure Log Storage Location:** Store logs in secure locations with appropriate access controls.
    *   **Access Control:** Implement strong access controls to restrict access to log files to authorized personnel only.
    *   **Secure Transmission:** Use secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS, TLS) for transmitting logs over networks.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of log storage and access mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Popular Sinks (Node 3.1.1)](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in_popular_sinks__node_3_1_1_.md)

    *   **Reputable Package Sources:** Prefer using reputable and trusted package registries.
    *   **Dependency Pinning:** Pin dependencies to specific versions to avoid automatic updates to potentially malicious versions.
    *   **Private Package Registries/Mirrors:** Consider using private package registries or mirrored repositories for internal dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Custom Sink Vulnerabilities (Node 3.1.3)](./attack_tree_paths/6__custom_sink_vulnerabilities__node_3_1_3_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Application developers create custom Serilog sinks to write logs to specific destinations or formats.
    *   These custom sinks contain security vulnerabilities due to insecure coding practices.
    *   Attacker exploits these vulnerabilities in the custom sink implementation.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Similar to Node 2.1.2 (Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Formatters/Enrichers): RCE, DoS, Information Disclosure.
    *   Compromise of Log Destination: Vulnerabilities could allow attackers to compromise the system where logs are written (e.g., database, file server).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Apply secure coding principles when developing custom sinks.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews of custom sinks.
    *   **Security Testing:** Perform security testing on custom sinks.
    *   **Use Existing Sinks:** Whenever possible, leverage well-vetted and established Serilog sinks instead of developing custom ones.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Insecure Sink Authentication/Authorization (Node 3.2.1)](./attack_tree_paths/7__insecure_sink_authenticationauthorization__node_3_2_1_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Serilog sink requires authentication and authorization to access or write logs.
    *   Sink is configured with weak or default credentials.
    *   Authentication is disabled or bypassed.
    *   Authorization is not properly implemented, allowing unauthorized access.
    *   Attacker exploits these weaknesses to gain unauthorized access to the sink.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Log Access: Attacker gains access to sensitive log data.
    *   Log Manipulation: Attacker can modify or delete logs, potentially covering their tracks or disrupting operations.
    *   Sink System Compromise: In some cases, weak authentication can be a stepping stone to further compromise the sink system itself.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Authentication:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms for sinks (e.g., strong passwords, API keys, certificate-based authentication).
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant minimal necessary permissions to sink users and applications.
    *   **Regular Credential Rotation:** Regularly rotate sink credentials.
    *   **Authentication Auditing:** Audit authentication attempts and access to sinks.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Malicious Extension Injection (Node 4.1 and sub-nodes)](./attack_tree_paths/8__malicious_extension_injection__node_4_1_and_sub-nodes_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attacker manipulates the application's extension loading mechanism to load malicious Serilog extensions (sinks, formatters, enrichers).
    *   This could involve:
        *   Modifying file paths or configuration settings that control extension loading.
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the extension loading logic itself.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Full Application Compromise: Malicious extensions can execute arbitrary code within the application's context, leading to RCE, data breaches, and complete system takeover.
    *   Persistence: Malicious extensions can be designed to provide persistent access to the compromised system.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Extension Loading Paths:** Restrict write access to directories where Serilog extensions are loaded from.

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Application uses internal or private Serilog extensions (sinks, formatters, enrichers).
    *   Attacker registers a malicious package on a public package registry (e.g., NuGet.org) with the same name as the internal/private extension.
    *   Application's dependency resolution mechanism is misconfigured or vulnerable to dependency confusion.
    *   Application mistakenly downloads and uses the malicious public package instead of the intended private one.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Full Application Compromise: Malicious substituted package can contain arbitrary code, leading to RCE, data breaches, and complete system takeover.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Private Package Registries:** Host internal/private packages in private package registries or repositories.
