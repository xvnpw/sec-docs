# Threat Model Analysis for serilog/serilog

## Threat: [Logging Sensitive Data](./threats/logging_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could gain access to log data handled by Serilog and read sensitive information that was inadvertently included in log messages. This occurs when developers fail to properly sanitize or filter sensitive data before passing it to Serilog's logging methods.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of PII, API keys, passwords, or other sensitive data, leading to potential identity theft, financial loss, or unauthorized access to other systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** Serilog core logging pipeline, `ILogger` interface.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict filtering and masking of sensitive data before logging using Serilog's features like `Destructure.ByTransforming` or custom `Enrichers`.
        *   Avoid logging raw request/response bodies without careful inspection and sanitization.
        *   Regularly review log configurations and code to identify potential sensitive data leaks.
        *   Educate developers on secure logging practices.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Sinks](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_sinks.md)

*   **Description:** If the application utilizes custom-developed Serilog sinks, these sinks might contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., injection flaws, insecure deserialization) that could be exploited by an attacker. The vulnerability resides within the code of the custom sink, which is an extension point of Serilog.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for remote code execution, data breaches, or other security compromises depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom sink.
    *   **Affected Component:** Custom Serilog sink implementations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and security audit any custom Serilog sinks before deployment.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom sinks.
        *   Keep dependencies used by custom sinks up-to-date with security patches.

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration of Sinks](./threats/insecure_configuration_of_sinks.md)

*   **Description:**  Misconfiguration within Serilog's configuration system can introduce security risks. This includes storing sensitive information like API keys or credentials for external logging services directly within the Serilog configuration (e.g., in plain text files) without proper encryption or access controls.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials used by Serilog to interact with logging sinks, potentially leading to unauthorized access to external logging services or other systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** Serilog configuration system, specific sink configuration settings.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store sensitive configuration details securely using environment variables, dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault), or encrypted configuration files, and reference them within Serilog's configuration.
        *   Avoid committing sensitive configuration details directly to version control.
        *   Regularly review and audit Serilog sink configurations.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Sinks](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_sinks.md)

*   **Description:** Certain Serilog sinks might involve deserialization of data, for instance, when receiving log events over a network. If these sinks do not handle deserialization securely, it could introduce deserialization vulnerabilities, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code by sending malicious serialized data to the sink.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete compromise of the application or logging infrastructure.
    *   **Affected Component:** Serilog sink implementations that perform deserialization.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Be aware of sinks that perform deserialization.
        *   Ensure the sink libraries are up-to-date and do not have known deserialization vulnerabilities.
        *   Avoid deserializing untrusted data. If necessary, implement secure deserialization practices.
