# Attack Surface Analysis for serilog/serilog

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Sinks (Path Traversal)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_sinks__path_traversal_.md)

**Description:** Attackers manipulate the log file path to write logs to arbitrary locations on the file system.

**How Serilog Contributes:** If the file path for the `File` sink is dynamically constructed based on external input or configuration without proper validation, it becomes vulnerable.

**Example:** A configuration setting allows specifying the log file directory. An attacker could set this to `../../../../etc/cron.d/` to potentially overwrite system files.

**Impact:** Overwriting critical system files, gaining unauthorized access, potential for privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid dynamic construction of file paths based on user input or untrusted sources.
*   Use absolute paths or restrict the base directory for log files.
*   Ensure the application process has the least necessary privileges for writing log files.
*   Regularly audit log file configurations.

## Attack Surface: [SQL/NoSQL Injection via Database Sinks](./attack_surfaces/sqlnosql_injection_via_database_sinks.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL or NoSQL commands through log data that is directly inserted into database queries.

**How Serilog Contributes:** If the chosen database sink (e.g., `Serilog.Sinks.MSSqlServer`) constructs queries by directly concatenating log message content without proper parameterization, it's vulnerable.

**Example:** A log message contains user input like `' OR '1'='1`. If this is directly inserted into a SQL query, it could bypass authentication or retrieve unauthorized data.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, potential for remote code execution (depending on database permissions).

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Ensure database sinks use parameterized queries or prepared statements.
*   Sanitize or encode log data before it's passed to the database sink.
*   Follow database security best practices (least privilege, strong authentication).

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Logged Sensitive Data](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_logged_sensitive_data.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information (passwords, API keys, personal data) is inadvertently logged and exposed.

**How Serilog Contributes:** Serilog will log any data provided to it. If developers are not careful about what they log, sensitive information can end up in log files or other sinks.

**Example:** Logging the entire request object, which might contain authentication tokens or user credentials in headers or body.

**Impact:** Data breach, identity theft, unauthorized access to systems.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the type of data exposed).

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid logging sensitive information.
*   Use filtering and masking techniques to redact sensitive data before logging.
*   Implement secure log storage and access controls.
*   Educate developers on secure logging practices.

## Attack Surface: [Credential Exposure in Configuration](./attack_surfaces/credential_exposure_in_configuration.md)

**Description:** Credentials for log sinks (databases, cloud services, etc.) are stored insecurely in the Serilog configuration.

**How Serilog Contributes:** Serilog configuration often requires providing credentials for sinks. If these are stored in plain text in configuration files or environment variables, they are vulnerable.

**Example:** Storing a database connection string with the password directly in the `appsettings.json` file.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to log sinks, potential for further compromise of connected systems.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid storing credentials directly in configuration files.
*   Use secure configuration management techniques (e.g., Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault).
*   Utilize environment variables with proper access controls.
*   Encrypt sensitive configuration data.
