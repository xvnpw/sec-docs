## High and Critical Serilog Threats

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action) | Impact | Affected Serilog Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Sensitive Data Disclosure in Logs** | An attacker gains access to log files or a logging sink and discovers sensitive information (passwords, API keys, PII) that was inadvertently logged due to Serilog's processing and writing of log events. | Data breach, compliance violations, reputational damage. | **Core Logging Pipeline, Sinks (File, Database, Cloud)** -  The process of formatting and writing log events to configured destinations. | **Critical** | - **Avoid logging sensitive data directly.**  Use placeholders or identifiers instead. - **Implement log scrubbing/filtering** using Serilog's `Destructuring` and `Filtering` features to remove sensitive information before logging. - **Secure log storage** with strong access controls and encryption. - **Regularly review log output** to identify and address instances of sensitive data being logged. - **Consider using Serilog.Expressions for advanced filtering and redaction.** |
| **Log Injection/Spoofing** | An attacker injects malicious or misleading log entries into the system through Serilog's logging mechanisms, potentially framing innocent components or masking their own actions. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's logging logic that utilizes Serilog or by manipulating data passed to Serilog. | Misleading audit trails, hindering incident response, potential for denial of service if excessive logs are injected. | **Core Logging Pipeline** - The process of receiving and processing log events within Serilog. | **High** | - **Centralized logging with authentication** to verify the source of log messages processed by Serilog. - **Careful code reviews** of logging statements to ensure proper input validation and prevent injection vulnerabilities when using Serilog. - **Monitor for unusual log patterns or sources.** |
| **Denial of Service via Excessive Logging** | An attacker triggers a large volume of log messages that are processed and written by Serilog, overwhelming the logging system and potentially impacting application performance or filling up storage. This could be done by exploiting application logic that uses Serilog or by directly sending a large number of requests that generate logs handled by Serilog. | Application instability, performance degradation, storage exhaustion, potential service outage. | **Core Logging Pipeline, Sinks (File, Database, Cloud)** - The processing and storage of log events by Serilog and its configured sinks. | **High** | - **Implement rate limiting for logging within the application logic that uses Serilog.** - **Configure appropriate log levels in Serilog** to avoid logging excessively verbose information in production. - **Monitor resource consumption of logging sinks used by Serilog.** - **Choose robust and scalable logging sinks for Serilog.** - **Implement circuit breakers** if a sink used by Serilog becomes overwhelmed. |
| **Code Injection via Custom Formatters/Sinks** | If the application uses custom Serilog formatters or sinks, an attacker might be able to inject malicious code that is executed by the application when Serilog processes log events using these custom components. This is a direct vulnerability within Serilog's extensibility points. | Remote code execution, complete system compromise. | **Formatters (ICustomFormatter), Custom Sinks (IBatchSink, ILogEventSink)** - Extensibility points in Serilog where custom logic can be implemented. | **Critical** | - **Thoroughly review and test custom formatters and sinks** for security vulnerabilities. - **Sanitize or validate any input** processed by custom components used by Serilog. - **Follow secure coding practices** when developing custom Serilog extensions. - **Minimize the use of custom components if standard options are sufficient.** |
| **Elevation of Privilege via Sink Vulnerabilities** | A vulnerability in a specific Serilog sink could be exploited during the process of Serilog writing logs to that sink, potentially allowing an attacker to gain elevated privileges on the system where the sink is running or the target system the sink interacts with (e.g., SQL injection in a database sink used by Serilog). | Unauthorized access, data manipulation, system compromise. | **Specific Sinks (Database, Cloud, Custom Sinks)** - The individual components responsible for writing logs to specific destinations as configured in Serilog. | **High** | - **Keep sink libraries used by Serilog updated** to patch known vulnerabilities. - **Follow secure coding practices when configuring and using sinks with Serilog.** - **Apply the principle of least privilege** to the accounts used by sinks configured in Serilog to interact with external systems. - **Implement input validation and sanitization** before passing data to sinks used by Serilog. |
