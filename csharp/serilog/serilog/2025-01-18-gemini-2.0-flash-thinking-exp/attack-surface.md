# Attack Surface Analysis for serilog/serilog

## Attack Surface: [Log Forgery and Injection](./attack_surfaces/log_forgery_and_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious content into log messages. This can mislead administrators, hide malicious activity, or potentially exploit vulnerabilities in log processing systems.

**How Serilog Contributes:** Serilog logs data provided to it. If the application directly includes unsanitized user input or data from untrusted sources in log messages, Serilog faithfully records this malicious content.

**Example:**  A web application logs user search queries. An attacker crafts a query containing control characters or escape sequences that, when processed by a log analysis tool, could execute commands or reveal sensitive information within that tool.

**Impact:** Tampered logs, misleading security analysis, potential command injection in log processing pipelines, denial of service on log aggregation systems.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Sanitize or encode user-provided data before including it in log messages.
- Use parameterized logging (structured logging) where the message template and properties are treated separately, preventing injection.
- Implement robust input validation on all data that might be logged.
- Secure log processing and analysis tools against injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure through Logged Data](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_through_logged_data.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys, personal data) is unintentionally included in log messages.

**How Serilog Contributes:** Serilog logs the data it is instructed to log. If developers inadvertently log sensitive information, Serilog will record it, potentially exposing it if the logs are compromised.

**Example:** An error handler logs the entire request object, which includes a user's password in the request body.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, credentials, or confidential business information.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Avoid logging sensitive data altogether.
- Implement filtering or masking of sensitive data within Serilog configuration or code.
- Review log messages and configurations regularly to identify and remove any instances of sensitive data being logged.
- Secure log storage and access controls.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal in File Sinks](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_in_file_sinks.md)

**Description:** Attackers can manipulate the log file path to write logs to arbitrary locations on the file system.

**How Serilog Contributes:** If the file path for a `File` sink is dynamically constructed based on user input or external configuration without proper validation, an attacker could inject path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`) to write logs outside the intended directory.

**Example:** A configuration setting allows specifying the log directory. An attacker manipulates this setting to write logs to a system directory, potentially overwriting critical files.

**Impact:** Overwriting critical system files, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive files, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Avoid dynamically constructing file paths based on external input.
- Use absolute paths or relative paths from a fixed, secure base directory.
- Implement strict validation and sanitization of any user-provided input that influences the log file path.
- Ensure the application has the least necessary privileges to write to the log directory.

## Attack Surface: [Credential Exposure in Sink Configurations](./attack_surfaces/credential_exposure_in_sink_configurations.md)

**Description:**  Credentials for database or network sinks are stored insecurely in configuration files or environment variables.

**How Serilog Contributes:** Serilog's configuration often includes connection strings or authentication details for sinks like databases or remote logging services. If these configurations are not properly secured, attackers gaining access to the configuration can obtain these credentials.

**Example:** A database connection string with username and password is stored in plain text in `appsettings.json`.

**Impact:** Compromise of database or external logging service, unauthorized access to data, potential for further attacks.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Avoid storing credentials directly in configuration files.
- Use secure credential management solutions like Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, or environment variables with restricted access.
- Encrypt sensitive configuration data.
- Implement proper access controls on configuration files.

## Attack Surface: [Injection Vulnerabilities in Custom Formatters or Enrichers](./attack_surfaces/injection_vulnerabilities_in_custom_formatters_or_enrichers.md)

**Description:**  Custom formatters or enrichers contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

**How Serilog Contributes:** Serilog allows developers to extend its functionality with custom formatters and enrichers. If these custom components are not developed securely, they can introduce vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A custom formatter uses string interpolation without proper escaping, allowing an attacker to inject code that gets executed during log formatting.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Thoroughly review and test custom formatters and enrichers for security vulnerabilities.
- Follow secure coding practices when developing custom components.
- Be cautious when using third-party or community-developed formatters/enrichers and ensure they are from trusted sources.
- Isolate custom components to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
