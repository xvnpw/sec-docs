## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal/Injection](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversalinjection.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the application's handling of file paths used by Serilog's file sink. By manipulating the path, they can write log data to arbitrary locations on the file system.

**Potential Impact:** This can lead to overwriting critical configuration files, injecting malicious code into executable locations, or reading sensitive files if the application's process has sufficient permissions.

**Why High-Risk:** Path traversal vulnerabilities are relatively common, and successful exploitation can have severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Credential Compromise for Cloud Logging Service](./attack_tree_paths/credential_compromise_for_cloud_logging_service.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the credentials used by the application to authenticate with the cloud logging service (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor). This could be through phishing, exploiting other vulnerabilities, or insider threats.

**Potential Impact:** With compromised credentials, the attacker can access, manipulate, or delete log data, potentially hiding malicious activity or gaining access to sensitive information logged in the cloud.

**Why High-Risk:** Credential compromise is a frequent attack vector, and cloud logging services often contain valuable information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Direct Access to Log Files](./attack_tree_paths/direct_access_to_log_files.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker gains direct access to the server or storage location where Serilog's log files are stored. This could be due to weak server security, misconfigured permissions, or vulnerabilities in the underlying infrastructure.

**Potential Impact:** If log files contain sensitive information (e.g., API keys, user data, internal system details), the attacker can directly read and exfiltrate this data.

**Why High-Risk:**  Insecurely stored log files are a common oversight, and the effort required for this attack is often low.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access to Log Management Systems](./attack_tree_paths/access_to_log_management_systems.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker compromises the log management system used to aggregate and analyze Serilog's logs (e.g., Elasticsearch, Splunk). This could be through exploiting vulnerabilities in the log management system itself or through compromised credentials.

**Potential Impact:**  Similar to direct access to log files, the attacker can read sensitive information. Additionally, they might be able to manipulate or delete logs to cover their tracks.

**Why High-Risk:** Log management systems often contain a wealth of information and are attractive targets for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access to Serilog Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/access_to_serilog_configuration_files.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the configuration files used by Serilog. This could be due to insecure file storage permissions or vulnerabilities in the application's deployment process.

**Potential Impact:** By modifying the configuration, the attacker can disable logging entirely (hindering detection), redirect logs to a malicious sink under their control, or reduce the logging level to hide their malicious activities.

**Why High-Risk:**  Compromising the logging configuration can significantly impair security monitoring and enable further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overwrite Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/overwrite_configuration_files.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Achieved through the "Path Traversal/Injection" high-risk path.

**Potential Impact:** Overwriting configuration files can allow the attacker to change application behavior, disable security features, or even gain remote code execution depending on how the application loads and uses its configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code (if executable)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code__if_executable_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Achieved through the "Path Traversal/Injection" high-risk path.

**Potential Impact:** Successfully writing malicious code to a location where it can be executed by the application or the operating system leads to complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary SQL Queries](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_sql_queries.md)

**Attack Vector:** Achieved through "SQL Injection via Unsanitized Log Data". If the application uses a direct SQL sink and doesn't properly sanitize log data, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the log messages.

**Potential Impact:**  Arbitrary SQL execution allows the attacker to read, modify, or delete data in the database, potentially leading to data breaches or application takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Database Records](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_database_records.md)

**Attack Vector:** Achieved through "NoSQL Injection via Unsanitized Log Data". Similar to SQL injection, but targeting NoSQL databases.

**Potential Impact:** The attacker can modify or delete records in the NoSQL database, potentially disrupting the application's functionality or corrupting data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Read Sensitive Information (via Direct Access to Log Files or Access to Log Management Systems)](./attack_tree_paths/read_sensitive_information__via_direct_access_to_log_files_or_access_to_log_management_systems_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Achieved through the respective high-risk paths.

**Potential Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive information contained within the logs can lead to data breaches, identity theft, or further attacks leveraging the exposed credentials or data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_configuration.md)

**Attack Vector:** Achieved through "Exploiting Configuration Reloading Mechanisms". If the application allows dynamic reloading of configuration, an attacker can inject malicious settings.

**Potential Impact:**  Similar to overwriting configuration files, this can lead to changes in application behavior, security bypasses, or even remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Injection, Path Traversal, etc. (via Vulnerabilities in Custom Sink Implementations)](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection__path_traversal__etc___via_vulnerabilities_in_custom_sink_implementations_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Vulnerabilities in custom-developed logging sinks can be directly exploited.

**Potential Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server or the ability to read or write arbitrary files.
