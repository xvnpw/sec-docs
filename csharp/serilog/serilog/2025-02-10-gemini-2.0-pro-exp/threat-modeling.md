# Threat Model Analysis for serilog/serilog

## Threat: [Forged Log Entry Injection](./threats/forged_log_entry_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Forged Log Entry Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious log messages or manipulates Serilog's configuration to inject false or misleading entries into the log stream.  This leverages vulnerabilities *within Serilog components* like custom formatters, enrichers, or sinks, or exploits how Serilog processes attacker-provided data *if* that data is directly passed to Serilog without proper application-level validation. The attacker might inject malicious code (SQL, XSS, etc.) into log messages, hoping for execution by log analysis tools.
    *   **Impact:** Compromised log integrity, leading to incorrect analysis, false alerts, or missed security incidents. If injected data is interpreted by a vulnerable log viewer, it could lead to further compromise (e.g., XSS in a log dashboard, SQL injection in a log database).
    *   **Affected Serilog Component:**
        *   Custom `ITextFormatter` implementations.
        *   Custom `ILogEventEnricher` implementations.
        *   Custom `ILogEventSink` implementations.
        *   Configuration loading mechanisms (if configuration is loaded from an untrusted source *and* Serilog itself has a vulnerability in how it handles that configuration).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Validate and sanitize all input *before* passing it to Serilog. This is primarily an application-level responsibility, but it's crucial for preventing injection into Serilog.
        *   Avoid using custom formatters, enrichers, or sinks unless absolutely necessary. If custom components are required, thoroughly audit them for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Load Serilog configuration from a trusted, read-only source.
        *   Use parameterized logging where possible.
        *   Encode or escape special characters in log messages (again, primarily an application-level responsibility, but impacts Serilog's output).

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure

    *   **Description:** The application inadvertently logs sensitive information (passwords, API keys, PII, etc.) *through Serilog*. This happens when developers directly pass sensitive data to Serilog's logging methods without redaction. The vulnerability lies in how the *application uses* Serilog, not in Serilog itself, but Serilog is the *mechanism* of exposure.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, leading to identity theft, financial loss, privacy violations, or other serious consequences.
    *   **Affected Serilog Component:**
        *   `ILogger` interface (as the entry point for logging).
        *   Custom `ITextFormatter` implementations (if they expose sensitive data).
        *   Custom `ILogEventEnricher` implementations (if they add sensitive data).
        *   Any sink that stores or transmits logs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never log sensitive data directly.** Implement strict coding guidelines.
        *   Use redaction, masking, or tokenization *before* passing data to Serilog.
        *   Carefully review and audit any custom formatters or enrichers.
        *   Store logs securely and use secure transport.
        *   Consider Serilog sinks with built-in redaction (if available and trusted).
        *   Implement data loss prevention (DLP) policies.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Log Flooding (Serilog-Specific Aspects)](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_log_flooding__serilog-specific_aspects_.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Log Flooding (Serilog-Specific Aspects)

    *   **Description:** While the *attack* is often application-level (flooding with requests), Serilog's configuration and choice of sinks directly impact its vulnerability.  A *synchronous* sink, a poorly configured `WriteTo.Async()`, or a sink with inherent limitations (e.g., slow network connection) can make Serilog a bottleneck, causing the application to become unresponsive. This focuses on the *Serilog-specific* aspects of DoS, not general application DoS.
    *   **Impact:** Application downtime, resource exhaustion, and potential loss of legitimate log entries *due to Serilog's inability to handle the load*.
    *   **Affected Serilog Component:**
        *   All sinks, especially synchronous sinks.
        *   `WriteTo.Async()` (if the asynchronous queue is misconfigured or overwhelmed).
        *   Sinks with inherent performance limitations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use asynchronous sinks (`WriteTo.Async()`) with *carefully considered queue limits and overflow handling*.
        *   Configure sinks with appropriate timeouts and error handling.
        *   Use a robust logging infrastructure (external logging service, etc.).
        *   Consider "lossy" sinks that drop entries under extreme load to prioritize application availability. This is a *Serilog-specific* mitigation.

## Threat: [Configuration Tampering (Direct Serilog Impact)](./threats/configuration_tampering__direct_serilog_impact_.md)

*   **Threat:** Configuration Tampering (Direct Serilog Impact)

    *   **Description:** An attacker modifies the Serilog configuration file to disable logging, change log levels, redirect logs to a less secure location, or *inject malicious sinks or enrichers that Serilog will then execute*. This focuses on the direct impact on Serilog's behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of logging, misdirection of logs, or potential execution of malicious code *through Serilog's sink/enricher mechanisms*.
    *   **Affected Serilog Component:**
        *   Configuration loading mechanisms (e.g., `ReadFrom.Configuration()`).
        *   The configuration file itself.
        *   *Potentially*, any sink or enricher loaded via configuration if Serilog has a vulnerability in how it instantiates or uses them.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Protect the Serilog configuration file with strict access controls.
        *   Implement file integrity monitoring (FIM) on the configuration file.
        *   Load configuration from a trusted, read-only source.

## Threat: [Sink Vulnerability Exploitation (Direct Serilog Sink)](./threats/sink_vulnerability_exploitation__direct_serilog_sink_.md)

*   **Threat:** Sink Vulnerability Exploitation (Direct Serilog Sink)

    *   **Description:** A vulnerability *within a specific Serilog sink* (especially a custom or third-party sink) is exploited. This is a direct threat to Serilog because the vulnerable code *is part of the Serilog ecosystem*. The consequences depend on the sink's functionality (e.g., SQL injection in a database sink, RCE in a sink that executes external commands).
    *   **Impact:** Varies widely, but could include data leakage, remote code execution, or other severe consequences *stemming directly from the Serilog sink*.
    *   **Affected Serilog Component:**
        *   Specific `ILogEventSink` implementations (especially custom or third-party).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Variable (High to Critical, depending on the sink and vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and audit any custom or third-party sinks.
        *   Keep all sinks up to date.
        *   Use well-established and actively maintained sinks.
        *   Isolate sinks requiring elevated privileges.
        *   Follow secure coding practices for custom sinks.

## Threat: [Insecure Log Transmission](./threats/insecure_log_transmission.md)

* **Threat:** Insecure Log Transmission
    * **Description:** Serilog is configured to send logs over an unencrypted channel (e.g., plain HTTP). An attacker intercepts the log stream. This is a direct threat because the *configuration of Serilog* dictates the insecure transmission.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data contained in logs.
    * **Affected Serilog Component:**
        *   Network-based sinks (e.g., `WriteTo.Http`, `WriteTo.Tcp`, `WriteTo.Udp`, `WriteTo.Syslog` - *when used without encryption*).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use secure transport protocols (HTTPS, TLS, encrypted syslog) for *all* network-based sinks.
        *   Ensure proper certificate validation.
