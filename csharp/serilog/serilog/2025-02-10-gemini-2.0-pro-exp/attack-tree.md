## Attack Tree Path: [A [CRITICAL]: Exploit Sink Vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection via SQL Server Sink)](./attack_tree_paths/a__critical__exploit_sink_vulnerabilities__e_g___sql_injection_via_sql_server_sink_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities within the Serilog sinks themselves. Sinks are the components that write log data to various destinations (databases, files, cloud services, etc.). If a sink has a vulnerability, and the application logs unsanitized user input, an attacker can exploit this to compromise the system. The most common and dangerous example is SQL injection through a database sink.
    *   **Example:**
        *   The application logs user-provided search terms without proper sanitization.
        *   The application uses the Serilog.Sinks.MSSqlServer sink to write logs to a SQL Server database.
        *   An attacker enters a malicious search term containing SQL injection code (e.g., `' OR 1=1; --`).
        *   The sink, lacking proper parameterization, directly incorporates the malicious input into the SQL query.
        *   The attacker's SQL code executes on the database server, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data, or even execute operating system commands.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (Highly dependent on the specific sink used and the application's input validation practices. SQL injection is a prevalent vulnerability if not addressed.)
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Can lead to complete data breaches, database compromise, and potentially full system compromise.)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Exploiting a known SQL injection vulnerability can be relatively straightforward with automated tools.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Requires understanding of SQL injection and the target sink's behavior.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Sophisticated SQL injection attacks can be difficult to detect without proper logging, intrusion detection, and database monitoring. Web application firewalls (WAFs) may offer some protection, but can often be bypassed.)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Before logging *any* data, especially data from user input, rigorously validate and sanitize it. Use whitelisting approaches whenever possible. Assume all logged data could be malicious.
        *   **Parameterized Queries (for Database Sinks):** If using a database sink, *always* use parameterized queries or stored procedures. Never construct SQL queries by concatenating strings with logged data.
        *   **Sink-Specific Security Best Practices:** Thoroughly review the security documentation for *each* sink used. Some sinks may have specific configuration options or recommendations to mitigate vulnerabilities. Ensure you are using the latest version of the sink and that any known vulnerabilities are patched.
        *   **Least Privilege:** The database user (or other credential) used by the sink should have the absolute minimum necessary permissions. It should *only* be able to write to the logging table/resource, not read other data or perform administrative actions.
        *   **Regular Security Audits of Sinks:** Treat sinks as third-party dependencies and include them in your regular security audits and penetration testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [B [CRITICAL]: Leverage Unintended Data Exposure in Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/b__critical__leverage_unintended_data_exposure_in_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector involves exploiting misconfigurations where sensitive information, such as API keys, connection strings, or passwords, are inadvertently exposed in Serilog's configuration (e.g., `appsettings.json`, environment variables). This isn't a Serilog vulnerability itself, but a common and dangerous misconfiguration that directly impacts the security of the logging system.
    *   **Example:**
        *   The application uses a Serilog sink that requires an API key for authentication.
        *   The API key is stored directly in the `appsettings.json` file.
        *   The `appsettings.json` file is accidentally committed to a public source code repository.
        *   An attacker discovers the exposed API key in the repository.
        *   The attacker uses the API key to access the logging service and exfiltrate sensitive data.
        *   Alternatively, if the configuration file is accessible via a misconfigured web server, the attacker could directly download it.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (A common mistake, especially in development environments or with insufficient configuration management practices.)
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Exposure of credentials can lead to significant breaches and compromise of the logging service or other connected systems.)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low (Simply viewing a publicly accessible configuration file or inspecting environment variables.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice (No specialized skills are required; just access to the configuration.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Unless there's specific monitoring for configuration file access, changes, or exposure in public repositories, this is unlikely to be detected proactively.)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Never Store Secrets Directly in Configuration Files:** Use environment variables, a secrets manager (e.g., Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault), or a dedicated configuration provider that supports secure storage.
        *   **Configuration File Permissions:** Ensure configuration files have restrictive permissions, limiting access to only authorized users/processes.
        *   **Regularly Review Configuration:** Audit configuration files for any accidentally exposed secrets. Implement processes to prevent secrets from being committed to source code repositories (e.g., pre-commit hooks, secrets scanning tools).
        *   **Environment Variable Security:** If using environment variables, ensure they are set securely and are not exposed to unauthorized users or processes.
