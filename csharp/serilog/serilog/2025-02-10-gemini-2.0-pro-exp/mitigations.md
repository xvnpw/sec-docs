# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for serilog/serilog

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Data Masking/Redaction (Serilog-Centric)](./mitigation_strategies/1__data_maskingredaction__serilog-centric_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement data masking and redaction *within Serilog* using `IDestructuringPolicy` or `Destructure.ByMasking()`.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Create a list of sensitive data fields.
    2.  **Choose a Redaction Method:**
        *   **Custom `IDestructuringPolicy` (Recommended):** Create a class implementing `IDestructuringPolicy`. In the `TryDestructure` method:
            *   Check the object type.
            *   If sensitive, iterate through properties.
            *   Redact sensitive properties (replace with "[REDACTED]", "****", a hash, etc.).
            *   Return `true` if handled, `false` otherwise.
        *   **`Destructure.ByMasking()`:** For simple cases, use `Destructure.ByMasking()` in Serilog's configuration. Specify properties to mask and the masking value.
    3.  **Integrate with Serilog:**
        *   **`IDestructuringPolicy`:** Register with Serilog: `.Destructure.With<MyRedactionPolicy>()`.
        *   **`Destructure.ByMasking()`:** Use directly in configuration: `.Destructure.ByMasking(x => x.Password, "****")`.
    4.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test redaction with unit tests, including negative tests.
    5.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review sensitive data lists and redaction logic.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs (Severity: High):** Prevents sensitive data from being written to logs.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Severity: High):** Helps meet compliance requirements.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Risk significantly reduced. Effectiveness depends on thoroughness.
    *   **Compliance Violations:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example:** Partially implemented. Basic `IDestructuringPolicy` redacts "Password" and "ApiKey".
    *   **Example:** Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Example:** Current policy needs expansion to cover all sensitive data sources and complex objects. Lacks comprehensive unit tests.
    *   **Example:** Need to implement `IDestructuringPolicy` in `LoggingService` and add unit tests.

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Selective Logging (Serilog Filters)](./mitigation_strategies/2__selective_logging__serilog_filters_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Use Serilog's filtering capabilities (`.Filter.ByExcluding()`, `.Filter.ByIncluding()`) to control which log events are written.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Log Events to Filter:** Determine which log events are unnecessary or contain potentially sensitive information.  Consider filtering by:
        *   **Source Context:** Exclude logs from specific classes or modules (e.g., authentication modules).
        *   **Property Values:** Exclude logs where a specific property has a certain value (e.g., exclude logs with a "Status" of "Debug").
        *   **Log Level:** Exclude logs below a certain level (e.g., exclude `Verbose` and `Debug` in production).
    2.  **Implement Filters:**
        *   **`.Filter.ByExcluding()`:** Exclude events matching a predicate.  Example: `.Filter.ByExcluding(Matching.FromSource("AuthenticationModule"))`.
        *   **`.Filter.ByIncluding()`:** Include *only* events matching a predicate.
    3.  **Combine Filters:** Use multiple filters to create complex filtering logic.
    4.  **Test Filters:** Verify that filters are working as expected.  Create log events that should be included and excluded, and check the output.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs (Severity: High):** Reduces the *likelihood* of logging sensitive data by filtering out unnecessary logs.
    *   **Log Volume and Storage Costs (Severity: Low):** Reduces log volume.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Risk reduced, but not eliminated. Complements data redaction.
    *   **Log Volume:** Can significantly reduce volume.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example:** Not implemented.
    *   **Example:** Implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Example:** Serilog filters are not currently used.  Implement filters to exclude logs from sensitive modules and to control log levels in different environments.
        *   **Example:** Need to add unit tests for filters.

## Mitigation Strategy: [3. Structured Logging (Enforcement via Serilog)](./mitigation_strategies/3__structured_logging__enforcement_via_serilog_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce structured logging *through Serilog's configuration and usage*, preventing direct string concatenation. This is less about a specific *feature* and more about *how* Serilog is used.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Consistent Message Templates:** *Always* use message templates and named properties: `Log.Information("User {Username} did {Action}.", username, action);`.
    2.  **Avoid String Concatenation:** *Never* concatenate user input directly: `Log.Information("User " + username + " did " + action);`.
    3.  **Centralized Configuration (Best Practice with Serilog):** Use a centralized configuration to enforce consistent logging practices across the application. This helps ensure that all developers are using Serilog in the same way.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Log Injection Attacks (Severity: High):** Prevents log forging, log poisoning, and some DoS attacks.
    *   **Log Forging (Severity: High):** Prevents fake log entries.
    *   **Log Poisoning (Severity: High):** Prevents code injection into logs.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Log Injection Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced with consistent enforcement.
    *   **Log Forging/Poisoning:** Risk virtually eliminated with correct usage.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example:** Partially implemented. Developers are aware, but no strict enforcement.
    *   **Example:** Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Example:** Stricter code review guidelines are needed. While external tools can help, the core principle is *how* Serilog's API is used.
    *   **Example:** Need to implement code review guidelines.

## Mitigation Strategy: [4. Log Enrichment Control (Serilog Enrichers)](./mitigation_strategies/4__log_enrichment_control__serilog_enrichers_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Carefully review and control Serilog enrichers to prevent them from adding sensitive data to log events.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Existing Enrichers:** Examine all configured enrichers (both built-in and custom).
    2.  **Identify Potential Risks:** Determine if any enrichers are adding sensitive data (e.g., user IDs, IP addresses, request headers).
    3.  **Modify or Remove Enrichers:**
        *   If an enricher is adding sensitive data unnecessarily, remove it or modify it to exclude the sensitive information.
        *   If an enricher *must* add potentially sensitive data, ensure that data redaction (Mitigation #1) is in place to handle it.
    4.  **`LogContext` Caution:** Be extremely careful with `LogContext`. Avoid pushing sensitive data onto the context unless absolutely necessary and redaction is robust.
    5.  **Custom Enricher Review:** Thoroughly review any custom enrichers to ensure they are not introducing security risks.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs (Severity: High):** Prevents enrichers from inadvertently adding sensitive data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Risk reduced, depending on the specific enrichers used.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example:** Not implemented. No specific review of enrichers has been performed.
    *   **Example:** Implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Example:** A comprehensive review of all configured enrichers is needed.  Specific attention should be paid to `LogContext` usage.
    *   **Example:** Need to add unit tests for enrichers.
