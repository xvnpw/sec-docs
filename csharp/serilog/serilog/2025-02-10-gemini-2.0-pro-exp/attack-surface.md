# Attack Surface Analysis for serilog/serilog

## Attack Surface: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs](./attack_surfaces/sensitive_data_exposure_in_logs.md)

*   **Description:**  Accidental or intentional logging of sensitive information (passwords, API keys, PII, etc.) facilitated by Serilog's logging mechanisms.
*   **Serilog Contribution:** Serilog's ease of use and flexible configuration, including structured logging, can make it easy to inadvertently log sensitive data if not used with extreme care. The core issue is *misuse* of Serilog, not a vulnerability *in* Serilog.
*   **Example:**  Logging the entire contents of an `HttpRequest` object (which includes headers like `Authorization`), or a user object containing a password hash, directly through Serilog's logging methods.
*   **Impact:**  Data breach, unauthorized access to systems, compliance violations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.), reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Data Masking/Redaction (Serilog-Specific):** Implement Serilog *enrichers* or custom *sinks* to automatically redact or mask sensitive data *before* it's written to the log. This is the most Serilog-centric mitigation.
    *   **Strict Logging Policies:** Establish and enforce clear guidelines on what *cannot* be logged.  This is crucial, regardless of the logging framework.
    *   **Avoid Logging Entire Objects:** Log only specific, non-sensitive fields, rather than entire complex objects.
    *   **Use Log Levels Appropriately:** Avoid verbose log levels (e.g., `Debug`) in production.
    *   **Secure Configuration (Serilog-Related):** Store sensitive sink configuration (e.g., database credentials for a database sink) securely, using environment variables or a secrets management service, *not* hardcoded in Serilog configuration files.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Periodically review log files and Serilog configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Overly Permissive Sink Configuration](./attack_surfaces/overly_permissive_sink_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**  Misconfiguring Serilog sinks with excessive permissions or exposing them to untrusted networks. This is a direct configuration issue with how Serilog is used.
*   **Serilog Contribution:** Serilog's flexibility in supporting various sinks (file, database, network, etc.) means that incorrect configuration directly leads to vulnerabilities. The vulnerability lies in the *configuration* of the Serilog sink.
*   **Example:**  A file sink writing to a world-writable directory (`777` permissions). A database sink using a default password and exposed publicly.
*   **Impact:**  Data breach, log file tampering, denial of service (if logs fill a critical disk), potential for code execution (depending on the sink).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Serilog-Specific):**  Grant Serilog sinks *only* the minimum necessary permissions. A file sink should only have write access to its specific log file.
    *   **Strong Authentication (Serilog-Specific):**  Use strong, unique passwords or other authentication for sinks that require credentials (databases, network services). Configure these securely within the Serilog configuration.
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate Serilog sinks from untrusted networks using firewalls and ACLs. This is a general security practice, but directly impacts Serilog sink security.
    *   **Encryption (Serilog-Specific):**  Configure Serilog sinks to encrypt log data in transit (e.g., using TLS for network sinks) and at rest (if the sink supports it, or through underlying file system encryption).
    *   **Regular Configuration Review (Serilog-Specific):**  Periodically audit *Serilog sink configurations* to ensure they remain secure.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization in Custom Sinks](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization_in_custom_sinks.md)

*   **Description:**  Custom Serilog sinks that deserialize log event data insecurely, creating a direct vulnerability.
*   **Serilog Contribution:** Serilog's extensibility allows developers to create custom sinks.  This *custom code* is where the vulnerability lies, but it's a direct consequence of using Serilog's extensibility features.
*   **Example:**  A custom sink receiving JSON data and using a vulnerable JSON deserializer without type checking.
*   **Impact:**  Remote code execution, complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Deserialization Libraries (Serilog-Specific):** Within the *custom sink code*, use well-vetted, secure deserialization libraries.
    *   **Type Checking and Whitelisting (Serilog-Specific):**  In the *custom sink*, implement strict type checking and whitelisting during deserialization.
    *   **Avoid Untrusted Sources:** If possible, avoid having the custom sink deserialize data from untrusted sources.
    *   **Code Review and Testing (Serilog-Specific):** Thoroughly review and test any *custom Serilog sink code* for deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Sink Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_sink_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Using a Serilog sink *package* that has known vulnerabilities.
*   **Serilog Contribution:** Serilog relies on external sink packages. The vulnerability is *in the sink package*, not Serilog itself, but it's a direct consequence of using Serilog with that specific sink.
*   **Example:**  Using an outdated version of `Serilog.Sinks.MSSqlServer` with a known SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the sink vulnerability, but could range from data leaks to remote code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific sink vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates (Serilog-Specific):** Keep all Serilog *sink packages* up to date. Use package managers (NuGet, etc.) to manage and update these dependencies.
    *   **Dependency Scanning (Serilog-Specific):** Use a software composition analysis (SCA) tool or dependency vulnerability scanner to identify vulnerabilities in Serilog *sink dependencies*.
    *   **Vet Third-Party Sinks:** Carefully evaluate the security of any third-party Serilog sinks before using them.
