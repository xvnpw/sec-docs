## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Administrative Control of NopCommerce Application (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_administrative_control_of_nopcommerce_application__critical_node_.md)

This represents the attacker's ultimate objective. Success at this point means the attacker has full control over the NopCommerce store, including data, configurations, and functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Security Vulnerabilities in NopCommerce Core (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_security_vulnerabilities_in_nopcommerce_core__critical_node_.md)

Attackers target publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the core NopCommerce platform. These vulnerabilities are often well-documented, and exploit code may be readily available. Successful exploitation can lead to various outcomes, including remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain complete control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify and Exploit Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/identify_and_exploit_publicly_disclosed_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

This attack path involves the attacker actively searching for and leveraging known vulnerabilities in specific versions of NopCommerce. They use resources like CVE databases and security advisories to identify exploitable weaknesses. The likelihood is higher because these vulnerabilities are already known and documented.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in NopCommerce Plugins/Themes (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_nopcommerce_pluginsthemes__critical_node_.md)

NopCommerce's extensibility through plugins and themes introduces a significant attack surface. Attackers target vulnerabilities within these third-party components. These vulnerabilities can range from SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to insecure file uploads and remote code execution. The impact can be significant as plugins often have access to sensitive data and core functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Target Popular/Widely Used Plugins with Known Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/target_popularwidely_used_plugins_with_known_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in plugins that are widely used across many NopCommerce installations. The likelihood is higher because popular plugins are often scrutinized by security researchers, and vulnerabilities are more likely to be discovered and potentially exploited on a larger scale.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Configuration Defaults (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_configuration_defaults__critical_node_.md)

This category of attacks targets instances where the default security configurations of NopCommerce have not been changed or hardened. This includes leaving default administrative credentials in place, which provides a direct and easy path to gaining control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default Administrative Credentials (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_administrative_credentials__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

This is a straightforward attack where the attacker attempts to log in to the administrative panel using common default usernames and passwords provided with the initial NopCommerce installation. If the administrator has not changed these defaults, the attacker gains immediate and complete control of the application. The likelihood depends on the administrator's security awareness, but the impact is critical, and the effort is minimal.
