# Attack Surface Analysis for nopsolutions/nopcommerce

## Attack Surface: [Third-Party Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/third-party_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws (e.g., SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting - XSS, Remote Code Execution - RCE) present in plugins developed by third-party vendors.
*   **How nopCommerce Contributes:** nopCommerce's architecture heavily relies on plugins for extending functionality. The platform itself doesn't inherently control the security of these external components.
*   **Example:** A vulnerable payment gateway plugin allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries to steal customer data.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches (customer information, payment details), website defacement, complete compromise of the nopCommerce installation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization in plugin code.
        *   Follow secure coding practices (e.g., OWASP guidelines).
        *   Regularly update plugin dependencies and address known vulnerabilities.
        *   Provide clear documentation on security considerations for plugin usage.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Thoroughly vet plugins before installation, checking developer reputation and reviews.
        *   Only install plugins from trusted sources (official nopCommerce marketplace or reputable developers).
        *   Keep plugins updated to the latest versions.
        *   Regularly review installed plugins and remove any that are unused or outdated.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection in Customizations or Plugins](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_in_customizations_or_plugins.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities where attackers can inject malicious SQL queries into the application's database through custom code or poorly written plugins.
*   **How nopCommerce Contributes:**  The flexibility to add custom functionality and the reliance on plugins can introduce SQL injection points if developers don't use parameterized queries or ORM features correctly.
*   **Example:** A custom search functionality in a plugin that directly concatenates user input into a SQL query, allowing an attacker to extract sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches (customer information, order details, administrative credentials), potential for database manipulation or deletion.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Always use parameterized queries or an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) like Entity Framework Core** provided by nopCommerce.
        *   Never directly concatenate user input into SQL queries.
        *   Implement proper input validation and sanitization on the server-side.
        *   Conduct thorough code reviews and security testing.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Primarily a development concern, but choosing reputable plugin developers helps mitigate this risk indirectly.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_uploads.md)

*   **Description:**  Allowing users (including potentially malicious actors) to upload arbitrary files to the server without proper validation, leading to various attacks.
*   **How nopCommerce Contributes:** Features like product image uploads, customer avatars, or potentially plugin-specific file upload functionalities can be vulnerable if not implemented securely.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploading a malicious PHP script disguised as an image, which can then be executed on the server, leading to remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, website defacement, information disclosure, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Validate file types and extensions rigorously on the server-side.**
        *   **Store uploaded files outside the webroot** to prevent direct execution.
        *   **Rename uploaded files** to prevent predictable URLs.
        *   Implement file size limits.
        *   Scan uploaded files for malware if feasible.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Be cautious about the file upload functionalities provided by plugins and ensure they are from trusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Sensitive Information in Configuration Files or Logs](./attack_surfaces/exposed_sensitive_information_in_configuration_files_or_logs.md)

*   **Description:**  Accidental or intentional exposure of sensitive data like database credentials, API keys, or internal paths in configuration files or log files.
*   **How nopCommerce Contributes:**  Improperly secured configuration files or overly verbose logging can expose sensitive information.
*   **Example:** Database connection strings with plaintext credentials stored in a publicly accessible configuration file.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Never store sensitive information in plaintext in configuration files.** Use environment variables, secure configuration management tools, or encryption.
        *   Ensure log files are stored securely and access is restricted.
        *   Avoid logging sensitive data unnecessarily.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Ensure proper file permissions are set on configuration and log files on the server.
        *   Regularly review server configurations and log settings.

## Attack Surface: [Brute-Force Attacks on Admin or Customer Accounts](./attack_surfaces/brute-force_attacks_on_admin_or_customer_accounts.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempting to guess usernames and passwords to gain unauthorized access.
*   **How nopCommerce Contributes:** Weak default password policies or the absence of account lockout mechanisms can make nopCommerce installations vulnerable.
*   **Example:** Attackers repeatedly trying common password combinations against the administrator login page.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to administrative functionalities or customer accounts, leading to data breaches or manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies (minimum length, complexity requirements).
        *   Implement account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of failed login attempts.
        *   Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative accounts.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts.
        *   Enable multi-factor authentication where available.
        *   Regularly change passwords.
