Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

**1. Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):**

*   **Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to the nopCommerce application.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploit Default Credentials (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):**
        *   **Weak Default Admin Password (Critical Node):**
            *   **Description:** The nopCommerce application is deployed with a default administrator password that is easily guessable or publicly known.
            *   **Attacker Action:** The attacker attempts to log in to the administrator panel using the default credentials.
            *   **Impact:** Full administrative access to the nopCommerce application, allowing the attacker to control all aspects of the system and its data.
    *   **Bypass Authentication Mechanisms (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):**
        *   **SQL Injection in Login Form (Critical Node):**
            *   **Description:** The login form is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing an attacker to manipulate the database query used for authentication.
            *   **Attacker Action:** The attacker crafts malicious SQL queries within the username or password fields to bypass the authentication check.
            *   **Impact:** Successful bypass of the authentication mechanism, granting the attacker unauthorized access to user accounts or administrative privileges.

**2. Exploit Data Handling Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):**

*   **Goal:** Compromise the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of data within the nopCommerce application.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):**
        *   **Exploiting Unsanitized User Input in Search Functionality (Critical Node):**
            *   **Description:** The search functionality does not properly sanitize user input before incorporating it into database queries.
            *   **Attacker Action:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the search bar.
            *   **Impact:**  Data breach (access to sensitive information), data manipulation (altering or deleting data), or potentially remote code execution on the database server.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):**
        *   **Stored XSS in Product Descriptions or Reviews (Critical Node):**
            *   **Description:** The application allows users to input data (e.g., in product descriptions or reviews) that is not properly sanitized before being displayed to other users.
            *   **Attacker Action:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a product description or review. This script is then stored in the database and executed when other users view the affected page.
            *   **Impact:** Session hijacking (stealing user session cookies), defacement of the website, redirection to malicious sites, or potentially further exploitation of the user's browser.
    *   **Insecure File Uploads (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):**
        *   **Uploading Malicious Scripts as Product Images (Critical Node):**
            *   **Description:** The application does not properly validate the type and content of uploaded files, allowing users to upload executable scripts disguised as image files.
            *   **Attacker Action:** The attacker uploads a malicious script (e.g., a PHP web shell) disguised as a product image.
            *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the web server, allowing the attacker to gain control of the server and potentially the entire application and its data.

**3. Exploit Plugin/Extension Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):**

*   **Goal:** Compromise the nopCommerce application by exploiting vulnerabilities within its installed plugins or extensions.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Installed Plugins (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Popular Plugins (Critical Node):**
            *   **Description:** Widely used nopCommerce plugins contain publicly known security vulnerabilities that have not been patched.
            *   **Attacker Action:** The attacker identifies the installed plugins and their versions, then searches for and exploits known vulnerabilities using readily available exploits or tools.
            *   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability and the plugin's functionality, but it can range from data breaches and remote code execution to denial of service or privilege escalation.
