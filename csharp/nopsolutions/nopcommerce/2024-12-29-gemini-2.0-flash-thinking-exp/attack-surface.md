Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving nopCommerce, with high and critical risk severity:

*   **Admin Panel Brute-Force and Weak Credentials**
    *   **Description:** Attackers attempting to guess admin credentials through repeated login attempts or exploiting weak default passwords.
    *   **How nopCommerce Contributes:** The admin panel is the central control point for the application. Default installations might have predictable admin usernames or weak default passwords if not changed.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses automated tools to try common username/password combinations against the admin login page, eventually gaining access.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the nopCommerce store, including access to customer data, financial information, and the ability to modify the website.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Enforce strong password policies for admin accounts. Implement account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed login attempts. Consider multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin logins. Provide clear guidance on changing default credentials during installation.
        *   **Users:** Immediately change default admin credentials upon installation. Use strong, unique passwords for all admin accounts. Enable and configure account lockout features. Implement MFA for admin logins. Restrict admin panel access by IP address if feasible.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through CMS Content**
    *   **Description:** Attackers injecting malicious scripts into website content (e.g., product descriptions, blog posts, forum posts) that are then executed in the browsers of other users.
    *   **How nopCommerce Contributes:** nopCommerce allows users and administrators to input rich content through its CMS features. If input is not properly sanitized by the platform, it can become a vector for XSS attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects a script into a product description that steals session cookies of users viewing that product page.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, information theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and output encoding/escaping for all user-generated and admin-entered content within the nopCommerce core. Use context-aware encoding. Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources. Regularly scan the application for XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   **Users:**  Educate content creators about the risks of XSS and the importance of not copying content from untrusted sources. Review and sanitize user-generated content before publishing.

*   **SQL Injection through Specific nopCommerce Features**
    *   **Description:** Attackers injecting malicious SQL queries through input fields that are not properly sanitized within the nopCommerce core code, allowing them to interact with the database in unintended ways.
    *   **How nopCommerce Contributes:** Vulnerabilities in nopCommerce's core database interaction logic, such as in search filters or data processing routines, can lead to SQL injection.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in the product filtering mechanism allows an attacker to inject SQL code to extract sensitive customer data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, complete database compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions within the nopCommerce core. Implement strict input validation and sanitization. Follow secure coding practices for database access. Regularly perform static and dynamic analysis to identify SQL injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **Users:** Ensure the nopCommerce core is updated to the latest version, as updates often include patches for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

*   **File Upload Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:** Attackers uploading malicious files (e.g., web shells, malware) through file upload functionalities provided by nopCommerce (e.g., for product images, attachments).
    *   **How nopCommerce Contributes:** nopCommerce provides various file upload features for managing product images, downloads, and other content. If the platform's file upload handling is not properly secured, these can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP web shell disguised as an image through the product image upload feature, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data theft, website defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict file type validation based on content (magic numbers) rather than just file extensions within the nopCommerce core. Store uploaded files outside the webroot. Generate unique and unpredictable filenames for uploaded files. Integrate with malware scanning tools for uploaded files. Implement proper access controls on uploaded files.
        *   **Users:**  Restrict file upload permissions to trusted users only. Regularly review uploaded files for suspicious content.

*   **Multi-Store Privilege Escalation**
    *   **Description:** In multi-store nopCommerce installations, vulnerabilities within the nopCommerce core allowing an attacker with access to one store to gain unauthorized access or privileges in other stores within the same installation.
    *   **How nopCommerce Contributes:** The multi-store feature shares a common codebase and potentially a database. Improper isolation between stores within the core platform can lead to privilege escalation.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains admin access to a less secure store and leverages a vulnerability in nopCommerce's multi-store logic to access the admin panel of the main store.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of multiple stores, access to a wider range of customer data and functionalities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict access controls and data isolation between stores within the nopCommerce core. Thoroughly test multi-store functionality for privilege escalation vulnerabilities. Ensure proper session management and authentication across stores.
        *   **Users:**  Apply the same security measures to all stores within the installation. Regularly audit user roles and permissions across all stores. Limit the number of users with access to multiple stores.
