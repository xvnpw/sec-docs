# Attack Surface Analysis for nopsolutions/nopcommerce

## Attack Surface: [Third-Party Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/third-party_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities within installed plugins, often developed by external parties.
*   **nopCommerce Contribution:**  The plugin architecture and marketplace are core to nopCommerce's extensibility.  This reliance on third-party code for many features *inherently* creates this attack surface.  The platform's design encourages the use of plugins.
*   **Example:**  A poorly coded "Payment Gateway" plugin stores credit card details in plain text in the database, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
*   **Impact:**  Compromise of the entire store, data theft (including sensitive customer and payment data), unauthorized actions, potential server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:**  **Critical** to **High** (depending on the plugin's functionality and the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rigorous Plugin Selection:**  Choose only essential plugins from reputable developers with a proven track record of security and updates.  Prioritize plugins with minimal permissions.
    *   **Code Review (Critical Plugins):**  If feasible, conduct a thorough code review of *critical* plugins (e.g., payment gateways, shipping providers) before installation, focusing on security best practices.
    *   **Mandatory Updates:**  Implement a strict policy of immediately updating plugins to the latest versions upon release.  Automate this process where possible.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Utilize vulnerability scanners that specifically target nopCommerce and its plugins to identify known issues.
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Ensure plugins are granted *only* the absolute minimum necessary permissions within the nopCommerce system.  Review plugin permissions regularly.
    *   **Disable/Remove Unused Plugins:**  Actively remove or disable any plugins that are not absolutely essential to the store's operation.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured ACL (Access Control List)](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_acl__access_control_list_.md)

*   **Description:**  Incorrectly configured user roles and permissions, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.
*   **nopCommerce Contribution:**  nopCommerce's ACL system is a *core feature* for managing user access.  Its complexity and granularity, while powerful, increase the risk of misconfiguration.  The platform's reliance on this system for security makes proper configuration crucial.
*   **Example:**  A marketing user is accidentally granted permissions to access and modify order data, including customer payment information, due to an incorrectly configured role.
*   **Impact:**  Data breaches (customer data, order details, financial information), unauthorized modification of data, potential for privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:**  **High** to **Critical** (depending on the extent of the misconfiguration).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Least Privilege:**  Adhere rigorously to the principle of least privilege.  Grant users *only* the absolute minimum permissions required for their specific job functions.
    *   **Regular ACL Audits:**  Conduct frequent and thorough audits of the ACL configuration.  Review user roles, permissions, and group memberships.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Review:**  Ensure the RBAC implementation is well-defined, documented, and regularly reviewed for accuracy and appropriateness.
    *   **Comprehensive Testing:**  Thoroughly test access controls using different user accounts and roles to verify that permissions are enforced correctly.  Include negative testing (attempting unauthorized actions).
    *   **Documentation and Training:**  Maintain clear documentation of the ACL configuration and provide training to administrators on how to manage it securely.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:**  Failure to change default administrator credentials or using weak, easily guessable passwords for administrative accounts.
*   **nopCommerce Contribution:**  nopCommerce, like many applications, ships with default administrator credentials. While the platform *strongly recommends* changing these, the responsibility ultimately lies with the administrator. The presence of these default credentials is a direct contribution.
*   **Example:**  An attacker gains full administrative access to the nopCommerce backend by using the well-known default username and password.
*   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise, data theft, defacement, potential server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:**  **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediate Default Credential Change:**  The *very first* action after installing nopCommerce must be to change the default administrator credentials to strong, unique values.
    *   **Enforced Strong Password Policies:**  Implement and enforce strong password policies for *all* user accounts, especially administrative accounts.  This includes minimum length, complexity requirements, and regular password changes.
    *   **Mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Require MFA for *all* administrator accounts.  This adds a crucial layer of security even if passwords are compromised. (May require a plugin).
    *   **Account Lockout Policies:**  Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks against user accounts.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured External Authentication](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_external_authentication.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from improperly configured integrations with external authentication providers (e.g., Google, Facebook, OpenID Connect).
    * **nopCommerce Contribution:** nopCommerce's *built-in support* for various external authentication methods introduces this attack surface. The security relies heavily on the correct configuration of these integrations within nopCommerce.
    * **Example:** An improperly configured OpenID Connect integration fails to validate the `id_token` properly, allowing an attacker to forge tokens and impersonate any user.
    * **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and potentially administrative functions.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict Configuration Adherence:** Meticulously follow the official nopCommerce documentation and the provider's documentation when configuring external authentication. Pay *extreme* attention to security-related settings.
        * **Thorough Token Validation:** Ensure that *all* authentication tokens received from external providers are rigorously validated according to the relevant specifications (e.g., JWT validation for OpenID Connect).
        * **Up-to-Date Libraries:** Keep all libraries related to external authentication providers updated to their latest versions to patch any security vulnerabilities.
        * **Comprehensive Testing:** Regularly and thoroughly test the *entire* authentication flow for each external provider, including edge cases and error handling, to ensure it functions securely.
