# Threat Model Analysis for nopsolutions/nopcommerce

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Installation](./threats/malicious_plugin_installation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker convinces an administrator to install a malicious plugin, either through social engineering or by exploiting a vulnerability that allows for unauthorized plugin uploads. The plugin contains malicious code designed to achieve the attacker's goals.  This directly involves nopCommerce because the plugin system is a core feature.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data exfiltration, website defacement, malware distribution, financial fraud, denial of service. The attacker gains full control over the application.
*   **Affected Component:** Plugin system (`Nop.Services.Plugins`), potentially any part of the application depending on the plugin's code.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Plugin Vetting:** Only install plugins from trusted sources (official marketplace *and* reputable developers). Examine reviews, developer history, and update frequency.
    *   **Code Review (Ideal):** Perform a security-focused code review of the plugin's source code before installation.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run the nopCommerce application with the minimum necessary file system and database permissions.
    *   **Staging Environment:** Install and test new plugins in a staging environment *before* deploying to production.
    *   **Monitoring:** Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect unusual plugin activity.

## Threat: [Exploitation of a Vulnerable Plugin](./threats/exploitation_of_a_vulnerable_plugin.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits a vulnerability in a legitimate, but poorly coded, plugin. This could be a vulnerability like SQL injection, XSS, or any other web application vulnerability, but *specifically within the plugin's code*. The attacker uses the vulnerability to gain unauthorized access or manipulate data. This is a direct threat because plugins are integral to nopCommerce's extensibility.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability. Could range from information disclosure to complete system compromise (if the vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution).
*   **Affected Component:** The specific vulnerable plugin, and potentially other components if the vulnerability allows for privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Plugin Updates:** Keep all plugins updated to their latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use a vulnerability scanner that can identify known vulnerabilities in nopCommerce plugins.
    *   **Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular penetration testing to identify unknown vulnerabilities in plugins.

## Threat: [Default Administrator Credentials Brute-Force](./threats/default_administrator_credentials_brute-force.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker attempts to guess the default administrator username and password. If the administrator credentials haven't been changed after installation, the attacker gains full administrative access. This is a direct threat because it targets nopCommerce's built-in authentication.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker can modify any setting, install malicious plugins, steal data, etc.
*   **Affected Component:** Authentication system (`Nop.Services.Authentication`), Customer Service (`Nop.Services.Customers.CustomerService`), specifically the login and user management functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediate Credential Change:** Change the default administrator username and password *immediately* after installation.
    *   **Strong Passwords:** Use strong, unique passwords for all administrative accounts.
    *   **Account Lockout:** Implement account lockout policies.
    *   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Enable 2FA for all administrative accounts.

## Threat: [Misconfigured File Upload Settings](./threats/misconfigured_file_upload_settings.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits improperly configured file upload settings *within nopCommerce* to upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, malware) to the server. This often involves bypassing file type restrictions or uploading files to directories with execute permissions. This directly involves nopCommerce's file handling logic.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, system compromise, malware distribution.
*   **Affected Component:** File upload handling (`Nop.Services.Media.PictureService`, `Nop.Web.Framework.Controllers.BaseController` and related controllers that handle file uploads), configuration settings related to allowed file types and upload directories.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict File Type Validation:** Enforce strict server-side file type validation (whitelist approach).
    *   **Restricted Upload Directories:** Upload files to directories that are *not* web-accessible and do *not* have execute permissions.
    *   **File Renaming:** Rename uploaded files.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Use CSP to restrict executable content.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Unpatched nopCommerce Core Vulnerability](./threats/exploitation_of_unpatched_nopcommerce_core_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known, but unpatched, vulnerability in the *core nopCommerce code*. This directly impacts nopCommerce itself.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure to complete system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** The specific vulnerable component within the nopCommerce core codebase.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Apply security updates released by the nopCommerce team as soon as possible.
    *   **Security Notifications:** Subscribe to security notifications.
    *   **Staging Environment:** Test updates in a staging environment before deploying to production.

## Threat: [Data Breach due to Weak Database Encryption (nopCommerce Data Handling)](./threats/data_breach_due_to_weak_database_encryption__nopcommerce_data_handling_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker gains access to the nopCommerce database. If sensitive data stored *by nopCommerce* is not properly encrypted at rest, the attacker can read customer data.  This focuses on nopCommerce's responsibility for data storage.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, violation of privacy regulations, reputational damage, financial loss.
*   **Affected Component:** Database (`Nop.Data`), data access layer (`Nop.Services`), any component that handles sensitive data *within nopCommerce*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Database Encryption:**  Enable and properly configure database encryption at rest for all sensitive data stored by nopCommerce.
        *   **Strong Encryption Keys:** Use strong, randomly generated encryption keys and manage them securely, outside of the nopCommerce application itself.
        *   **Data Minimization:** Only store the minimum necessary customer data within nopCommerce.
