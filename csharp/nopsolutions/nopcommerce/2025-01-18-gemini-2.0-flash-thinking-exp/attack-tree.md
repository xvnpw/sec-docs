## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Plugin Vulnerability (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_plugin_vulnerability__high-risk_path_.md)

- **Execute Arbitrary Code via Plugin (Critical Node):**
  - Likelihood: Medium (If vulnerability exists)
  - Impact: Critical
  - Effort: Medium
  - Skill Level: Medium
  - Detection Difficulty: Medium
  - **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities like Remote Code Execution (RCE) in nopCommerce plugins to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially gaining full control.

- **Gain Unauthorized Access via Plugin (Critical Node):**
  - Likelihood: Medium (If vulnerability exists)
  - Impact: High
  - Effort: Medium
  - Skill Level: Medium
  - Detection Difficulty: Medium
  - **Description:** Attackers leverage authentication or authorization flaws within plugins to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Weakness (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_weakness__high-risk_path_.md)

- **Exploit Weak Admin Credentials (Critical Node):**
  - Likelihood: Medium
  - Impact: Critical
  - Effort: Low
  - Skill Level: Low
  - Detection Difficulty: Low (Multiple failed attempts might be logged)
  - **Description:** Attackers use default or easily guessable administrator credentials to gain full administrative access to the nopCommerce application.

- **Exploit Exposed Database Connection String (Critical Node):**
  - Likelihood: Low
  - Impact: Critical
  - Effort: Low
  - Skill Level: Medium
  - Detection Difficulty: Low (If logging is enabled)
  - **Description:** Attackers gain access to the database connection string, allowing them to directly access and manipulate the underlying database, potentially compromising all data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Authentication/Authorization Flaws (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_authenticationauthorization_flaws__high-risk_path_.md)

- **Exploit Default Credentials (Critical Node):**
  - Likelihood: Medium
  - Impact: Critical
  - Effort: Low
  - Skill Level: Low
  - Detection Difficulty: Low
  - **Description:** Attackers use default credentials for user accounts (including administrative accounts) that have not been changed after installation.

- **Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerability (Critical Node):**
  - Likelihood: Low
  - Impact: Critical
  - Effort: Medium
  - Skill Level: Medium
  - Detection Difficulty: Medium
  - **Description:** Attackers exploit flaws in the authentication logic of nopCommerce to bypass login requirements and gain unauthorized access.

- **Exploit Privilege Escalation Vulnerability (Critical Node):**
  - Likelihood: Low
  - Impact: Critical
  - Effort: Medium
  - Skill Level: Medium
  - Detection Difficulty: Medium
  - **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the authorization logic to gain higher privileges than they are intended to have, potentially leading to full administrative control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Data Handling Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_data_handling_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

- **Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerability (nopCommerce Specific) (Critical Node):**
  - Likelihood: Medium
  - Impact: Critical
  - Effort: Medium
  - Skill Level: Medium
  - Detection Difficulty: Medium (WAF might detect)
  - **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into input fields to execute arbitrary database commands, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete database takeover.

- **Exploit Command Injection Vulnerability (nopCommerce Specific) (Critical Node):**
  - Likelihood: Low
  - Impact: Critical
  - Effort: Medium
  - Skill Level: Medium
  - Detection Difficulty: Medium
  - **Description:** Attackers inject malicious commands that are executed by the server's operating system, potentially allowing them to gain control of the server.

- **Access/Modify Customer Data (Critical Node):**
  - Likelihood: Medium
  - Impact: High
  - Effort: Medium
  - Skill Level: Medium
  - Detection Difficulty: Medium
  - **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities to directly access and modify sensitive customer information, leading to privacy breaches and potential financial harm.
