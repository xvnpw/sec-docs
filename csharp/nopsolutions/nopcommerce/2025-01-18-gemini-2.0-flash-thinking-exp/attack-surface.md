# Attack Surface Analysis for nopsolutions/nopcommerce

## Attack Surface: [Third-Party Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/third-party_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws present in plugins developed by third-party vendors.
    *   **How nopCommerce Contributes:** nopCommerce's plugin architecture is a core feature, enabling extensive customization through third-party extensions. The security of these plugins is inherently tied to the platform's extensibility model, but not directly controlled by the nopCommerce core team.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable payment gateway plugin (specific to nopCommerce's integration points) allows an attacker to intercept or manipulate payment information during checkout.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (financial information, customer data), website compromise, malware distribution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability and plugin's function).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet plugins before installation, checking developer reputation and reviews within the nopCommerce ecosystem.
        *   Only install necessary plugins from the nopCommerce marketplace or trusted sources.
        *   Keep all plugins updated to the latest versions available through the nopCommerce admin panel.
        *   Regularly check for security advisories specifically related to nopCommerce plugins.
        *   Consider using plugins from well-established and reputable developers within the nopCommerce community.
        *   Implement a process for testing plugins in a non-production nopCommerce environment before deploying to live.

## Attack Surface: [Administration Panel Brute-Force and Credential Stuffing](./attack_surfaces/administration_panel_brute-force_and_credential_stuffing.md)

*   **Description:** Attempts to gain unauthorized access to the nopCommerce administration panel by trying numerous username/password combinations.
    *   **How nopCommerce Contributes:** The nopCommerce administration panel is the primary interface for managing the store, making it a critical and directly exposed component of the platform. Default or weak admin credentials within a nopCommerce installation increase the risk.
    *   **Example:** Attackers use automated tools to try common passwords against the `/admin` login page of a nopCommerce instance.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the store, data manipulation within the nopCommerce database, malware injection through plugin management, financial loss.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies for administrator accounts within the nopCommerce user management system.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin logins, leveraging nopCommerce's extensibility if needed.
        *   Implement account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts specifically for the nopCommerce admin login.
        *   Consider IP address whitelisting or limiting access to the `/admin` path at the web server level.
        *   Monitor login attempts to the nopCommerce admin panel for suspicious activity.
        *   Change default administrator usernames created during nopCommerce installation.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Payment Gateway Integrations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_payment_gateway_integrations.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from the integration of nopCommerce with third-party payment gateways.
    *   **How nopCommerce Contributes:** nopCommerce's architecture includes specific interfaces and methods for integrating with various payment processors. The security of these integrations is directly dependent on how nopCommerce implements and manages these connections.
    *   **Example:** A flaw in the nopCommerce payment processing logic for a specific gateway allows an attacker to manipulate the payment amount or bypass payment verification during the checkout process.
    *   **Impact:** Financial loss, data breach of payment information handled by nopCommerce before being passed to the gateway, reputational damage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use reputable and PCI DSS compliant payment gateways officially supported by nopCommerce.
        *   Ensure the nopCommerce payment gateway integration is up-to-date with the latest patches provided by nopCommerce.
        *   Regularly review and audit the payment gateway integration configuration within the nopCommerce admin panel.
        *   Implement server-side validation of payment information within the nopCommerce application logic.
        *   Follow the payment gateway's security best practices in conjunction with nopCommerce's recommended integration methods.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection in Plugin Parameters or Custom Fields](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_in_plugin_parameters_or_custom_fields.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL queries through plugin configuration parameters or custom fields that are not properly sanitized.
    *   **How nopCommerce Contributes:** The flexibility of nopCommerce with its plugin system and the ability to add custom attributes and fields can introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities if plugin developers or administrators entering data don't sanitize input before it's used in database queries within the nopCommerce context.
    *   **Example:** An attacker manipulates a plugin setting within the nopCommerce admin panel to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the nopCommerce database, potentially gaining access to sensitive customer or order data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach of the nopCommerce database, data manipulation, potential for remote code execution on the database server hosting the nopCommerce data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Encourage plugin developers to use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions within their nopCommerce plugins.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all plugin parameters and custom fields within the nopCommerce application.
        *   Regularly audit plugin code for SQL injection vulnerabilities, especially those interacting with the nopCommerce database.
        *   Educate administrators on the risks of entering unsanitized data into custom fields.
