## 7. Data Flow (Detailed)

The following describes a more detailed user interaction flow, highlighting data types and component interactions:

1. **User Action:** A user interacts with the presentation layer (e.g., browsing products on the homepage, adding a "Product" to the shopping cart, initiating the checkout process).
2. **Presentation Layer Processing:** The presentation layer's "Controller" receives the "HTTP Request" (e.g., a GET request for a product page, a POST request to add an item to the cart). The controller may receive data as form parameters or route data.
3. **Application Layer Interaction:** The controller invokes a specific service method in the application layer (e.g., `IProductService.GetProductById(productId)`, `IShoppingCartService.AddToCart(customer, product, quantity)`). Data is passed as strongly-typed objects or primitive types.
4. **Business Logic Execution:** The application layer service executes the necessary business logic, potentially involving multiple domain entities and other services. For example, adding to the cart might involve checking product inventory, applying discounts, and calculating shipping costs.
5. **Data Access Layer Interaction:** The application layer service utilizes repository interfaces from the data access layer to interact with the data store (e.g., `_productRepository.GetById(productId)`, `_shoppingCartItemRepository.Insert(shoppingCartItem)`). Data is transferred as entity objects.
6. **Data Store Operation:** The data access layer, using EF Core, translates the repository calls into database queries (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements) and executes them against the "Data Store".
7. **Response:** The data retrieved from the database (or the result of a data modification) is returned through the layers back to the presentation layer as entity objects or DTOs (Data Transfer Objects).
8. **User Interface Update:** The presentation layer's controller processes the returned data and prepares a "View Model". The view model is then passed to the appropriate "Razor View" to render the "HTTP Response" (HTML) that is sent back to the user's "Web Browser".
9. **External Integration (Optional):** At various points, the application layer may interact with external services. For example, during checkout, the `IPaymentService` might call the "Payment Gateway API" to process a payment. Data exchanged with external services is typically in formats like JSON or XML.

## 8. Deployment Considerations

nopCommerce offers flexibility in deployment, but security considerations vary depending on the chosen environment:

*   **On-Premises:**
    *   Requires managing the entire infrastructure, including servers, networking, and security.
    *   Security responsibilities include physical security, server hardening, network segmentation, and access control.
*   **Cloud-Based:**
    *   **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) (e.g., Azure VMs, AWS EC2):** Provides more control over the infrastructure but still requires managing the operating system, web server, and application security.
    *   **Platform as a Service (PaaS) (e.g., Azure App Service):**  Reduces infrastructure management overhead, with the cloud provider handling some aspects of security. However, application-level security remains the responsibility of the developer.
    *   **Containerized (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes):** Offers portability and scalability but introduces new security considerations related to container image security, orchestration platform security, and network policies.

## 9. Technology Stack

*   **Programming Language:** C# (.NET)
*   **Framework:** ASP.NET Core
*   **Web Server:** Kestrel (typically used behind a reverse proxy like IIS on Windows or Nginx/Apache on Linux)
*   **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server (primary), with support for other databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL via plugins or custom data providers.
*   **ORM:** Entity Framework Core
*   **Frontend Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, potentially other JavaScript frameworks in custom themes or plugins.
*   **Dependency Injection:** Built-in ASP.NET Core Dependency Injection container.
*   **Caching:** In-memory caching, Redis (common via plugin), potentially other distributed caching solutions.
*   **Logging:** Built-in logging abstractions, often implemented with libraries like Serilog or NLog.

## 10. Security Considerations (Detailed for Threat Modeling)

This section provides more specific security considerations to guide the threat modeling process:

*   **Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   **Threats:** Brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, session hijacking, session fixation, insecure password storage, privilege escalation.
    *   **Considerations:**  Strength of password hashing algorithms (e.g., PBKDF2), use of salting, account lockout policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA), secure session management (HTTP-only, Secure flags on cookies), proper implementation of role-based access control (RBAC).
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   **Threats:** SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), command injection, path traversal, XML External Entity (XXE) injection.
    *   **Considerations:**  Server-side validation of all user inputs, output encoding to prevent XSS, parameterized queries or ORM usage to prevent SQL injection, avoiding direct execution of user-provided commands, secure handling of file uploads.
*   **Session Management:**
    *   **Threats:** Session hijacking, session fixation.
    *   **Considerations:**  Using strong session IDs, regenerating session IDs after login, setting appropriate cookie flags (HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite), implementing session timeouts.
*   **Data Protection:**
    *   **Threats:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    *   **Considerations:**  Encryption of sensitive data at rest (e.g., using Transparent Data Encryption for SQL Server), encryption in transit (HTTPS), secure storage of API keys and connection strings, compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Threats:** Stealing user credentials, performing actions on behalf of a user, defacing the website.
    *   **Considerations:**  Implementing Content Security Policy (CSP), using output encoding libraries, avoiding the use of `eval()` or similar functions with user-provided data.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**
    *   **Threats:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of an authenticated user.
    *   **Considerations:**  Using anti-CSRF tokens (synchronizer tokens), implementing proper SameSite cookie attributes.
*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   **Threats:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
    *   **Considerations:**  Regularly updating dependencies, using vulnerability scanning tools, following secure coding practices when integrating with external libraries.
*   **Plugin Security:**
    *   **Threats:** Malicious plugins, vulnerable plugins introducing security flaws.
    *   **Considerations:**  Careful vetting of third-party plugins, implementing a secure plugin development framework, sandboxing plugin execution (if feasible).
*   **Payment Processing Security:**
    *   **Threats:** Credit card theft, payment fraud.
    *   **Considerations:**  PCI DSS compliance if handling credit card data directly, using secure payment gateways, tokenization of sensitive payment information.
*   **API Security:**
    *   **Threats:** Unauthorized access to API endpoints, data breaches through APIs.
    *   **Considerations:**  Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms for APIs (e.g., OAuth 2.0), rate limiting, input validation, output encoding, proper error handling to avoid information leakage.
*   **Deployment Security:**
    *   **Threats:** Server compromise, unauthorized access to the deployment environment.
    *   **Considerations:**  Regular security patching of servers and operating systems, strong firewall rules, network segmentation, access control lists, secure configuration of web servers, secure storage of deployment credentials.
