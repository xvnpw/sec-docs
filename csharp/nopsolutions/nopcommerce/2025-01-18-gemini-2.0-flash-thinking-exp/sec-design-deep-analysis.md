    *   Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) at the service layer to ensure users only have access to authorized functionalities and data.
    *   Implement proper exception handling to prevent the leakage of sensitive information in error messages.
    *   Sanitize and redact sensitive data in logs.

**3. Data Access Layer (nop.data):**

*   **Security Implication:** This layer interacts directly with the database, making it a critical point for preventing data breaches.
    *   **Threat:** SQL Injection vulnerabilities could arise if parameterized queries or ORM features are not used correctly, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
    *   **Threat:**  Exposure of sensitive database connection strings.
    *   **Threat:**  Insufficient data validation before database insertion or updates could lead to data corruption or integrity issues.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce the use of parameterized queries or ORM features (like Entity Framework Core) to prevent SQL injection. Avoid constructing SQL queries using string concatenation with user input.
    *   Securely store database connection strings, preferably using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system. Avoid hardcoding connection strings in configuration files.
    *   Implement data validation rules at the data access layer to ensure data integrity.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege to database user accounts used by the application.

**4. Infrastructure Layer (nop.core, nop.framework):**

*   **Security Implication:** This layer provides foundational services, and vulnerabilities here can have widespread impact.
    *   **Threat:**  Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used for logging, caching, or dependency injection could be exploited.
    *   **Threat:**  Insecure configuration of caching mechanisms could lead to data leaks.
    *   **Threat:**  Weak encryption algorithms or insecure key management practices could compromise sensitive data.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update all third-party dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement secure configuration for caching mechanisms, ensuring sensitive data is not inadvertently exposed.
    *   Use strong and well-vetted cryptographic libraries for encryption and hashing.
    *   Implement secure key management practices, avoiding hardcoding keys and using secure storage mechanisms.
    *   Ensure proper configuration of the dependency injection container to prevent unintended access or modification of services.

**5. Plugins:**

*   **Security Implication:** Plugins extend the platform's functionality, but poorly developed or malicious plugins can introduce significant security risks.
    *   **Threat:**  Vulnerable plugins could introduce XSS, SQL injection, or other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Threat:**  Malicious plugins could be designed to steal data, compromise the server, or perform other malicious actions.
