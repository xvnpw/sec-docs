Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving MediatR, with high and critical severity:

*   **Description:** Unauthorized Access and Execution of Handlers
    *   **How MediatR Contributes to the Attack Surface:** MediatR's core function is to route requests to specific handlers. This routing mechanism, if not properly secured, allows attackers to potentially trigger and execute handlers they are not authorized to access.
    *   **Example:** By manipulating request parameters or routes, an unprivileged user can directly invoke a handler intended for administrative functions, leading to actions like deleting user accounts or modifying critical data.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized data modification or deletion, access to sensitive information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement mandatory authorization checks *within* each handler, verifying user permissions before executing any business logic.
        *   Avoid relying solely on implicit authorization based on request type or handler naming conventions.
        *   Utilize dedicated authorization libraries or frameworks that integrate with MediatR to enforce access control policies.

*   **Description:** Malicious Payloads in Requests/Commands/Queries
    *   **How MediatR Contributes to the Attack Surface:** MediatR facilitates the transfer of data from incoming requests to handler logic via request objects. If these request objects are not rigorously validated, attackers can inject malicious payloads that are then processed by the handlers.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a request object containing a SQL injection payload within a property that is subsequently used in a database query within the handler, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, potential for remote code execution depending on the vulnerability within the handler.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strict input validation for all properties of request objects *before* they are processed by handlers.
        *   Employ strong typing and consider using validation attributes or libraries to ensure data integrity and prevent injection attacks.
        *   Sanitize or encode user-provided data before using it in sensitive operations such as database queries or external API calls.

*   **Description:** Abuse of Event/Notification System for Unauthorized Actions
    *   **How MediatR Contributes to the Attack Surface:** MediatR's event publishing mechanism allows different parts of the application to react to specific events. If the publication of events is not properly controlled, attackers might be able to trigger events they shouldn't, leading to unintended or malicious actions.
    *   **Example:** A malicious user triggers an event that initiates a password reset process for another user without proper authentication or authorization, potentially leading to account takeover.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions, service disruption, potential for information disclosure if event handlers process sensitive data without proper authorization.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement authorization checks before publishing events to restrict which users or components can trigger specific events.
        *   Carefully review the logic within event handlers to ensure they only perform actions that are authorized based on the event context and user permissions.
        *   Avoid relying solely on the fact that an event was triggered as proof of authorization.

*   **Description:** Manipulation of Pipeline Behaviors to Bypass Security Controls
    *   **How MediatR Contributes to the Attack Surface:** MediatR's pipeline allows for the interception and modification of requests and responses through custom behaviors. If the dependency injection configuration is compromised, or if pipeline behaviors are poorly implemented, attackers might inject malicious behaviors to bypass security checks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects a pipeline behavior that removes authorization headers from requests before they reach the intended handler, effectively bypassing authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls, unauthorized access to resources, potential for further exploitation depending on the nature of the bypassed controls.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the dependency injection container to prevent unauthorized registration or modification of pipeline behaviors.
        *   Thoroughly review and test all custom pipeline behaviors for potential security vulnerabilities and ensure they do not introduce new attack vectors.
        *   Implement integrity checks to ensure the expected pipeline behaviors are in place and have not been tampered with.
