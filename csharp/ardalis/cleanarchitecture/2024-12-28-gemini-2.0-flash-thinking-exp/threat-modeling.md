* **Threat:** Compromised Interface Adapter Impersonating Inner Layers
    * **Description:**
        * **Attacker Action:** An attacker gains control of an Interface Adapter (e.g., a Controller or Presenter) by exploiting vulnerabilities within the adapter itself or its dependencies.
        * **How:** The attacker crafts malicious requests or responses that mimic legitimate interactions, sending manipulated data or triggering unintended logic in the inner Use Case layer. The Use Cases, designed to trust the Interface Adapters for handling external concerns, process this malicious input without sufficient independent validation.
    * **Impact:**
        * The application processes illegitimate requests, leading to incorrect data manipulation, unauthorized actions, or denial of service.
        * Business logic is executed based on attacker-controlled data, potentially compromising data integrity and application state.
    * **Affected Component:** Specific Controller or Presenter within the Interface Adapters layer.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong input validation and sanitization *within the Use Cases*, not solely relying on the Interface Adapters. This provides a defense-in-depth approach inherent to the layered architecture.
        * Secure dependencies of the Interface Adapters and keep them updated.
        * Follow secure coding practices within the Interface Adapters to prevent vulnerabilities like injection flaws.
        * Implement authentication and authorization checks within the Use Cases to verify the legitimacy of requests, even if they originate from seemingly trusted Interface Adapters.

* **Threat:** Data Corruption at Layer Boundaries
    * **Description:**
        * **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the data transformation logic within Interface Adapters (e.g., Gateways) to inject malicious data or manipulate the mapping process between external data formats and internal domain models.
        * **How:** This could involve exploiting flaws in data serialization/deserialization, type conversion errors, or insufficient validation of data being passed specifically between the outer and inner layers as defined by the Clean Architecture.
    * **Impact:**
        * Corrupted data is passed to the inner layers, leading to incorrect business logic execution and potentially persistent data corruption in the data store.
        * The application's state becomes inconsistent, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential security breaches.
    * **Affected Component:** Specific Gateway within the Interface Adapters layer responsible for data mapping and translation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement rigorous testing of data mapping logic within Gateways, focusing on the correctness and security of the transformations between external and internal representations.
        * Use schema validation and data type enforcement at the boundaries between layers to ensure data integrity as it crosses the architectural boundaries.
        * Consider using immutable data transfer objects (DTOs) to prevent accidental modification during transfer between layers.
        * Sanitize and validate data received from external sources *before* mapping it to internal domain models within the Gateways.

* **Threat:** Malicious Dependency Injection
    * **Description:**
        * **Attacker Action:** An attacker manipulates the dependency injection mechanism, a core aspect of how Clean Architecture is often implemented, to inject malicious implementations of interfaces into the inner layers.
        * **How:** This could happen if the dependency injection configuration is vulnerable, if external configuration sources are compromised, or if the application doesn't properly validate or sanitize injected dependencies, allowing a malicious component to be substituted for a legitimate one.
    * **Impact:**
        * Malicious code is executed within the application's core layers, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or complete system compromise.
        * The attacker gains control over the behavior of inner components by replacing them with their own malicious versions.
    * **Affected Component:** The dependency injection container and the components that rely on injected dependencies (primarily Use Cases and Interface Adapters).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use a secure dependency injection framework and carefully manage the registration and resolution of dependencies.
        * Avoid allowing external configuration to directly control which implementations are injected without proper validation and authorization.
        * Implement integrity checks on injected dependencies to ensure they haven't been tampered with.
        * Follow the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to modify dependency injection configurations.
        * Regularly audit dependency configurations for any unauthorized or suspicious entries. Consider using compile-time dependency injection where possible to reduce runtime manipulation risks.
