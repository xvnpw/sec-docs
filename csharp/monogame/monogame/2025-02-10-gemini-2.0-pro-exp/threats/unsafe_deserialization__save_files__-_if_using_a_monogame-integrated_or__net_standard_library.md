# Deep Analysis: Unsafe Deserialization in MonoGame Save Files

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Unsafe Deserialization" threat within the context of a MonoGame application, identify specific vulnerabilities, assess potential attack vectors, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the initial threat model description.  We aim to provide developers with practical guidance to prevent this critical security issue.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses on:

*   **Serialization Libraries:**  .NET Standard libraries used *within* the MonoGame project for save/load functionality.  This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   `System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter` (explicitly *excluded* due to inherent insecurity)
    *   `System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer`
    *   `Newtonsoft.Json.JsonSerializer` (with a focus on secure configurations)
    *   Other potential third-party serialization libraries.
*   **Save File Handling:** The entire process of reading, deserializing, validating, and using data from save files within the MonoGame application.
*   **MonoGame Context:** How the deserialization process integrates with the MonoGame game loop (`LoadContent`, `Update`, `Draw`, and any custom loading/saving mechanisms).
*   **Exclusions:**  This analysis *does not* cover:
    *   Vulnerabilities *within* the MonoGame framework itself (this threat is about libraries used *with* MonoGame).
    *   Network-based attacks (this is focused on local save files).
    *   General game cheating (e.g., modifying save files to gain an advantage, *without* exploiting a deserialization vulnerability).

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Understanding:**  Review the threat description and expand upon the underlying principles of unsafe deserialization.
2.  **Vulnerability Identification:**  Identify specific vulnerabilities in common serialization libraries and configurations.
3.  **Attack Vector Analysis:**  Describe how an attacker could craft a malicious save file and trigger the vulnerability.
4.  **MonoGame Integration Analysis:**  Examine how the save/load process interacts with the MonoGame game loop and identify potential points of failure.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**  Provide detailed, practical mitigation strategies, including code examples and configuration recommendations.
6.  **Testing and Verification:**  Outline testing approaches to verify the effectiveness of the mitigations.

## 2. Threat Understanding: Unsafe Deserialization

Unsafe deserialization occurs when an application deserializes data from an untrusted source (like a user-provided save file) without proper validation.  The core problem is that some serializers, especially those designed for flexibility, allow the serialized data to specify the *type* of object to be created.  An attacker can manipulate this type information to instantiate arbitrary .NET classes, potentially leading to:

*   **Code Execution:**  If the attacker can force the instantiation of a class with a malicious constructor, static initializer, or a method called during deserialization (e.g., `OnDeserialized`), they can execute arbitrary code.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Creating large or deeply nested objects can consume excessive resources, crashing the game.
*   **Data Tampering:**  Even without full code execution, an attacker might be able to modify the game state in unexpected ways by manipulating the deserialized data.

The danger is amplified when the deserialized data is used without further validation.  For example, if a deserialized object contains a file path, and the game directly uses that path without checking it, an attacker could potentially overwrite critical game files.

## 3. Vulnerability Identification

### 3.1 `BinaryFormatter` (AVOID COMPLETELY)

*   **Vulnerability:**  `BinaryFormatter` is inherently vulnerable to deserialization attacks.  It allows the serialized data to specify arbitrary types, and there's no built-in mechanism to restrict this.
*   **Recommendation:**  **Never use `BinaryFormatter` for save files.**  It should be considered deprecated for security-sensitive scenarios.

### 3.2 `System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer` (Preferred)

*   **Vulnerability (Incorrect Configuration):**  If `TypeNameHandling` is enabled (it's *disabled* by default in newer .NET versions), it can be vulnerable.  Also, using custom converters without proper validation can introduce risks.
*   **Recommendation (Secure Configuration):**
    *   **Ensure `TypeNameHandling` is disabled (default).**  Do *not* use `JsonSerializerOptions.PolymorphismOptions`.
    *   **Use `JsonSerializerOptions.TypeInfoResolver` for strict type control.**  Define a custom resolver that *only* allows deserialization of known, trusted types.  Example:

    ```csharp
    using System.Text.Json;
    using System.Text.Json.Serialization.Metadata;

    // Define your game data classes
    public class PlayerData { /* ... */ }
    public class GameState { /* ... */ }

    public class MyTypeResolver : IJsonTypeInfoResolver
    {
        public JsonTypeInfo GetTypeInfo(Type type, JsonSerializerOptions options)
        {
            if (type == typeof(PlayerData))
            {
                return JsonMetadataServices.CreateObjectInfo<PlayerData>(options, () => new PlayerData());
            }
            else if (type == typeof(GameState))
            {
                return JsonMetadataServices.CreateObjectInfo<GameState>(options, () => new GameState());
            }
            else
            {
                // Throw an exception for unknown types
                throw new JsonException($"Type '{type}' is not allowed for deserialization.");
            }
        }
    }

    // Usage:
    var options = new JsonSerializerOptions
    {
        TypeInfoResolver = new MyTypeResolver()
    };

    // Deserialize ONLY PlayerData or GameState
    GameState loadedState = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<GameState>(jsonString, options);
    ```

    *   **Validate custom converters:** If you *must* use custom converters, ensure they thoroughly validate the input and do not blindly create objects based on untrusted data.

### 3.3 `Newtonsoft.Json.JsonSerializer` (Use with Caution)

*   **Vulnerability (Incorrect Configuration):**  `TypeNameHandling` is a major source of vulnerabilities.  By default, it's set to `TypeNameHandling.None` (safe), but if it's changed to `Auto`, `All`, `Objects`, or `Arrays`, it becomes vulnerable.
*   **Recommendation (Secure Configuration):**
    *   **Keep `TypeNameHandling` set to `None` (default).**  This is the safest option.
    *   **If you *must* use `TypeNameHandling` (strongly discouraged for save files), use a `SerializationBinder` to restrict allowed types.**  Example:

    ```csharp
    using Newtonsoft.Json;
    using Newtonsoft.Json.Serialization;
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;

    // Define your game data classes
    public class PlayerData { /* ... */ }
    public class GameState { /* ... */ }

    public class SafeSerializationBinder : ISerializationBinder
    {
        private readonly HashSet<Type> _allowedTypes = new HashSet<Type>
        {
            typeof(PlayerData),
            typeof(GameState)
            // Add other allowed types here
        };

        public void BindToName(Type serializedType, out string assemblyName, out string typeName)
        {
            assemblyName = null;
            typeName = serializedType.FullName;
        }

        public Type BindToType(string assemblyName, string typeName)
        {
            Type type = Type.GetType(typeName); // Simplified for brevity; consider assembly handling
            if (type != null && _allowedTypes.Contains(type))
            {
                return type;
            }
            else
            {
                throw new JsonSerializationException($"Type '{typeName}' is not allowed for deserialization.");
            }
        }
    }

    // Usage:
    var settings = new JsonSerializerSettings
    {
        TypeNameHandling = TypeNameHandling.Objects, // Example (use with caution!)
        SerializationBinder = new SafeSerializationBinder()
    };

    GameState loadedState = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<GameState>(jsonString, settings);
    ```

    *   **Avoid `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(jsonString)` without specifying a type.**  This can lead to unexpected type instantiation.  Always use the generic version: `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<T>(jsonString, settings)`.

### 3.4 Other Third-Party Libraries

*   **Vulnerability:**  Vulnerabilities depend on the specific library and its configuration.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   **Thoroughly research the library's security track record.**  Look for known vulnerabilities and security advisories.
    *   **Prefer libraries with built-in type validation and secure defaults.**
    *   **Follow the library's documentation for secure usage.**
    *   **Keep the library up-to-date.**

## 4. Attack Vector Analysis

1.  **Attacker Obtains a Legitimate Save File:** The attacker starts by obtaining a legitimate save file from the game, either by playing the game or downloading a save file online.
2.  **Attacker Modifies the Save File:** The attacker uses a text editor or a specialized tool to modify the save file.  They change the type information within the serialized data to point to a malicious class.  This class might be:
    *   A class within a .NET framework library that has a known vulnerability.
    *   A class within a third-party library used by the game that has a known vulnerability.
    *   A custom class that the attacker somehow injects into the game's environment (less likely, but possible in some scenarios).
3.  **Attacker Triggers Deserialization:** The attacker places the modified save file in the game's save file directory.  They then launch the game and load the malicious save file.
4.  **Vulnerability Exploitation:** When the game deserializes the save file, the malicious class is instantiated, and its code is executed.  This could lead to:
    *   Running arbitrary commands on the player's system.
    *   Stealing sensitive data (e.g., game credentials, personal information).
    *   Installing malware.
    *   Corrupting the player's system.

## 5. MonoGame Integration Analysis

The save/load process typically interacts with the MonoGame game loop in the following ways:

*   **`LoadContent`:**  This is often used to load initial game assets, but it *could* also be used to load an initial save file (e.g., for a "Continue Game" option).  If deserialization happens here, it's critical to ensure it's secure.
*   **`Update`:**  The game might load a save file during gameplay (e.g., in response to a player action or a menu option).  Deserialization within the `Update` method is also a potential vulnerability point.
*   **`Draw`:**  While less common, if the save data directly affects rendering (e.g., by storing object positions or visual properties), deserialization might indirectly influence the `Draw` method.  This is less likely to be a direct attack vector, but it's important to consider.
* **Custom Loading Logic:** Many games implement custom loading screens or asynchronous loading mechanisms. These custom systems must also be carefully scrutinized for deserialization vulnerabilities.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Timing:**  Deserialization should ideally happen at a predictable and controlled point in the game loop, minimizing the risk of unexpected side effects.
*   **Error Handling:**  Robust error handling is crucial.  If deserialization fails (e.g., due to a corrupted or malicious save file), the game should handle the error gracefully, without crashing or exposing sensitive information.  It should *not* attempt to use partially deserialized data.
*   **Asynchronous Loading:**  If using asynchronous loading, ensure that the deserialization process is properly synchronized and that the game state is not accessed until deserialization is complete and the data has been validated.

## 6. Mitigation Strategy Refinement

In addition to the strategies outlined in the original threat model, here are refined and expanded recommendations:

1.  **Prioritize `System.Text.Json`:**  This is the recommended serializer for modern .NET applications.  It's designed with security in mind and has secure defaults.
2.  **Implement Strict Type Validation (Essential):**  Use `JsonSerializerOptions.TypeInfoResolver` with `System.Text.Json` or a `SerializationBinder` with `Newtonsoft.Json` to *explicitly* whitelist the allowed types.  Do *not* rely on default type handling.
3.  **Schema Validation (Highly Recommended):**  Before deserializing, validate the JSON structure against a predefined schema.  This helps prevent attacks that rely on unexpected data structures.  Use a library like `JsonSchema.Net` for this purpose.
    ```csharp
    // Example using JsonSchema.Net
    using JsonSchema;
    using System.Text.Json;

    // Define your schema (example)
    string schemaJson = @"{
      ""type"": ""object"",
      ""properties"": {
        ""playerName"": { ""type"": ""string"" },
        ""playerLevel"": { ""type"": ""integer"" },
        ""playerHealth"": { ""type"": ""integer"" }
      },
      ""required"": [ ""playerName"", ""playerLevel"", ""playerHealth"" ]
    }";

    JsonSchema schema = JsonSchema.FromJson(schemaJson);

    // Validate the JSON string before deserialization
    using (JsonDocument document = JsonDocument.Parse(jsonString))
    {
        ValidationResults results = schema.Validate(document.RootElement);

        if (!results.IsValid)
        {
            // Handle validation errors (log, display error message, etc.)
            Console.WriteLine("Save file validation failed:");
            foreach (var error in results.Errors)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"  - {error.Key}: {error.Value}");
            }
            // Do NOT proceed with deserialization
            return;
        }
    }

    // If validation is successful, proceed with deserialization (using secure settings)
    // ...
    ```
4.  **Input Sanitization (Defense in Depth):**  Even after deserialization and type validation, sanitize the data *before* using it.  This means:
    *   **Range Checks:**  Ensure numeric values are within expected ranges.
    *   **String Validation:**  Check string lengths, allowed characters, and prevent path traversal attacks (e.g., if the save file contains file paths).
    *   **Object Validation:**  Validate the relationships between objects and ensure the overall game state is consistent.
5.  **Avoid Unnecessary Polymorphism:**  If possible, design your save data classes to minimize the need for polymorphism.  Simpler data structures are easier to validate.
6.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of your save/load code, including the serialization library and its configuration.
7.  **Stay Updated:**  Keep your serialization library and the .NET framework up-to-date to benefit from security patches.
8. **Consider Sandboxing (Advanced):** For extremely high-security requirements, consider running the deserialization process in a sandboxed environment (e.g., a separate AppDomain with restricted permissions). This is complex but can provide an additional layer of protection.

## 7. Testing and Verification

1.  **Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests to verify that your type validation and schema validation logic works correctly.  Test with valid and invalid save files, including files with unexpected types and structures.
2.  **Fuzz Testing:**  Use a fuzzer to generate a large number of malformed save files and test how your game handles them.  This can help uncover unexpected vulnerabilities.
3.  **Penetration Testing:**  If possible, engage a security professional to perform penetration testing on your game, specifically targeting the save/load functionality.
4.  **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to scan your code for potential deserialization vulnerabilities. Many code analysis tools can detect insecure uses of serialization libraries.

By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of unsafe deserialization vulnerabilities in your MonoGame application and protect your players from potential attacks. Remember that security is an ongoing process, and continuous vigilance is essential.
