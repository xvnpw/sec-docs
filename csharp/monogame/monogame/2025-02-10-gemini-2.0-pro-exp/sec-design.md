```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers commit code changes to the GitHub repository.
2.  A build server (e.g., GitHub Actions) is triggered by the commit.
3.  The build server executes a build script.
4.  The build script uses the .NET SDK compiler to build the MonoGame framework and game code.
5.  The build script uses the MonoGame Content Builder (MGCB) to process game assets.
6.  SAST tools are integrated into the build script to scan for potential security vulnerabilities.
7.  The compiler produces binaries (DLLs, EXEs).
8.  The asset processor produces processed assets.
9.  The build script packages the binaries and assets into build artifacts (installers, app packages, etc.).

Security Controls:

*   security control: Use of a build server (GitHub Actions) for automated builds.
*   security control: Integration of SAST tools into the build process.
*   security control: Use of a managed code compiler (.NET SDK) which provides some inherent security benefits.
*   security control: Version control (GitHub) for tracking code changes.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Game development and deployment.
*   Community engagement and contribution.
*   Maintenance and updates of the framework.

Data to Protect:

*   Source code (Low sensitivity - Publicly available on GitHub).
*   Game assets (Variable sensitivity - Depends on the specific game).
*   User data (if collected by games built with MonoGame) (Variable sensitivity - Depends on the data collected).
*   Contributor information (Low sensitivity - Publicly available on GitHub).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, COPPA) that need to be considered for games built with MonoGame?
*   What is the expected level of security expertise of developers using MonoGame?
*   What are the most common target platforms for MonoGame games?
*   Are there any existing security audits or penetration test reports for MonoGame or related projects?
*   What level of support is provided for developers regarding security best practices?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a stable and functional game development framework. Security is a concern, but not the top priority.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The project relies heavily on the security of the underlying operating systems and APIs. Developers using MonoGame are expected to have some basic security knowledge.
*   DESIGN: The design is modular and allows for platform-specific implementations. The content pipeline is a critical component for asset management.
