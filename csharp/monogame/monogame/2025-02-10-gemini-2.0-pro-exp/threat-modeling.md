# Threat Model Analysis for monogame/monogame

## Threat: [DLL Injection/Hijacking](./threats/dll_injectionhijacking.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker replaces a legitimate DLL used by MonoGame (e.g., a native library like `SDL2.dll` or `OpenAL.dll`, or even a managed assembly distributed with MonoGame) with a malicious one. This malicious DLL could intercept calls to MonoGame functions, modify game behavior, or steal data. The attacker needs file system access to replace the DLL.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over the game's execution, potential for data theft, code execution with the game's privileges.  This can bypass any game-level security.
    *   **Affected MonoGame Component:** Potentially *any* component that relies on external DLLs. This includes low-level systems like graphics (`GraphicsDevice`), audio (`SoundEffect`, `SoundEffectInstance`), input (`GamePad`, `Keyboard`, `Mouse`), and platform-specific implementations. The attack targets the *dependencies* of MonoGame, which are integral to its functioning.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strong-named assemblies: Use strong naming for managed assemblies (those provided by MonoGame and your own) to prevent replacement with unsigned or differently-signed versions.
        *   DLL signature verification: If possible on the target platform (and if the DLLs are signed), verify the digital signatures of loaded DLLs *before* MonoGame initializes and uses them. This is a proactive check.
        *   Secure deployment: Ensure the game is installed in a location with restricted write access (this is a general security practice, but it directly impacts this threat).
        *   Code signing: Digitally sign the entire game package (where supported) to verify its integrity. This helps detect tampering with the installer or installed files.

## Threat: [Asset Tampering (Texture Replacement)](./threats/asset_tampering__texture_replacement_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker modifies texture files (e.g., PNG, JPG) loaded by MonoGame's `ContentManager`. They could replace a wall texture with a transparent one to see through walls (cheating), or replace a character's texture with an offensive image. The attacker needs file system access.
    *   **Impact:** Unfair advantage in multiplayer (cheating), disruption of gameplay, offensive content display, potential game instability if the replacement texture is malformed or incompatible.
    *   **Affected MonoGame Component:** `ContentManager` (specifically, the loading of assets), `Texture2D` (the affected asset type). This is a direct attack on how MonoGame handles content.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (especially for multiplayer games where visual integrity is crucial).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Checksums: Implement checksums (e.g., SHA-256) for all texture files. Verify these checksums *within your game code* when loading textures via `ContentManager.Load<Texture2D>()`. This is a crucial step performed *using* MonoGame's API.
        *   Store assets in a packed, encrypted format (custom solution, as MonoGame doesn't have built-in encryption for content). This makes it harder to modify individual assets. You would decrypt *before* passing the data to `ContentManager`.
        *   Operating system file permissions: On platforms with support, use OS file permissions to restrict write access to the game's content directory.

## Threat: [Unsafe Deserialization (Save Files) - *If using a MonoGame-integrated or .NET Standard library*](./threats/unsafe_deserialization__save_files__-_if_using_a_monogame-integrated_or__net_standard_library.md)

*   **Description:** The game uses serialization to save and load game progress.  If a .NET Standard library *used within the MonoGame project* for serialization has vulnerabilities, an attacker could craft a malicious save file that, when deserialized, exploits the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.  This is *indirectly* related to MonoGame because it's the context in which the vulnerable library is used.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution with the game's privileges, potential for data theft or system compromise.
    *   **Affected MonoGame Component:** While not a direct MonoGame component, this affects the game loop (`Game.LoadContent`, `Game.Update`, potentially `Game.Draw` if save data affects rendering) where deserialization occurs. The vulnerability is in the *serialization library*, but the *context* is the MonoGame application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid `BinaryFormatter`:** `BinaryFormatter` is inherently unsafe and should *never* be used.
        *   **Use a secure serializer:** Prefer `JsonSerializer` (from `System.Text.Json`, *not* Newtonsoft.Json unless you carefully configure it) or a well-vetted third-party library. Ensure you use the serializer's secure settings (e.g., type validation, no automatic type resolution).
        *   **Type validation:** If using a serializer that supports it, enforce *strict* type validation during deserialization. Only allow deserialization of known, trusted types defined within your game.
        *   **Schema validation:** For JSON or XML, use schema validation to ensure the data conforms to the expected structure *before* deserialization.
        *   **Input sanitization:** Even with a secure serializer, sanitize the deserialized data *after* deserialization and *before* using it within your MonoGame code.
