## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Client/Server): [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce___clientserver___cn_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the primary and most critical goal for an attacker.  Achieving RCE allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system (either the game client or the game server), giving them complete control.

   *   **Critical Node Justification:**  RCE represents the highest level of compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [High Risk Path 1: Exploit Content Pipeline Bugs [HR] [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_1_exploit_content_pipeline_bugs__hr___cn_.md)

*   **Description:** The MonoGame Content Pipeline processes various asset types (images, models, sounds, fonts) to prepare them for use in the game.  Vulnerabilities in the Content Pipeline itself, or in the third-party libraries it uses, can be exploited by providing maliciously crafted asset files.

      *   **High-Risk Path Justification:** The Content Pipeline is a complex component that often relies on external libraries, making it a prime target for attackers.  Games often allow user-generated content or mods, which increases the risk of malicious assets being introduced.

      *   **Critical Node Justification:** Successful exploitation of a Content Pipeline vulnerability can directly lead to RCE.

      *   **Specific Attack Vectors (A, B, C):**

          *   **A. Buffer Overflow:**
              *   **Description:** A crafted asset file contains data that exceeds the allocated buffer size during processing, overwriting adjacent memory and potentially injecting malicious code.
              *   **Likelihood:** High
              *   **Impact:** Very High
              *   **Effort:** Medium to High
              *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
              *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

          *   **B. Format String Vulnerability:**
              *   **Description:** The Content Pipeline uses format string functions (e.g., `printf`-like functions) improperly, allowing an attacker to control the format string via a crafted asset. This can be used to read or write arbitrary memory locations.
              *   **Likelihood:** Medium
              *   **Impact:** Very High
              *   **Effort:** Medium to High
              *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
              *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

          *   **C. Integer Overflow:**
              *   **Description:** A crafted asset contains integer values that, when processed, cause an integer overflow or underflow, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially memory corruption.
              *   **Likelihood:** Medium
              *   **Impact:** Very High
              *   **Effort:** Medium
              *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
              *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [High Risk Path 2: Exploit Network Code [HR] [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_2_exploit_network_code__hr___cn_.md)

*   **Description:** If the game uses networking (either MonoGame's built-in networking or a third-party library), vulnerabilities in the network code can be exploited by sending specially crafted network packets.

      *   **High-Risk Path Justification:** Network communication is inherently risky, and vulnerabilities in networking libraries are common.

      *   **Critical Node Justification:** Successful exploitation of a network code vulnerability can directly lead to RCE.

      *   **Specific Attack Vectors (D, E, F):**

          *   **D. Buffer Overflow:**
              *   **Description:** A malicious network packet contains data that exceeds the allocated buffer size in the network code, overwriting adjacent memory and potentially injecting malicious code.
              *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
              *   **Impact:** Very High
              *   **Effort:** Medium to High
              *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
              *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

          *   **E. Unvalidated Input:**
              *   **Description:** The network code fails to properly validate data received from the network, allowing an attacker to inject malicious data that triggers unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
              *   **Likelihood:** High
              *   **Impact:** Very High
              *   **Effort:** Medium
              *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
              *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

          *   **F. Deserialization Vulnerability:**
              *   **Description:** If the network code uses deserialization to convert network data into objects, a crafted packet can trigger the instantiation of malicious objects or the execution of arbitrary code.
              *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if deserialization is used)
              *   **Impact:** Very High
              *   **Effort:** Medium to High
              *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
              *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure.md)

    * **Debugging Features [CN]:**
        * **Description:** Leftover debugging features, such as exposed APIs, debug consoles, or verbose logging, can inadvertently reveal sensitive information about the game's internal state, player data, or even server-side secrets.
        * **Critical Node Justification:** While not directly leading to RCE, exposed debugging features can provide attackers with valuable information to aid in further attacks, or directly leak sensitive data.
        * **Specific Attack Vectors (N):**
            * **N. Exposed API:**
                * **Description:** Debugging APIs that are not properly disabled or protected in the release build can be accessed by attackers to manipulate the game, extract data, or even execute code.
                * **Likelihood:** Low (if properly disabled)
                * **Impact:** High
                * **Effort:** Very Low
                * **Skill Level:** Novice
                * **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy
