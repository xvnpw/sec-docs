# Attack Surface Analysis for monogame/monogame

## Attack Surface: [Malformed Asset Files (Content Pipeline)](./attack_surfaces/malformed_asset_files__content_pipeline_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Monogame's content pipeline processes various asset types (images, audio, models, fonts). A specially crafted asset can trigger unexpected behavior during the build process or at runtime.
    *   **How Monogame Contributes:** Monogame provides the content pipeline for converting assets into a format suitable for the game. Vulnerabilities in the importers or processors for specific file types within this pipeline can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A malicious PNG file with carefully crafted header data could cause a buffer overflow in the image decoding library used by the content pipeline, potentially leading to a crash or code execution during the content build.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **During Content Build:** Denial of service for developers, potential for arbitrary code execution on the build machine.
        *   **At Runtime:** Application crash, memory corruption, potential for arbitrary code execution if the vulnerability persists in the runtime loading.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Keep Monogame and its content pipeline dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
            *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within custom content importers/processors.
            *   Consider using third-party libraries known for their security and actively maintained.
            *   Perform security audits of custom content processing logic.

## Attack Surface: [Shader Exploits](./attack_surfaces/shader_exploits.md)

*   **Description:**  Maliciously crafted shaders (HLSL/GLSL) that can cause denial-of-service by consuming excessive resources or potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in the graphics driver.
    *   **How Monogame Contributes:** Monogame allows developers to use custom shaders for rendering. If the application loads shaders from external sources or allows user-defined shaders, this introduces a risk.
    *   **Example:** A shader with an infinite loop or excessively complex calculations could cause the GPU to hang, leading to a game crash or system instability.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, system instability, potential for exploiting vulnerabilities in graphics drivers (though less common).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Avoid loading shaders from untrusted sources.
            *   Implement checks and limitations on shader complexity if user-defined shaders are allowed.
            *   Sanitize shader code if it originates from user input.
            *   Test shaders thoroughly on various hardware configurations.
