# Threat Model Analysis for monogame/monogame

## Threat: [Malicious Asset Loading](./threats/malicious_asset_loading.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Asset Loading
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides crafted or modified game assets (images, audio, models, shaders) that, when loaded by Monogame, exploit vulnerabilities in the asset loading and processing pipeline *within Monogame*. This could involve embedding malicious code within asset files that is executed by Monogame's asset readers or crafting files that trigger parsing errors leading to memory corruption *within Monogame's code*.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, arbitrary code execution within the application's context, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Monogame Component:** `Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content` (specifically the `ContentManager` class and its associated asset readers). `Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics` (for image, model, and shader loading *handled by Monogame*).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Load assets only from trusted sources or implement robust integrity checks before loading.
        *   Implement checks and validation on loaded assets to ensure they conform to expected formats and do not contain unexpected or malicious data *before being processed by Monogame*.
        *   Keep Monogame updated, as updates may include fixes for vulnerabilities in its asset loading and processing code.
        *   Consider using a content pipeline that performs validation and preprocessing of assets during the build process, *before they are used by Monogame*.

## Threat: [Shader Exploits](./threats/shader_exploits.md)

*   **Threat:** Shader Exploits
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides custom or modified shaders that contain malicious code or exploit vulnerabilities in *Monogame's* shader processing pipeline or its interaction with the underlying graphics driver. This could involve shaders designed to cause driver crashes *through Monogame's rendering calls*, expose sensitive information accessible to the GPU *via Monogame*, or potentially be leveraged for compute shader exploits.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, system instability, potential for information disclosure accessible via the GPU, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Monogame Component:** `Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics` (specifically the shader compilation and rendering pipeline within the `GraphicsDevice` class and related shader classes *managed by Monogame*).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review and validate any custom shaders used in the game.
        *   Restrict the ability for users to load arbitrary shaders.
        *   Keep Monogame updated, as updates may include fixes or mitigations for shader processing vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Underlying Native Libraries (Directly Triggered by Monogame)](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_native_libraries__directly_triggered_by_monogame_.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Underlying Native Libraries (Directly Triggered by Monogame)
    *   **Description:** Monogame relies on native libraries (like SDL2 or platform-specific graphics APIs). Vulnerabilities in these underlying libraries can be exploited *through specific calls or interactions initiated by Monogame*. This means the vulnerability is exposed because of how Monogame uses the native library.
    *   **Impact:**  Depends on the vulnerability in the underlying library, but could range from application crashes and denial of service to arbitrary code execution at a lower level.
    *   **Affected Monogame Component:**  The specific Monogame components that interface with the vulnerable native library functions. Examples include the platform-specific implementations within `Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics` or input handling relying on SDL2 *where Monogame directly calls the vulnerable function*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, potentially Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Monogame updated, as updates often include newer versions of its dependencies with security fixes.
        *   Monitor security advisories for the native libraries used by Monogame on the target platforms and assess if Monogame's usage is affected.

## Threat: [Compromised Monogame Installation/Dependencies](./threats/compromised_monogame_installationdependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Monogame Installation/Dependencies
    *   **Description:** If the developer's Monogame installation or its direct dependencies (packages consumed by the Monogame project) are compromised, malicious code could be injected into the game during the build process *through the Monogame build pipeline or its dependency management*.
    *   **Impact:**  The impact is severe, potentially leading to the distribution of malware to end-users.
    *   **Affected Monogame Component:** The entire build pipeline and any part of the application that uses the compromised Monogame components or dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use trusted sources for Monogame and its direct dependencies (e.g., official NuGet packages).
        *   Implement security measures on the development machine to prevent compromise.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in used libraries.
        *   Regularly update Monogame and its dependencies.

## Threat: [Tampering with Distributed Monogame Runtime Libraries](./threats/tampering_with_distributed_monogame_runtime_libraries.md)

*   **Threat:** Tampering with Distributed Monogame Runtime Libraries
    *   **Description:** After the game is built and distributed, attackers might tamper with the Monogame runtime libraries (DLLs) included with the application, replacing them with malicious versions that *mimic Monogame's API but contain malicious code*.
    *   **Impact:**  The attacker could gain control over the application's execution, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or other malicious activities.
    *   **Affected Monogame Component:** The Monogame runtime libraries that are distributed with the application (e.g., MonoGame.Framework.dll).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement code signing for the game executable and runtime libraries to ensure integrity.
        *   Use distribution channels that provide integrity checks.
