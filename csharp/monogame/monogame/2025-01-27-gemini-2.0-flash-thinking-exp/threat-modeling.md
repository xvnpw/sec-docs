# Threat Model Analysis for monogame/monogame

## Threat: [Native Library Exploitation](./threats/native_library_exploitation.md)

Description: An attacker exploits vulnerabilities present in the underlying native libraries (SDL2, OpenAL, Graphics APIs) that Monogame relies upon. This can be achieved by crafting specific inputs or triggering code paths within the Monogame application that interact with vulnerable functions in these libraries. Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's system.
Impact: Critical. Full system compromise due to arbitrary code execution. Potential for data theft, malware installation, and complete control over the user's machine. Denial of service by crashing the application or the operating system.
Affected Monogame Component: Monogame Core, Platform-Specific Backends, Native Library Bindings.
Risk Severity: Critical.
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Keep Monogame Updated: Regularly update Monogame to the latest stable version. Monogame updates often include patches for vulnerabilities in underlying libraries.
    * Monitor Security Advisories: Stay informed about security advisories for SDL2, OpenAL, and the graphics API libraries relevant to your target platforms.
    * Robust Error Handling: Implement comprehensive error handling within the application to prevent crashes and unexpected behavior that could be exploited.
    * Minimize Feature Usage: Consider using only the necessary Monogame features to reduce the attack surface related to specific native library components.

## Threat: [Malicious Content Injection leading to Code Execution](./threats/malicious_content_injection_leading_to_code_execution.md)

Description: An attacker injects malicious content (e.g., crafted images, models, or audio files) that exploits vulnerabilities in Monogame's Content Pipeline. When the application loads and processes this malicious content, it can trigger code execution. This could occur if content loaders have vulnerabilities or if the processing logic is flawed.
Impact: High. Code execution within the application's context, potentially leading to application compromise or further system exploitation. Data breaches if the attacker gains access to application data. Game save corruption or manipulation.
Affected Monogame Component: Content Pipeline, Content Loaders (e.g., ImageReader, SoundReader, ModelReader), Asset Processing functions.
Risk Severity: High.
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Trusted Content Sources:  Strictly load content only from trusted and verified sources. Avoid loading content from untrusted user-generated content or external, unverified sources.
    * Content Integrity Checks: Implement robust content integrity checks, such as checksums or digital signatures, to verify the authenticity and integrity of loaded content.
    * Content Sanitization (Limited): While complex for binary assets, explore options for sanitizing or validating content before loading, especially for text-based content or metadata.
    * Security Audits of Custom Loaders: If you extend or customize the Content Pipeline with custom content loaders, conduct thorough security audits of these loaders to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Shader Code Injection for Malicious Operations](./threats/shader_code_injection_for_malicious_operations.md)

Description: An attacker injects malicious shader code into the application, which is then executed by the GPU. This could be achieved if the application loads shaders from untrusted sources or if there are vulnerabilities in the shader compilation or execution process within Monogame. Malicious shaders can be designed to perform unauthorized computations, access sensitive data within GPU memory (if vulnerabilities exist), or cause denial of service by exhausting GPU resources.
Impact: High. Potential for unauthorized computations on the GPU, denial of service by GPU resource exhaustion, and in severe cases, potential for code execution on the CPU if GPU vulnerabilities are exploited to gain CPU access. Visual manipulation and disruption of the game.
Affected Monogame Component: Graphics Pipeline, Shader Compilation (e.g., `Effect.CompileEffect`), Shader Execution.
Risk Severity: High.
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Trusted Shader Sources: Load shaders exclusively from trusted and verified sources. Never load shaders from untrusted user input or external, unverified locations.
    * Shader Code Review: If dynamic shader loading is necessary, implement a rigorous shader code review process to identify and reject potentially malicious or vulnerable shader code.
    * Secure Shader Compilation: Ensure the shader compilation process is secure and uses up-to-date and trusted shader compilers.
    * Resource Limits for Shaders: Implement limits on shader complexity and resource usage to prevent denial of service attacks through overly complex or resource-intensive shaders.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Monogame's Direct Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_monogame's_direct_dependencies.md)

Description: Critical vulnerabilities are discovered in the direct dependencies of Monogame itself (NuGet packages or native libraries that Monogame directly includes and relies on). If these vulnerabilities are exploitable, applications using Monogame become vulnerable as well.
Impact: High to Critical. Depending on the vulnerability, impacts can range from code execution and denial of service to information disclosure and full application compromise. This impact is inherited by all applications using the vulnerable Monogame version.
Affected Monogame Component: Monogame Dependencies, NuGet Packages directly used by Monogame, core native libraries bundled with Monogame.
Risk Severity: High to Critical (depending on the specific dependency vulnerability).
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Keep Monogame Updated:  Updating Monogame is crucial to receive security patches for its dependencies. Monogame developers are responsible for updating their dependencies and releasing patched versions.
    * Monitor Monogame Release Notes and Security Announcements: Stay informed about Monogame releases and any security announcements related to Monogame's dependencies.
    * Dependency Scanning (Limited Applicability for End-Users): While end-users might not directly manage Monogame's core dependencies, understanding the dependencies and potential vulnerabilities in them is important. Dependency scanning tools might be helpful for developers contributing to Monogame itself or creating custom Monogame builds.
