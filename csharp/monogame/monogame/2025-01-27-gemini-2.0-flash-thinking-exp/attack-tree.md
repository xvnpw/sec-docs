*   **Critical Node:** This is a major entry point for attackers to compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses in how MonoGame processes game assets.
*   **High-Risk Path:**  Successful exploitation here can lead to code execution and system compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **1.1 Malicious Asset Injection:**
        *   **Critical Node:** Injecting malicious assets is the primary method to exploit the content pipeline.
        *   **High-Risk Path:**  Bypassing content validation and loading malicious assets can lead to critical vulnerabilities.
            *   **1.1.1 Crafted Image Files:**
                *   **Critical Node:** Images are a common asset type and image loading libraries are historically prone to vulnerabilities.
                *   **High-Risk Path:**  Malicious images can trigger memory corruption during loading.
                    *   **1.1.1.a Buffer Overflow in Image Loading:**
                        *   **Critical Node:** Buffer overflows are classic and highly exploitable vulnerabilities.
                        *   **High-Risk Path:**  Crafted images exceeding buffer limits during decoding (PNG, JPG, etc.) can overwrite memory and allow code execution.
                    *   **1.1.1.c Heap Overflow in Image Allocation:**
                        *   **Critical Node:** Heap overflows are also highly exploitable memory corruption issues.
                        *   **High-Risk Path:**  Crafted images causing excessive heap allocation during processing can lead to heap overflows and code execution.
            *   **1.1.2 Crafted Model Files:**
                *   **Critical Node:** Model files are complex and their parsing can be vulnerable.
                *   **High-Risk Path:** Malicious models can trigger vulnerabilities during loading and processing.
                    *   **1.1.2.a Buffer Overflow in Model Loading:**
                        *   **Critical Node:** Similar to images, model loading can suffer from buffer overflows.
                        *   **High-Risk Path:**  Crafted models exceeding buffer limits during loading (FBX, custom formats) can lead to code execution.
                    *   **1.1.2.b Arbitrary File Write during Model Processing:**
                        *   **High-Risk Path:** If the content pipeline has flaws, processing a malicious model could be manipulated to write files to arbitrary locations on the system, potentially leading to system compromise.
            *   **1.1.3 Crafted Audio Files:**
                *   **Critical Node:** Audio decoding, like image decoding, can be a source of vulnerabilities.
                *   **High-Risk Path:** Malicious audio files can trigger memory corruption during decoding.
                    *   **1.1.3.a Buffer Overflow in Audio Decoding:**

                        *   **High-Risk Path:** Crafted audio files exceeding buffer limits during decoding (MP3, WAV, etc.) can lead to code execution.
                    *   **1.1.3.b Integer Overflow in Audio Processing:**
                        *   **Critical Node:** Integer overflows can lead to unexpected memory allocation sizes and subsequent memory corruption.
                        *   **High-Risk Path:** Integer overflows during audio processing can lead to memory corruption and code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.0 Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2_0_exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **2.1 Input Injection Attacks:**
    *   **2.1.1 Keyboard Input Injection:**
        *   **Critical Node:** Keyboard input is a primary user interaction method and a common attack vector.
        *   **High-Risk Path:**  Improper handling of keyboard input can lead to command injection.
            *   **2.1.1.a Command Injection via Text Input Fields:**
                *   **Critical Node:** Text input fields, if used without proper sanitization, are direct pathways for command injection.
                *   **High-Risk Path:**  If the application uses text input fields (e.g., for chat, console commands) and doesn't sanitize input, attackers can inject system commands that are then executed by the application, leading to system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.0 Exploit MonoGame Library Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/4_0_exploit_monogame_library_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Critical Node:** Exploiting vulnerabilities directly within the MonoGame framework can have widespread impact.

*   **4.1 Known MonoGame Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Critical Node:** Known vulnerabilities are easier to exploit as information and potentially exploits are publicly available.
    *   **High-Risk Path:**  Applications using outdated MonoGame versions are vulnerable to known exploits.
        *   **4.1.1 Exploiting Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities (CVEs):**
            *   **Critical Node:** CVEs represent publicly documented vulnerabilities with potential exploits.
            *   **High-Risk Path:** Targeting applications using outdated MonoGame versions with known CVEs is a straightforward attack.

                *   **6.1.1.a Unintended access to game internals:**
                    *   **Critical Node:** Exposing game internals unintentionally can allow attackers to bypass intended game mechanics or access sensitive data.
                    *   **High-Risk Path:**  Poorly designed MonoGame interactions can unintentionally expose game internals, allowing attackers to manipulate game state or access sensitive information.
                *   **6.1.1.b Exploiting game logic flaws exposed through MonoGame's input or state management:**
                    *   **Critical Node:** Flaws in game logic, especially related to input and state, are often exploitable for cheating or more serious vulnerabilities.
                    *   **High-Risk Path:**  Vulnerabilities in game logic related to input handling or state management, when exposed through MonoGame APIs, can be exploited for game manipulation, denial of service, or potentially code execution if the logic flaws are severe enough.
