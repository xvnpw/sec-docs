# Threat Model Analysis for monogame/monogame

## Threat: [Malicious Content Pipeline Asset](./threats/malicious_content_pipeline_asset.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Content Pipeline Asset
    *   **Description:** An attacker could provide a maliciously crafted asset (image, audio, model, etc.) that exploits vulnerabilities in the Monogame Content Pipeline during processing. This could lead to buffer overflows, infinite loops, or other issues during asset loading, potentially allowing for code execution within the content pipeline process.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (application crash during asset loading), potential for arbitrary code execution within the content pipeline process.
    *   **Affected Component:** Monogame Content Pipeline (MGCB).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only load assets from trusted sources.
        *   Implement checks and validation on loaded assets where feasible.
        *   Run the Content Pipeline in a sandboxed environment if possible.

## Threat: [Exploiting Native Code Vulnerabilities in Platform-Specific Implementations](./threats/exploiting_native_code_vulnerabilities_in_platform-specific_implementations.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Native Code Vulnerabilities in Platform-Specific Implementations
    *   **Description:** Monogame uses native code for platform-specific functionalities. Vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, use-after-free) in these native implementations within Monogame could be exploited by an attacker with local access or through carefully crafted input that triggers the vulnerable code path within Monogame's native components.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, elevation of privilege (depending on the vulnerability and platform).
    *   **Affected Component:** Platform-specific Monogame backends (e.g., DirectX implementation on Windows, OpenGL on Linux/macOS, platform-specific graphics/input handling within Monogame).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Monogame updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in the native code.
        *   Ensure the underlying operating system and drivers are up-to-date.

## Threat: [Input Injection via Gamepad or Keyboard](./threats/input_injection_via_gamepad_or_keyboard.md)

*   **Threat:** Input Injection via Gamepad or Keyboard
    *   **Description:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious input sequences through gamepads or keyboards that exploit vulnerabilities in Monogame's input handling. This might involve sending excessively long input strings or specific key combinations that trigger unexpected behavior or crashes within Monogame's input processing logic, potentially leading to exploitable states.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (application crash), unexpected game behavior potentially leading to exploitable vulnerabilities in game logic.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input` namespace, platform-specific input handling implementations within Monogame.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the game logic.
        *   Limit the length and type of expected input processed by the game.
        *   Handle unexpected input gracefully and prevent it from reaching sensitive game logic.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion due to Improper Resource Management within Monogame](./threats/resource_exhaustion_due_to_improper_resource_management_within_monogame.md)

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion due to Improper Resource Management within Monogame
    *   **Description:** Bugs within Monogame's code could lead to improper management of resources (memory, textures, audio buffers, etc.), allowing an attacker to trigger resource exhaustion by performing actions that excessively allocate resources without proper release, causing a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (application becomes unresponsive or crashes).
    *   **Affected Component:** Various parts of Monogame.Framework responsible for resource allocation and disposal (e.g., `GraphicsDevice`, `ContentManager`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Monogame updated to benefit from fixes to resource management issues.
        *   Follow best practices for resource management when using Monogame APIs (dispose of objects properly).
        *   Monitor resource usage during development and testing to identify potential leaks.
