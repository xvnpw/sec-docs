# Attack Surface Analysis for monogame/monogame

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Loaded Audio Files](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_loaded_audio_files.md)

*   **Description:**  Maliciously crafted audio files can exploit vulnerabilities in the audio decoding libraries used by Monogame or the underlying platform.
*   **How Monogame Contributes:** Monogame uses platform-specific audio libraries for playback. If these libraries have vulnerabilities, loading a malicious audio file through Monogame's audio API can trigger them.
*   **Example:** A game loads an MP3 file from an untrusted source. The MP3 file contains crafted metadata that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the underlying MP3 decoding library, leading to code execution.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Validate audio files before loading. Use reputable audio encoding/decoding libraries and keep them updated. Consider sandboxing audio decoding processes. Avoid loading audio from untrusted sources.
    *   **Users:** Be cautious about downloading and using audio files from unknown sources.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Assets via the Content Pipeline](./attack_surfaces/malicious_assets_via_the_content_pipeline.md)

*   **Description:** Specially crafted game assets (images, models, etc.) can exploit vulnerabilities in the Monogame Content Pipeline's processing logic or the underlying asset processing libraries.
*   **How Monogame Contributes:** Monogame's Content Pipeline handles the loading and processing of various asset types. Vulnerabilities in the pipeline's code or the libraries it uses (e.g., image decoders) can be exploited by malicious assets.
*   **Example:** A game loads a PNG image from a user-created mod. The PNG file contains carefully crafted data that exploits a buffer overflow in the PNG decoding library used by the Content Pipeline, allowing arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution, data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Validate all assets before loading, especially those from external or untrusted sources. Keep Monogame and its dependencies updated. Consider sandboxing the content pipeline processing. Implement integrity checks for assets.
    *   **Users:** Be cautious about installing mods or loading custom content from untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Shader Vulnerabilities (if dynamically loaded)](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_shader_vulnerabilities__if_dynamically_loaded_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows loading and compiling shaders at runtime from external sources, malicious shader code can be injected.
*   **How Monogame Contributes:** Monogame provides mechanisms for loading and using shaders. If the application allows dynamic loading without proper validation, it becomes an attack vector.
*   **Example:** A game allows players to upload custom shaders. A malicious player uploads a shader that contains code to read GPU memory or cause a denial of service by creating infinite loops.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service (GPU lockup), information disclosure (reading GPU memory), potentially influencing the rendering of other applications.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Avoid dynamic loading of shaders from untrusted sources. If necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization of shader code. Consider using a curated set of pre-approved shaders. Run shader compilation in a sandboxed environment.
    *   **Users:** Avoid using custom shaders from untrusted sources.
