## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **1.1. Buffer Overflow in Input Processing:** Attackers send more data than the allocated buffer can hold, overwriting adjacent memory. This can be used to inject and execute arbitrary code.
    * **1.3. Exploiting vulnerabilities in custom input handling code:** Flaws in developer-written code for processing input can be exploited. This could include logic errors, incorrect bounds checking, or mishandling of specific input sequences leading to unintended actions or vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Resource Loading Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_resource_loading_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **2.1. Malicious Asset Injection:** Attackers replace legitimate game assets with malicious files. When the game loads these assets, the malicious code is executed.
        * **2.1.1. Exploit lack of integrity checks on loaded assets:** If the application doesn't verify the integrity of loaded assets (e.g., using checksums), malicious replacements will go undetected.
    * **2.2. Path Traversal Vulnerabilities:** Attackers manipulate file paths used for loading assets to access files outside the intended game directory. This can lead to reading sensitive data or even executing arbitrary code if executable files are accessed.
        * **2.2.1.1. Exploit lack of proper sanitization of file paths:** If the application doesn't sanitize file paths provided in configuration or input, attackers can inject ".." sequences to navigate the file system.
    * **2.3. Exploiting vulnerabilities in asset parsing libraries:** Attackers provide specially crafted asset files (images, audio, models) that exploit vulnerabilities in the libraries used by Monogame to parse these files. This can lead to code execution or application crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Native Interoperability Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_native_interoperability_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **4.2. Insecure P/Invoke Calls (if application uses them):** If the application uses P/Invoke to call native code, vulnerabilities can arise from:
        * **4.2.1. Exploit vulnerabilities in native code called through P/Invoke:** The native code being called might have its own vulnerabilities that can be triggered through the P/Invoke interface.
        * **4.2.2. Manipulate parameters passed to P/Invoke calls:** Attackers can manipulate the parameters passed to the native function to cause unexpected behavior, memory corruption, or other security breaches in the native code.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploit Vulnerabilities within the Monogame Framework Itself](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_vulnerabilities_within_the_monogame_framework_itself.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **6.1. Known Monogame Vulnerabilities:** Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in specific versions of Monogame can be exploited if the application uses an outdated and vulnerable version.
        * **6.1.1.1. Target applications using outdated Monogame versions:** Attackers specifically target applications known to be using older, vulnerable versions of the framework.
    * **6.3. Exploiting insecure default configurations or behaviors within Monogame:** Monogame might have default settings or behaviors that are insecure if not properly configured by the developer. Attackers can leverage these insecure defaults to compromise the application.
