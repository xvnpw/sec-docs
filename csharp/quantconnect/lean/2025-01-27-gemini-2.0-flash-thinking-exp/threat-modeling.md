Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Rigorous algorithm development lifecycle with comprehensive testing.
    *   Code reviews by experienced developers.
    *   Static code analysis tools to identify logic flaws.
    *   Implement circuit breakers and risk management rules.
    *   Thorough documentation and understanding of LEAN API.
    *   Gradual deployment in simulated environments before live trading.
    *   Monitoring of algorithm performance for anomalies.

## Threat: [Malicious or Subverted Algorithms](./threats/malicious_or_subverted_algorithms.md)

Description: A malicious actor uploads or injects a deliberately crafted algorithm into LEAN. This algorithm is designed to steal API keys, exfiltrate trading data, perform denial-of-service attacks on LEAN, or manipulate trading signals for malicious purposes.
Impact: Data breach, financial theft, system downtime, reputational damage, legal repercussions.
LEAN Component Affected: Algorithm Loading and Execution, Algorithm Management Interface, Data Access Layer, Security Framework.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Algorithm sandboxing and isolation to limit access.
    *   Strict access control for algorithm upload and modification.
    *   Mandatory code review for uploaded algorithms, including automated security scans.
    *   Input validation and sanitization for algorithm parameters.
    *   "Least privilege" principle for algorithm execution permissions.
    *   Real-time monitoring of algorithm behavior for suspicious activity.
    *   Digital signatures and integrity checks for algorithms.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Credentials (API Keys, Brokerage Credentials)](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_credentials__api_keys__brokerage_credentials_.md)

Description: An attacker gains access to sensitive credentials required for LEAN to connect to brokers and data providers. This could be due to insecure storage within the LEAN application or environment. With these credentials, unauthorized access to trading accounts and data is possible.
Impact: Unauthorized access to trading accounts, financial theft, data breach, reputational damage, regulatory fines.
LEAN Component Affected: Configuration Management, Credential Storage, Brokerage API Integration, Data Provider API Integration.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Secure storage of credentials using encryption and secrets management systems.
    *   Principle of least privilege for credential access.
    *   Regular rotation of API keys and brokerage credentials.
    *   Avoid hardcoding credentials in algorithms or configuration files.
    *   Secure configuration management practices.
    *   Robust access control for systems storing credentials.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Trading Data and Algorithm Information](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_trading_data_and_algorithm_information.md)

Description: An attacker gains unauthorized access to sensitive trading data or proprietary algorithm code stored within the LEAN environment. This could be through weak access controls in the application or LEAN setup. The attacker could exploit this information for insider trading or competitive advantage.
Impact: Intellectual property theft, insider trading opportunities, competitive disadvantage, reputational damage, regulatory fines.
LEAN Component Affected: Data Storage, Algorithm Storage, Access Control, Security Framework, Backtesting Engine.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Robust access control mechanisms (RBAC) to restrict data and algorithm access.
    *   Data encryption at rest and in transit.
    *   Audit logging of data access and algorithm execution.
    *   Secure data storage practices and infrastructure hardening.
    *   Regular security audits and penetration testing for access control vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the LEAN Engine Software](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the_lean_engine_software.md)

Description: An attacker exploits a security vulnerability within the LEAN engine code itself. This could allow for unauthorized access, arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or compromise of trading operations.
Impact: System compromise, data breach, denial of service, financial losses, reputational damage, legal repercussions.
LEAN Component Affected: Core LEAN Engine (various modules), Security Framework, API Interfaces.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Keep LEAN engine updated to the latest version with security patches.
    *   Monitor for security advisories related to LEAN.
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of LEAN.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when extending LEAN.
    *   Contribute to the LEAN open-source community by reporting vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by LEAN. These vulnerabilities in dependencies can lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or other security breaches within the LEAN environment.
Impact: System compromise, data breach, denial of service, financial losses, reputational damage.
LEAN Component Affected: Dependency Management, Core LEAN Engine (through vulnerable dependencies).
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools.
    *   Keep dependencies updated to the latest versions with security patches.
    *   Use dependency management tools to track and manage dependencies.
    *   Consider Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools for continuous monitoring.
    *   Minimize dependencies and choose reputable libraries.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks Targeting LEAN or Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_targeting_lean_or_dependencies.md)

Description: An attacker compromises the software supply chain of LEAN or its dependencies, injecting malicious code. Users downloading compromised software unknowingly introduce vulnerabilities into their applications using LEAN.
Impact: System compromise, widespread vulnerabilities, data breach, reputational damage, loss of trust.
LEAN Component Affected: Software Distribution, Dependency Management, Build Process.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Verify integrity of LEAN downloads using checksums and digital signatures.
    *   Use trusted sources for LEAN and dependencies (official repositories).
    *   Implement software supply chain security practices.
    *   Regularly scan for malware in development and deployment environments.
    *   Consider dependency pinning and reproducible builds.
    *   Monitor for supply chain compromise advisories in the open-source ecosystem.
