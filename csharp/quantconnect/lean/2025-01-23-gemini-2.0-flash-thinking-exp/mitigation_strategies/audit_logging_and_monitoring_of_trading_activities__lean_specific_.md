    *   **Threat Intelligence Integration:**  Incorporate threat intelligence feeds and knowledge of common trading application attacks to inform the definition of security events.
    *   **Use Case Development:**  Develop specific use cases for each security event, outlining the potential threat, the log patterns to monitor, and the expected response.
    *   **Iterative Refinement:**  Establish a process for regularly reviewing and refining security event definitions based on incident analysis, threat landscape changes, and feedback from security monitoring teams.

**Step 4: Set up real-time alerts based on Lean's audit logs.**

*   **Analysis:** Real-time alerting is crucial for timely incident detection and response.  This step leverages the centralized logs and defined security events to trigger alerts when suspicious activity is detected.  Alerting needs to be configured within the SIEM or logging platform.
*   **Strengths:**  Enables rapid detection of security incidents, minimizing potential damage and downtime.  Automates security monitoring and reduces reliance on manual log review for immediate threats.  Provides timely notifications to security teams for prompt investigation and response.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Alert fatigue can occur if alerts are not properly tuned, leading to desensitization and missed critical alerts.  Requires careful configuration of alert thresholds and conditions to minimize false positives.  Effective alerting depends on accurate security event definitions and reliable log ingestion.
*   **Implementation Considerations:**  Requires configuration of alerting rules within the chosen SIEM or logging platform based on the defined security events.  Tuning of alert thresholds and conditions to minimize false positives and false negatives.  Establishment of clear alert notification channels and escalation procedures.  Regular review and optimization of alerting rules based on alert effectiveness and feedback from security teams.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Alert Prioritization and Severity Levels:**  Implement alert prioritization and severity levels to focus security team attention on the most critical incidents.
    *   **Alert Tuning and Threshold Adjustment:**  Continuously monitor alert effectiveness and tune alert thresholds and conditions to minimize false positives and optimize detection accuracy.
    *   **Notification Channels and Escalation:**  Define clear notification channels (e.g., email, SMS, incident management systems) and escalation procedures for security alerts to ensure timely response.
    *   **Playbook Development:**  Develop incident response playbooks for common security alerts to guide security teams in investigating and resolving incidents efficiently.

**Step 5: Regularly review and analyze Lean's audit logs for security incidents and compliance purposes.**
