## Threat: [Malicious Algorithm Injection (via Lean Interface)](./threats/malicious_algorithm_injection__via_lean_interface_.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Algorithm Injection (via Lean Interface)
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *within Lean's algorithm loading or execution mechanisms* to inject and run a malicious algorithm. This differs from the previous "Malicious Algorithm Injection" in that it focuses on vulnerabilities *within Lean itself*, not just the surrounding deployment environment.  For example, a flaw in how Lean handles user-provided algorithm code (if that's a feature) could be exploited.
    *   **Impact:** Complete loss of funds, market manipulation, data breach, legal and regulatory consequences, reputational damage.  Control over the Lean instance.
    *   **Affected Lean Component:** `AlgorithmManager`, `IAlgorithm` interface (handling and execution of the algorithm), any Lean components responsible for loading or compiling user-provided code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** If Lean accepts algorithm code from external sources (e.g., user uploads, API calls), *extremely* rigorous validation and sanitization are crucial.  Consider sandboxing or running the code in a highly restricted environment.
        *   **Code Signing (Internal):** Even for internally managed algorithms, code signing can help prevent unauthorized modifications.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning of Lean:** Regularly scan the Lean codebase itself for vulnerabilities related to code execution and input handling.
        *   **Limit Algorithm Capabilities:** Restrict the permissions and capabilities of algorithms running within Lean (e.g., network access, file system access).

## Threat: [Algorithm Logic Flaw - Unintended Market Manipulation (High Impact)](./threats/algorithm_logic_flaw_-_unintended_market_manipulation__high_impact_.md)

*   **Threat:** Algorithm Logic Flaw - Unintended Market Manipulation (High Impact)
    *   **Description:** A developer unintentionally introduces a bug into the algorithm's logic *that interacts with Lean's core order handling in a way that causes severe market disruption*. This is specifically about flaws that leverage Lean's features to amplify the negative impact. For example, a bug that causes rapid-fire order placement *through Lean's brokerage integration* could be more impactful than a simple logic error.
    *   **Impact:** Major market disruption (e.g., flash crash), significant financial losses, severe regulatory fines, reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Lean Component:** `IAlgorithm` implementation (the flawed algorithm code), `QCAlgorithm` methods related to order placement (`PlaceOrder`, `MarketOrder`, etc.), `IBrokerage` implementations (how orders are sent to the market).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enhanced Code Review (Lean-Specific):** Focus code reviews on the interaction between the algorithm and Lean's order handling, brokerage integration, and data feed components.
        *   **Stress Testing (Lean Integration):** Specifically test the algorithm's behavior under extreme market conditions and high order volumes *within the Lean environment*.
        *   **Lean-Specific Circuit Breakers:** Implement circuit breakers *within Lean itself* that can detect and halt algorithms exhibiting dangerous behavior related to order placement or market interaction.
        *   **Transaction Rate Limiting (within Lean):** Consider adding rate limiting features *directly within Lean's brokerage integration* to prevent algorithms from overwhelming the market.

## Threat: [Data Feed Poisoning - Exploiting Lean's Data Handling](./threats/data_feed_poisoning_-_exploiting_lean's_data_handling.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Feed Poisoning - Exploiting Lean's Data Handling
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the data feed and injects false data, *specifically targeting vulnerabilities or weaknesses in how Lean processes and handles this data*. This goes beyond simply providing bad data; it focuses on exploiting how Lean *interprets* or *uses* that data. For example, if Lean has a vulnerability in how it handles certain data types or edge cases, the attacker could craft malicious data to trigger that vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Incorrect trading decisions leading to significant losses, potential exploitation of the Lean engine itself (if the data poisoning triggers a vulnerability).
    *   **Affected Lean Component:** `IDataFeed` implementation, `BaseData` derived classes, `HistoryProvider`, any Lean components involved in data parsing, validation, and storage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Robust Data Validation (within Lean):** Implement *very* strict data validation checks *within Lean's data handling components* to detect and reject anomalous or potentially malicious data. This goes beyond simple range checks; it should include checks for data type consistency, expected patterns, and potential exploits.
        *   **Fuzz Testing of Lean's Data Handlers:** Use fuzz testing techniques to identify vulnerabilities in how Lean processes different types of market data.
        *   **Redundant Data Feeds (with Lean-Level Comparison):** Implement logic *within Lean* to compare data from multiple feeds and detect discrepancies.
        *   **Secure Data Deserialization:** If Lean deserializes data from external sources, ensure that this process is secure and resistant to injection attacks.

## Threat: [Brokerage API Key Leakage (from Lean's Configuration)](./threats/brokerage_api_key_leakage__from_lean's_configuration_.md)

*   **Threat:** Brokerage API Key Leakage (from Lean's Configuration)
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the API keys used by Lean *specifically by exploiting a vulnerability in how Lean stores or manages these keys*. This is distinct from general key leakage; it focuses on weaknesses *within Lean's configuration system*. For example, if Lean stores keys in an insecure format or has a vulnerability that allows unauthorized access to its configuration files, this would be the threat.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the brokerage account, potential complete loss of funds, access to sensitive account information.
    *   **Affected Lean Component:** `Brokerage` implementations (how they access and use keys), Lean's configuration management system (e.g., `config.json` handling, environment variable handling).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Configuration Storage (within Lean):** Review and harden how Lean stores and accesses sensitive configuration data, including API keys.  Consider using a secure vault or key management service *integrated with Lean*.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning of Lean's Configuration System:** Specifically scan Lean for vulnerabilities related to configuration file handling and access control.
        *   **Least Privilege (Lean's Access to Keys):** Ensure that Lean itself only has the minimum necessary access to the API keys.
        *   **Audit Trail for Key Access (within Lean):** Implement logging within Lean to track when and how API keys are accessed.

## Threat: [Lean Library Vulnerability Exploitation (High Impact)](./threats/lean_library_vulnerability_exploitation__high_impact_.md)

*   **Threat:** Lean Library Vulnerability Exploitation (High Impact)
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a *high-impact* vulnerability in the Lean library or one of its *core* dependencies to gain control of the system, modify algorithm behavior, or steal data. This focuses on vulnerabilities that directly affect Lean's core functionality, not just peripheral components.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breach, algorithm manipulation, denial of service, *specifically impacting the core trading operations managed by Lean*.
    *   **Affected Lean Component:** Potentially any *critical* part of the Lean library or its *essential* dependencies (e.g., those involved in order handling, data processing, brokerage communication).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Prioritized Updates:** Immediately apply security updates for Lean and its *core* dependencies.
        *   **Targeted Vulnerability Scanning:** Focus vulnerability scanning efforts on the *critical components* of Lean and its *essential* dependencies.
        *   **Dependency Analysis:** Carefully analyze the dependencies of Lean and identify those that are most critical to its core functionality. Prioritize security reviews and updates for these dependencies.
        *   **Runtime Protection:** Consider using runtime application self-protection (RASP) tools to detect and prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities in Lean at runtime.

## Threat: [Backtesting Data Manipulation (Impacting Lean's Integrity)](./threats/backtesting_data_manipulation__impacting_lean's_integrity_.md)

*   **Threat:** Backtesting Data Manipulation (Impacting Lean's Integrity)
    *   **Description:** An attacker alters historical data *used internally by Lean for backtesting*, specifically targeting vulnerabilities in how Lean *stores, accesses, or validates* this data. This is about compromising the integrity of Lean's backtesting process itself, not just providing bad data.
    *   **Impact:** Deployment of a losing algorithm due to manipulated backtest results, undermining the reliability of Lean's backtesting engine.
    *   **Affected Lean Component:** `IDataFeed`, `HistoryProvider`, data storage files *managed by Lean*, any Lean components involved in loading, caching, or validating backtesting data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Data Integrity Checks (within Lean):** Implement robust data integrity checks *within Lean's backtesting components* to detect and prevent the use of manipulated data. This could involve checksums, digital signatures, or other techniques.
        *   **Secure Data Storage (for Lean's Internal Data):** Protect the data files used by Lean for backtesting from unauthorized modification, using file system permissions and other security measures.
        *   **Audit Trail for Backtesting Data (within Lean):** Implement logging within Lean to track access to and modifications of backtesting data.
        *   **Independent Verification of Backtesting Data:** Periodically verify the integrity of Lean's backtesting data against independent sources.
