# Attack Surface Analysis for quantconnect/lean

## Attack Surface: [1. Malicious Algorithm Logic (Theft/Manipulation)](./attack_surfaces/1__malicious_algorithm_logic__theftmanipulation_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts or compromises an algorithm to steal funds, manipulate trades, or leak information.
*   **Lean Contribution:** Lean is the *execution environment* for the algorithm.  Lean's features (data access, order placement, etc.) are the tools used by a malicious algorithm.  The attack *cannot* happen without Lean.
*   **Example:** An algorithm with a hidden backdoor that siphons a percentage of profits to the attacker.
*   **Impact:** Direct financial loss, account compromise, legal penalties.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rigorous Code Review:** Mandatory, independent code reviews focusing on security.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Utilize Lean's `SecurityManager` to *strictly* limit algorithm permissions (file access, network access, API calls). This is a *Lean-specific* mitigation.
    *   **Formal Verification:** For critical logic sections, consider formal methods to prove correctness.
    *   **Strict API Permission Control:**  Minimize API access granted to the algorithm within Lean and at the brokerage level.
    *   **Extensive Backtesting/Paper Trading:**  Mandatory before live deployment.
    *   **Real-time Monitoring/Alerting:**  Monitor algorithm behavior *through Lean's logging and event system* for anomalies.

## Attack Surface: [2. API Key Compromise (within Lean's context)](./attack_surfaces/2__api_key_compromise__within_lean's_context_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to API keys used *by Lean* to interact with the brokerage.
*   **Lean Contribution:** Lean *stores and uses* the API keys to connect to brokerage accounts.  The security of how Lean handles these keys is paramount.  This is distinct from general API key security; it's about *Lean's* handling.
*   **Example:**  An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a custom Lean data handler that exposes API keys in memory, or finds keys improperly stored due to misconfiguration of Lean's environment.
*   **Impact:** Complete control of the trading account, unauthorized trades, fund withdrawal.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Key Storage (Lean-Specific):**  *Never* hardcode keys. Use environment variables *accessed through Lean's configuration system*.  Leverage Lean's recommended methods for secure parameter handling.  If using a custom deployment, ensure secure key injection into the Lean environment.
    *   **Key Rotation:** Regularly rotate keys, and ensure Lean is configured to use the new keys correctly.
    *   **Least Privilege (Brokerage & Lean):**  Grant minimal permissions at the brokerage *and* within Lean's `SecurityManager`.
    *   **Network Security (Lean's Communication):** Ensure Lean communicates with the brokerage API over HTTPS with proper certificate validation.  This is a configuration aspect *within Lean*.

## Attack Surface: [3. Data Feed Manipulation (impacting Lean's data handling)](./attack_surfaces/3__data_feed_manipulation__impacting_lean's_data_handling_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a data feed *used by Lean*, leading to incorrect trading decisions.
*   **Lean Contribution:** Lean *processes and provides* the data to the algorithm.  The attack targets Lean's data ingestion and handling mechanisms.
*   **Example:**  An attacker injects false price data into a custom data feed implemented as a Lean `IDataFeed`.
*   **Impact:** Incorrect trades, financial losses, potential market manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Reputable Data Providers (for Lean integrations):** Choose providers with strong security, and use Lean's official integrations where possible.
    *   **Data Validation (within Lean Handlers):** Implement robust validation and sanity checks *within any custom Lean `IDataFeed` or `IDataProvider` implementations*. This is a *Lean-specific* mitigation.
    *   **Multiple Data Sources (configured in Lean):**  Use multiple, independent data sources *within Lean's configuration* for redundancy and comparison.
    *   **Data Integrity Checks (in custom Lean handlers):** If possible, verify data integrity using checksums or signatures *within custom Lean data handling code*.

## Attack Surface: [4. Dependency Vulnerabilities (within Lean and its extensions)](./attack_surfaces/4__dependency_vulnerabilities__within_lean_and_its_extensions_.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability in a library used *by Lean or a custom Lean extension* is exploited.
*   **Lean Contribution:** Lean itself and any custom `IDataFeed`, `IAlgorithm`, or other extensions rely on dependencies.  The vulnerability exists *within the Lean ecosystem*.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in a numerical library used by a custom Lean indicator allows code execution.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, data breaches, system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates (Lean and Custom Components):** Keep Lean and *all custom extensions* updated. This is critical for patching vulnerabilities in the entire Lean-based system.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning (Lean Project):** Use tools like `dotnet list package --vulnerable` on the *entire Lean project*, including any custom extensions.
    *   **Dependency Auditing (Lean Ecosystem):** Regularly audit dependencies of Lean *and* any custom components.
    *   **Vendor Monitoring (Lean and Extensions):** Monitor security advisories for Lean *and* all libraries used in custom extensions.
