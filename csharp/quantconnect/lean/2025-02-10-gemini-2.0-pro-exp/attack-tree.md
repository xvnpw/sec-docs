            *   **1.1.1.2 Social Engineering of Developers/Admins [HIGH RISK]**
                *   **Description:** The attacker uses social engineering techniques (phishing, pretexting, baiting) to trick developers or administrators into revealing credentials, installing malware, or granting access to the source code.
                *   **Example:**  A phishing email impersonating a trusted source, a phone call requesting sensitive information, a malicious USB drive left in a common area.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium
                *   **Impact:** High
                *   **Effort:** Low to Medium

                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Market Data Feeds (1.2) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_market_data_feeds__1_2___high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** The attacker aims to provide false or manipulated market data to the trading algorithm, causing it to make incorrect trading decisions.

    *   **1.2.1 Compromise Data Provider API [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the API of the data provider used by Lean.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **1.2.1.1 Exploit API Vulnerabilities (e.g., weak authentication, injection) [HIGH RISK]**
                *   **Description:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the data provider's API, such as weak authentication, lack of input validation, or SQL injection, to inject false data or gain unauthorized access.
                *   **Example:**  Using default or weak API keys, exploiting a SQL injection vulnerability to modify data, sending crafted requests to bypass authentication.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium
                *   **Impact:** High
                *   **Effort:** Medium to High
