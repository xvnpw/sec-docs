# Attack Surface Analysis for quantconnect/lean

## Attack Surface: [Market Data Injection](./attack_surfaces/market_data_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious or compromised external market data feeds inject fabricated or manipulated data into the Lean engine.
    *   **How Lean Contributes:** Lean's reliance on external data sources for backtesting and live trading, and the robustness of its data ingestion and validation processes, directly influence this attack surface. Weaknesses in Lean's data handling make it susceptible to accepting and processing malicious data.
    *   **Example:** A compromised data vendor provides historical price data with artificially inflated prices, leading to inaccurate backtesting results and potentially flawed live trading strategies executed by Lean.
    *   **Impact:** Incorrect backtesting results, flawed live trading decisions leading to financial losses, and potentially compromised trading strategies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Verify the integrity and authenticity of market data sources *used by Lean*.
        *   Implement robust data validation and sanitization *within the Lean data ingestion pipeline*.
        *   Use reputable and trusted data vendors with strong security practices.
        *   Monitor data feeds for anomalies and unexpected behavior *within Lean*.
        *   Implement circuit breakers or sanity checks in algorithms *executed by Lean* to detect and react to unusual data.

## Attack Surface: [Algorithm Sandboxing Weaknesses](./attack_surfaces/algorithm_sandboxing_weaknesses.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Lean's algorithm sandboxing mechanism allow malicious or poorly written algorithms to escape the sandbox and access system resources or interfere with other processes.
    *   **How Lean Contributes:** Lean *provides* the sandboxed environment for executing user-provided algorithms. The security and effectiveness of this sandbox are inherent to Lean's design and implementation.
    *   **Example:** A malicious algorithm exploits a vulnerability in the Lean sandboxing implementation to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Lean engine, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or other applications.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data breaches, denial of service, and potential control over the hosting environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Lean engine updated to the latest version with security patches *related to the sandbox*.
        *   Thoroughly review and test the sandboxing implementation *within Lean* for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement strong resource limits and monitoring for algorithm execution *within Lean*.
        *   Consider using additional layers of security like containerization or virtualization *around the Lean environment*.
        *   Restrict the permissions and capabilities available within the sandbox *as configured in Lean*.

## Attack Surface: [Brokerage API Key Compromise](./attack_surfaces/brokerage_api_key_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to brokerage API keys used by Lean to interact with trading platforms, allowing attackers to execute trades or access account information.
    *   **How Lean Contributes:** Lean requires and manages brokerage API keys for live trading operations. The security of how Lean stores, accesses, and uses these keys is a direct contribution to this attack surface.
    *   **Example:** Brokerage API keys are stored in plain text in a Lean configuration file accessible to an attacker. The attacker uses these keys to place unauthorized trades or withdraw funds from the associated account *via Lean*.
    *   **Impact:** Significant financial losses, unauthorized trading activity, and potential compromise of brokerage accounts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely store brokerage API keys using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions, avoiding hardcoding *within Lean configuration*.
        *   Encrypt API keys at rest and in transit *as handled by Lean or the surrounding application*.
        *   Implement strict access controls to configuration files and environment variables *used by Lean*.
        *   Utilize the principle of least privilege for API key permissions *granted to Lean*.
        *   Regularly rotate API keys.
        *   Monitor brokerage accounts for suspicious activity *originating from Lean*.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion through Malicious Algorithms](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_through_malicious_algorithms.md)

*   **Description:** A poorly written or intentionally malicious algorithm consumes excessive system resources (CPU, memory, network), leading to denial of service for the Lean engine or the entire application.
    *   **How Lean Contributes:** Lean's architecture for executing user algorithms and its mechanisms for resource management directly influence the likelihood and impact of this attack. Weak or missing resource limits within Lean are key contributors.
    *   **Example:** A malicious algorithm is designed with an infinite loop or performs computationally intensive operations without limits, causing the Lean engine to become unresponsive and potentially crashing the server.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, application downtime, and potential instability of the hosting environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement resource limits (CPU, memory, execution time) *within the Lean algorithm execution environment*.
        *   Monitor resource usage of running algorithms *within Lean*.
        *   Implement mechanisms to terminate or throttle algorithms exceeding resource limits *within Lean*.
        *   Educate users on best practices for algorithm development and resource management *for Lean*.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Data Source Integrations](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_data_source_integrations.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws in the code that integrates custom data sources with Lean, allowing attackers to inject malicious data or gain unauthorized access.
    *   **How Lean Contributes:** Lean's design allows for custom data source integrations, making it a potential conduit for vulnerabilities if these integrations are not secured. While the vulnerability may reside in the integration code, Lean's architecture facilitates this interaction.
    *   **Example:** A custom data connector fetches data from an external API without proper input validation. An attacker manipulates the API request to inject malicious code that is then processed by Lean.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, code execution within the Lean environment, and potential compromise of the Lean engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and secure all custom data source integrations *used with Lean*.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for data from custom sources *before it reaches Lean*.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom integrations *for Lean*.
        *   Use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) for fetching data *integrated with Lean*.
        *   Regularly audit and review custom integration code for vulnerabilities *interacting with Lean*.
