## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Algorithm Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_algorithm_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

This represents a broad category of attacks targeting the core logic of the trading algorithm. Success here can lead to significant financial losses or manipulation of trading strategies.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Inject Malicious Logic into User Algorithm (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__inject_malicious_logic_into_user_algorithm__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers aim to insert harmful code into the user's trading algorithm. This could involve logic to execute specific trades, steal data, or disrupt operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Via Unsanitized Input/Configuration (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/via_unsanitized_inputconfiguration__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers exploit the lack of proper input validation when users upload or configure their algorithms. Malicious code embedded within the input is then executed by Lean.

## Attack Tree Path: [Influence Algorithm Parameters](./attack_tree_paths/influence_algorithm_parameters.md)

While the parent node isn't marked as high-risk, a specific sub-path is:

## Attack Tree Path: [Via Manipulation of Data Sources Used by the Algorithm (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/via_manipulation_of_data_sources_used_by_the_algorithm__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers compromise the data feeds that the algorithm relies on. By injecting or altering market data, they can subtly influence the algorithm's decision-making process, leading to profitable trades for the attacker or losses for the application user.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Data Handling Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_data_handling_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

This category focuses on weaknesses in how the application and Lean handle market data and sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Inject Malicious Data into Data Feeds (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__inject_malicious_data_into_data_feeds__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers inject fabricated or manipulated data into the streams that Lean uses for live trading or backtesting. This can directly lead to incorrect trading decisions.

## Attack Tree Path: [If Application Relies on External Data Sources Without Proper Validation (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/if_application_relies_on_external_data_sources_without_proper_validation__high-risk_path_.md)

Applications that directly consume external data without verifying its integrity are highly vulnerable. Attackers can compromise these external sources to inject malicious data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Gain Access to Sensitive Data Handled by Lean (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__gain_access_to_sensitive_data_handled_by_lean__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers target sensitive information managed by Lean, such as brokerage credentials, API keys, and potentially the algorithm's source code.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Brokerage Account Credentials (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__brokerage_account_credentials__high-risk_path_.md)

Obtaining brokerage account credentials is a critical compromise, allowing attackers to directly control the trading account and execute unauthorized trades.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Brokerage Integration Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_brokerage_integration_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

This category focuses on weaknesses in how the application and Lean interact with brokerage APIs.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Steal Brokerage Credentials (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__steal_brokerage_credentials__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers aim to steal the credentials used to authenticate with the brokerage.

## Attack Tree Path: [If Stored Insecurely by the Application (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/if_stored_insecurely_by_the_application__high-risk_path_.md)

A common vulnerability where the application stores brokerage credentials in a way that is easily accessible to attackers (e.g., plain text, weak encryption).

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Execute Unauthorized Trades Directly Through Brokerage Account (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__execute_unauthorized_trades_directly_through_brokerage_account__high-risk_path_.md)

This is the direct consequence of gaining unauthorized access to the brokerage account.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Using Stolen Credentials (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__using_stolen_credentials__high-risk_path_.md)

Once brokerage credentials are stolen, attackers can use them to log in and execute trades as if they were the legitimate user.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

While the parent node isn't marked as high-risk, a specific sub-path is:

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Lean Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/modify_lean_configuration_files.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [If Configuration Files are Accessible Without Proper Authorization (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/if_configuration_files_are_accessible_without_proper_authorization__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers gain unauthorized access to Lean's configuration files. By modifying these files, they can alter the application's behavior, potentially introducing vulnerabilities or redirecting trading activities.
