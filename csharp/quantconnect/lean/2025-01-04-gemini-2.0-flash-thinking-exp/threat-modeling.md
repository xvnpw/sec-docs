# Threat Model Analysis for quantconnect/lean

## Threat: [Malicious Algorithm Execution](./threats/malicious_algorithm_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker submits a crafted algorithm containing malicious code. This code could exploit vulnerabilities within the LEAN execution environment to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially gaining full control. The attacker might attempt to read sensitive files, install malware, or pivot to other systems.

**Impact:** Critical. Complete compromise of the server hosting LEAN, leading to data breaches (including sensitive trading data, API keys), financial losses, and reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** Algorithm Execution Engine (specifically the component responsible for running user-submitted code), potentially the Python/C# interpreter or any libraries used in the execution sandbox.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement robust algorithm sandboxing with strict resource limits and isolation.
*   Employ static and dynamic code analysis on submitted algorithms before execution.
*   Regularly update LEAN and its dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Enforce strict input validation and sanitization for algorithm parameters.
*   Consider using a containerization technology (e.g., Docker) to further isolate algorithm execution environments.

## Threat: [Algorithm Logic Errors Leading to Financial Loss](./threats/algorithm_logic_errors_leading_to_financial_loss.md)

**Description:** While not intentionally malicious, an attacker could exploit publicly known or discovered flaws in common trading strategies or market behaviors by submitting an algorithm designed to capitalize on these weaknesses, potentially causing significant financial losses for other users or the platform itself. The attacker might exploit slippage, front-running opportunities, or arbitrage scenarios in an unintended way.

**Impact:** High. Significant financial losses for users or the platform.

**Affected Component:** Algorithm Execution Engine, Order Management System.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Provide robust backtesting and paper trading environments to allow users to thoroughly test their algorithms.
*   Implement risk management controls and circuit breakers to prevent runaway losses.
*   Offer educational resources and best practices for algorithm development.
*   Monitor for unusual trading patterns and provide alerts to users.
*   Consider implementing limitations on order sizes or frequency to mitigate the impact of faulty algorithms.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data within the LEAN Environment](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_within_the_lean_environment.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in LEAN's code or configuration could expose sensitive data such as API keys, brokerage credentials, database connection strings, or internal system information. An attacker exploiting these vulnerabilities could gain unauthorized access to these secrets.

**Impact:** Critical. Unauthorized access to trading accounts, financial losses, compromise of the platform's infrastructure.

**Affected Component:** Configuration Management, Credential Storage, Logging System.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Securely store sensitive data using encryption and secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
*   Implement strict access controls and the principle of least privilege.
*   Regularly audit LEAN's configuration and code for potential vulnerabilities.
*   Avoid storing sensitive information in plain text in configuration files or code.

## Threat: [Insecure Brokerage API Integration](./threats/insecure_brokerage_api_integration.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in how LEAN interacts with brokerage APIs could be exploited to manipulate orders, withdraw funds, or gain unauthorized access to trading accounts. An attacker might intercept API calls or exploit weaknesses in the API authentication or authorization mechanisms.

**Impact:** Critical. Financial losses due to unauthorized trading activity, unauthorized withdrawals from brokerage accounts.

**Affected Component:** Brokerage Integration Module, Order Routing System.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Securely store and handle brokerage API keys.
*   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for brokerage API interactions.
*   Validate all data exchanged with brokerage APIs.
*   Adhere to brokerage API security best practices.
*   Monitor API activity for suspicious patterns.

## Threat: [Compromised API Keys or Credentials](./threats/compromised_api_keys_or_credentials.md)

**Description:** If API keys or other credentials used by LEAN to connect to external services (e.g., data feeds, brokerage APIs) are compromised (e.g., through phishing, insider threat, or a security breach of a related system), an attacker could use these credentials to gain unauthorized access to those services and potentially manipulate trading activity or access sensitive data.

**Impact:** Critical. Unauthorized trading activity, access to sensitive market data, financial losses.

**Affected Component:** Credential Storage, API Client Libraries.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Securely store API keys using encryption and access controls.
*   Implement regular rotation of API keys.
*   Monitor API key usage for suspicious activity.
*   Educate users and developers about the importance of credential security.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in LEAN Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_lean_dependencies.md)

**Description:** LEAN relies on various third-party libraries and dependencies. If these dependencies contain security vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit them to compromise the LEAN engine. This could involve leveraging known exploits in libraries used for networking, data processing, or other functionalities.

**Impact:** High. Arbitrary code execution, data breaches, denial of service, depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Affected Component:** All components relying on vulnerable dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Regularly update LEAN and all its dependencies to the latest versions.
*   Implement vulnerability scanning for dependencies and address identified issues promptly.
*   Use dependency management tools to track and manage dependencies effectively.

## Threat: [Lack of Secure Updates and Patching](./threats/lack_of_secure_updates_and_patching.md)

**Description:** Failure to promptly apply security updates and patches to LEAN could leave the system vulnerable to known exploits. Attackers could leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities to compromise the system.

**Impact:** High. System compromise, data breaches, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** All components of LEAN.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Establish a process for regularly updating LEAN.
*   Subscribe to security advisories from QuantConnect and relevant security sources.
*   Test updates in a non-production environment before deploying to production.
*   Implement automated update mechanisms where appropriate.
