# Attack Surface Analysis for quantconnect/lean

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Algorithm Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_algorithm_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Users submit custom algorithms that contain malicious code.
*   **How Lean Contributes:** Lean's core functionality allows users to upload and execute arbitrary Python code within its environment. This provides a direct pathway for executing malicious logic.
*   **Example:** A user uploads an algorithm that, upon execution, reads environment variables containing API keys and sends them to an external server.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (exposure of sensitive information), resource exhaustion (DoS), manipulation of trading activity.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement a secure sandboxing environment with restricted system call access and resource limits for algorithm execution.
    *   Perform static and dynamic analysis of submitted algorithms before execution to identify potentially malicious code patterns.
    *   Enforce strict code review processes for submitted algorithms.
    *   Limit the libraries and modules accessible within the algorithm execution environment.
    *   Implement robust logging and monitoring of algorithm execution to detect suspicious activity.
    *   Consider a tiered access system where only trusted users can submit algorithms without rigorous review.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Algorithms](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_algorithms.md)

*   **Description:** User-submitted algorithms rely on external Python libraries that contain known security vulnerabilities.
*   **How Lean Contributes:** Lean allows the inclusion of external Python packages specified in requirements files or directly within the algorithm code. This inherits the risk of vulnerabilities present in those dependencies.
*   **Example:** An algorithm uses an outdated version of a popular data science library with a known remote code execution vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breach, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement a process to scan algorithm dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `safety` or `pip-audit`.
    *   Maintain an allow-list of approved and vetted libraries.
    *   Regularly update the Lean environment and its core dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.
    *   Encourage users to use well-maintained and reputable libraries.
    *   Implement dependency pinning to ensure consistent and tested versions of libraries are used.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Brokerage Credentials](./attack_surfaces/compromised_brokerage_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Lean requires brokerage credentials for live trading. If these credentials are stored insecurely within the application or Lean's configuration, they could be compromised.
*   **How Lean Contributes:** Lean's integration with brokerage APIs necessitates the storage and use of sensitive credentials. Insecure handling of these credentials directly increases the risk.
*   **Example:** Brokerage API keys are stored in plain text in a configuration file accessible to unauthorized users.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized trading activity, financial losses, account compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store brokerage credentials securely using encryption mechanisms (e.g., using a secrets management service like HashiCorp Vault or cloud provider secrets managers).
    *   Avoid storing credentials directly in code or configuration files.
    *   Implement strong access controls to the credential storage.
    *   Regularly rotate brokerage API keys.
    *   Utilize multi-factor authentication where supported by the brokerage.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Lean Itself](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_lean_itself.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities may exist within the Lean engine's codebase.
*   **How Lean Contributes:**  As a software application, Lean is susceptible to software vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in Lean's data processing logic could be exploited to gain remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the severity of the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Stay up-to-date with the latest Lean releases and apply security patches promptly.
    *   Monitor Lean's security advisories and vulnerability disclosures.
    *   Consider contributing to Lean's security by reporting identified vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) if Lean exposes any web interfaces.
