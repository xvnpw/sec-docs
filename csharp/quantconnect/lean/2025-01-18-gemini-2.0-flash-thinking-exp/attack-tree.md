## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Algorithm Execution Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_algorithm_execution_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in how Lean executes user-defined algorithms. If successful, attackers can gain arbitrary code execution within the Lean environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code into Algorithm](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_algorithm.md)

*   This attack vector involves inserting malicious code directly into the algorithm definition. This can be achieved through various means, leading to significant control over the application's behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Unsanitized User Input in Algorithm Definition](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_unsanitized_user_input_in_algorithm_definition.md)

*   This critical node highlights the danger of not properly sanitizing user input used to define algorithms. If input validation is lacking, attackers can inject malicious code snippets that will be executed by Lean. This directly leads to arbitrary code execution and potential system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Indicators/Modules](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_custom_indicatorsmodules.md)

*   If the application uses custom indicators or modules within Lean, vulnerabilities in this code can be exploited. This is especially concerning if these components utilize third-party libraries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Utilize Known Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries](./attack_tree_paths/utilize_known_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_libraries.md)

*   This critical node emphasizes the risk of using third-party libraries with known security flaws. Attackers can leverage these publicly disclosed vulnerabilities to compromise the application if the libraries are not kept up-to-date.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Language-Specific Vulnerabilities (e.g., Python)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_language-specific_vulnerabilities__e_g___python_.md)

*   Lean is built using Python, and vulnerabilities within the Python language itself or its commonly used libraries can be exploited to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Utilize Known Security Flaws in Python Libraries Used by Lean](./attack_tree_paths/utilize_known_security_flaws_in_python_libraries_used_by_lean.md)

*   This critical node highlights the risk of using outdated or vulnerable Python libraries that Lean depends on. Attackers can exploit these known flaws to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in how Lean handles sensitive data, potentially leading to unauthorized access or manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Data within Lean's Environment](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_data_within_lean's_environment.md)

*   Attackers aim to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored or processed by Lean, such as API keys, trading strategies, or user information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Storage of API Keys or Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_storage_of_api_keys_or_credentials.md)

*   This critical node highlights the risk of storing API keys or other sensitive credentials insecurely (e.g., in plain text in configuration files or environment variables). This makes it easy for attackers to retrieve these credentials and compromise connected services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Brokerage Integration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_brokerage_integration_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in how Lean integrates with brokerage APIs, potentially leading to unauthorized trading or financial loss.

## Attack Tree Path: [Hijack Brokerage API Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/hijack_brokerage_api_credentials.md)

*   This critical node highlights the severe risk of attackers gaining control of the brokerage API credentials used by Lean. This allows them to perform unauthorized trading activities, potentially leading to significant financial losses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Brokerage API Client Library](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_brokerage_api_client_library.md)

*   If the library used to interact with the brokerage API has vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit these flaws to manipulate trading activities or gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Utilize Known Security Flaws in the Specific Brokerage Integration](./attack_tree_paths/utilize_known_security_flaws_in_the_specific_brokerage_integration.md)

*   This critical node emphasizes the risk of using outdated or vulnerable brokerage API client libraries. Attackers can exploit known flaws in these libraries to compromise the integration and potentially manipulate trades.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in Lean's configuration, allowing attackers to modify settings and potentially weaken security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Lean Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/modify_lean_configuration_files.md)

*   This critical node highlights the risk of attackers gaining write access to Lean's configuration files. This allows them to inject malicious parameters, disable security features, or modify API endpoints, leading to further compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit External Library Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_external_library_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in the external libraries that Lean depends on.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify and Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Lean's Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/identify_and_exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_lean's_dependencies.md)

*   This critical node emphasizes the importance of managing Lean's dependencies. Attackers can exploit publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in outdated or unpatched libraries to gain arbitrary code execution or other forms of access.
