    *   Data is typically provided through APIs or data streams in various formats.
*   **Data Ingestion:** The process of retrieving, processing, and validating market data from external data feed providers.
    *   Involves tasks like parsing data formats (e.g., JSON, CSV), cleaning inconsistencies, and normalizing data for consistent use within LEAN.
    *   May incorporate caching mechanisms to improve data access performance and reduce API calls.
*   **Data Storage (Historical & Real-time):**  Persistent storage mechanisms for both historical market data used for backtesting and real-time data used for live trading.
    *   Historical data storage often involves databases optimized for time-series data.
    *   Real-time data storage might utilize in-memory databases or message queues for low-latency access.
    *   Examples include SQL databases like PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension, NoSQL databases like InfluxDB, or cloud storage services like AWS S3.

    *   Maintains a simulated portfolio and tracks its performance over the backtesting period.
*   **Simulation Environment:**  The isolated environment within the backtesting engine where trading simulations are executed, ensuring that backtesting does not impact live trading operations.
*   **Performance Metrics & Reporting:**  Generates comprehensive reports and calculates key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate the effectiveness of backtested algorithms.
    *   Includes metrics such as Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, profit and loss (P&L), win rate, and average trade duration.

*   **Risk Management:**  Implements predefined rules and checks to mitigate potential financial risks associated with live trading.
    *   Includes features like setting maximum position sizes, implementing stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, and defining daily or overall risk limits.
*   **Execution Handler:**  The component that interfaces directly with the Brokerage API Adapters to transmit order instructions and receive execution confirmations.
*   **Brokerage API Adapters:**  Specialized modules that translate LEAN's internal order representation into the specific API format required by each supported brokerage platform.
    *   Handles authentication and authorization with the brokerage.
    *   Manages communication protocols and data formats specific to each brokerage API.

*   **Account Management:**  Manages and tracks information related to the connected trading account, including account balances, open positions, and transaction history.
*   **Cloud Storage (e.g., S3, Azure Blob):**  Optional cloud-based storage solutions for storing large datasets, backtesting results, algorithm code repositories, and other persistent data.
*   **Cloud Compute (e.g., EC2, Azure VMs):**  Optional cloud-based compute resources that can be used to run backtesting simulations, deploy live trading instances, and scale computational power as needed.
*   **Cloud APIs:**  Application Programming Interfaces provided by cloud platforms to access and manage cloud services like storage, compute, and other functionalities.

## 7. Security Considerations (Initial)

This section provides an initial overview of security considerations relevant to the LEAN engine. A more detailed threat model will be developed based on this design document to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Securely verifying the identity of users and controlling their access to the LEAN engine, sensitive data, and connected brokerage accounts. This includes strong password policies, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control.
*   **Data Security:** Protecting sensitive financial data, including market data, algorithm code (intellectual property), and trading account credentials, both while in transit (using encryption protocols like TLS/SSL) and at rest (using encryption at the storage level).
*   **API Security:** Securing the interfaces between LEAN and external systems, such as market data providers and brokerage platforms. This involves secure API key management, request validation, and protection against common API attacks (e.g., injection attacks, rate limiting).
*   **Code Security:** Ensuring the integrity and security of the LEAN codebase itself and user-developed algorithms. This includes regular code reviews, static and dynamic code analysis, and secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities like code injection or logic flaws.
*   **Infrastructure Security:** Protecting the underlying infrastructure where LEAN is deployed from unauthorized access and malicious activities. This involves implementing security best practices for server hardening, network security (firewalls, intrusion detection), and regular security patching.
*   **Brokerage Account Security:**  Protecting the credentials and access to connected brokerage accounts, as compromise could lead to significant financial loss. This includes secure storage of API keys and OAuth tokens, and adherence to brokerage security recommendations.
*   **Data Feed Integrity:** Ensuring the reliability and integrity of market data received from external providers, as manipulated or inaccurate data can lead to incorrect trading decisions. This may involve data validation and anomaly detection mechanisms.

## 8. Technologies Used

*   **Programming Languages:** C#, Python
*   **Data Storage:**  Various options depending on deployment needs and scale, including:
    *   Relational Databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)
    *   Time-Series Databases (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB)
    *   Cloud Storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage)
*   **Communication Protocols:** HTTPS for secure communication with external services and APIs, potentially WebSockets for real-time data streams.
*   **Cloud Platforms (Optional):** Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## 9. Deployment Model

LEAN offers flexibility in its deployment options:

*   **Local Deployment:** Running the LEAN engine directly on a user's personal computer or server. This provides full control over the environment but requires managing infrastructure and dependencies. Suitable for development and testing.
*   **Cloud Deployment:** Deploying LEAN on cloud infrastructure using services like virtual machines (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure VMs), containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes), or serverless functions. This offers scalability, reliability, and reduced operational overhead.
*   **Hybrid Deployment:** Combining local and cloud resources, for example, running backtesting on cloud infrastructure while managing live trading from a local environment for lower latency.
