# Threat Model Analysis for quantconnect/lean

## Threat: [Malicious Algorithm Code Injection](./threats/malicious_algorithm_code_injection.md)

* **Threat:** Malicious Algorithm Code Injection
    * **Description:** An attacker uploads or provides a crafted algorithm containing malicious code. This code could attempt to break out of the Lean sandbox, execute arbitrary commands on the server, access sensitive data beyond the algorithm's intended scope, or interfere with other running algorithms.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application server, data breaches (including access to other users' algorithms or sensitive application data), denial of service affecting the entire platform, potential financial losses due to manipulated trading activity.
    * **Affected Lean Component:** `AlgorithmManager`, Lean Execution Environment (Sandbox), potentially the underlying operating system if the sandbox is breached.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement and rigorously enforce a strong sandbox environment for algorithm execution within Lean.
        * Utilize code analysis tools (static and dynamic) to scan user-provided algorithms for suspicious patterns before execution.
        * Implement strict resource limits (CPU, memory, network) for each algorithm execution.
        * Employ a principle of least privilege for the Lean execution environment, limiting its access to system resources.
        * Consider code review processes for submitted algorithms, especially for critical deployments.
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization for any parameters passed to the Lean engine.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Algorithm](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_algorithm.md)

* **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion via Algorithm
    * **Description:** An attacker submits a deliberately inefficient or malicious algorithm designed to consume excessive system resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth). This can lead to a denial of service, making the application or the Lean engine unresponsive for legitimate users.
    * **Impact:** Application downtime, performance degradation, inability to execute other algorithms, potential financial losses due to missed trading opportunities.
    * **Affected Lean Component:** `AlgorithmManager`, Lean Execution Environment (Resource Management), potentially the underlying operating system.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement and enforce resource quotas and limits within Lean for algorithm execution (e.g., CPU time limits, memory limits, network bandwidth limits).
        * Implement monitoring and alerting for resource consumption by individual algorithms.
        * Provide mechanisms to terminate runaway or excessively resource-intensive algorithms.
        * Implement fair queuing or prioritization mechanisms for algorithm execution.

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration via Algorithm](./threats/data_exfiltration_via_algorithm.md)

* **Threat:** Data Exfiltration via Algorithm
    * **Description:** A malicious algorithm attempts to access and exfiltrate sensitive data that it should not have access to. This could include API keys managed within Lean, other users' algorithm code stored within Lean's environment, or internal application secrets accessible through Lean's interfaces. The exfiltration could occur through network requests initiated by the algorithm, logging, or other covert channels.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential financial losses, reputational damage.
    * **Affected Lean Component:** `DataSubscriptionManager`, logging mechanisms within Lean, potentially any component that handles sensitive data within the Lean environment.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict data access controls within Lean, ensuring algorithms can only access data they are explicitly authorized for.
        * Sanitize and validate data before it is made available to algorithms.
        * Implement network egress filtering to restrict outbound connections from the Lean execution environment.
        * Monitor algorithm network activity for suspicious patterns.
        * Securely store and manage sensitive data within Lean's environment, using encryption and access controls.
        * Implement logging and auditing of data access attempts within algorithms.

## Threat: [Insecure Lean Configuration](./threats/insecure_lean_configuration.md)

* **Threat:** Insecure Lean Configuration
    * **Description:**  The Lean engine itself might be misconfigured with weak authentication, default credentials, or insecure network settings. An attacker could exploit these misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access to the Lean engine's management interface or API, allowing them to manipulate algorithms, access data, or disrupt operations.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Lean functionalities, manipulation of trading strategies, data breaches, denial of service.
    * **Affected Lean Component:** Lean's API endpoints, configuration files, authentication modules.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong authentication and authorization for Lean's API and management interfaces, enforcing the principle of least privilege.
        * Avoid using default credentials and enforce strong password policies.
        * Secure network configurations for the Lean engine, limiting access to authorized networks and services.
        * Regularly review and audit Lean's configuration settings for security vulnerabilities.
        * Follow Lean's security best practices documentation for deployment and configuration.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Lean Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_lean_dependencies.md)

* **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Lean Dependencies
    * **Description:** Lean relies on various third-party libraries and dependencies. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit them to compromise the Lean engine or the application. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in serialization libraries, networking libraries, or other components within Lean's dependency tree.
    * **Impact:**  Similar to malicious algorithm injection, potentially leading to system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.
    * **Affected Lean Component:** Various modules depending on the vulnerable dependency within the Lean engine. This could include core Lean libraries or external NuGet packages used by Lean.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Lean and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
        * Implement vulnerability scanning for Lean's dependencies to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
        * Monitor security advisories for Lean and its dependencies.
        * Consider using dependency management tools that provide vulnerability scanning and alerting.

## Threat: [Undisclosed Lean Engine Vulnerabilities](./threats/undisclosed_lean_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Threat:** Undisclosed Lean Engine Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:**  Vulnerabilities may exist within the Lean engine itself that are not yet publicly known or patched. An attacker who discovers such a vulnerability could exploit it to compromise the application.
    * **Impact:**  Unpredictable, potentially leading to complete compromise depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    * **Affected Lean Component:** Any part of the Lean engine.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Stay up-to-date with Lean releases and security patches.
        * Monitor Lean's security advisories and community discussions for reported vulnerabilities.
        * Consider contributing to Lean's security through bug reports or security audits.
        * Implement defense-in-depth strategies to mitigate the impact of potential zero-day vulnerabilities.
        * Regularly review Lean's source code if possible for potential security flaws.
