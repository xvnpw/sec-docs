# Attack Surface Analysis for signalr/signalr

## Attack Surface: [Hub Method Exposure](./attack_surfaces/hub_method_exposure.md)

**Description:**  Unintentionally making Hub methods accessible to unauthorized users or clients.

**How SignalR Contributes:** SignalR allows defining methods on Hub classes that can be invoked by connected clients. If not properly secured, any connected client can potentially call these methods.

**Example:** A `TransferFunds` Hub method is exposed without proper authorization checks. A malicious user could connect and call this method to transfer funds from other users' accounts.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities, data manipulation, privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms within Hub methods using SignalR's built-in features or custom logic.
* Follow the principle of least privilege, only exposing necessary Hub methods.
* Use attributes like `[Authorize]` to restrict access to specific roles or authenticated users.
* Carefully review and document the intended access control for each Hub method.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Input Validation in Hub Methods](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_input_validation_in_hub_methods.md)

**Description:** Hub methods accepting and processing client input without proper validation.

**How SignalR Contributes:** SignalR facilitates the exchange of data between clients and the server through Hub method parameters. If this data is not validated, it can be exploited.

**Example:** A `SendMessage` Hub method accepts a message string without sanitization. A malicious user sends a message containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, which is then broadcast to other clients, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.

**Impact:** Server-side errors, application crashes, data corruption, injection vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, command injection if the input is used in system calls), denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement thorough input validation and sanitization within all Hub methods that accept client input.
* Use allow-lists for expected input formats rather than block-lists for malicious patterns.
* Encode output data appropriately to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
* Consider using data transfer objects (DTOs) with validation attributes for complex inputs.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Missing Authentication for SignalR Connections](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_missing_authentication_for_signalr_connections.md)

**Description:**  SignalR connections established without proper authentication, allowing anonymous or unauthorized access.

**How SignalR Contributes:** SignalR requires explicit configuration for authentication. If not implemented correctly, connections can be established without verifying the user's identity.

**Example:** A chat application allows anyone to connect to the SignalR Hub without logging in. Malicious users can join and send inappropriate messages or disrupt the service.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to application features, impersonation of legitimate users, data breaches, spam or abuse.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement authentication middleware to verify user identities before establishing SignalR connections.
* Use authentication providers like JWT or cookies to securely identify users.
* Ensure that the authentication context is properly propagated to the SignalR Hub.
* Avoid relying solely on client-side authentication, as it can be easily bypassed.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Bypass in Hub Methods](./attack_surfaces/authorization_bypass_in_hub_methods.md)

**Description:**  Authorization checks within Hub methods are flawed or insufficient, allowing unauthorized users to perform actions they shouldn't.

**How SignalR Contributes:** While SignalR provides mechanisms for authorization, incorrect implementation can lead to bypasses.

**Example:** A `DeleteUser` Hub method checks if the caller's role is "Admin" but fails to account for role inheritance or alternative administrative privileges. A user with a different administrative role could exploit this to delete users.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized data modification or deletion, security policy violations.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust and well-tested authorization logic within Hub methods.
* Use role-based or claim-based authorization mechanisms.
* Avoid relying on simple string comparisons for role checks.
* Regularly review and audit authorization rules.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Server-Sent Messages](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_server-sent_messages.md)

**Description:**  The server sending malicious scripts within SignalR messages that are executed in the client's browser.

**How SignalR Contributes:** SignalR facilitates real-time communication, and if server-sent data is not properly encoded, it can lead to XSS.

**Example:** A chat application broadcasts user messages without encoding. A malicious user sends a message containing `<script>stealCookies()</script>`, which is then executed in other users' browsers.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always encode server-sent data before sending it to clients, especially user-generated content.
* Use context-aware output encoding based on where the data will be displayed.
* Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate XSS risks.
