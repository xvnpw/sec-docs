## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Server-Side Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_server-side_vulnerability.md)

*   **Exploit Server-Side Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]:**  The attacker aims to leverage weaknesses in the server-side code or the SignalR implementation itself. This is a high-risk path because successful exploitation can lead to significant compromise.
    *   **Target Hub Invocation [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker focuses on manipulating the execution of server-side hub methods.
        *   **Hub Method Parameter Injection [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attackers send crafted messages with malicious data in the parameters of hub method calls. If the server-side code doesn't properly sanitize or validate these inputs, it can lead to:
            *   Command Injection: Injecting commands that the server executes.
            *   SQL Injection: Injecting SQL queries if hub methods interact with databases.
            *   Logic Flaws: Triggering unexpected behavior or errors in the application logic.
    *   **Target Connection Management:** The attacker focuses on manipulating the lifecycle and identity of SignalR connections.
        *   **Connection Hijacking [CRITICAL NODE]:** An attacker gains control of an existing legitimate SignalR connection. This could be achieved through:
            *   Session Fixation: Forcing a user to use a known session ID.
            *   Stealing Connection Tokens: Obtaining the unique identifier for a connection.
        *   **Connection Impersonation [CRITICAL NODE]:** An attacker establishes a new SignalR connection claiming to be another user. This often relies on weaknesses in the authentication process.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Connection Flooding [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** An attacker opens a large number of SignalR connections, consuming server resources and potentially making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:** Known security flaws in the SignalR library itself or its underlying dependencies can be exploited if the application uses a vulnerable version.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Denial of Service (DoS) via Connection Flooding](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_denial_of_service__dos__via_connection_flooding.md)

*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Connection Flooding [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** An attacker opens a large number of SignalR connections, consuming server resources and potentially making the application unavailable to legitimate users. This is high-risk due to the ease of execution and significant impact on availability.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (if HTTPS is not enforced or improperly configured)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks__if_https_is_not_enforced_or_improperly_configured_.md)

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (if HTTPS is not enforced or improperly configured) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** If HTTPS is not enforced or is improperly configured, attackers can intercept and manipulate SignalR messages in transit between the client and the server. This allows them to:
    *   Eavesdrop on communication: Steal sensitive information being exchanged.
    *   Inject malicious messages: Send crafted messages to the server or client.
    *   Modify existing messages: Alter the content of messages in transit.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Configuration Issues](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_configuration_issues.md)

*   **Exploit Configuration Issues [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker targets misconfigurations in the SignalR setup or the application's use of SignalR.
    *   **Insecure Authentication/Authorization Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]:** Weak or missing authentication and authorization mechanisms for hub methods allow unauthorized access and manipulation. This can manifest as:
        *   Lack of proper verification of the user's identity.
        *   Insufficient checks to ensure the authenticated user has permission to invoke specific methods.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Inject Malicious Scripts via Messages](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_inject_malicious_scripts_via_messages.md)

*   **Inject Malicious Scripts via Messages [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attackers send messages containing JavaScript code that is executed by the client's browser. This is a form of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking: Stealing user session cookies.
    *   Data theft: Accessing sensitive information displayed on the client-side.
    *   Malicious actions: Performing actions on behalf of the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via SignalR](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_signalr.md)

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via SignalR [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attackers inject malicious scripts that are broadcasted to other connected clients through SignalR. This can occur if the server doesn't properly sanitize messages before broadcasting them, allowing malicious scripts to be persisted and delivered to other users, leading to widespread client compromise.
