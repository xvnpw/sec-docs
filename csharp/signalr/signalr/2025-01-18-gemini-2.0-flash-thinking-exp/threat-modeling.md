# Threat Model Analysis for signalr/signalr

## Threat: [Unauthorized Hub Method Invocation](./threats/unauthorized_hub_method_invocation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft malicious client-side code to call server-side hub methods that they are not intended to access. This could involve guessing method names or manipulating client-side logic to bypass intended restrictions.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data modification, access to sensitive information, triggering unintended server-side actions, potential for escalation of privilege if the invoked method has elevated permissions.

**Affected Component:** Hubs, Hub Dispatcher

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust authorization checks within each hub method to verify the caller's identity and permissions.
* Avoid relying solely on client-side logic to restrict access to hub methods.
* Use attribute-based authorization (e.g., `[Authorize]`) provided by SignalR.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when designing hub method access.

## Threat: [Hub Method Parameter Injection](./threats/hub_method_parameter_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate the arguments passed to server-side hub methods. If these arguments are not properly validated and sanitized on the server, it could lead to vulnerabilities like command injection, data corruption, or other unintended consequences.

**Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized data access, potential for remote code execution if the injected parameters are used in a vulnerable way on the server.

**Affected Component:** Hubs, Hub Methods

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all parameters received by hub methods.
* Use parameterized queries or ORM frameworks to prevent SQL injection if database interaction is involved.
* Avoid directly executing commands based on user-provided input.
* Use allow lists for expected input values where possible.

## Threat: [Message Tampering in Transit](./threats/message_tampering_in_transit.md)

**Description:** While SignalR often uses secure transports like WebSockets over TLS, if a less secure transport is negotiated or TLS is improperly configured, an attacker could intercept and modify messages being exchanged between clients and the server.

**Impact:** Data corruption, manipulation of application state, delivery of false information, potential for impersonation if message content is used for authentication.

**Affected Component:** Connections, Transports

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Enforce the use of secure transports (WebSockets over TLS) and disable fallback to less secure options if possible.**
* Ensure proper TLS configuration on the server.
* Consider end-to-end encryption of sensitive message content if transport security is a concern.

## Threat: [Connection Hijacking](./threats/connection_hijacking.md)

**Description:** An attacker could attempt to hijack an existing SignalR connection, potentially by stealing the connection ID or other session identifiers. This would allow them to impersonate the legitimate client and perform actions on their behalf.

**Impact:** Unauthorized actions, access to sensitive information, potential for data manipulation or deletion in the context of the hijacked user.

**Affected Component:** Connections, Connection Management

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use strong, unpredictable connection IDs.
* Implement mechanisms to detect and invalidate suspicious connection activity.
* Tie connection identity to authenticated user sessions.
* Regularly regenerate connection IDs or implement session timeouts.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Connection Flooding](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_connection_flooding.md)

**Description:** An attacker could attempt to overwhelm the server by establishing a large number of SignalR connections, exhausting server resources (memory, CPU, network bandwidth) and preventing legitimate clients from connecting or using the application.

**Impact:** Service unavailability, performance degradation for legitimate users.

**Affected Component:** Connections, Connection Management

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement connection limits per client IP address or authenticated user.
* Use rate limiting to restrict the number of connection requests from a single source.
* Implement proper resource management and scaling strategies on the server.
* Consider using a reverse proxy or load balancer with DoS protection capabilities.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Message Flooding](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_message_flooding.md)

**Description:** An attacker could send a large volume of messages to the server or to specific groups, overwhelming server resources and potentially impacting the performance of other clients or even crashing the server.

**Impact:** Service degradation, potential server crash, impact on other connected clients.

**Affected Component:** Hubs, Message Handling

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement message rate limiting per connection or user.
* Implement message size limits.
* Implement server-side logic to detect and drop suspicious message patterns.
* Consider using message queues or backpressure mechanisms to handle bursts of messages.
