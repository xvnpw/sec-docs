# Attack Surface Analysis for signalr/signalr

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated Input in Hub Methods](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_input_in_hub_methods.md)

*   **Description:** Hub methods receive data from clients. If this data isn't properly validated and sanitized on the server, it can lead to various injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **How SignalR Contributes:** SignalR's core functionality involves clients invoking server-side methods (Hub methods) with parameters. This direct interaction creates an entry point for potentially malicious input.
    *   **Example:** A chat application's `SendMessage` Hub method directly uses user input in a database query without sanitization, leading to SQL injection.
    *   **Impact:** Code injection, SQL injection, command injection, logic errors, data corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the server-side for all Hub method parameters.
        *   Use parameterized queries or ORM frameworks to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Avoid using client input directly in system commands or dynamic code execution.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Authorization Checks in Hub Methods](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_authorization_checks_in_hub_methods.md)

*   **Description:** Hub methods that perform sensitive actions or access sensitive data are accessible to unauthorized clients.
    *   **How SignalR Contributes:** SignalR allows clients to directly invoke server-side methods. Without proper authorization, any connected client can potentially call any Hub method.
    *   **Example:** A `DeleteUser` Hub method can be called by any authenticated user, allowing them to delete other users' accounts.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data modification, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement authorization checks within Hub methods to verify if the calling user has the necessary permissions.
        *   Utilize SignalR's built-in authorization features or integrate with existing authentication/authorization systems.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access to Hub methods.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Message Content](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_message_content.md)

*   **Description:** Messages broadcasted or sent through SignalR are displayed to other users without proper encoding, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts.
    *   **How SignalR Contributes:** SignalR's real-time communication often involves displaying user-generated content. If this content isn't sanitized, it becomes a vector for XSS.
    *   **Example:** A chat message containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` is sent through SignalR and executed in other users' browsers.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, information theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement proper output encoding and sanitization on the client-side before displaying any data received through SignalR.
        *   Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Connection Hijacking](./attack_surfaces/connection_hijacking.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts and takes control of a legitimate user's SignalR connection.
    *   **How SignalR Contributes:**  If the connection is not properly secured (e.g., using HTTPS), attackers on the network can potentially intercept the communication and hijack the session.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on a shared Wi-Fi network intercepts a SignalR connection and sends malicious messages as the legitimate user.
    *   **Impact:** Impersonation, unauthorized actions, data manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS for SignalR connections to encrypt communication and prevent eavesdropping.
        *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms for SignalR connections.
