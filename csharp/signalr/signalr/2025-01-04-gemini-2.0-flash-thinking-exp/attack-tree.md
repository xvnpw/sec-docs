## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Hub Method Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_hub_method_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vectors:**  This path focuses on directly attacking the server-side logic exposed through SignalR Hub methods. Attackers aim to exploit weaknesses in how these methods handle input, process data, or enforce authorization.
**Why High-Risk:** Successful exploitation can lead to significant consequences, including unauthorized data access, modification, or even remote code execution on the server. The direct interaction with server-side code makes these vulnerabilities particularly dangerous.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Authentication Weaknesses (leading to SignalR compromise)](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_authentication_weaknesses__leading_to_signalr_compromise_.md)

**Attack Vectors:** This path involves compromising the application's overall authentication mechanism. Once authenticated (even with a legitimate user's credentials or by bypassing authentication), the attacker can then interact with the SignalR Hub, potentially performing actions they are not authorized for within the SignalR context.
**Why High-Risk:** While not a direct SignalR vulnerability, a compromised authentication system provides a wide gateway to abuse application features, including SignalR. The impact is high because it allows attackers to act as legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Payloads via SignalR Messages](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_payloads_via_signalr_messages.md)

**Attack Vectors:** This path focuses on injecting malicious content into messages transmitted via SignalR. This can manifest as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, targeting client-side vulnerabilities, or, in less common scenarios, command injection attempts targeting the server if message content is improperly handled.
**Why High-Risk:** XSS attacks can lead to session hijacking, data theft, and other client-side compromises. Command injection, though less likely in typical SignalR usage, represents a critical server-side vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration or Deployment Issues](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_or_deployment_issues.md)

**Attack Vectors:** This path targets weaknesses arising from misconfigurations or the use of vulnerable components. This includes weak authentication/authorization settings for SignalR, lax CORS policies, or the presence of known vulnerabilities in the SignalR library itself or its dependencies.
**Why High-Risk:** These issues are often easy to identify and exploit, requiring less sophisticated techniques. They can have a broad impact, potentially bypassing security measures designed into the application code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Parameter Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/parameter_manipulation.md)

**Attack Vector:** Sending crafted or malicious data as parameters to SignalR Hub methods to trigger unintended behavior, such as buffer overflows, SQL injection (if parameters are used in database queries), or logic errors.
**Why Critical:** Successful manipulation can directly lead to code execution or data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Logic Flaws in Hub Methods](./attack_tree_paths/logic_flaws_in_hub_methods.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the server-side code within SignalR Hub methods. This could involve flaws in business logic, insecure data handling, or missing security checks.
**Why Critical:** These flaws can allow attackers to bypass intended functionality, gain unauthorized access, or execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unauthorized Method Invocation](./attack_tree_paths/unauthorized_method_invocation.md)

**Attack Vector:** Calling SignalR Hub methods without proper authorization checks in place. This allows attackers to execute actions they should not have permission to perform.
**Why Critical:**  Circumventing authorization can lead to direct data manipulation, privilege escalation, or other unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Messages](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_messages.md)

**Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into SignalR messages that is then executed in the browsers of other connected clients.
**Why Critical:** XSS can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, and other client-side compromises.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via Messages](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_messages.md)

**Attack Vector:** Injecting operating system commands into SignalR messages that are then executed by the server (this is highly dependent on how the server processes message content).
**Why Critical:** Successful command injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unintentional Data Exposure](./attack_tree_paths/unintentional_data_exposure.md)

**Attack Vector:** Server-side code inadvertently sending sensitive information (e.g., personal data, internal system details) through SignalR messages to unauthorized clients.
**Why Critical:** This directly leads to a breach of confidentiality and can have significant legal and reputational consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak Authentication/Authorization Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/weak_authenticationauthorization_configuration.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Improperly configured authentication or authorization mechanisms for SignalR Hubs, allowing unauthorized clients to connect or invoke methods.
**Why Critical:**  A fundamental security control failure that can grant broad access to attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Vulnerable SignalR Version](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vulnerable_signalr_version.md)

**Attack Vector:** Using an outdated version of the SignalR library that contains known security vulnerabilities.
**Why Critical:**  Known vulnerabilities often have readily available exploits, making it easy for attackers to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Vulnerable Transitive Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vulnerable_transitive_dependencies.md)

**Attack Vector:** Vulnerabilities present in libraries that SignalR depends on, which can be exploited indirectly through SignalR.
**Why Critical:** These vulnerabilities can be less obvious but can still provide pathways for attackers to compromise the application.
