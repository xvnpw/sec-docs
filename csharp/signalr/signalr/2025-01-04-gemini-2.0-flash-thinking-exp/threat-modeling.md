# Threat Model Analysis for signalr/signalr

## Threat: [Unauthorized Hub Method Invocation](./threats/unauthorized_hub_method_invocation.md)

**Description:** Attackers can craft malicious requests to directly call hub methods they are not intended to access. This bypasses intended access controls defined within the SignalR hub.

**Impact:** Data breaches, modification of sensitive data managed by the hub, execution of unauthorized actions within the SignalR application logic, privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** Hub method invocation mechanism within the SignalR library, authorization attributes and handlers provided by SignalR.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement server-side authorization checks within each hub method using SignalR's authorization features.
* Utilize SignalR's built-in `Authorize` attribute or create custom authorization handlers that inherit from `HubAuthorizeAttribute`.
* Avoid relying solely on client-side checks or assumptions about user roles.

## Threat: [Bypassing Connection Authentication](./threats/bypassing_connection_authentication.md)

**Description:** Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in the SignalR connection establishment process or authentication mechanisms to connect to the hub without proper authentication.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to real-time data streams managed by the hub, potential for unauthorized message sending, and the possibility of launching further attacks.

**Affected Component:** SignalR's connection handshake process, authentication middleware integration with SignalR.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce authentication on the SignalR endpoint using ASP.NET Core Authentication middleware configured for SignalR.
* Verify user identity and claims during the `OnConnectedAsync` event within the hub.
* Ensure that the authentication context is properly passed and validated within the SignalR pipeline.

## Threat: [Session Hijacking on Persistent Connections](./threats/session_hijacking_on_persistent_connections.md)

**Description:** Attackers could intercept or steal a legitimate user's session information used by SignalR, allowing them to impersonate the user and interact with the hub as that user. This directly impacts the security of SignalR's persistent connection management.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the SignalR application, ability to send and receive messages as the victim, potential for data manipulation or exfiltration within the real-time context.

**Affected Component:** SignalR's connection management, the underlying transport's session handling (e.g., WebSocket session), integration with ASP.NET Core session management.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce HTTPS for all SignalR communication to encrypt session data in transit, protecting it from interception.
* Use secure session management practices provided by ASP.NET Core, including `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags for cookies.
* Consider implementing mechanisms for short-lived connection tokens and regular re-authentication within the SignalR context.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Message Flooding](./threats/denial_of_service_through_message_flooding.md)

**Description:** Attackers can overwhelm the SignalR server by sending a large volume of messages to the hub, exploiting the real-time nature of SignalR to consume server resources.

**Impact:** Application downtime, degraded performance for legitimate users interacting through SignalR, potential server instability.

**Affected Component:** SignalR's message processing pipeline, connection management within SignalR.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting on incoming messages per connection within the SignalR hub or using middleware.
* Monitor connection activity for suspicious patterns and implement mechanisms to disconnect or block abusive connections.
* Configure maximum message sizes within SignalR to prevent excessively large messages from consuming resources.
* Consider using backpressure mechanisms or message queues to manage message processing load.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If the SignalR application uses custom message serialization or deserialization, attackers could craft malicious payloads that, when deserialized by SignalR's infrastructure, execute arbitrary code on the server. This is a direct vulnerability related to how SignalR handles message data.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the server hosting the SignalR application, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Affected Component:** SignalR's message serialization/deserialization mechanisms, any custom serialization logic used within the SignalR application.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use secure and well-vetted serialization libraries for custom message formats.
* Avoid deserializing untrusted data without thorough validation and sanitization within the SignalR hub.
* Keep serialization libraries updated to patch known vulnerabilities that could be exploited through SignalR's message handling.
