## High and Critical SignalR Threats

This table outlines high and critical threats that directly involve the SignalR library.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & How) | Impact | Affected SignalR Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Client Impersonation via Connection ID Reuse/Prediction** | An attacker attempts to reuse or predict a valid SignalR connection ID to impersonate a legitimate client. This could involve intercepting connection IDs or exploiting predictable generation patterns. | Unauthorized actions performed as the impersonated user, access to sensitive information intended for that user, disruption of the legitimate user's session. | `Hub`, `Connection`, `IHubContext` | High | **Implement robust authentication and authorization:** Verify user identity before establishing a SignalR connection and for each hub method invocation. **Use secure and unpredictable connection ID generation:** SignalR generally handles this, but ensure no custom logic weakens it. **Consider short-lived connection tokens:**  Implement a mechanism to periodically refresh or invalidate connection tokens. |
| **Hub Method Spoofing/Unauthorized Invocation** | An attacker directly calls hub methods without proper authorization, bypassing UI or other application logic. This could be done by crafting malicious requests or exploiting vulnerabilities in client-side logic. | Unauthorized actions, data manipulation, potential security breaches, bypassing business logic constraints. | `Hub`, `Hub Methods`, `IHubContext` | High | **Implement server-side authorization for hub methods:** Use the `Authorize` attribute or custom authorization logic to restrict access to specific methods based on user roles or permissions. **Avoid relying solely on client-side checks:** Client-side logic can be easily bypassed. **Validate all input parameters in hub methods:** Treat all data received from clients as potentially malicious. |
| **Message Tampering (Man-in-the-Middle)** | An attacker intercepts and modifies messages in transit between the client and server. This is possible if HTTPS is not enforced or if vulnerabilities exist in custom message handling. | Data corruption, manipulation of application state, injection of malicious commands or data. | `Transport` (WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, Long Polling), `Hub` | High | **Enforce HTTPS:** Ensure all SignalR traffic is over HTTPS to encrypt communication. **Validate and sanitize all incoming messages:** Treat all data received from clients as potentially malicious. **Consider message signing or encryption:** For highly sensitive data, implement additional layers of security by signing or encrypting messages before sending. |
| **Denial of Service (DoS) via Connection Flooding** | An attacker establishes a large number of connections to the SignalR server, overwhelming its resources and making it unavailable to legitimate users. | Service unavailability, performance degradation, resource exhaustion on the server. | `Connection`, `Hub`, `Transport` | High | **Implement connection limits:** Restrict the number of concurrent connections from a single IP address or user. **Use rate limiting:** Limit the frequency of connection requests. **Leverage SignalR's built-in connection management features:** Understand and utilize features like connection timeouts and automatic reconnection handling. **Consider using a reverse proxy or load balancer with DoS protection.** |
| **Denial of Service (DoS) via Hub Method Abuse** | An attacker repeatedly calls resource-intensive hub methods, potentially overloading the server and causing performance degradation or service unavailability. | Service degradation, resource exhaustion on the server, potential application crashes. | `Hub`, `Hub Methods` | High | **Implement rate limiting for hub method calls:** Limit the number of times a specific hub method can be called within a certain timeframe. **Optimize hub method performance:** Ensure hub methods are efficient and avoid unnecessary resource consumption. **Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent resource-intensive operations based on malicious input.** |
| **Elevation of Privilege through Insecure Hub Method Implementation** | Vulnerabilities in the logic of hub methods allow an attacker to perform actions they are not authorized to do. This could involve missing authorization checks or logic flaws. | Unauthorized access to data or functionality, potential security breaches, data manipulation. | `Hub`, `Hub Methods` | Critical | **Follow secure coding practices when implementing hub methods:** Thoroughly validate inputs, avoid common vulnerabilities like SQL injection or command injection. **Implement robust authorization checks within hub methods:** Verify user permissions before performing sensitive actions. **Perform regular code reviews and security testing:** Identify and address potential vulnerabilities in hub method implementations. |
| **Bypassing Authorization Checks due to Incorrect Implementation** | Authorization checks are implemented incorrectly or are easily bypassed, allowing unauthorized users to access restricted hub methods or data. | Unauthorized access to data or functionality, potential security breaches. | `Hub`, `Authorize` attribute, Custom Authorization Logic | High | **Ensure authorization checks are enforced consistently and correctly:** Don't rely on implicit authorization or easily bypassed checks. **Test authorization logic thoroughly:** Verify that only authorized users can access specific resources and functionalities. **Use established authorization patterns and frameworks.** |
| **Dependency Vulnerabilities in SignalR or its Dependencies** | Outdated or vulnerable versions of SignalR or its dependencies contain known security flaws that attackers can exploit. | Potential for various attacks depending on the specific vulnerability, including remote code execution, information disclosure, and denial of service. | SignalR Library, NuGet Packages | Critical | **Keep SignalR and its dependencies up-to-date:** Regularly update to the latest stable versions to patch known vulnerabilities. **Monitor security advisories:** Stay informed about potential security issues affecting SignalR and its dependencies. **Use dependency scanning tools to identify and manage vulnerabilities.** |
