# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for signalr/signalr

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Encoding (Server-Side within SignalR Hubs)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_encoding__server-side_within_signalr_hubs_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Strongly-Typed Hub Methods:** Define Hub methods with specific data types (e.g., `int`, `string`, `MyCustomClass`) instead of `object` or `dynamic`.
    2.  **Data Annotations (on SignalR Models):** Use data annotations (e.g., `[Required]`, `[StringLength]`) on properties of classes used as parameters in Hub methods.
    3.  **Custom Validation (within Hub Methods):** Implement custom validation logic *inside* your Hub methods *before* processing data.
    4.  **Output Encoding (within Hub Methods):** *Always* encode data sent *from* the Hub *to* clients using `System.Net.WebUtility.HtmlEncode` (or other appropriate encoding).
    5.  **Reject Invalid Input (within Hub Methods):** Throw a `HubException` if validation fails.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):**  Directly mitigates XSS within SignalR communication.
    *   **Data Tampering (Severity: Medium):** Prevents modified data from being processed within the Hub.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):**  Can limit oversized payloads sent to the Hub.
    *   **Indirectly mitigates:** SQL Injection, Command Injection (if SignalR data is *immediately* used in these contexts, which is bad practice).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:**  High impact within the SignalR context.
    *   **Data Tampering:** High impact within the SignalR context.
    *   **DoS:** Medium impact (limits payload size).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Data models and annotations are used in `ChatHub.cs`.
    *   Output encoding is in `ChatHub.cs`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive custom validation is limited in `ChatHub.cs`.
    *   Missing in other Hub methods.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Authorization and Authentication (Hub Level - using SignalR Attributes)](./mitigation_strategies/authorization_and_authentication__hub_level_-_using_signalr_attributes_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`[Authorize]` Attribute (on Hubs):** Apply the `[Authorize]` attribute to the Hub class or individual Hub methods.
    2.  **Role-Based Authorization (within `[Authorize]`):** Use `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]` for role-based restrictions.
    3.  **Access `Context.User` (within Hub Methods):** Use `Context.User` to get information about the authenticated user within Hub methods.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: High):** Prevents unauthenticated/unauthorized Hub method invocation.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: High):**  Limits access to data sent through the Hub.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** Prevents unauthorized actions via Hub methods.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Eliminates unauthorized Hub method calls.
    *   **Information Disclosure/Privilege Escalation:** High impact by enforcing authorization.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `[Authorize]` is used on `SecureHub.cs`.
    *   Role-based authorization is used in `SecureHub.cs`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing on `ChatHub.cs`.
    *   More granular policies could be used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in SignalR (Hub Connection Handling)](./mitigation_strategies/preventing_cross-site_request_forgery__csrf__in_signalr__hub_connection_handling_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Origin Validation (in `OnConnectedAsync`):**  *Strictly* validate the `Origin` header in the Hub's `OnConnectedAsync` method using `Context.GetHttpContext().Request.Headers["Origin"]`. Compare against a whitelist.
    2.  **Custom Anti-Forgery Tokens (Sent via SignalR):**
        *   Include a server-generated token in the initial page.
        *   Send the token as a query parameter or header *when establishing the SignalR connection*.
        *   Validate the token in the Hub's `OnConnectedAsync` method.
        *   `Context.Abort()` if validation fails.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Severity: Medium):** Prevents malicious sites from initiating SignalR connections.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **CSRF:** Significantly reduces risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Origin validation is in `HubBase.cs`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Full custom anti-forgery token mechanism is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting and Throttling (Custom Logic within Hubs)](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_and_throttling__custom_logic_within_hubs_.md)

    3.  **Hub Method Invocation Throttling (within Hub Methods):** Limit specific Hub method calls per client/IP/user (custom logic, using a cache).
    4.  **Reject/Delay (within Hub Methods/`OnConnectedAsync`):**  `Context.Abort()` or throw `HubException` if limits are exceeded.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium to High):** Prevents resource exhaustion.
