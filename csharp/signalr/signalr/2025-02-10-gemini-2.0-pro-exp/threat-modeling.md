# Threat Model Analysis for signalr/signalr

## Threat: [Unauthorized Client Connection and Impersonation](./threats/unauthorized_client_connection_and_impersonation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker connects to the SignalR Hub without proper authentication or impersonates a legitimate user by manipulating connection IDs or other identifying information.  The attacker might try to obtain a valid connection ID by sniffing network traffic (if HTTPS is not enforced), examining client-side code, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the authentication process. They could then send messages *as* the impersonated user.
*   **Impact:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to real-time data and functionality. They could send malicious messages, receive sensitive information, or perform actions on behalf of the impersonated user, potentially leading to significant data breaches or system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** `Hub` (connection management), `IHubContext` (if used for sending messages to specific connections), Authentication mechanisms *integrated with* SignalR.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Authentication:** Enforce strong authentication *before* any SignalR connection is established. Use ASP.NET Core authentication (JWT, cookies, etc.) and integrate with SignalR via the `[Authorize]` attribute on Hubs and methods.
    *   **Connection ID as Opaque Handle:** Treat the connection ID as an opaque handle, *not* a security token. Do not rely on it for authorization. Associate authenticated user identities with connections server-side.
    *   **Secure Connection ID Handling:** Avoid exposing connection IDs unnecessarily. If exposed, ensure they are not easily guessable.
    *   **User-Specific Groups:** Use SignalR's Groups feature. Add authenticated users to specific groups. Send messages only to authorized groups.

## Threat: [Message Tampering and Injection (Specifically within SignalR's Message Handling)](./threats/message_tampering_and_injection__specifically_within_signalr's_message_handling_.md)

*   **Description:**  Even with HTTPS, an attacker with client-side access (e.g., through a compromised browser extension or a pre-existing XSS vulnerability that allows script execution) could modify SignalR messages *before* they are sent by the client or *after* they are received. The attacker might inject malicious script code (XSS), alter data values, or forge commands *specifically targeting SignalR Hub methods*. This bypasses transport-layer security.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, execution of malicious code on the server or *other connected clients* (real-time XSS propagation), unauthorized actions, and potential system compromise. The real-time nature of SignalR exacerbates the impact of XSS.
*   **Affected Component:** `Hub` methods (message handling), Message serialization/deserialization logic *within SignalR*, Client-side SignalR message handling code.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict HTTPS Enforcement:**  Ensure HTTPS is *always* used.
    *   **Server-Side Input Validation:** Rigorous server-side validation of *all* data received from clients *within Hub methods*. Check data types, lengths, formats, and allowed values. Do *not* trust client-provided data.
    *   **Output Encoding:** Encode any user-provided data displayed to other users to prevent XSS. Use appropriate encoding techniques. This is crucial in the real-time context of SignalR.
    *   **Message Signing (Advanced):** For high-security, consider digitally signing messages.
    *   **Use Strong Types:** Avoid `dynamic` in Hub methods. Use strongly-typed objects.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Overbroadcasting (SignalR-Specific Misuse)](./threats/information_disclosure_via_overbroadcasting__signalr-specific_misuse_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to sensitive information by receiving SignalR messages broadcast to a wider audience than intended. This occurs due to *incorrect use of SignalR's broadcasting features*, such as sending sensitive data to `Clients.All` or to overly broad groups. The attacker might be a legitimate user who shouldn't have access to the data.
*   **Impact:** Leakage of confidential data, privacy violations, potential for further attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** `Hub` methods (broadcasting logic), `Clients.All`, `Clients.Group`, `IHubContext` (if used for broadcasting).  This is *specifically* about the misuse of these SignalR components.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Strictly control group memberships. Only add users to groups that *require* the data.
    *   **Targeted Messaging:** Prefer `Clients.User(userId)`, `Clients.Client(connectionId)`, or narrowly scoped `Clients.Group`. Avoid `Clients.All` unless the data is non-sensitive.
    *   **Data Minimization:** Send only the *minimum* necessary data.
    *   **Review Return Types:** Ensure Hub methods don't return more data than intended.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Connection Flooding (Targeting SignalR)](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_connection_flooding__targeting_signalr_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker overwhelms the server by establishing a large number of *SignalR connections*, exhausting server resources. This is a DoS attack *specifically targeting the SignalR connection handling*.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability to legitimate users.
*   **Affected Component:** `Hub` (connection management), Server infrastructure (as it relates to SignalR connection limits).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Connection Limits:** Configure limits on concurrent connections, globally and per client IP. Use ASP.NET Core's settings.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor server resources and set up alerts.
    *   **Reverse Proxy/Load Balancer:** Use a reverse proxy or load balancer to handle connections and distribute load.
    *   **Client Disconnect Handling:** Ensure resources for disconnected clients are released promptly.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Hub Method Invocation (Elevation of Privilege within SignalR)](./threats/unauthorized_hub_method_invocation__elevation_of_privilege_within_signalr_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker invokes *SignalR Hub methods* they shouldn't have access to, performing unauthorized actions or accessing restricted data. This results from missing or incorrect *SignalR-specific authorization checks*.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions, data breaches, potential system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** `Hub` methods, `[Authorize]` attribute *as applied to Hubs and Hub methods*, Authorization policies *used with SignalR*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **`Authorize` Attribute:** Use `[Authorize]` on Hubs and individual Hub methods to restrict access.
    *   **Custom Authorization Policies:** Define and apply custom authorization policies for complex requirements.
    *   **Server-Side Validation (Always):** Validate *all* input parameters to Hub methods server-side.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Method Invocation:** Prefer strongly-typed Hubs. If dynamic invocation is necessary, meticulously validate the method name.
