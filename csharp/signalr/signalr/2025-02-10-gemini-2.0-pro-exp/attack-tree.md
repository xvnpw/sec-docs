## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Server-Side Code Execution via Hub Method Injection](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_server-side_code_execution_via_hub_method_injection.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This path represents the most direct route to server-side code execution, a highly critical outcome. The attacker leverages weaknesses in how the SignalR application handles user input to inject malicious code into hub method parameters.

*   **[!!! 3. Code Execution/Manipulation !!!]:**
    *   **Description:** The overarching goal of achieving code execution, either on the server or client. This is the highest impact category.
    *   **Why Critical:** Successful code execution grants the attacker significant control over the compromised system.

*   **[!!! 3.1 Hub Method Injection !!!]:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker manipulates the parameters passed to SignalR hub methods to influence the server's execution flow.
    *   **Why Critical:** This is the direct mechanism for achieving server-side code execution within the SignalR context.

*   **[!!! 3.1.1 Unvalidated Input !!!]:**
    *   **Description:** The hub method does not properly validate or sanitize the data received from clients. This allows the attacker to inject arbitrary code (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, etc.) disguised as a parameter value.
    *   **Why Critical:** This is the most common and fundamental vulnerability leading to code injection.  It's the root cause of many successful attacks.
    *   **Example:** A hub method `SendMessage(string message)` that directly uses the `message` parameter in a database query without sanitization is vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement strict input validation using whitelists, regular expressions, and type checking.  Never trust user-supplied data.

*   **[3.1.2 Weak Authorization]:**
    *   **Description:**  The application does not properly enforce authorization, allowing an attacker to call hub methods they should not have access to.  This can exacerbate the impact of unvalidated input.
    *   **Example:** An administrative hub method is exposed to regular users due to a misconfiguration.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust role-based access control (RBAC) and ensure that all hub methods have appropriate authorization checks.

*   **[3.1.3 Overly Permissive CORS]:**
    *   **Description:**  Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is misconfigured, allowing requests from untrusted origins.  This allows an attacker to potentially invoke hub methods from a malicious website.
    *   **Example:**  The CORS policy allows requests from `*` (all origins).
    *   **Mitigation:**  Configure CORS to allow only specific, trusted origins.  Avoid wildcard origins.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Client-Side Script Injection (XSS) via SignalR](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_client-side_script_injection__xss__via_signalr.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This path focuses on compromising connected clients by injecting malicious JavaScript code through SignalR. The attacker leverages the real-time communication to distribute the attack to multiple users.

*   **[!!! 3. Code Execution/Manipulation !!!]:** (Same as above)

    *   **[!!! 3.2 Client-Side Script Injection !!!]:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other connected clients.
        *   **Why Critical:** This allows the attacker to compromise multiple clients simultaneously, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting users, or defacing the application.

    *   **[!!! 3.2.1 XSS via Hub !!!]:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker sends a message containing malicious JavaScript through a SignalR hub method.
        *   **Why Critical:** This is the delivery mechanism for the XSS payload within the SignalR context.

    *   **[!!! 3.2.2 Unescaped Output !!!]:**
        *   **Description:** The server or client-side code does not properly escape or encode data received from SignalR before displaying it in the user interface. This allows the injected script to be executed.
        *   **Why Critical:** This is the fundamental vulnerability that enables XSS.  Without proper output encoding, any injected script will be executed by the browser.
        *   **Example:** A chat application that displays messages without HTML-encoding them. An attacker can send a message like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, which will be executed by other clients.
        *   **Mitigation:** Use a context-aware output encoding library (e.g., one that understands HTML, JavaScript, and CSS) to escape all data before rendering it in the browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Information Disclosure via Unencrypted Transport](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_information_disclosure_via_unencrypted_transport.md)

* **Overall Description:** This path focuses on the attacker's ability to intercept and read sensitive data transmitted over SignalR due to a lack of encryption.

    * **[2. Information Disclosure/Data Exfiltration]:**
        * **Description:** The attacker gains access to sensitive information.

    * **[2.1 Eavesdropping]:**
        * **Description:** The attacker intercepts SignalR messages in transit.

    * **[!!!2.1.1 Unencrypted Transport!!!]:**
        * **Description:** SignalR communication is not protected by HTTPS, allowing an attacker to passively sniff network traffic and read all transmitted data.
        * **Why Critical:** This is a fundamental security flaw that exposes *all* data transmitted over SignalR. It's a prerequisite for many other attacks.
        * **Example:** The SignalR connection URL uses `http://` instead of `https://`.
        * **Mitigation:** *Always* use HTTPS for SignalR connections. Enforce HTTPS at the server level and ensure that clients are configured to use HTTPS. Use strong cipher suites and keep TLS/SSL certificates up-to-date.
