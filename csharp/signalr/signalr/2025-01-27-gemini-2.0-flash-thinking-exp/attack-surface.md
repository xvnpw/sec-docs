# Attack Surface Analysis for signalr/signalr

## Attack Surface: [Injection Vulnerabilities in Hub Methods](./attack_surfaces/injection_vulnerabilities_in_hub_methods.md)

*   **Description:** Hub methods that process user input without proper sanitization and validation are susceptible to injection attacks. Attackers can inject malicious code or commands through user-provided data passed to Hub methods.
*   **SignalR Contribution:** SignalR's core functionality allows clients to directly invoke server-side methods (Hub methods) with parameters. This direct client-to-server method invocation, if not secured with input validation, directly introduces the injection attack surface.
*   **Example:** A chat application hub method `SendMessage(string message)` directly constructs and executes a database query using the `message` content without sanitization. An attacker sends a message like `"; DROP TABLE Users; --` which gets incorporated into the SQL query, leading to SQL injection and potential data loss.
*   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the server, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all user inputs received by hub methods *within the Hub method logic*. Use whitelisting and regular expressions to ensure data conforms to expected formats and constraints *before processing the input in the method*.
    *   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:** When interacting with databases *from within Hub methods*, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with minimal necessary privileges to limit the impact of successful injection attacks *originating from Hub method exploits*.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Message Content](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_message_content.md)

*   **Description:** If messages broadcasted via SignalR are rendered on client-side applications without proper output encoding, attackers can inject malicious scripts into messages. These scripts execute in other users' browsers when they receive and display the message *received via SignalR*.
*   **SignalR Contribution:** SignalR's primary function is real-time message broadcasting. The vulnerability arises because SignalR facilitates the delivery of user-generated content to clients. If the application *receiving SignalR messages* doesn't handle message rendering securely, it becomes vulnerable to XSS.
*   **Example:** In a chat application, an attacker sends a message containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` through SignalR. If the client-side application *receiving this SignalR message* directly renders it in the chat window without encoding, the JavaScript code will execute in every user's browser who receives the message, potentially stealing cookies or redirecting users to malicious sites.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, account takeover, website defacement, redirection to malicious sites, information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Output Encoding:**  Always encode user-generated content *received via SignalR* before displaying it in the browser. Use appropriate encoding techniques like HTML encoding to neutralize potentially harmful characters *in the client-side rendering logic*.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS attacks *originating from SignalR messages*.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Connection Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_connection_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers flood the SignalR server with numerous connection requests, overwhelming server resources and preventing legitimate users from connecting or experiencing degraded performance *specifically targeting the SignalR endpoint*.
*   **SignalR Contribution:** SignalR's connection model, designed for persistent, real-time communication, inherently manages a pool of connections. This connection management aspect, if not properly configured with limits and resource controls, can be directly exploited to launch DoS attacks against the SignalR service.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses a botnet to send thousands of connection requests *directly to the SignalR endpoint*. The server becomes overloaded trying to handle these connections *managed by SignalR*, leading to slow response times or complete unavailability for legitimate users trying to access the application's real-time features.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption, financial loss, reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Medium** (While potentially High impact, DoS is often considered High-Medium depending on the specific context and resilience measures).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Connection Limits:** Configure connection limits *within SignalR server settings* to restrict the maximum number of concurrent connections from a single IP address or in total.
    *   **Request Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting *at the SignalR endpoint level* to throttle the number of connection requests from a specific source within a given time frame.
    *   **Resource Monitoring and Scaling:** Monitor server resource utilization (CPU, memory, network) *related to SignalR processes* and implement auto-scaling to handle traffic spikes and DoS attempts *targeting SignalR*.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to detect and block malicious traffic patterns and DoS attacks *aimed at the SignalR endpoint*.
    *   **Implement Connection Throttling/Backpressure:**  Implement mechanisms *within SignalR configuration or application logic* to handle connection requests gracefully under heavy load, potentially queuing or rejecting new connections when resources are strained.

## Attack Surface: [Missing or Weak Authentication and Authorization](./attack_surfaces/missing_or_weak_authentication_and_authorization.md)

*   **Description:** Lack of proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for SignalR connections and hub method invocations allows unauthorized users to access and manipulate application functionalities *exposed through SignalR*.
*   **SignalR Contribution:** SignalR itself is a communication framework and does not inherently enforce authentication or authorization. The responsibility for securing access lies entirely with the developer integrating SignalR.  Failing to implement these security measures *for SignalR connections and Hub method calls* directly creates a critical vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A real-time dashboard application uses SignalR to push sensitive data updates to clients. If authentication is not implemented *for SignalR connections*, anyone who knows the SignalR endpoint can connect and receive this sensitive data without logging in. Similarly, if authorization is missing *in Hub methods*, any connected user might be able to invoke administrative hub methods.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, data breaches, data manipulation, privilege escalation, unauthorized actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Authentication:** Integrate a robust authentication mechanism (e.g., token-based authentication like JWT, session-based authentication) to verify user identities *before allowing SignalR connections*. This should be enforced *at the SignalR connection level*.
    *   **Implement Authorization:** Enforce authorization checks *within Hub methods* to ensure that only authorized users can invoke specific methods and access certain data. Use role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) as appropriate *within the Hub method logic*.
    *   **Secure Connection Handshake:** Secure the SignalR connection handshake process to prevent unauthorized connection attempts *at the SignalR level*.
