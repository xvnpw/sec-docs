# Threat Model Analysis for signalr/signalr

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Hub Access](./threats/unauthenticated_hub_access.md)

Description: An attacker bypasses authentication mechanisms and directly connects to a SignalR hub. They can then invoke hub methods without proper authorization, potentially reading sensitive data, triggering actions, or disrupting the application's functionality. This is achieved by crafting requests that mimic legitimate SignalR connection attempts but lack valid authentication credentials.
Impact: Unauthorized access to application features, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, and potential compromise of the application's integrity.
Affected SignalR Component: Hubs, Connection Handlers, Authentication Middleware
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement Authentication: Use robust authentication mechanisms like JWT, Cookies, or OAuth 2.0 to secure SignalR connections.
    * Require Authentication for Hubs: Configure SignalR hubs to require authenticated users using authorization attributes or policies.
    * Regularly Review Authentication Logic: Ensure authentication logic is correctly implemented and up-to-date with security best practices.

## Threat: [Inadequate Hub Method Authorization](./threats/inadequate_hub_method_authorization.md)

Description: Even with authentication, an attacker, after gaining access as a legitimate user (or through account compromise), can invoke hub methods they are not authorized to use. This happens when hub methods lack proper authorization checks based on user roles or permissions. The attacker exploits missing or insufficient authorization logic within the hub method implementation.
Impact: Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities, data manipulation, and potential business logic bypass.
Affected SignalR Component: Hub Methods, Authorization Logic within Hubs
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement Authorization Checks in Hub Methods: Within each hub method, explicitly check user roles, permissions, or claims before executing sensitive operations.
    * Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Define roles and assign permissions to roles. Check user roles within hub methods to control access.
    * Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC): Implement more granular authorization based on user attributes, resource attributes, and environmental conditions if needed.
    * Principle of Least Privilege: Grant users only the necessary permissions required for their tasks.

## Threat: [Message Interception (Man-in-the-Middle - MITM)](./threats/message_interception__man-in-the-middle_-_mitm_.md)

Description: An attacker intercepts network traffic between the client and the SignalR server. If HTTPS is not enforced, communication is unencrypted, allowing the attacker to read and potentially modify messages exchanged in real-time. This can be done by network sniffing or ARP poisoning techniques.
Impact: Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data transmitted via SignalR messages, potential data manipulation if messages are altered in transit.
Affected SignalR Component: Transport Layer (WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, Long Polling), Network Communication
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Enforce HTTPS: **Mandatory use of HTTPS for all SignalR connections.** Configure both server and client to only use secure protocols (wss:// for WebSockets, https:// for Server-Sent Events and Long Polling).
    * Implement HSTS: Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) on the server to force browsers to always use HTTPS for the application, preventing downgrade attacks.
    * Educate Users: Advise users to use secure networks and avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive operations.

## Threat: [XSS via Real-time Messages](./threats/xss_via_real-time_messages.md)

Description: An attacker injects malicious scripts into messages sent through SignalR. If the client-side application does not properly sanitize these messages before displaying them in the UI, the injected script will execute in the user's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the application. The attacker can send malicious messages directly through a compromised client or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the server-side logic that generates messages.
Impact: Client-side compromise, session hijacking, data theft, website defacement, malware distribution.
Affected SignalR Component: Client-side JavaScript, Message Handling on Client, UI Rendering
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Output Encoding/Sanitization on Client-Side: **Crucially sanitize all data received via SignalR before rendering it in the UI.** Use appropriate encoding techniques (e.g., HTML encoding) to prevent script execution.
    * Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement and configure CSP headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, reducing the impact of XSS attacks.
    * Regular Security Audits: Regularly audit client-side code and message handling logic for potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Connection Exhaustion DoS](./threats/connection_exhaustion_dos.md)

Description: An attacker floods the SignalR server with a large number of connection requests, exceeding the server's capacity to handle new connections. This exhausts server resources like memory, CPU, and connection limits, preventing legitimate users from connecting or causing performance degradation. Attackers can use botnets or simple scripts to initiate numerous connection attempts.
Impact: Denial of service, application unavailability for legitimate users, performance degradation, potential server crashes.
Affected SignalR Component: SignalR Server, Connection Management, Transport Layer
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Connection Limits: Configure connection limits on the SignalR server to restrict the maximum number of concurrent connections.
    * Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on connection requests to prevent rapid bursts of connection attempts from a single source.
    * Resource Monitoring: Monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory, connections) to detect and respond to potential DoS attacks.
    * Load Balancing and Scaling: Use load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple SignalR server instances and scale infrastructure to handle increased connection loads.
    * Implement Connection Throttling: Introduce mechanisms to slow down or reject excessive connection attempts from specific IP addresses or clients.

## Threat: [Hub Method Parameter Injection](./threats/hub_method_parameter_injection.md)

Description: An attacker crafts malicious input for hub method parameters. If these parameters are not properly validated and sanitized on the server-side, the attacker can inject code or commands that are then executed by the server. This can lead to data manipulation, logic bypass, or in severe cases, remote code execution. The vulnerability arises from trusting client-provided input without proper validation.
Impact: Data manipulation, unauthorized access, logic bypass, potential remote code execution, server compromise.
Affected SignalR Component: Hub Methods, Parameter Handling, Server-side Logic
Risk Severity: High (can be Critical if RCE is possible)
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Strict Input Validation: **Implement rigorous input validation for all hub method parameters.** Validate data types, formats, ranges, and expected values.
    * Input Sanitization: Sanitize input parameters to remove or escape potentially malicious characters or code.
    * Parameterized Queries/ORM: If hub methods interact with databases, use parameterized queries or ORM features to prevent SQL injection.
    * Principle of Least Privilege: Minimize the privileges of the account under which the SignalR server and hub methods are running.

## Threat: [Logic Flaws in Hub Methods](./threats/logic_flaws_in_hub_methods.md)

Description: Vulnerabilities exist in the business logic implemented within hub methods. These flaws can be exploited by attackers to manipulate application behavior in unintended ways, bypass security controls, or gain unauthorized access to functionalities. This is due to errors or oversights in the design and implementation of the hub method logic.
Impact: Business logic bypass, data manipulation, unauthorized access, application instability, potential financial loss or reputational damage.
Affected SignalR Component: Hub Methods, Business Logic Implementation
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Secure Coding Practices: Apply secure coding principles during hub method development.
    * Thorough Code Reviews: Conduct comprehensive code reviews of hub method logic to identify potential flaws and vulnerabilities.
    * Security Testing: Perform security testing, including penetration testing and fuzzing, to uncover logic flaws.
    * Unit and Integration Tests: Implement unit and integration tests to verify the intended behavior of hub methods and ensure they function as expected under various conditions.
    * Principle of Least Privilege: Design hub methods with the principle of least privilege in mind, minimizing the scope of actions they perform and the data they access.
