# BUSINESS POSTURE

ServiceStack is a web services framework designed to simplify the development of fast, typed, end-to-end web services. It aims to increase developer productivity by providing a cohesive and opinionated framework that handles many common web development tasks out of the box. The primary business priority for adopting ServiceStack is to accelerate the development and deployment of web applications and APIs, potentially reducing development costs and time to market.

Key business goals include:
- Rapid development of web services and applications.
- Improved developer productivity and reduced development effort.
- Creation of performant and scalable web services.
- Simplified maintenance and evolution of web applications.
- Support for various platforms and data formats to ensure broad applicability.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Security vulnerabilities in the framework itself could impact all applications built with it.
- Misconfiguration or misuse of the framework by developers could lead to security weaknesses in applications.
- Dependency on a third-party framework introduces supply chain risks.
- Performance bottlenecks within the framework could negatively impact application performance.
- Compatibility issues with evolving technologies or platforms could require ongoing maintenance and updates.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: HTTPS enforcement for communication security. Implemented at web server level and within application configuration.
- security control: Input validation mechanisms provided by the framework. Described in ServiceStack documentation.
- security control: Authentication and authorization features built into the framework. Described in ServiceStack documentation.
- security control: Cryptography libraries and utilities available within the framework. Described in ServiceStack documentation.
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions and open-source nature for security audits and vulnerability discovery.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline for applications built with ServiceStack.
- security control: Conduct regular security code reviews of ServiceStack applications, focusing on framework-specific security best practices.
- security control: Implement dependency scanning to identify and manage vulnerabilities in ServiceStack framework dependencies.
- security control: Establish a process for timely patching and updating of ServiceStack framework versions to address security vulnerabilities.
- security control: Provide security training for developers on secure coding practices within the ServiceStack framework.

Security requirements:
- Authentication:
    - Requirement: Support for multiple authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0, JWT, session-based authentication).
    - Requirement: Secure storage of credentials and secrets.
    - Requirement: Protection against common authentication attacks (e.g., brute-force, credential stuffing).
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions.
    - Requirement: Fine-grained authorization policies to control access to specific resources and operations.
    - Requirement: Secure enforcement of authorization policies throughout the application.
- Input validation:
    - Requirement: Robust input validation for all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
    - Requirement: Whitelisting approach for input validation where possible.
    - Requirement: Centralized input validation mechanisms within the framework.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Secure handling of sensitive data at rest and in transit using strong encryption algorithms.
    - Requirement: Proper key management practices, including secure key generation, storage, and rotation.
    - Requirement: Use of established and well-vetted cryptography libraries.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- Core application functionality provided by ServiceStack services.
- Data processing and storage within the application.
- Integration with external APIs and systems.
- User authentication and authorization.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- User data: Potentially sensitive depending on the application (e.g., personal information, credentials). Sensitivity level depends on the application's purpose and regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
- Business data: Data processed and stored by the application, sensitivity depends on the nature of the business and data (e.g., financial data, customer orders, intellectual property). Sensitivity level varies widely.
- Application secrets: API keys, database credentials, encryption keys. Highly sensitive, requiring strong protection.
- Logs: Can contain sensitive information if not properly managed. Sensitivity depends on the logged data.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What type of application is being built with ServiceStack? (e.g., public-facing web application, internal API, microservice) - This will influence the risk assessment and security requirements.
- What is the sensitivity of the data being processed and stored by the application? - This will determine the required level of data protection.
- What are the specific compliance requirements for the application? (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) - Compliance requirements will dictate specific security controls.
- What is the organization's risk appetite? - Risk appetite will influence the balance between security controls and business agility.
- Are there any existing security policies or standards within the organization that need to be followed? - Existing policies should be considered when designing security controls.

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is rapid application development and deployment. Security is important but should not significantly hinder development speed.
- SECURITY POSTURE: The project currently has basic security controls in place (HTTPS, input validation, authentication). There is a willingness to improve security posture by implementing recommended controls.
- DESIGN: The application will be deployed in a cloud environment using containers and Kubernetes. The build process is automated using CI/CD pipelines.
