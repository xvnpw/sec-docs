*   **Description:** Attackers can send malicious payloads within request data (JSON, XML, JSV, etc.) to exploit vulnerabilities in ServiceStack's deserialization process or the underlying serializers. This can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) by manipulating object creation or method calls during deserialization, or Denial of Service (DoS) by triggering resource-intensive deserialization.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) - full server control for the attacker.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - application becomes unavailable.
    *   Potential data breaches or corruption.
*   **Affected ServiceStack Component:** Request Binding, Serialization/Deserialization (JsonSerializer, XmlSerializer, JsvSerializer).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep ServiceStack and serializer dependencies updated to patch vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement strong input validation on DTO properties using ServiceStack's validation features.
    *   Use input validation whitelists for allowed values and formats.
    *   Exercise extreme caution when deserializing data from untrusted sources.
    *   Disable XML external entity processing to prevent XXE injection if using XML.

## Threat: [Inadequate DTO Validation](./threats/inadequate_dto_validation.md)

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass due to Misconfigured or Flawed Authorization Attributes](./threats/authorization_bypass_due_to_misconfigured_or_flawed_authorization_attributes.md)

*   **Threat:** Authorization Bypass due to Misconfigured or Flawed Authorization Attributes
*   **Description:** Misconfiguration or incorrect use of ServiceStack's authorization attributes (`[Authenticate]`, `[RequiredRole]`, `[RequiredPermission]`) can lead to authorization bypass. Attackers can exploit these issues to access resources or perform actions they are not authorized for. Logic flaws in custom authorization implementations can also enable unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data and application functionality.
    *   Privilege escalation, allowing attackers to act as administrators or privileged users.
    *   Data breaches and data manipulation.
    *   Compromise of application security and integrity.
*   **Affected ServiceStack Component:** Authorization Attributes, Authorization Feature, Service Logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully apply and test authorization attributes to all relevant services and operations.
    *   Thoroughly test authorization rules to ensure intended enforcement and prevent bypasses.
    *   Review custom authorization logic for flaws and vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement role-based or permission-based authorization for effective access control.
    *   Ensure consistent authorization checks throughout the application.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in ServiceStack Plugins](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_servicestack_plugins.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in ServiceStack Plugins
*   **Description:** ServiceStack plugins, especially from third-party sources, may contain security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application. The impact can range from Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to Remote Code Execution (RCE), depending on the plugin's functionality and the vulnerability type.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Varies depending on the plugin vulnerability (XSS to RCE).
    *   Potential data breaches, DoS, or complete application compromise.
    *   Increased attack surface due to added plugin code.
*   **Affected ServiceStack Component:** Plugin Architecture, Installed Plugins.
