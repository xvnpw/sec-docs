## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit ServiceStack Specific Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_servicestack_specific_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **1.1 Authentication Bypass [CRITICAL]**:
    *   **Description:** An attacker circumvents ServiceStack's authentication mechanisms, gaining unauthorized access as a legitimate user or with elevated privileges.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (if regularly updated and well-configured), Medium (if outdated or custom auth is poorly implemented)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (complete compromise of user accounts)
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (depending on logging and monitoring)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update ServiceStack to the latest version.
        *   Thoroughly review and test custom authentication implementations.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all authentication-related inputs.
        *   Monitor authentication logs for suspicious activity (e.g., brute-force attempts, unusual login patterns).
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
        *   Enforce strong password policies.

*   **1.2 AutoQuery Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]**:
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the AutoQuery feature to inject malicious queries, bypass access controls, or extract sensitive data.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (common feature, potential for misconfiguration or undiscovered vulnerabilities)
    *   **Impact:** High (data breaches, unauthorized data modification)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (if misconfigured), High (if exploiting a zero-day)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (unusual queries might be logged)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully define permissions and restrictions for AutoQuery endpoints using `[Restrict]` attributes.
        *   Validate and sanitize any user-supplied input used in AutoQuery requests.
        *   Consider using explicit DTOs instead of relying solely on AutoQuery for sensitive data.
        *   Monitor AutoQuery usage for unusual patterns (e.g., excessively large result sets, unexpected query parameters).
        *   Implement rate limiting on AutoQuery endpoints.

*   **1.4 Serialization/Deserialization Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]**:
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how ServiceStack handles serialization and deserialization of data, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Denial of Service (DoS).
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (historically a common source of critical vulnerabilities)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE))
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High (requires crafting malicious payloads)
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (often requires deep packet inspection and behavioral analysis)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use the most secure serialization format available (e.g., JSON with strict type checking).
        *   Avoid inherently unsafe formats like .NET's BinaryFormatter.
        *   Implement strict type checking during deserialization.  *Crucially important.*
        *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources.
        *   Regularly update ServiceStack and any serialization libraries used.
        *   Consider using a whitelist approach for allowed types during deserialization.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of RCE.
        *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with rules to detect and block common serialization attack patterns.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Abuse ServiceStack Features/APIs](./attack_tree_paths/2__abuse_servicestack_featuresapis.md)

*   **2.1 Authentication Bypass (Feature Abuse) [CRITICAL]**:
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits misconfigured authentication settings or weak security practices to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (weak passwords, misconfigured CORS are common issues)
    *   **Impact:** High (compromise of user accounts)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (brute-forcing, exploiting weak configurations)
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium (failed login attempts, unusual CORS requests)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity, history).
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
        *   Carefully configure CORS settings to restrict access to authentication endpoints.  *Very important.*
        *   Regularly review authentication configurations.
        *   Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks.
        *   Educate users about phishing and social engineering attacks.

*   **2.2 AutoQuery Abuse**:
    *   **Description:**  An attacker misuses AutoQuery features, even without a direct vulnerability, to access or modify data they shouldn't.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if AutoQuery is enabled without proper restrictions)
    *   **Impact:** High (data breaches, unauthorized data modification)
    *   **Effort:** Low (if misconfigured)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (unusual queries might be logged)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use `[Restrict]` attributes to limit access to AutoQuery endpoints based on roles and permissions.
        *   Avoid exposing sensitive data models directly through AutoQuery without careful consideration.
        *   Implement granular permissions at the data model level.
        *   Regularly audit AutoQuery usage and configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Leverage Misconfigured ServiceStack Features](./attack_tree_paths/3__leverage_misconfigured_servicestack_features.md)

*   **3.1 Authentication Disabled/Misconfigured [CRITICAL]**:
    *   **Description:** Authentication is accidentally disabled or improperly configured, allowing anyone to access protected resources.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (should be caught during testing), Medium (human error)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (complete compromise)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy (no authentication required)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure authentication is enabled and properly configured for all sensitive endpoints.
        *   Regularly review authentication settings as part of code reviews and deployments.
        *   Use automated configuration checks to detect and prevent misconfigurations.
        *   Implement a "deny by default" security policy.

*   **3.3 Debug Mode Enabled in Production [CRITICAL]**:
    *   **Description:** Debug mode is left enabled in a production environment, exposing sensitive information and potentially introducing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (should be caught during deployment), Medium (human error)
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (exposure of sensitive information, potential vulnerabilities)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy (often indicated by verbose error messages or debug output)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable debug mode in production environments.  *Absolutely essential.*
        *   Use appropriate logging levels for production (e.g., "Info" or "Error").
        *   Implement automated checks to ensure debug mode is disabled before deployment.
        *   Regularly review server configurations.
