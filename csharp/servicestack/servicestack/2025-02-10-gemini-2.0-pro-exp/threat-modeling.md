# Threat Model Analysis for servicestack/servicestack

## Threat: [Threat: (Spoofing) Forged JWT Tokens](./threats/threat__spoofing__forged_jwt_tokens.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a JSON Web Token (JWT) with modified claims (e.g., user ID, roles) to impersonate another user or gain elevated privileges. This relies on weaknesses in ServiceStack's JWT handling *if improperly configured*, such as a weak signing secret, an algorithm substitution attack (e.g., changing `HS256` to `none`), or a lack of proper validation of the `iss` (issuer) and `aud` (audience) claims.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, data breaches, impersonation of legitimate users, complete system compromise if administrative privileges are obtained.
*   **Affected Component:** `JwtAuthProvider`, JWT validation logic (potentially within custom `IAuthRepository` implementations if JWTs are handled manually).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use a strong, randomly generated secret key (at least 256 bits for HS256).
    *   Store the secret key *securely* (key management system, environment variables, *never* in source code).
    *   Enforce *strict* JWT validation:
        *   Verify the signature.
        *   Validate `iss`, `aud`, and `exp` claims.
        *   Consider using the `nbf` claim.
    *   Regularly rotate the secret key.
    *   Use a well-vetted JWT library and keep it updated.
    *   Protect private keys (if using asymmetric encryption) with extreme care.

## Threat: [Threat: (Tampering) AutoQuery Parameter Manipulation](./threats/threat__tampering__autoquery_parameter_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the parameters of a ServiceStack *AutoQuery* request to bypass intended restrictions and access or modify data they shouldn't. They might alter filter parameters, skip/take values, or inject unauthorized conditions, directly exploiting the AutoQuery feature.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data modification, data deletion, potential for denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** `AutoQuery` feature, request DTOs, custom query logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strict input validation on AutoQuery request DTOs (Fluent Validation).
    *   Use `[AutoApply]` cautiously, only on safe properties.
    *   Implement authorization checks within the AutoQuery service or using ServiceStack's authorization attributes.
    *   Consider custom AutoQuery implementations for sensitive data.
    *   Limit the maximum number of records returned.

## Threat: [Threat: (Elevation of Privilege) Misconfigured Authorization](./threats/threat__elevation_of_privilege__misconfigured_authorization.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits *misconfigured authorization rules within ServiceStack* (e.g., missing `[RequiredRole]` attributes, incorrect role names, flawed custom authorization logic in `IAuthRepository` or service implementations) to access services or data they should not have access to. This is a direct failure of ServiceStack's authorization mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, data breaches, potential for complete system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** ServiceStack's authorization features (`[RequiredRole]`, `[RequiredPermission]`, `IAuthRepository`, custom authorization logic).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Apply authorization attributes (`[RequiredRole]`, `[RequiredPermission]`) to *all* relevant services and operations.
    *   Use a consistent and well-defined set of roles/permissions.
    *   Thoroughly test authorization rules (unit and integration tests).
    *   Implement a "deny by default" approach.
    *   If using a custom `IAuthRepository`, ensure it *correctly* enforces authorization.
    *   Regularly review and audit authorization configurations.

## Threat: [Threat: (Denial of Service) Unbounded Request Payloads (Specifically within ServiceStack Handlers)](./threats/threat__denial_of_service__unbounded_request_payloads__specifically_within_servicestack_handlers_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends requests with excessively large payloads to *ServiceStack services*, consuming server resources and causing a denial of service. This focuses on the lack of request size limits *within ServiceStack's request handling*.
*   **Impact:** Service unavailability, performance degradation, potential server crashes.
*   **Affected Component:** All ServiceStack services that accept request bodies, especially those handling file uploads or large data structures *without proper limits configured within ServiceStack*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement request size limits for all ServiceStack services, *globally in the `AppHost` configuration* (e.g., `SetConfig(new HostConfig { LimitBodySize = ... });`) or on a per-service basis.
    *   For file uploads, use ServiceStack's features with size limits and validation.
    *   Validate the `Content-Length` header *before* processing within ServiceStack handlers.
    *   Use streaming techniques for large request bodies (within ServiceStack if applicable).

## Threat: [Threat: (Tampering) Unsafe Deserialization (Within ServiceStack)](./threats/threat__tampering__unsafe_deserialization__within_servicestack_.md)

*   **Description:** While less likely with ServiceStack's *default* serializers, if *custom serializers or older, potentially vulnerable versions of ServiceStack are used*, an attacker might inject malicious data during deserialization, leading to remote code execution. This is a direct threat to the serialization/deserialization process *within ServiceStack*.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data corruption, denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** *Custom serializers*, *older versions of ServiceStack*, potentially third-party serialization libraries *used with ServiceStack*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if vulnerable)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   *Prefer ServiceStack's built-in serializers* (JSON, JSV, Protocol Buffers).
    *   If using custom serializers, *thoroughly vet them* for security vulnerabilities.
    *   Avoid unsafe deserialization practices.
    *   If using XML, *disable XXE and DTD processing*.
    *   *Keep ServiceStack and any third-party serialization libraries up-to-date*.
    *   Consider a whitelist of allowed types for deserialization.
