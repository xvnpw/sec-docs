## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strict Authentication with `[Authenticate]`](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strict_authentication_with___authenticate__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Strict Authentication with `[Authenticate]`

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify All Protected Endpoints:**  Conduct a thorough code review to identify *every* ServiceStack service method and route that requires authentication.
        2.  **Apply `[Authenticate]` Attribute:**  Decorate *each* identified endpoint with the ServiceStack `[Authenticate]` attribute. Place this attribute directly above the service method or class declaration.
        3.  **Test Authentication:**  Thoroughly test each endpoint to ensure that unauthenticated requests are rejected with a 401 Unauthorized error, as handled by ServiceStack's authentication mechanisms.
        4.  **Centralized Configuration (Optional):** While explicit attributes are preferred, you *can* configure authentication globally in your `AppHost`'s `Configure` method, but this is less specific than per-service attributes.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Authentication Bypass (Severity: Critical):** Prevents unauthorized access to protected ServiceStack resources. Attackers cannot directly call service methods without valid credentials recognized by ServiceStack's auth providers.
        *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of leaking sensitive data via ServiceStack services to unauthenticated users.
        *   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** Prevents unauthenticated users from performing actions via ServiceStack services that require elevated privileges.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Authentication Bypass:** Risk reduced to near zero for properly decorated ServiceStack endpoints.
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Significantly reduces the risk, assuming data access within services is tied to ServiceStack's authentication.
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** Significantly reduces the risk, as unauthenticated users cannot execute protected ServiceStack operations.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Implemented on `SecureDataService` and `AdminPanelService`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Missing on `ReportService` and `UserProfileService`. These services currently rely on implicit checks, which are not robust within the ServiceStack framework.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with `[RequiredRole]` and `[RequiredPermission]`](./mitigation_strategies/implement_granular_role-based_access_control__rbac__with___requiredrole___and___requiredpermission__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with `[RequiredRole]` and `[RequiredPermission]`

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Define Roles and Permissions:** Create roles and permissions relevant to your application's ServiceStack services.
        2.  **Assign Roles to Users:** Within your chosen ServiceStack authentication provider, assign roles to users.
        3.  **Apply `[RequiredRole]` and `[RequiredPermission]`:** Decorate ServiceStack service methods with ServiceStack's `[RequiredRole]` or `[RequiredPermission]` attributes.
        4.  **Test RBAC:** Thoroughly test each ServiceStack endpoint with users having different roles and permissions.
        5.  **Consider using `HasRole` and `HasPermission` methods:** Inside your ServiceStack service logic, you can use `base.Request.GetSession().HasRole("Admin")` or `base.Request.GetSession().HasPermission("WriteData")` for dynamic checks, but attributes are generally preferred.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** Prevents users from performing actions via ServiceStack services beyond their authorized roles.
        *   **Horizontal Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** Prevents a user with one role from accessing ServiceStack resources associated with a different role.
        *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium):** Limits access to sensitive data exposed through ServiceStack services based on roles.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** Significantly reduces the risk, as users are restricted by ServiceStack's role checks.
        *   **Horizontal Privilege Escalation:** Significantly reduces the risk.
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Reduces the risk, relying on proper role assignments within ServiceStack.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Roles are defined, but `[RequiredRole]` is only used on `AdminService`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** `[RequiredPermission]` is not used. `[RequiredRole]` is missing on other services (e.g., `ReportService`).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Service Exposure with Explicit Registration and Routing](./mitigation_strategies/control_service_exposure_with_explicit_registration_and_routing.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Control Service Exposure with Explicit Registration and Routing

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Explicit Service Registration:** In your `AppHost`'s `Configure` method, *explicitly* register only the ServiceStack services you want to expose using `Routes.Add<MyServiceRequest>("/myservice")`.  Avoid assembly scanning.
        2.  **Define Specific Routes:** Use `Routes.Add` to define specific routes for each ServiceStack service.
        3.  **Use HTTP Verb Constraints:** Specify allowed HTTP verbs (GET, POST, etc.) for each route within the `Routes.Add` call.
        4.  **Use `IVerb` Interfaces:** Implement ServiceStack's `IGet`, `IPost`, `IPut`, `IDelete` interfaces on your request DTOs.
        5.  **Route Constraints:** Use ServiceStack route constraints like `Routes.Add<MyRequest>("/myroute/{Id:int}");`

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unintended Service Exposure (Severity: Medium):** Prevents accidental exposure of internal classes as ServiceStack services.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** By limiting access via ServiceStack's routing, you reduce the attack surface.
        *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Low):** Reduces the risk of leaking information about internal ServiceStack services.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unintended Service Exposure:** Significantly reduces the risk.
        *   **Denial of Service:** Moderately reduces the risk.
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Slightly reduces the risk.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Routes are defined, but some are broad. HTTP verb constraints are used inconsistently.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** `IVerb` interfaces are not used. Route constraints are not used. Assembly scanning is used for service registration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable `JsConfig.AllowRuntimeType`](./mitigation_strategies/disable__jsconfig_allowruntimetype_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Disable `JsConfig.AllowRuntimeType`

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Locate `JsConfig` Settings:** Find where `JsConfig` settings are configured, usually in your `AppHost`'s `Configure` method.
        2.  **Ensure `AllowRuntimeType` is False:** Explicitly set `JsConfig.AllowRuntimeType = false;`.
        3.  **Test Deserialization:** Thoroughly test ServiceStack's serialization/deserialization.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from exploiting ServiceStack's deserialization to execute arbitrary code.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Remote Code Execution:** Eliminates the risk associated with this specific ServiceStack setting.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Yes. Explicitly set to `false` in the `AppHost` configuration.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** None.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement CSRF Protection with `[AutoValidateAntiforgeryToken]`](./mitigation_strategies/implement_csrf_protection_with___autovalidateantiforgerytoken__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement CSRF Protection with `[AutoValidateAntiforgeryToken]`

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Apply `[AutoValidateAntiforgeryToken]`:** Apply the ServiceStack `[AutoValidateAntiforgeryToken]` attribute to your services or globally in your `AppHost`.
        2.  **Include Tokens in Forms (Server-Side Rendering):** If using ServiceStack.Razor, ensure `EnableAutoAntiForgeryToken = true` in your RazorFormat plugin configuration.
        3.  **Include Tokens in API Requests (Client-Side Frameworks):** If using a client-side framework, obtain the token from the `ss-opt` cookie and include it in the `X-Csrf-Token` request header.
        4.  **Test CSRF Protection:** Test that requests without a valid token are rejected by ServiceStack.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Severity: High):** Prevents CSRF attacks against your ServiceStack services.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery:** Significantly reduces the risk.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. `EnableAutoAntiForgeryToken` is enabled for Razor views.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** `[AutoValidateAntiforgeryToken]` is not used on services handling API requests. The client-side framework is not configured to include tokens.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Debug Mode and Metadata Exposure in Production](./mitigation_strategies/disable_debug_mode_and_metadata_exposure_in_production.md)

* **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Debug Mode and Metadata Exposure in Production

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Set `DebugMode = false`:** In your `AppHost`'s `Configure` method, ensure `DebugMode = false;` for production, typically using environment variables.
        2.  **Restrict Metadata Page Access:** Disable or restrict access to ServiceStack's `/metadata` page in production. You can remove the `MetadataFeature` plugin, use ServiceStack's `[Authenticate]` and `[RequiredRole]` on the metadata page itself, or use a reverse proxy to block the route.
        3.  **Customize Error Handling:** Use ServiceStack's `HandleUncaughtException` and `ServiceExceptionHandler` in your `AppHost` to avoid exposing stack traces.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium):** Prevents exposure of sensitive information via ServiceStack's debugging features and metadata page.
        *   **Reconnaissance (Severity: Low):** Makes it harder for attackers to gather information about your ServiceStack application.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Significantly reduces the risk.
        *   **Reconnaissance:** Moderately reduces the risk.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. `DebugMode` is controlled by an environment variable and is `false` in production.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** The metadata page is accessible. Custom error handling is basic.
