# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for elmah/elmah

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Restrict Access to the Elmah Log Interface (Elmah Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/1__restrict_access_to_the_elmah_log_interface__elmah_configuration_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Implement strong authentication and authorization within Elmah's configuration, and optionally use a custom handler path.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Authentication & Authorization (web.config):**  Use the `<location>` tag in `web.config` to wrap the Elmah handler (`elmah.axd` or your custom path).  Within this `<location>` tag, use the `<authorization>` section to:
        *   `allow roles`: Specify the roles (e.g., "Administrators", "SecurityAuditors") that are permitted to access the Elmah interface.  These roles should align with your application's existing authentication system.
        *   `deny users="*"`:  Explicitly deny access to all other users.  This is crucial to prevent unauthorized access.
    2.  **Custom Handler Path (web.config):**  Change the default `elmah.axd` path to something less predictable.  Update the `path` attribute in the `<httpHandlers>` section of `web.config`.  This is a minor security-through-obscurity measure.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Error Logs (Severity: High):**  Attackers could gain access to sensitive information.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: High):**  Error logs can reveal internal application details.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Severity: Medium):**  Attackers might try to guess credentials.
    *   **Automated Scanners (Severity: Medium):**  Scanners look for default paths like `elmah.axd`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:**  Risk significantly reduced (High to Low) with proper authorization.
    *   **Information Disclosure:**  Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:**  Risk reduced (Medium to Low) due to authentication.
    *   **Automated Scanners:**  Risk slightly reduced (Medium to Low-Medium) with a custom path.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Authorization: Partially implemented (missing specific Elmah handler rules).
    *   Custom Handler Path: Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Authorization:  Add the `<location>` tag with `<authorization>` rules to `web.config`, specifically targeting the Elmah handler.
    *   Custom Handler Path:  Modify the `path` attribute in the `<httpHandlers>` section of `web.config`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Filter Sensitive Information (Elmah's ErrorFilter Event)](./mitigation_strategies/2__filter_sensitive_information__elmah's_errorfilter_event_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Implement custom error filtering using Elmah's `ErrorFilter` event to redact or remove sensitive data.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Event Handler (Global.asax.cs or similar):**  Create a method that handles the `ErrorLog_Filtering` event.  This is typically done in `Global.asax.cs` or a similar application initialization location.
    2.  **Access Exception Data:**  Inside the event handler, access the `Exception` object from the `ExceptionFilterEventArgs` ( `args.Exception` ).
    3.  **Redaction Logic:**  Use regular expressions, string manipulation, or other techniques to identify and replace sensitive data within the `Exception.Message`, `Exception.StackTrace`, and other relevant properties.  Redact:
        *   PII (names, addresses, emails, etc.)
        *   Authentication tokens (session IDs, API keys)
        *   Database connection strings
        *   Internal file paths
    4.  **Dismiss and Re-Raise (Recommended):**
        *   `args.Dismiss()`:  Prevent the original exception from being logged.
        *   Create a *new* `Exception` object with the redacted information.
        *   `ErrorSignal.FromCurrentContext().Raise(newException)`:  Log the new, sanitized exception.
    5.  **Thorough Testing:**  Rigorously test your filtering logic to ensure it handles various scenarios and doesn't introduce new issues.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breach (Severity: High):**  Exposure of sensitive data in logs.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Severity: High):**  Logging PII without controls.
    *   **Credential Exposure (Severity: High):**  Logging passwords or API keys.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium):**  Revealing internal details.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
    *   **Compliance Violations:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
    *   **Credential Exposure:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low-Medium).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No custom error filtering is implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A complete implementation of the `ErrorLog_Filtering` event handler is required, including the redaction logic.

## Mitigation Strategy: [3. Configure Elmah for Database Storage (Elmah Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/3__configure_elmah_for_database_storage__elmah_configuration_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Configure Elmah to store logs in a database instead of XML files.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Database Provider (web.config):**  In the `<elmah>` section of `web.config`, specify the appropriate database provider.  For example, for SQL Server, use `Elmah.SqlErrorLog`.
    2.  **Connection String (web.config):**  Provide a `connectionStringName` attribute that points to a connection string defined in your `web.config`'s `<connectionStrings>` section.  This connection string should point to your chosen database.  Ensure the database user associated with this connection string has *minimal* privileges (read/write access to the Elmah log table *only*).
    3.  **Table Creation (Database):**  If the Elmah log tables don't already exist in your database, you'll need to create them.  Elmah usually provides SQL scripts for this purpose (check the Elmah documentation for your chosen database provider).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Log Files (Severity: High):**  Easier to secure a database than file system permissions.
    *   **Data Tampering (Severity: Medium):**  Databases offer better protection against modification.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
    *   **Data Tampering:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Elmah is currently configured to use XML file storage.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Modify the `<elmah>` section in `web.config` to use a database provider (e.g., `Elmah.SqlErrorLog`) and provide the correct `connectionStringName`.
    *   Create the necessary Elmah log tables in the database.

## Mitigation Strategy: [4. Disable Elmah in Production (Elmah Configuration - Conditional)](./mitigation_strategies/4__disable_elmah_in_production__elmah_configuration_-_conditional_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Disable Elmah entirely in the production environment using configuration transforms.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configuration Transform (web.Release.config):**  Use a configuration transform file (typically `web.Release.config` in ASP.NET) to *remove* the entire `<elmah>` section from the `web.config` file when building for the production environment.  This prevents Elmah from being loaded or initialized.
    2.  **Alternative Logging (Consider):**  If you still need *some* level of error logging in production, consider using a different logging library or a secure, centralized logging service *instead* of Elmah.  This allows for more granular control over what is logged and where it's stored.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **All Elmah-related threats (Severity: High to Low):**  Completely eliminates all risks associated with Elmah.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **All Elmah-related threats:** Risk eliminated (reduced to Negligible).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Elmah is enabled in all environments.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Create or modify `web.Release.config` to remove the `<elmah>` section from the configuration during production builds.
