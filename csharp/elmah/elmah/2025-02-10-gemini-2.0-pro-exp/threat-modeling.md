# Threat Model Analysis for elmah/elmah

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_logs.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the ELMAH logs (either through the web interface or directly to the storage) and finds sensitive information that was inadvertently included in exception messages or context. The attacker might exploit a misconfiguration (weak authentication, exposed `elmah.axd`), a vulnerability in the web server, or gain access to the underlying file system or database. ELMAH directly stores this sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, identity theft, financial loss, reputational damage, legal consequences, further targeted attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ErrorLog` implementation (e.g., `XmlFileErrorLog`, `SqlErrorLog`, `SQLiteErrorLog`, etc.), `elmah.axd` (web interface).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Custom Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling *before* exceptions reach ELMAH to filter, redact, or sanitize sensitive data.  Use structured logging to separate sensitive fields.
        *   **ELMAH Filtering:** Use `ErrorFilter` (in `web.config` or programmatically) to prevent specific exceptions or details from being logged.
        *   **Secure `elmah.axd`:**  Restrict access using the `security` section in `web.config`.  Require strong authentication (preferably multi-factor) and disable remote access if not essential.
        *   **Encryption at Rest:** Encrypt the storage used by ELMAH (database or file system).
        *   **Log Rotation and Retention:** Implement a policy to regularly rotate and purge logs, minimizing the window of exposure.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application and ELMAH have only the minimum necessary permissions to the database or file system.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to ELMAH Interface (`elmah.axd`)](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_elmah_interface___elmah_axd__.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to ELMAH Interface (`elmah.axd`)

    *   **Description:** An attacker directly accesses the `elmah.axd` endpoint without proper authentication. This could be due to a misconfiguration (remote access enabled without authentication), a bypassed authentication mechanism, or a vulnerability in the authentication implementation. ELMAH's web interface is the direct target.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of error logs (leading to sensitive data exposure), potential for further attacks based on revealed information.
    *   **Affected Component:** `elmah.axd` (web interface), `ErrorLogModule`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Configuration:**  Use the `security` section in `web.config` to restrict access to `elmah.axd`.  Require strong authentication (e.g., Windows Authentication, custom authentication provider).
        *   **Disable Remote Access:** Set `allowRemoteAccess="false"` in the `security` configuration if remote access is not strictly necessary.
        *   **IP Address Restrictions:**  If remote access is needed, restrict it to specific, trusted IP addresses.
        *   **Alternative Access Methods:** Consider accessing logs through a separate, secured application or tool instead of exposing `elmah.axd`.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Include `elmah.axd` access control in penetration testing and security reviews.

## Threat: [Log Tampering or Deletion](./threats/log_tampering_or_deletion.md)

*   **Threat:** Log Tampering or Deletion

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains write access to the ELMAH log storage (database or file system) and modifies or deletes log entries. This could be to cover their tracks after an attack, disrupt investigations, or cause confusion. The attacker might exploit a vulnerability in the database, file system permissions, or a compromised account. ELMAH's storage mechanism is the direct target.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of audit trail, hindering incident response, potential for undetected malicious activity.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ErrorLog` implementation (e.g., `XmlFileErrorLog`, `SqlErrorLog`, `SQLiteErrorLog`, etc.).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Storage:**  Ensure the database or file system used by ELMAH is properly secured with strong access controls and permissions.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  The application's database user account should have only the minimum necessary privileges (read for viewing, limited write for adding new entries).
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Use FIM tools to detect unauthorized changes to ELMAH log files.
        *   **Database Auditing:** Enable database auditing features to track changes to the ELMAH log tables.
        *   **Regular Backups:**  Maintain regular, secure backups of the ELMAH logs.
