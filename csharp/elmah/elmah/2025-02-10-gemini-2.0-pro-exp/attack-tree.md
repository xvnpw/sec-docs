## Attack Tree Path: [1. Gain Unauthorized Access to ELMAH Data/Functionality [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__gain_unauthorized_access_to_elmah_datafunctionality__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the overarching objective of the attacker.  It represents the successful compromise of ELMAH, allowing the attacker to achieve their specific goals (data exfiltration, manipulation, or disruption).
*   **Why Critical:** This is the root of the entire threat model.  All successful attacks converge here.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Access ELMAH Interface [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2__access_elmah_interface__critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker gains access to the ELMAH web interface (typically `/elmah.axd`). This is usually the first step in exploiting ELMAH.
*   **Why Critical:**  Access to the interface provides a direct path to viewing logged data, and potentially manipulating ELMAH's configuration or data if further vulnerabilities exist.
*    Mitigation:
    *   Strong, unique password.
    *   IP address restrictions.
    *   Multi-factor authentication (if possible).
    *   Disable remote access if not strictly necessary.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Weak Credentials [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_weak_credentials__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker leverages weak or easily guessable passwords to gain access to the ELMAH interface.
*   **Why High Risk:** This is a common and often successful attack vector due to the prevalence of weak or default passwords.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **2.1.1 Default Password:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker tries the default ELMAH password (if one exists and hasn't been changed).
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (High if defaults are unchanged, Very Low if changed)
        *   **Impact:** High (Full access to ELMAH data)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low (Just trying a known password)
        *   **Skill Level:** Very Low (No technical skill needed)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Failed login attempts might be logged, but not always)
        *    Mitigation:
            *   Change the default password immediately upon installation.

    *   **2.1.2 Guess:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker tries common passwords (e.g., "password," "admin," "123456").
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (Unless the password is very weak)
        *   **Impact:** High (Full access to ELMAH data)
        *   **Effort:** Low (Trying common passwords)
        *   **Skill Level:** Very Low (Basic password guessing)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Failed login attempts might be logged)
        *    Mitigation:
            *   Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity).
            *   Implement account lockout after a few failed attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Manipulate ELMAH Data](./attack_tree_paths/3__manipulate_elmah_data.md)

* **Description:** The attacker alters the data stored by ELMAH. This could involve forging new log entries, deleting existing ones, or modifying them.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Use API (if exposed) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_use_api__if_exposed___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker utilizes exposed and unsecured ELMAH API endpoints to manipulate log data (delete or modify).
    *   **Why High Risk:** If the API is exposed without proper authentication and authorization, it provides a direct and easy way for an attacker to tamper with logs.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (If the API is properly secured or disabled) / High (If exposed and unsecured)
    *   **Impact:** High (Loss of audit trail, hiding malicious activity, or creating false information)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Using an API endpoint)
    *   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic API interaction)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (API calls might be logged, but the specific action might not be obvious without detailed auditing)
    *    Mitigation:
        *   Disable ELMAH API endpoints if they are not absolutely necessary.
        *   If API endpoints are required, implement strong authentication and authorization (e.g., API keys, OAuth).
        *   Log all API calls and monitor for suspicious activity.
