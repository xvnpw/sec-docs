# Attack Surface Analysis for elmah/elmah

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Access to Error Logs](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_access_to_error_logs.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain access to the ELMAH error log interface and view sensitive information.
    *   **How ELMAH Contributes:** ELMAH provides a web interface for viewing error logs, which, if not properly secured, becomes a direct entry point for attackers. This is the *core* functionality of ELMAH and thus directly contributes.
    *   **Example:** An attacker navigates to `https://example.com/elmah.axd` and views detailed error logs containing database connection strings, API keys, and user session data.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure of sensitive data (PII, credentials, internal system details).
        *   Potential for further attacks (database compromise, account takeover).
        *   Reputational damage.
        *   Compliance violations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Strong Authentication:** Require strong, unique credentials for accessing the ELMAH interface.  Do *not* rely solely on the application's existing authentication if general users should not have access.
        *   **Implement Authorization:**  Restrict access to specific user roles or groups.  Use the `<authorization>` section in `web.config` (or equivalent in newer frameworks) to define access rules.
        *   **IP Address Whitelisting:** Limit access to the ELMAH interface to a predefined list of trusted IP addresses (e.g., developer machines, internal monitoring servers).
        *   **Change Default Path:**  Rename the default `/elmah.axd` handler to a less predictable path.
        *   **Disable Remote Access (if feasible):** If logs are only needed locally, set `allowRemoteAccess="false"` in the ELMAH configuration.
        *   **Filter Sensitive Data:** Use ELMAH's filtering capabilities (e.g., `ErrorFilter` or custom filters) to prevent sensitive information (passwords, API keys) from being logged in the first place.  This is *crucial*.
        *   **Use a Separate Logging System:** For production, consider a dedicated logging solution (SIEM) and disable or severely restrict ELMAH.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Log Flooding](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_log_flooding.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers intentionally trigger numerous errors to overwhelm ELMAH and potentially crash the application or server.
    *   **How ELMAH Contributes:** ELMAH's logging mechanism is the direct target of this attack.  The attacker leverages ELMAH's core function (logging errors) to cause harm.
    *   **Example:** An attacker repeatedly sends malformed requests to the application, causing exceptions that are logged by ELMAH.  This fills up disk space or consumes excessive memory.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Application unavailability.
        *   Server instability.
        *   Potential data loss (if logs are not properly managed).
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting at the application level (this is a general mitigation, but helps protect ELMAH).
        *   **Error Throttling:** Configure ELMAH (potentially with custom filters) to limit the number of errors logged within a specific timeframe. This is a *direct* ELMAH mitigation.
        *   **Log Rotation and Archiving:** Implement a robust log rotation and archiving strategy to prevent log files from growing uncontrollably.  Automate this process.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) and set up alerts for unusual activity.
        *   **Robust Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate all user input (general mitigation, but reduces the attack surface).

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Known ELMAH Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_known_elmah_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in specific versions of the ELMAH library.
    *   **How ELMAH Contributes:** This is a direct vulnerability *of* ELMAH itself. The attack targets the library's code.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in an outdated version of ELMAH to gain unauthorized access to the error logs.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep ELMAH Updated:** Regularly update ELMAH to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities. Use package managers (like NuGet) to simplify updates.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security mailing lists or follow ELMAH's official channels to stay informed about security updates and vulnerabilities.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan the application and its dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
