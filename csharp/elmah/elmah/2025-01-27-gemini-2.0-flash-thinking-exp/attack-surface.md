# Attack Surface Analysis for elmah/elmah

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured ELMAH Web Interface Access](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_elmah_web_interface_access.md)

*   **Description:**  The `elmah.axd` endpoint, providing a web interface to view error logs, is accessible without authentication and authorization.
*   **ELMAH Contribution:** ELMAH, by default, exposes the `elmah.axd` interface at a well-known URL without enforced security. This direct exposure is the primary contributor to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker accesses `https://vulnerable-website.com/elmah.axd` and gains immediate, unrestricted access to all error logs without any login or security challenge.
*   **Impact:**  **Critical Information Disclosure**.  Attackers gain immediate access to potentially highly sensitive information within error logs, including credentials, internal paths, user data, and application secrets. This can lead to rapid and severe compromise of the application and its data.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Authentication and Authorization:**  Implement robust authentication and authorization *specifically for the `elmah.axd` handler*. This is the most critical mitigation. Use your application's existing security framework or configure dedicated ELMAH security rules. Ensure only authorized administrators can access the interface.
    *   **Restrict Access by IP Address (If applicable):**  In environments with predictable administrator IPs, restrict access to `elmah.axd` based on source IP address in addition to authentication.
    *   **Regularly Audit Access Controls:**  Periodically review and audit the configured authentication and authorization rules for `elmah.axd` to ensure they remain effective and correctly implemented.

## Attack Surface: [High-Severity Information Disclosure via Error Details](./attack_surfaces/high-severity_information_disclosure_via_error_details.md)

*   **Description:** Error logs captured and displayed by ELMAH contain highly sensitive information exposed through stack traces, error messages, and request details, accessible via the unsecured web interface.
*   **ELMAH Contribution:** ELMAH's core function is to log detailed error information, and it displays this information directly through its web interface.  If this interface is unsecured (as in point 1), ELMAH directly facilitates the disclosure of sensitive details it logs.
*   **Example:** An error log displayed in `elmah.axd` reveals database connection strings, API keys embedded in code, or unmasked Personally Identifiable Information (PII) due to overly verbose error messages or logging practices within the application, all accessible to unauthorized viewers via ELMAH.
*   **Impact:** **High Information Disclosure**. Exposure of highly sensitive data like credentials, API keys, or significant amounts of PII. This can lead to direct account compromise, data breaches, and severe compliance violations.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure `elmah.axd` Access (Primary Mitigation):**  As highlighted in point 1, securing access to `elmah.axd` is the *primary* mitigation for preventing unauthorized information disclosure via ELMAH.
    *   **Proactive Sensitive Data Sanitization in Error Handling:**  Implement application-level error handling that *actively prevents* logging of highly sensitive data. Sanitize or redact sensitive information *before* it reaches ELMAH for logging.
    *   **Regular Log Review and Data Minimization:**  Periodically review error logs (via the secured ELMAH interface) to identify and minimize the logging of sensitive data. Refine error handling and logging practices to reduce the exposure of critical information.
    *   **Consider Data Masking/Redaction within ELMAH (If feasible/customizable):** Explore if ELMAH configuration or customization allows for data masking or redaction *within* the logging process itself, although application-level sanitization is generally more robust.

## Attack Surface: [High-Severity Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities in ELMAH UI](./attack_surfaces/high-severity_cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities_in_elmah_ui.md)

*   **Description:** The ELMAH web interface (`elmah.axd`) is vulnerable to XSS attacks, potentially leading to administrator account compromise when viewing maliciously crafted error logs.
*   **ELMAH Contribution:** If the `elmah.axd` interface does not properly sanitize or encode error log data before displaying it, ELMAH's UI itself becomes the vector for XSS. This is a direct vulnerability within the ELMAH component.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a field that will be logged by ELMAH (e.g., via a vulnerable input field in the application). When an administrator views this error in `elmah.axd`, the unsanitized malicious script executes within their browser session, potentially stealing session cookies or performing administrative actions.
*   **Impact:** **High Account Compromise and Control**. Successful XSS attacks can lead to full compromise of administrator accounts accessing ELMAH, allowing attackers to gain control over the application and potentially the server.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Output Encoding in `elmah.axd` UI:**  Ensure *all* data displayed within the `elmah.axd` interface is properly output encoded (HTML encoded) to prevent interpretation of error log content as executable code. This is a critical fix within the ELMAH UI itself (or potentially requiring patching/updating ELMAH).
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy for the `elmah.axd` interface to limit the capabilities of any potentially injected scripts, reducing the impact of XSS.
    *   **Regular Security Updates for ELMAH:**  Keep ELMAH updated to the latest version to benefit from any security patches addressing XSS or other vulnerabilities in the UI.
    *   **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Include the ELMAH interface in regular security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify and address any XSS vulnerabilities.
