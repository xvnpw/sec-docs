## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Strong Authentication for ELMAH Dashboard](./mitigation_strategies/implement_strong_authentication_for_elmah_dashboard.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Strong Authentication for ELMAH Dashboard

**Description:**

1.  **Identify ELMAH Endpoint:** Locate the configured endpoint for ELMAH dashboard access, typically `elmah.axd` or a custom route defined in `web.config` or application startup.
2.  **Configure Authorization Rules:** Utilize your application's existing authentication mechanism or implement a dedicated authentication layer to restrict access to the ELMAH endpoint.
    *   **ASP.NET Framework (web.config):**  Within the `<system.web>` section, use `<location>` and `<authorization>` rules targeting `elmah.axd` to allow access only to specific roles or users (e.g., Administrators).
    *   **ASP.NET Core (Startup.cs or Program.cs):** Use authorization middleware and policies to restrict access to the ELMAH endpoint handler to authorized users based on roles or claims.
3.  **Test Authentication:** Verify that only authorized users can access the ELMAH dashboard and unauthorized users are denied access.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Error Logs (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized individuals from viewing sensitive error information exposed through the ELMAH dashboard.
*   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of leaking sensitive application details and potential vulnerabilities via publicly accessible ELMAH error logs.
*   **Account Enumeration (Medium Severity):**  Prevents attackers from potentially gathering information about application users or roles by probing the ELMAH dashboard without proper authentication.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Dashboard Abuse (Medium Severity):** Prevents public access to the dashboard, reducing the attack surface for DoS attempts targeting the ELMAH interface itself.

**Impact:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Error Logs:** High Risk Reduction
*   **Information Disclosure:** High Risk Reduction
*   **Account Enumeration:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Dashboard Abuse:** Medium Risk Reduction

**Currently Implemented:**  Potentially partially implemented. General application authentication might be present, but specific authorization for the ELMAH endpoint might be missing or weak.

**Missing Implementation:**  Likely missing specific authorization rules *for the ELMAH endpoint*. Developers need to explicitly configure authorization to restrict access to authorized roles or users for `elmah.axd` or the configured ELMAH route.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Access to ELMAH Configuration Files](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_access_to_elmah_configuration_files.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Restrict Access to ELMAH Configuration Files

**Description:**

1.  **Identify Configuration Files:** Locate the configuration files where ELMAH settings are stored, typically `web.config` or `appsettings.json`.
2.  **Review File Permissions:** Check file system permissions on these files. Ensure they are readable only by the application's process account and authorized administrators.
3.  **Apply Secure File Permissions:** Use operating system tools (e.g., `icacls` on Windows, `chmod/chown` on Linux) to set restrictive permissions. Remove read access for general users and grant it only to the application pool identity and administrator accounts.
4.  **Verify Access Restrictions:** Test by attempting to access the configuration files with an unauthorized user account to confirm access is denied.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**

*   **Information Disclosure via Configuration Exposure (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from reading ELMAH configuration files to obtain sensitive information like database connection strings or custom settings that might reveal internal details.
*   **Configuration Tampering (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of unauthorized modification of ELMAH settings, which could disrupt error logging or be used to manipulate ELMAH's behavior.

**Impact:**

*   **Information Disclosure via Configuration Exposure:** High Risk Reduction
*   **Configuration Tampering:** Medium Risk Reduction

**Currently Implemented:**  Likely partially implemented by default OS file permissions. However, explicit review and hardening are needed, especially in shared environments.

**Missing Implementation:**  Explicit review and hardening of file system permissions *on configuration files containing ELMAH settings*. Developers and system administrators need to actively verify and adjust permissions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Error Log Data](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_error_log_data.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Sanitize Error Log Data

**Description:**

1.  **Identify Sensitive Data in ELMAH Logs:** Analyze the types of errors logged by ELMAH and identify potentially sensitive data that might be included in error details (e.g., connection strings, API keys, user passwords, internal paths).
2.  **Implement Data Sanitization Logic:** Develop code to sanitize or mask sensitive data *before* it is logged by ELMAH.
    *   **Custom Error Handling:** Modify application's exception handling to sanitize exception details or messages before logging with ELMAH.
    *   **ELMAH Filtering (Advanced):**  Potentially extend ELMAH or use a custom error log sink to intercept and sanitize error details before logging (more complex).
3.  **Example Sanitization Techniques:** Use masking (e.g., replacing sensitive parts with asterisks), removal of sensitive fields, or one-way hashing for sensitive identifiers.
4.  **Test Sanitization:** Generate errors that would normally log sensitive data and verify that sanitized ELMAH logs do not contain the sensitive information in its original form.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**

*   **Information Disclosure via Error Logs (High Severity):** Prevents sensitive data from being exposed in ELMAH error logs, reducing the risk of attackers gaining access to secrets or user data by accessing ELMAH logs.

**Impact:**

*   **Information Disclosure via Error Logs:** High Risk Reduction

**Currently Implemented:**  Likely missing. Data sanitization for ELMAH error logs is usually not implemented by default.

**Missing Implementation:**  Data sanitization logic needs to be implemented in error handling routines *specifically for data logged by ELMAH*. This requires code changes to sanitize data before passing it to ELMAH for logging.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Error Details Logged](./mitigation_strategies/limit_error_details_logged.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Limit Error Details Logged

**Description:**

1.  **Review ELMAH Logged Data:** Examine the current level of detail logged by ELMAH. Identify if excessive or unnecessary information is being logged *by ELMAH*.
2.  **Configure Logging Level (If Applicable via Integration):** If using a logging framework integrated with ELMAH, configure it to control the logging level and reduce verbosity of logs sent to ELMAH.
3.  **Customize Error Handling (If Direct ELMAH Usage):** If directly using ELMAH's API, modify the code to log only essential information to ELMAH: Exception Type, Message, Stack Trace, and sanitized context. Avoid logging excessive request details or sensitive context data in ELMAH logs.
4.  **Test Reduced Logging:** Generate errors and verify that ELMAH logs contain sufficient information for debugging *within ELMAH* but do not include unnecessary details.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**

*   **Information Disclosure via Error Logs (Medium Severity):** Reduces the amount of potentially sensitive information logged *by ELMAH*, minimizing the risk of accidental exposure through ELMAH logs.
*   **Log Storage Overload (Low Severity):**  Reduces the volume of logs generated *by ELMAH*, potentially saving storage space for ELMAH logs.

**Impact:**

*   **Information Disclosure via Error Logs:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Log Storage Overload:** Low Risk Reduction

**Currently Implemented:**  Potentially partially implemented based on default ELMAH behavior. However, active review and configuration are needed to minimize information leakage *in ELMAH logs*.

**Missing Implementation:**  Active configuration and customization of logging details *specifically for ELMAH* to limit the amount of information logged. Developers need to review their error logging practices related to ELMAH and adjust them.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Log Storage Location](./mitigation_strategies/secure_log_storage_location.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Log Storage Location

**Description:**

1.  **Identify ELMAH Log Storage Location:** Determine where ELMAH logs are stored (file system, database, cloud storage).
2.  **Apply Access Controls:**
    *   **File System (ELMAH XML Files):** Apply secure file system permissions to the directory where ELMAH XML log files are stored.
