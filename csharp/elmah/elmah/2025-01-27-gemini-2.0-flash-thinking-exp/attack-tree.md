## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application via ELMAH [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_application_via_elmah__critical_node_.md)

Description: This is the overall goal.  Success in any of the sub-paths leads to achieving this goal via ELMAH vulnerabilities.

Risk Level: Critical - Represents a full application compromise through ELMAH.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Unauthorised Access to Sensitive Information via ELMAH Interface [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__unauthorised_access_to_sensitive_information_via_elmah_interface__c_7cec49de.md)

Description: This path focuses on gaining unauthorized access to the ELMAH interface and leveraging it to extract sensitive information. It's high-risk because it's often easily achievable and leads directly to data exposure.

Likelihood: High
Impact: High
Effort: Low
Skill Level: Low
Detection Difficulty: Medium
Attack Vectors:
    * Unprotected Dashboard: Exploiting misconfigurations where the ELMAH dashboard is accessible without any authentication.
    * Weak Authentication: Bypassing or cracking weak authentication mechanisms protecting the dashboard.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Unprotected ELMAH Dashboard Access [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__unprotected_elmah_dashboard_access__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

Description: This is the most direct and critical sub-path within "Unauthorised Access".  It targets the scenario where the ELMAH dashboard is left completely unprotected, often due to default configurations or oversight.

Likelihood: High
Impact: High
Effort: Low
Skill Level: Low
Detection Difficulty: Medium
Attack Vectors:
    * [HIGH RISK PATH] Access ELMAH Dashboard without Authentication [HIGH RISK PATH]
        * [HIGH RISK PATH] Default Configuration with No Authentication [HIGH RISK PATH]
            * Attack Vector: Simply accessing the default ELMAH URL (e.g., `elmah.axd`) in a web browser.
            * Why High-Risk: Extremely easy to exploit, requires no skills, and immediately grants access to potentially sensitive error logs. Default configurations are often overlooked during deployment.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Access ELMAH Dashboard without Authentication [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__access_elmah_dashboard_without_authentication__high_risk_path_.md)

Description:  The attacker directly accesses the ELMAH dashboard URL without being prompted for or needing to bypass any authentication.

Likelihood: High (if default configuration is used)
Impact: High
Effort: Low
Skill Level: Low
Detection Difficulty: Medium
Attack Vectors:
    * Direct URL Access: Typing or navigating to the ELMAH dashboard URL in a browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Default Configuration with No Authentication [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__default_configuration_with_no_authentication__high_risk_path_.md)

Description: The application is deployed with the default ELMAH configuration, which typically does not enforce authentication on the dashboard.

Likelihood: High (especially in development, testing, or quick deployments)
Impact: High
Effort: Low
Skill Level: Low
Detection Difficulty: Medium
Attack Vectors:
    * Configuration Neglect: Developers or administrators fail to configure authentication for the ELMAH dashboard during setup or deployment.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Information Disclosure via ELMAH Error Details [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__information_disclosure_via_elmah_error_details__critical_node___hig_a70d62e2.md)

Description: Even with a protected dashboard, this path focuses on the risk of sensitive information being present *within* the error logs themselves. This is a high-risk path because it relies on common coding practices that inadvertently log sensitive data.

Likelihood: High
Impact: High
Effort: Low (if dashboard is accessible)
Skill Level: Low
Detection Difficulty: Low (for attacker to find in logs), Hard (to proactively detect from outside)
Attack Vectors:
    * Viewing Sensitive Data in Error Logs: Accessing the ELMAH dashboard (through authorized or unauthorized means) and reviewing the error logs to find sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] View Sensitive Data in Error Logs [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__view_sensitive_data_in_error_logs__high_risk_path_.md)

Description: The attacker examines the error logs displayed in the ELMAH dashboard, specifically looking for instances where sensitive data has been logged.

Likelihood: High (if application logging practices are insecure)
Impact: High
Effort: Low (if dashboard is accessible)
Skill Level: Low
Detection Difficulty: Low (for attacker), Hard (proactive detection)
Attack Vectors:
    * [HIGH RISK PATH] Application Logs Sensitive Data in Exceptions (e.g., API Keys, Passwords, PII) [HIGH RISK PATH]
        * Attack Vector: Developers inadvertently log sensitive information (API keys, passwords, PII, etc.) within exception handling blocks in the application code. ELMAH then captures and displays this sensitive data in the error logs.
        * Why High-Risk: Common coding mistake, direct exposure of highly sensitive credentials and personal data, easily exploitable if the dashboard is accessible.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Application Logs Sensitive Data in Exceptions (e.g., API Keys, Passwords, PII) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__application_logs_sensitive_data_in_exceptions__e_g___api_keys__passwords__pii___hig_94705ad4.md)

Description:  The root cause of sensitive data exposure within ELMAH logs. This highlights the insecure coding practice of logging sensitive information when handling exceptions.

Likelihood: High (common developer mistake)
Impact: High
Effort: No effort for attacker to exploit if logs are accessible.
Skill Level: Low for attacker.
Detection Difficulty: Hard to detect proactively from outside, requires internal code review and secure coding practices.
Attack Vectors:
    * Insecure Exception Handling:  Developers directly logging sensitive variables or data structures within `catch` blocks or error handling routines.
    * Overly Verbose Logging:  Logging too much detail in error messages, including sensitive context information.
