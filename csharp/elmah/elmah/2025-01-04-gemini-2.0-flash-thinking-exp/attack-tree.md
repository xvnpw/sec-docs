## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Error Logs (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_error_logs__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Identify ELMAH Endpoint:** Attackers locate the ELMAH interface, typically through common paths like `/elmah.axd`.
    *   **Bypass Authentication/Authorization (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers circumvent security measures protecting the ELMAH interface.
        *   **Exploit Default Configuration (HIGH-RISK PATH):** The most common scenario where administrators fail to set a password for the ELMAH endpoint, granting immediate access.
    *   **Exploit Information Disclosure of Error Log Data (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers access error log data without proper authorization.
        *   **Access publicly accessible ELMAH endpoint due to misconfiguration (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**  A misconfigured web server or application directly exposes the ELMAH interface without requiring authentication.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Error Logs (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_error_logs__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Gain Access to Error Logging Mechanism:** Attackers trigger errors that ELMAH will log, often through interaction with vulnerable parts of the application.
    *   **Inject Malicious Data into Error Logs (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers insert harmful data into the error logs.
        *   **Trigger specific errors with crafted input to inject malicious scripts (Stored XSS) (HIGH-RISK PATH):** By providing malicious input that causes an error, attackers inject scripts that execute when an administrator views the logs.
    *   **Exploit Log Data for Further Attacks (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers use information from the logs for malicious purposes.
        *   **Extract sensitive information (API keys, database credentials) logged in errors (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Error messages inadvertently contain sensitive data that attackers can steal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit ELMAH Configuration Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_elmah_configuration_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Access ELMAH Configuration Files (e.g., web.config) (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers gain access to the configuration file, often through file inclusion vulnerabilities or misconfigured web servers.
    *   **Manipulate Configuration Settings (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers change ELMAH's settings for malicious purposes.
        *   **Disable security features (e.g., authentication) (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers remove the authentication requirement for the ELMAH endpoint.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities within ELMAH Library Code (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_within_elmah_library_code__critical_node_.md)

*   **Exploit identified vulnerabilities (e.g., potential for remote code execution, although less likely in a logging library) (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers leverage publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the specific ELMAH version being used.
