# Attack Surface Analysis for elmah/elmah

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Elmah Endpoint Access](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_elmah_endpoint_access.md)

*   **Description:** The Elmah endpoint (e.g., `/elmah.axd`) is accessible without authentication or authorization.
    *   **How Elmah Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Elmah *provides* the web interface for viewing error logs. If the endpoint serving this interface is not secured, it becomes a direct point of access facilitated by Elmah's design.
    *   **Example:** An attacker navigates to `https://example.com/elmah.axd` and can view all logged errors through Elmah's built-in UI.
    *   **Impact:**  Information Disclosure (sensitive application details, internal paths, connection strings, user data potentially present in errors), potential for further reconnaissance.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement authentication and authorization for the Elmah endpoint. This can be done through web server configuration (e.g., IIS authentication) or application-level authorization checks.
        *   Restrict access to specific IP addresses or networks if appropriate.
        *   Consider using a non-standard or hard-to-guess endpoint path, although this is security through obscurity and should not be the primary defense.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Elmah UI](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_elmah_ui.md)

*   **Description:** The Elmah UI does not properly sanitize or encode error details before displaying them, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
    *   **How Elmah Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Elmah's responsibility is to *render* the error details it receives. If it doesn't sanitize this input before displaying it in its UI, it directly enables the XSS vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker triggers an error with a crafted message containing a `<script>` tag. When an administrator views this error in the Elmah UI provided by Elmah, the script executes in their browser.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise of administrators viewing the logs, potential for further attacks on the application through the administrator's session.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Elmah (or any custom UI built on top of Elmah data) properly encodes output when displaying error details to prevent script execution.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   Regularly update Elmah to the latest version, as updates may include security fixes.
