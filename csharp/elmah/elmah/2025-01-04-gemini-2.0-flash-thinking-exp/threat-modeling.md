# Threat Model Analysis for elmah/elmah

## Threat: [Unprotected Error Log Viewer Access](./threats/unprotected_error_log_viewer_access.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Actions:** An attacker could directly access the Elmah error log viewer (typically through a URL like `/elmah.axd` in ASP.NET applications) without proper authentication or authorization. They would browse to this endpoint.
    *   **How:** The attacker leverages the default configuration or lack of enforced access controls on the Elmah viewer endpoint.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive information contained within the error logs, such as database connection strings, API keys, internal paths, user credentials, and application internals. This information can be used for further attacks, such as privilege escalation, data breaches, or gaining deeper understanding of the application's vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   **Component:** `Elmah.Mvc.ErrorLogController` (or similar depending on the Elmah integration), specifically the actions responsible for rendering the error log view.
*   **Risk Severity:**
    *   **Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to the Elmah viewer. This can be done through framework-level security features (e.g., ASP.NET Authorization attributes) or dedicated Elmah configuration settings.
    *   Change the default Elmah viewer path (`/elmah.axd`) to a less predictable value.
    *   Consider disabling the web-based viewer entirely in production environments if it's not actively used for monitoring and rely on alternative methods for accessing logs.

## Threat: [Information Leakage through Verbose Error Details](./threats/information_leakage_through_verbose_error_details.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Actions:** An attacker analyzes the detailed error messages and stack traces logged by Elmah. This information is passively gathered by observing the output of the unprotected error log viewer or by intercepting network traffic if the viewer is accessed over an insecure connection.
    *   **How:** The attacker exploits the fact that Elmah, by default, logs detailed exception information, including file paths, class names, method names, and potentially sensitive data within variables.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of internal application structure, technology stack details, and potential vulnerabilities. This information aids attackers in reconnaissance, identifying attack vectors, and crafting targeted exploits.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   **Component:** The core Elmah logging mechanism, specifically the components responsible for formatting and storing exception details.
*   **Risk Severity:**
    *   **Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure Elmah to log less verbose error details in production environments. Focus on logging essential information for debugging without exposing excessive internal details.
    *   Implement custom error handling to sanitize or redact sensitive information from exception objects before they are logged by Elmah.
    *   Ensure the Elmah viewer is accessed over HTTPS to prevent interception of sensitive log data.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Error Logs](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_error_logs.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Actions:** An attacker gains access to the stored error logs (e.g., in the file system, database, or other configured storage) and extracts sensitive information present within the logged exception details.
    *   **How:** This could occur through exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's file system permissions, database access controls, or other security misconfigurations related to the Elmah log storage.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Impact:**  Direct exposure of sensitive data, potentially leading to data breaches, identity theft, or financial loss, depending on the nature of the information exposed.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   **Component:** The Elmah logging storage mechanism (e.g., `Elmah.Io.ErrorLog`, `Elmah.SqlErrorLog`), and the underlying storage medium (file system, database).
*   **Risk Severity:**
    *   **Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the storage location of Elmah logs with appropriate file system permissions or database access controls.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data before it is logged by Elmah.
    *   Implement secure configuration practices to protect connection strings and credentials used by Elmah to access its log storage.
    *   Regularly review and audit the security of the Elmah log storage.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Excessive Error Generation](./threats/denial_of_service_through_excessive_error_generation.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Actions:** An attacker intentionally triggers a large number of errors within the application, causing Elmah to log a massive amount of data.
    *   **How:** This could be achieved by sending malicious requests, exploiting application vulnerabilities that lead to exceptions, or simply bombarding the application with requests designed to cause errors.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Impact:**  Resource exhaustion on the server hosting the application, potentially leading to performance degradation or complete service outage. This can impact disk space, memory, and database load if logging to a database.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   **Component:** The core Elmah logging mechanism, specifically the components responsible for writing error information to the configured storage.
*   **Risk Severity:**
    *   **Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting or throttling mechanisms to prevent excessive error generation from specific sources.
    *   Monitor Elmah's logging activity for unusual spikes in error rates.
    *   Configure appropriate storage limits and retention policies for Elmah logs to prevent unbounded growth.
    *   Implement robust input validation and error handling within the application to minimize the occurrence of unhandled exceptions.

## Threat: [Exposure of Elmah Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_elmah_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Actions:** An attacker gains access to Elmah's configuration files (e.g., `web.config` or other configuration sources).
    *   **How:** This could be achieved through exploiting vulnerabilities in file system permissions, insecure deployment practices, or by gaining access to the server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive configuration settings, such as connection strings to log storage, API keys for remote logging services, or credentials used by Elmah. This information can be used for further attacks or to compromise the integrity of the logging system.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   **Component:** Elmah's configuration loading mechanism and the configuration files themselves.
*   **Risk Severity:**
    *   **Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure configuration files using appropriate file system permissions.
    *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in plain text configuration files. Consider using secure configuration management techniques or encryption for sensitive settings.
    *   Regularly review and audit Elmah's configuration settings.

## Threat: [Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Elmah](./threats/exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in_elmah.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Actions:** An attacker exploits known security vulnerabilities present within the Elmah library itself.
    *   **How:** This involves researching publicly disclosed vulnerabilities and crafting exploits to target those weaknesses.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Impact:**  Depending on the nature of the vulnerability, this could lead to arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, denial of service, or other forms of compromise.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   **Component:** Any part of the Elmah library containing the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:**
    *   **Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Elmah updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories related to Elmah and other dependencies to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in Elmah and its configuration.
