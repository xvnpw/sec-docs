# Attack Tree Analysis for elmah/elmah

Objective: Gain unauthorized access to sensitive information by leveraging ELMAH vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   **[HIGH RISK PATH]** Access Sensitive Information via ELMAH
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** View Error Log Contents
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]** Unauthorized Access to Error Log Viewer (OR)
            *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]** Default Configuration/Weak Credentials (AND)
                *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Default ELMAH path not changed (e.g., elmah.axd)
                *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Lack of authentication/authorization on the ELMAH viewer
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH]** Direct Access to Error Log Storage (OR)
            *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]** Publicly Accessible Log Files (AND)
                *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Error log files stored in a web-accessible directory

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Access Sensitive Information via ELMAH](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_access_sensitive_information_via_elmah.md)

This path represents the attacker's primary goal when targeting ELMAH. Successful exploitation along this path directly leads to the exposure of sensitive information logged by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: View Error Log Contents](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_view_error_log_contents.md)

This node represents the core objective within the "Access Sensitive Information" path. Gaining the ability to view the error logs is the most direct way to achieve the attacker's goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Unauthorized Access to Error Log Viewer](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_unauthorized_access_to_error_log_viewer.md)

This path outlines the most common and easily exploitable methods for gaining access to the ELMAH viewer. It leverages common misconfigurations and security oversights.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Unauthorized Access to Error Log Viewer](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_unauthorized_access_to_error_log_viewer.md)

This node is critical because it represents a direct gateway to viewing the error logs. If this node is compromised, the attacker has immediate access to potentially sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Default Configuration/Weak Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_default_configurationweak_credentials.md)

This path highlights the risk associated with using ELMAH's default settings without implementing proper security measures. It's a very common vulnerability in web applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Default Configuration/Weak Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_default_configurationweak_credentials.md)

This node is critical because it represents a significant security flaw. Failing to change the default path and implement authentication makes the ELMAH viewer easily accessible to anyone.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Default ELMAH path not changed (e.g., elmah.axd)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_default_elmah_path_not_changed__e_g___elmah_axd_.md)

This node is critical because the default path is well-known, making the ELMAH viewer easily discoverable by attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Lack of authentication/authorization on the ELMAH viewer](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_lack_of_authenticationauthorization_on_the_elmah_viewer.md)

This node is critical because the absence of authentication allows anyone who finds the ELMAH viewer to access the error logs without any restrictions.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Direct Access to Error Log Storage](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_direct_access_to_error_log_storage.md)

This path represents an alternative way for attackers to access the error logs by bypassing the ELMAH viewer and directly accessing the underlying storage mechanism.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Publicly Accessible Log Files](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_publicly_accessible_log_files.md)

This path highlights a severe configuration error where the error log files are stored in a location accessible via the web server, allowing attackers to download them directly.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Publicly Accessible Log Files](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_publicly_accessible_log_files.md)

This node is critical because it represents a direct and easily exploitable vulnerability. If log files are publicly accessible, no authentication or complex exploitation is required to access them.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Error log files stored in a web-accessible directory](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_error_log_files_stored_in_a_web-accessible_directory.md)

This node is critical because it's the specific misconfiguration that makes the "Publicly Accessible Log Files" attack path possible.
