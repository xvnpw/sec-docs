# Threat Model Analysis for elmah/elmah

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Error Logs](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_error_logs.md)

**Description:** Attackers could gain unauthorized access to ELMAH's error logs, either through the web interface (`ErrorLogPage.axd`) or by directly accessing the underlying storage mechanism (files or database). They could then review the detailed error information captured by `Elmah.ErrorLogModule`, which might inadvertently contain sensitive data such as user credentials, API keys, personal information, or internal system details logged within exceptions, request parameters, or server variables.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, leading to the exposure of sensitive information. This information can be exploited for further attacks, identity theft, or unauthorized access to other systems.

**Affected Component:**
* `Elmah.ErrorLogModule` (captures error details)
* `ErrorLogPage.axd` (web interface for viewing logs)
* File logging mechanism
* Database logging mechanism

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure ELMAH to filter out sensitive data from error logs using custom filters or by modifying the logging process within `Elmah.ErrorLogModule`.
* Secure the ELMAH viewer (`ErrorLogPage.axd`) with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
* Ensure proper file system permissions are set for log files.
* Implement robust access controls on the database if using database logging.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to ELMAH Error Log Viewer](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_elmah_error_log_viewer.md)

**Description:** Attackers could bypass or exploit weaknesses in the authentication or authorization mechanisms protecting the ELMAH error log viewer (`ErrorLogPage.axd`). This could involve exploiting default credentials or vulnerabilities in custom authentication logic implemented for the viewer. Successful exploitation allows unauthorized individuals to access and review potentially sensitive error information exposed by `ErrorLogPage.axd`.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, allowing unauthorized individuals to gain insights into application errors and potentially sensitive data, aiding in reconnaissance and further attacks.

**Affected Component:**
* `ErrorLogPage.axd` (web interface for viewing logs)
* Authentication and authorization mechanisms implemented specifically for `ErrorLogPage.axd`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong, non-default authentication for the ELMAH viewer.
* Utilize robust authorization mechanisms to restrict access to the ELMAH viewer based on user roles or permissions.
* Regularly review and test the authentication and authorization logic protecting the ELMAH viewer.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in ELMAH Library](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_elmah_library.md)

**Description:** Attackers could discover and exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the ELMAH library code itself. This could potentially allow them to execute arbitrary code within the application's context, bypass security restrictions enforced by ELMAH, or cause a denial of service by exploiting flaws in `Elmah.ErrorLogModule` or other components.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server, depending on the nature of the vulnerability. This could lead to data breaches, system takeover, or service disruption.

**Affected Component:**
* All ELMAH components (`Elmah.ErrorLogModule`, `ErrorLogPage.axd`, logging providers, etc.)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update the ELMAH library to the latest version to patch any known security vulnerabilities.
* Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists related to ELMAH to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.
* Follow secure coding practices when integrating and configuring ELMAH to minimize the risk of introducing new vulnerabilities.
