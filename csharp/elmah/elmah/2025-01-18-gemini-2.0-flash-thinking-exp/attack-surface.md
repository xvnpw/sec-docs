# Attack Surface Analysis for elmah/elmah

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Elmah Endpoint](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_elmah_endpoint.md)

- **Description:** The Elmah endpoint (typically `/elmah.axd`) is accessible without proper authentication and authorization.
- **How Elmah Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Elmah provides a built-in web interface for viewing error logs, and if this interface is not secured, it becomes a direct point of access for attackers.
- **Example:** An anonymous user navigates to `https://example.com/elmah.axd` and can view all logged errors.
- **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive information contained in error logs (internal paths, database connection strings, user input, etc.), providing attackers with valuable insights into the application's vulnerabilities and inner workings.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Implement Authentication and Authorization:** Restrict access to the Elmah endpoint to authorized users only. This can be done through web server configuration (e.g., using `<authorization>` in `web.config` for IIS) or application-level authentication.
    - **Consider Alternative Deployment:** If the Elmah UI is not needed in production, consider disabling it or deploying Elmah to a separate, secured monitoring environment.
    - **Use HTTPS:** Ensure the entire application, including the Elmah endpoint, is served over HTTPS to protect the confidentiality of the error data in transit.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Error Details](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_error_details.md)

- **Description:** Error messages logged by Elmah contain unsanitized user input, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts that are executed when viewing the Elmah logs.
- **How Elmah Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Elmah renders the error details, including potentially malicious user input, directly in the web interface.
- **Example:** A user submits input containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` which triggers an error and is logged by Elmah. When an administrator views this error in Elmah, the script executes in their browser.
- **Impact:**  An attacker could potentially steal session cookies of administrators viewing the logs, perform actions on their behalf, or inject further malicious content into the Elmah interface.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize or encode user input before it is logged by Elmah. This should be done at the point where the error is being handled and logged.
    - **Output Encoding:** Ensure that Elmah properly encodes the error details when rendering them in the HTML output to prevent the browser from interpreting malicious scripts.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities.
