# Threat Model Analysis for avaloniaui/avalonia

## Threat: [XAML Resource Tampering](./threats/xaml_resource_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker modifies XAML files (either on disk or during a compromised build process) to inject malicious UI elements, alter existing controls, or change application behavior. They might replace a legitimate button with one that sends data to an attacker-controlled server, or change text labels to display phishing messages. This directly exploits Avalonia's reliance on XAML for UI definition.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive user input could be redirected to the attacker.
        *   **Code Execution:** Injected XAML could potentially trigger unintended code execution if it interacts with vulnerable application logic *through Avalonia's data binding or event handling*.
        *   **Phishing/Social Engineering:** Users could be tricked into performing actions they didn't intend.
        *   **Application Misbehavior:** The application could behave unexpectedly, leading to data loss or corruption.
    *   **Avalonia Component Affected:**
        *   `Avalonia.Markup.Xaml.AvaloniaXamlLoader`: This class is responsible for loading and parsing XAML files.
        *   Resource Dictionaries: Styles, templates, and other resources defined in XAML, loaded and used by Avalonia.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Digital Signatures:** Digitally sign the application and all XAML resources. Verify the signature before loading any XAML using `AvaloniaXamlLoader`.
        *   **Resource Embedding:** Embed XAML resources directly into the application assembly to prevent external modification. This makes it harder for an attacker to tamper with the XAML.
        *   **File System Permissions:** Implement strict file system permissions to prevent unauthorized access to XAML files (though embedding is preferred).
        *   **Secure Deployment:** Use a secure deployment mechanism that ensures the integrity of application files, including XAML.
        *   **Input Validation (Indirect):** Validate any data loaded *into* the XAML (e.g., from a database) to prevent indirect injection attacks.

## Threat: [Data Binding Manipulation](./threats/data_binding_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with the ability to inject code or manipulate memory targets Avalonia's data binding system. They could alter the values of bound properties, causing incorrect data to be displayed or processed, or trigger unexpected behavior in the application logic *through Avalonia's binding mechanisms*. This is a direct attack on Avalonia's core functionality.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Corruption:** Incorrect data could be written back to data sources *via Avalonia's two-way bindings*.
        *   **Application Logic Errors:** Unexpected property values could lead to crashes or incorrect program execution, triggered by Avalonia's event handling based on changed bindings.
        *   **Security Bypass:** If data bindings control access control or other security features *within Avalonia's UI*, manipulation could bypass these mechanisms.
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Altered bindings could expose sensitive data that should not be visible *within the Avalonia UI*.
    *   **Avalonia Component Affected:**
        *   `Avalonia.Data.Binding`: The core data binding mechanism.
        *   `AvaloniaProperty`: The property system used for data binding.
        *   `INotifyPropertyChanged` and related interfaces: Used for change notification in data binding, part of Avalonia's reactive UI model.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Minimize Unsafe Code:** Avoid using unsafe code or P/Invoke that could introduce memory corruption vulnerabilities, which could then be used to attack Avalonia.
        *   **Memory Protection:** Utilize OS-level memory protection features (ASLR, DEP). While not directly Avalonia-specific, they protect against the exploitation *method*.
        *   **Code Auditing:** Regularly audit code for potential memory manipulation vulnerabilities that could affect Avalonia's data.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate all data that is used in data bindings, especially if it originates from external sources, to prevent injection into Avalonia's data context.
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding guidelines to prevent memory corruption and injection vulnerabilities that could be used to target Avalonia.
        *   **Use OneWay or OneTime Bindings:** Where possible, use `OneWay` or `OneTime` binding modes to reduce the attack surface. Avoid `TwoWay` bindings for sensitive data unless absolutely necessary, limiting the impact on the data source.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Layout/Rendering Overload](./threats/denial_of_service_via_layoutrendering_overload.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides malicious input (e.g., extremely complex XAML, deeply nested controls, or very large images) designed to overwhelm Avalonia's layout or rendering engine. This is a direct attack on Avalonia's rendering pipeline.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Application Unavailability:** The Avalonia application becomes unusable.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** CPU, memory, or other system resources are exhausted due to Avalonia's processing.
        *   **Potential System Instability:** In extreme cases, the entire system could become unstable due to Avalonia's resource consumption.
    *   **Avalonia Component Affected:**
        *   `Avalonia.Layout.LayoutManager`: Handles the layout process.
        *   `Avalonia.Rendering.IRenderer`: The rendering engine.
        *   `Avalonia.Controls.Control`: The base class for all UI controls. Complex or deeply nested controls are the primary attack vector, directly impacting Avalonia's UI system.
        *   `Avalonia.Media.Imaging.Bitmap` and related image handling classes: Large or malformed images can cause performance issues within Avalonia's rendering.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user input and data loaded from external sources, especially XAML and image data, that will be processed by Avalonia.
        *   **Complexity Limits:** Impose limits on the complexity of UI layouts (e.g., maximum nesting depth, maximum number of controls) *within the XAML processed by Avalonia*.
        *   **Resource Quotas:** Implement resource limits or quotas to prevent excessive CPU or memory consumption *by the Avalonia application*.
        *   **Asynchronous Operations:** Use asynchronous operations for potentially long-running tasks (e.g., loading large images) to prevent UI freezes *within Avalonia*.
        *   **Performance Profiling:** Regularly profile the Avalonia application's performance to identify potential bottlenecks and areas vulnerable to DoS attacks.
        *   **Image Size Limits:** Restrict the maximum size and dimensions of images that can be loaded *by Avalonia*.

## Threat: [Unsafe Native Interop (P/Invoke) used by Avalonia](./threats/unsafe_native_interop__pinvoke__used_by_avalonia.md)

*   **Description:** Avalonia itself, or custom controls within the Avalonia application, use P/Invoke to call native code. If these P/Invoke calls are not implemented securely, they could introduce vulnerabilities. While the vulnerability isn't *in* Avalonia's core code, it's a direct consequence of how Avalonia (or extensions to it) interacts with the OS.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Code Execution:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code.
        *   **Elevation of Privilege:** If the native code has higher privileges.
        *   **Data Corruption:** Memory corruption.
        *   **System Instability:** Crashes in native code.
    *   **Avalonia Component Affected:**
        *   Any Avalonia component (including custom controls) that uses `System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImport`. This includes Avalonia's own platform-specific implementations (e.g., for windowing).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Minimize P/Invoke:** Use managed code whenever possible.
        *   **Input/Output Validation:** Thoroughly validate all input and output to/from native code.
        *   **Safe String Handling:** Use appropriate string marshalling.
        *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling.
        *   **Code Auditing:** Regularly audit P/Invoke code.
        *   **Use Safe Libraries:** If possible, use well-vetted libraries.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Consider sandboxing native code.
        *   **Keep Avalonia Updated:** Ensure you are using the latest version of Avalonia, as vulnerabilities in its platform-specific code will be patched there.
