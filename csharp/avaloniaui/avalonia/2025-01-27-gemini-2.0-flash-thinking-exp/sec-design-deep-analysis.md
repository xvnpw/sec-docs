    *   Input Handling Issues
    *   Dependency Vulnerabilities
    *   Data Exposure

*   **Deep Dive and Additional Security Implications:**
    *   **State Management Vulnerabilities:** Improper management of application state, especially sensitive data in memory or persistent storage, can lead to vulnerabilities.  For example, storing credentials in memory for longer than necessary or using insecure storage mechanisms.
    *   **Client-Side Logic Vulnerabilities:**  Over-reliance on client-side validation or security checks without server-side enforcement can be bypassed.  While Avalonia is primarily for desktop/mobile, applications might interact with backend services where this becomes relevant.
