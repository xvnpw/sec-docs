*   **Threat:** Excessive Retries Leading to Downstream Service Denial of Service
    *   **Description:** An attacker might intentionally trigger errors in a downstream service that the application interacts with. If the Polly `RetryPolicy` is configured with a high number of retries and/or a short retry interval, the application could flood the failing downstream service with repeated requests, exacerbating the issue and potentially causing a denial of service on the downstream service itself.
    *   **Impact:**  Unavailability of the downstream service, impacting other applications or users relying on it. Potential cascading failures if other services depend on the affected downstream service.
    *   **Polly Component Affected:** `RetryPolicy`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully tune retry parameters (number of retries, backoff strategy) based on the downstream service's capabilities and expected error rates.
        *   Implement exponential backoff with jitter to avoid thundering herd problems.
        *   Consider using a circuit breaker in conjunction with retries to prevent repeated calls to a persistently failing service.
        *   Monitor the health and performance of downstream services to detect and respond to issues proactively.

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion on Application Due to Aggressive Retries
    *   **Description:** An attacker could induce errors that trigger the `RetryPolicy`. If the policy is configured with too many retries or a very short delay between retries, the application might consume excessive resources (threads, connections, memory) attempting to retry the failing operation, potentially leading to a denial of service on the application itself.
    *   **Impact:** Application slowdown, unresponsiveness, or complete failure.
    *   **Polly Component Affected:** `RetryPolicy`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Set reasonable limits on the maximum number of retry attempts.
        *   Implement appropriate delays between retries.
        *   Monitor application resource usage (CPU, memory, threads) to detect potential exhaustion.
        *   Consider using asynchronous retry mechanisms to avoid blocking threads.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Fallback Actions
    *   **Description:** An attacker might intentionally trigger failures that invoke the `Fallback` action. If the fallback implementation itself contains vulnerabilities (e.g., insecure deserialization, command injection if the fallback involves executing external commands), the attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**  Code execution on the application server, data breaches, or other security compromises depending on the vulnerability in the fallback action.
    *   **Polly Component Affected:** `Fallback`
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Treat fallback actions as critical components and apply the same security rigor as primary application logic.
        *   Thoroughly review and test fallback implementations for common vulnerabilities.
        *   Avoid performing complex or potentially dangerous operations within fallback actions.
        *   Sanitize any input used within fallback actions.
