# Threat Model Analysis for bitwarden/server

## Threat: [Direct Database Access Compromise](./threats/direct_database_access_compromise.md)

- **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the underlying database server, potentially by exploiting database software vulnerabilities, using compromised database credentials, or through network misconfigurations *directly affecting the database instance used by the Bitwarden server*. The attacker might then directly query the database, bypassing application-level security.
- **Impact:**  Critical. Full access to all encrypted vault data, including usernames, passwords, notes, and other sensitive information. Attackers can decrypt this data and use it for malicious purposes. Potential for data manipulation or deletion, leading to data loss and service disruption.
- **Affected Component:** Database Layer (e.g., the MySQL or MSSQL instance).
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - **Developers:**
    - Implement strong access controls and network segmentation to restrict access to the database server.
    - Regularly patch and update the database software to address known vulnerabilities.
    - Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication for database accounts *used by the Bitwarden server*.
    - Use encrypted connections for database access *from the Bitwarden server*.
    - Implement database activity monitoring and auditing.
  - **Users (Deployers):**
    - Secure the database server infrastructure (network security, operating system hardening) *hosting the Bitwarden server's database*.
    - Regularly review and restrict database access permissions.

## Threat: [API Authentication/Authorization Bypass](./threats/api_authenticationauthorization_bypass.md)

- **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the server-side API authentication or authorization mechanisms *within the Bitwarden server code*. This could involve bypassing authentication checks, exploiting flaws in token validation, or leveraging insecure authorization logic to access or modify resources they are not permitted to.
- **Impact:** High. Unauthorized access to user vaults, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. Attackers could impersonate users, create or delete vaults, or change user settings.
- **Affected Component:** API Authentication Module, API Authorization Middleware, specific API endpoints *within the Bitwarden server*.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - **Developers:**
    - Implement robust and well-tested authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT).
    - Thoroughly validate all API requests and inputs.
    - Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access.
    - Regularly review and audit API security configurations.
    - Implement rate limiting and abuse detection mechanisms.
  - **Users (Deployers):**
    - Ensure proper configuration of authentication providers if used *with the Bitwarden server*.

## Threat: [Brute-Force Attacks on Admin Credentials](./threats/brute-force_attacks_on_admin_credentials.md)

- **Description:** Attackers attempt to guess administrator credentials for the Bitwarden server's administrative panel through repeated login attempts *targeting the server's admin interface*. If successful, they gain full control over the server.
- **Impact:** Critical. Complete compromise of the Bitwarden server instance. Attackers can manage users, modify configurations, access server logs, and potentially gain access to the underlying system.
- **Affected Component:** Admin Panel Authentication Module.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - **Developers:**
    - Implement strong account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts.
    - Use CAPTCHA or similar mechanisms to prevent automated brute-force attacks.
    - Enforce strong password policies for administrator accounts.
    - Implement multi-factor authentication for administrator accounts.
    - Log and monitor administrative login attempts.
  - **Users (Deployers):**
    - Use strong and unique passwords for administrator accounts.
    - Enable multi-factor authentication for administrator accounts.
    - Restrict network access to the administrative panel.

## Threat: [Exposure of Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_configuration_files.md)

- **Description:** Sensitive configuration files containing database credentials, API keys, encryption secrets, or other sensitive information *used by the Bitwarden server* are unintentionally exposed. This could occur due to misconfigured web servers *hosting the Bitwarden server*, insecure file permissions *on the server*, or vulnerabilities in the deployment process.
- **Impact:** Critical. Exposure of sensitive credentials can allow attackers to directly access the database, impersonate the server, or decrypt sensitive data.
- **Affected Component:** Configuration Management System, Deployment Scripts *of the Bitwarden server*.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - **Developers:**
    - Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files.
    - Utilize secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, environment variables).
    - Ensure proper file permissions are set on configuration files.
    - Implement secure deployment practices to prevent accidental exposure.
    - Regularly review and audit configuration file security.
  - **Users (Deployers):**
    - Secure the server file system and restrict access to configuration files *of the Bitwarden server*.
    - Regularly review file permissions.

## Threat: [Compromised Update Mechanism](./threats/compromised_update_mechanism.md)

- **Description:** An attacker compromises the update server or the update delivery process *for the Bitwarden server*, allowing them to distribute malicious updates to Bitwarden server instances.
- **Impact:** Critical. Malicious updates could introduce backdoors, steal data, or completely compromise the server. This could affect all instances that apply the malicious update.
- **Affected Component:** Update Client *within the Bitwarden server*, Update Server Infrastructure.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - **Developers:**
    - Implement strong security measures for the update server infrastructure.
    - Digitally sign update packages to ensure authenticity and integrity.
    - Use HTTPS for all update communication.
    - Implement a rollback mechanism for failed or malicious updates.
    - Thoroughly test updates before release.
  - **Users (Deployers):**
    - Monitor for unexpected updates or changes.
    - Consider manual update procedures in highly sensitive environments.
