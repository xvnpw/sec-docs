# Attack Surface Analysis for bitwarden/server

## Attack Surface: [Weak Encryption at Rest for Vault Data](./attack_surfaces/weak_encryption_at_rest_for_vault_data.md)

**Description:** The encryption applied to the vault data stored in the database might be weak, outdated, or improperly implemented.

**How Server Contributes:** The Bitwarden server is responsible for implementing the encryption at rest mechanism. Vulnerabilities in the encryption algorithms chosen, key management practices, or implementation flaws can weaken this protection.

**Example:** An attacker gains read access to the database files. If the encryption algorithm used is outdated (e.g., a deprecated cipher) or the encryption keys are stored insecurely alongside the data, the attacker could decrypt the vault data offline.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of all stored passwords and sensitive information.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Implement strong, industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
    * Implement secure key management practices, such as using dedicated key management systems or hardware security modules (HSMs).
    * Regularly review and update encryption libraries and implementations.
* **Users:**
    * Ensure the underlying infrastructure (database server) is securely configured and access is restricted.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Key Derivation Function (KDF) for Master Password](./attack_surfaces/insecure_key_derivation_function__kdf__for_master_password.md)

**Description:** The process used to derive the encryption key from the user's master password might be susceptible to brute-force or dictionary attacks.

**How Server Contributes:** The server implements the KDF used during user registration and login. Weak or improperly configured KDFs reduce the computational cost for attackers trying to guess master passwords.

**Example:** An attacker obtains a copy of the user database (even if encrypted at rest). If the KDF used is weak (e.g., insufficient iterations or a weak hashing algorithm), the attacker can perform offline brute-force attacks on the master password hashes more efficiently.

**Impact:** Compromise of individual user vaults, potentially leading to widespread credential theft.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Utilize strong and well-vetted KDFs like Argon2id with recommended parameters (sufficient memory cost, time cost, and parallelism).
    * Ensure the KDF parameters are regularly reviewed and updated based on security best practices.
* **Users:**
    * Encourage users to choose strong, unique master passwords.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_api_endpoints.md)

**Description:** Security flaws exist in the custom API endpoints developed specifically for the Bitwarden server.

**How Server Contributes:** The server code defines and implements these API endpoints. Bugs, logic errors, or insufficient security considerations during development introduce vulnerabilities.

**Example:** An API endpoint responsible for sharing vault items lacks proper authorization checks, allowing a malicious user to access items they shouldn't. Another endpoint might be vulnerable to injection attacks due to insufficient input sanitization.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to vault data, modification of user settings, or potential server-side command execution depending on the vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all API endpoints.
    * Enforce strict authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API requests.
    * Conduct regular security code reviews and penetration testing of the API.
    * Follow secure coding practices throughout the development lifecycle.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of Server-Side Secrets](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_server-side_secrets.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information required for the server to operate (e.g., database credentials, API keys for external services) is stored insecurely.

**How Server Contributes:** The server's configuration and code determine how these secrets are stored and accessed. Storing them in plain text in configuration files or environment variables is insecure.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the server's file system or environment variables and finds the database password in plain text, allowing them to directly access the vault data.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the server and access to all stored data.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Utilize secure secret management solutions like HashiCorp Vault or cloud provider secret managers.
    * Avoid storing secrets directly in configuration files or environment variables.
    * Encrypt sensitive configuration data at rest.
* **Users:**
    * Ensure proper file system permissions are in place to restrict access to configuration files.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Security flaws exist in the external libraries and frameworks used by the Bitwarden server.

**How Server Contributes:** The server relies on these dependencies for various functionalities. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited if not properly managed and updated.

**Example:** A widely used library for handling web requests has a known vulnerability that allows for remote code execution. If the Bitwarden server uses this vulnerable version, an attacker could exploit it to gain control of the server.

**Impact:** Range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, denial of service, and data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk.
    * Keep all dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    * Implement a process for promptly addressing identified vulnerabilities.
* **Users:**
    * Ensure the server is running the latest stable version of Bitwarden, which typically includes updated dependencies.
