## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities leading to RCE](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_leading_to_rce.md)

* An attacker identifies a publicly known vulnerability (CVE) in the Bitwarden server software or its dependencies.
* They develop or find an existing exploit for this vulnerability.
* The exploit is used to execute arbitrary code on the Bitwarden server, granting the attacker significant control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities leading to Unauthorized Data Access](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_leading_to_unauthorized_data_access.md)

* An attacker identifies a publicly known vulnerability related to authentication or authorization.
* They exploit this vulnerability to bypass security controls and gain access to sensitive data without proper credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Administrative Access via Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/gain_administrative_access_via_default_credentials.md)

* The Bitwarden server is deployed with default administrative credentials that have not been changed.
* An attacker uses these default credentials to gain full administrative access to the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept Communication due to Insecure TLS](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_communication_due_to_insecure_tls.md)

* The Bitwarden server is configured with weak TLS settings (e.g., outdated protocols or weak ciphers).
* An attacker on the same network (or through a man-in-the-middle attack) can intercept and decrypt communication between the client application and the server, potentially revealing sensitive data like credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Exposed Services](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_exposed_services.md)

* The Bitwarden server has unnecessary or vulnerable services exposed on the network.
* Attackers can target these exposed services to gain unauthorized access or cause denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Files](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_files.md)

* Incorrect file permissions allow attackers to read sensitive files on the server's file system, potentially containing configuration details or other secrets.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Database Access leading to Read/Modify Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_database_access_leading_to_readmodify_sensitive_data.md)

* An attacker exploits a vulnerability like SQL injection in custom extensions or integrations, or a vulnerability in the underlying database server itself.
* This allows them to execute arbitrary SQL queries, enabling them to read or modify sensitive data within the Bitwarden database, including encrypted vaults and user information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Server Credentials with Database Access leading to Read/Modify Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_server_credentials_with_database_access_leading_to_readmodify_sensitive_data.md)

* An attacker compromises credentials that have access to the Bitwarden database. This could be through various means, including exploiting vulnerabilities or social engineering.
* Using these compromised credentials, the attacker directly accesses the database to read or modify sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tamper with Encrypted Vault Data](./attack_tree_paths/tamper_with_encrypted_vault_data.md)

* An attacker gains unauthorized access to the storage location of the encrypted vault data.
* They then directly modify the encrypted data, potentially corrupting it or introducing malicious entries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse API Endpoints for Data Exfiltration or Modification](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_api_endpoints_for_data_exfiltration_or_modification.md)

* The Bitwarden server's API has vulnerabilities such as insecure input validation or broken authentication/authorization.
* Attackers exploit these weaknesses to send malicious requests that allow them to extract sensitive data or modify existing data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Dependencies leading to RCE or Unauthorized Data Access](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_dependencies_leading_to_rce_or_unauthorized_data_access.md)

* Attackers identify a vulnerable dependency used by the Bitwarden server.
* They manage to introduce malicious code into this dependency (this is a highly sophisticated attack).
* When the Bitwarden server uses this compromised dependency, the malicious code is executed, potentially leading to remote code execution or unauthorized access to data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Build/Release Process leading to RCE or Unauthorized Data Access](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_buildrelease_process_leading_to_rce_or_unauthorized_data_access.md)

* Attackers gain access to the Bitwarden server's build or release pipeline.
* They inject malicious code into the software during the build or release process.
* When this compromised version of the server is deployed, the malicious code is executed, potentially leading to remote code execution or unauthorized access to data.
