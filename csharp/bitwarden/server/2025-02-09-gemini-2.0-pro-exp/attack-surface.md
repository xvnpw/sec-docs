# Attack Surface Analysis for bitwarden/server

## Attack Surface: [Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing Attacks (Login)](./attack_surfaces/brute-forcecredential_stuffing_attacks__login_.md)

*   **Description:** Attempting to guess user passwords by trying many combinations or using credentials leaked from other breaches.
*   **Server Contribution:** The `/api/accounts/login` endpoint is the target.  The server's authentication logic and rate limiting are crucial defenses.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses a list of common passwords or leaked credentials to repeatedly attempt login at the `/api/accounts/login` endpoint.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, leading to access to all stored secrets.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Enforce strong password complexity requirements.  Implement a robust, adaptive rate-limiting system that considers IP address, user agent, and other factors.  Use a strong Key Derivation Function (KDF) with a high iteration count (configurable by the user).  Monitor for suspicious login patterns.  Consider offering account lockout after multiple failed attempts (with a secure unlock mechanism). Implement robust protection against timing attacks.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious SQL code into database queries through input fields.
*   **Server Contribution:** Any endpoint that interacts with the database is a potential target.  The server's use of an ORM (Entity Framework) is a primary defense, but vulnerabilities in the ORM or custom SQL queries are critical.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious input for a search field that, if not properly sanitized, modifies the underlying SQL query to extract data or modify the database.
*   **Impact:** Complete database compromise, including data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.  Potentially, server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Strictly adhere to secure coding practices for database interactions.  Use parameterized queries or the ORM's built-in sanitization mechanisms *exclusively*.  Avoid dynamic SQL generation.  Regularly audit code for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.  Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules to detect and block SQL injection attempts.  Keep the ORM and database server software up-to-date.

## Attack Surface: [Data Exfiltration (Cipher Access)](./attack_surfaces/data_exfiltration__cipher_access_.md)

*   **Description:** Gaining unauthorized access to encrypted vault data (ciphers).
*   **Server Contribution:** The `/api/ciphers` and related endpoints are the targets.  Authentication and authorization mechanisms are critical.
*   **Example:** An attacker bypasses authentication and directly accesses the `/api/ciphers` endpoint to retrieve all ciphers for a user.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of encrypted vault data.  While still encrypted, this is a major breach and could lead to decryption if the attacker obtains the user's master password.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Rigorously enforce authentication and authorization for all cipher-related endpoints.  Ensure that users can only access their own ciphers (or those explicitly shared with them).  Implement robust session management to prevent session hijacking.  Regularly audit access control logic.

## Attack Surface: [Privilege Escalation (Organization Management)](./attack_surfaces/privilege_escalation__organization_management_.md)

*   **Description:** Gaining higher privileges within an organization than authorized.
*   **Server Contribution:** Vulnerabilities in the `/api/organizations`, `/api/collections`, and related endpoints could allow attackers to manipulate roles, permissions, or group memberships.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability to grant themselves administrative privileges within an organization, gaining access to all shared data.
*   **Impact:** Access to sensitive organization data, control over other users' accounts, and potential compromise of the entire organization.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict role-based access control (RBAC) for all organization-related endpoints.  Ensure that users can only perform actions permitted by their assigned roles.  Thoroughly validate all input related to user roles and permissions.  Regularly audit the organization management code for vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Attachment Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/attachment_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting weaknesses in how the server handles file attachments.
*   **Server Contribution:** The `/attachments/{cipherId}/{attachmentId}` endpoint and the server's file storage and retrieval mechanisms.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious file disguised as a legitimate attachment, exploiting a path traversal vulnerability to overwrite system files.
*   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict file type validation, allowing only specific, safe file types.  Store attachments in a secure location outside the web root, with appropriate access controls.  Use a unique, randomly generated filename for each attachment.  Scan uploaded files for malware.  Implement size limits for attachments. Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal attacks.
