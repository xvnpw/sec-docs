# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for bitwarden/server

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Queries and ORM Enforcement](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_queries_and_orm_enforcement.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce the exclusive use of parameterized queries (provided by the ORM, Entity Framework Core) for all database interactions on the server.  Prohibit any direct string concatenation or interpolation when constructing SQL queries within the server's code.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Code Review Policy (Server-Side):** Establish a mandatory code review policy for all server-side code that specifically checks for any instances of raw SQL query construction using string manipulation.
    2.  **Static Analysis (Server-Side):** Integrate a static analysis tool (e.g., Roslyn analyzers for C#) into the server's build pipeline. Configure the tool to flag any server-side code that builds SQL queries using string concatenation or interpolation.
    3.  **Training (Server-Side Developers):** Provide server-side developers with training on secure coding practices, emphasizing the dangers of SQL injection and the correct usage of parameterized queries with the ORM.
    4.  **ORM Usage (Server-Side):**  Utilize the Entity Framework Core's features for building queries (e.g., LINQ to Entities) which inherently use parameterized queries.  Avoid `FromSqlRaw` or `ExecuteSqlRaw` on the server unless absolutely necessary, and if used, ensure parameters are *always* used.
    5.  **Documentation (Server-Side):**  Clearly document the policy against raw SQL construction and the proper use of the ORM in the project's server-side coding standards.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (Critical):**  Prevents attackers from injecting malicious SQL code into database queries executed by the server, which could lead to data breaches, data modification, or even server compromise.
    *   **Data Exposure (Critical):**  Reduces the risk of unintended data exposure through error messages or manipulated queries on the server.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:**  Risk reduction: Very High (near elimination if implemented comprehensively on the server).
    *   **Data Exposure:** Risk reduction: High.

*   **Currently Implemented (Educated Guess):**  Likely implemented to a large extent on the server. Bitwarden uses Entity Framework Core, which encourages parameterized queries.  However, thorough code review and static analysis are crucial to ensure *consistent* enforcement on the server.

*   **Missing Implementation (Educated Guess):**  Potential areas for improvement on the server:
    *   **Comprehensive Static Analysis (Server-Side):**  Ensuring *all* server-side code paths are covered by static analysis rules.
    *   **Strict Policy Enforcement (Server-Side):**  A formal, documented policy with automated checks and mandatory code reviews for server code.
    *   **Auditing of `FromSqlRaw`/`ExecuteSqlRaw` Usage (Server-Side):**  If these methods are used *anywhere* on the server, they need extremely rigorous auditing and justification.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization (API Layer - Server-Side)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization__api_layer_-_server-side_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization at the server's API layer for *all* incoming data, before it's processed or passed to any other part of the server application.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Input Schemas (Server-Side):**  For each API endpoint on the server, define a clear schema that specifies the expected data types, formats, lengths, and allowed values for each input parameter.
    2.  **Validation Library (Server-Side):** Use a robust validation library (e.g., FluentValidation for .NET) on the server to enforce the defined schemas.
    3.  **Whitelist Approach (Server-Side):**  Prefer a whitelist approach to validation on the server, where only explicitly allowed values are accepted.
    4.  **Data Type Validation (Server-Side):**  Validate that data conforms to the expected data type on the server.
    5.  **Length Restrictions (Server-Side):**  Enforce appropriate length restrictions on string inputs on the server.
    6.  **Format Validation (Server-Side):**  Validate the format of specific data types on the server.
    7.  **Sanitization (Server-Side):** If necessary, sanitize input data on the server. *Validation* is generally preferred. Sanitization should be context-specific.
    8.  **Error Handling (Server-Side):**  Provide clear and informative error messages to the client when validation fails on the server, but *avoid* revealing sensitive information.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High):** Prevents malicious scripts from being injected through API requests (if API output is rendered in a web UI). This is relevant if the server generates any HTML.
    *   **SQL Injection (Medium):**  Provides an additional layer of defense against SQL injection on the server.
    *   **NoSQL Injection (Medium):** If any NoSQL databases are used by the server, this helps prevent injection.
    *   **Command Injection (High):**  Prevents attackers from injecting operating system commands through API requests to the server.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium):**  Length restrictions and format validation on the server can help prevent some DoS attacks.
    *   **Business Logic Attacks (Medium):**  Validating input against expected business rules on the server can prevent exploitation of flaws.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS, Command Injection:** Risk reduction: High.
    *   **SQL Injection, NoSQL Injection:** Risk reduction: Medium (secondary defense).
    *   **DoS, Business Logic Attacks:** Risk reduction: Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented (Educated Guess):**  Likely implemented to some degree on the server. Modern API frameworks often provide built-in validation.

*   **Missing Implementation (Educated Guess):**
    *   **Comprehensive Schema Definition (Server-Side):**  Ensuring *every* server API endpoint has a clearly defined and enforced input schema.
    *   **Centralized Validation Logic (Server-Side):**  Using a consistent validation library and approach across the entire server API.
    *   **Regular Review of Validation Rules (Server-Side):**  Periodically reviewing and updating validation rules on the server.
