Okay, let's create a design document for the Bitwarden server project, focusing on aspects relevant to threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Bitwarden is an established open-source password management service.  The server component is critical for both individual users and enterprise customers.  The primary business goals are:

*   Provide a secure and reliable password management solution.
*   Maintain user trust and confidence in the platform's security.
*   Support both individual and enterprise use cases with appropriate features and scalability.
*   Enable self-hosting for users who prefer to manage their own infrastructure.
*   Continuously improve the security and functionality of the platform.

Key business priorities:

*   Data Confidentiality:  Protecting user credentials and other sensitive data is paramount.  A breach would be catastrophic to the business.
*   Data Integrity:  Ensuring that user data is not tampered with or corrupted is crucial.
*   Service Availability:  The service must be highly available to meet user needs.
*   Compliance:  Meeting relevant regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2) is essential, especially for enterprise customers.
*   Reputation: Maintaining a strong security reputation is vital for continued growth and user trust.

Most important business risks:

*   Compromise of user credentials due to server-side vulnerabilities.
*   Data loss or corruption due to infrastructure failures or attacks.
*   Denial of service attacks impacting service availability.
*   Reputational damage resulting from security incidents.
*   Failure to meet compliance requirements, leading to legal and financial penalties.
*   Supply chain attacks targeting the build and deployment pipeline.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls (based on the GitHub repository and general knowledge of Bitwarden):

*   security control: End-to-end encryption: User data is encrypted client-side before being sent to the server. The server never has access to the unencrypted data. Implemented in client applications.
*   security control: Secure password hashing:  Uses industry-standard algorithms like Argon2id for password hashing. Implemented in server code.
*   security control: Two-factor authentication (2FA):  Supports various 2FA methods to enhance account security. Implemented in server and client applications.
*   security control: Rate limiting:  Protects against brute-force attacks. Implemented in server code and potentially at the infrastructure level.
*   security control: Regular security audits and penetration testing:  Bitwarden undergoes regular security assessments. Described in security documentation and reports.
*   security control: Open-source codebase:  Allows for community review and scrutiny. Publicly available on GitHub.
*   security control: Bug bounty program:  Encourages responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities. Described in security documentation.
*   security control: HTTPS: Enforces encrypted communication between clients and the server. Implemented at the infrastructure level (e.g., load balancer, reverse proxy).
*   security control: Input validation: Server-side validation of user inputs to prevent injection attacks. Implemented in server code.
*   security control: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection: Implemented in server code.
*   security control: Content Security Policy (CSP): Implemented in server code and delivered via HTTP headers.
*   security control: Use of secure coding practices and frameworks: The project uses ASP.NET Core, which provides built-in security features. Implemented in server code.

Accepted risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on client-side security: The security model heavily relies on the security of the client applications. A compromise of the client could expose user data even if the server is secure.
*   accepted risk: Potential for zero-day vulnerabilities:  Like any software, Bitwarden is susceptible to unknown vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: User error:  Weak passwords, phishing attacks, and other user-related security lapses can compromise accounts.
*   accepted risk: Self-hosting risks: Users who self-host are responsible for securing their own infrastructure.

Recommended security controls:

*   Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) for included JavaScript libraries to mitigate supply chain risks.
*   Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents.
*   Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of potential breaches.
*   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support strong password policies (length, complexity).
    *   Enforce 2FA for all users (or provide strong recommendations).
    *   Protect against brute-force and credential stuffing attacks.
    *   Securely store and manage user authentication tokens.
    *   Implement secure session management.

*   Authorization:
    *   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for enterprise features.
    *   Ensure that users can only access their own data.
    *   Enforce least privilege principles.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Validate all user inputs on the server-side.
    *   Sanitize data to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
    *   Protect against SQL injection and other injection vulnerabilities.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use strong, industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256, RSA).
    *   Securely manage cryptographic keys.
    *   Use secure random number generators.
    *   Regularly review and update cryptographic implementations.

## BUILD

The Bitwarden server project uses a combination of build tools and scripts, primarily within the .NET ecosystem. The build process is automated and can be executed locally or within a CI/CD environment.

1.  **Source Code:** Developers work on the codebase, committing changes to the Git repository (GitHub).
2.  **Build Trigger:** A build is triggered manually or automatically (e.g., on commit, on tag).
3.  **Dependency Resolution:** NuGet is used to manage .NET dependencies.
4.  **Compilation:** The .NET SDK compiles the source code into intermediate language (IL) assemblies.
5.  **Testing:** Unit tests and integration tests are executed.
6.  **Packaging:** The compiled code and dependencies are packaged into Docker images.
7.  **Publishing:** Docker images are pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Azure Container Registry).

    buildserver -- "Packages into Docker images" --> docker["Docker"]
    docker -- "Pushes images" --> registry["Container Registry (e.g., Docker Hub)"]

```

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): SAST tools can be integrated into the build process to identify potential vulnerabilities in the source code.
*   security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA): SCA tools can be used to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Code signing:  Build artifacts (e.g., Docker images) can be signed to ensure their integrity and authenticity.
*   security control: Build server hardening: The build server itself should be secured to prevent unauthorized access and tampering.
*   security control: Least privilege: Build processes should run with the minimum necessary privileges.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   User authentication and authorization.
*   Secure storage and retrieval of encrypted user data.
*   Management of organizations and collections (for enterprise users).
*   Delivery of push notifications.
*   Email notifications.

Data Sensitivity:

*   User credentials (encrypted): Highest sensitivity.  Even though encrypted, a compromise could lead to attempts to decrypt the data.
*   User vault data (encrypted): Highest sensitivity.  Contains all the user's sensitive information.
*   Organization data (encrypted): High sensitivity.  Contains information about organizations and their members.
*   Email addresses: Medium sensitivity.  Used for communication and account recovery.
*   IP addresses: Low sensitivity.  Used for logging and rate limiting.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2) does Bitwarden need to meet?
*   What is the target threat model for self-hosted deployments? (e.g., sophisticated nation-state actors, opportunistic attackers)
*   What are the specific performance and scalability requirements for the server?
*   What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities discovered in third-party dependencies?
*   Are there any specific hardware security requirements (e.g., HSMs)?
*   What is the disaster recovery plan for the Bitwarden server?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: Bitwarden prioritizes security above all else.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The existing security controls described in the documentation are implemented correctly.
*   DESIGN: The provided design diagrams are a reasonable representation of the actual system architecture. The system uses Docker and docker-compose for deployments. Client applications handle encryption/decryption.
