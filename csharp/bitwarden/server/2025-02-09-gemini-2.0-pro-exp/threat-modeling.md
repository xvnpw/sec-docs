# Threat Model Analysis for bitwarden/server

## Threat: [Rogue Bitwarden Server](./threats/rogue_bitwarden_server.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sets up a fake Bitwarden server using techniques like DNS poisoning, ARP spoofing, or compromising a network device. The attacker's server presents a valid-looking (but attacker-controlled) TLS certificate.  This allows the attacker to intercept traffic intended for the legitimate server.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of user credentials and potential access to encrypted vault data (which the attacker *cannot* decrypt without the master password, but could hold hostage or corrupt).
*   **Affected Component:** Entire server infrastructure; specifically, the TLS termination point and any network-facing components.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong TLS (TLS 1.3 only, with strong ciphers and forward secrecy).
    *   Use HSTS with a long `max-age`.
    *   Regularly audit TLS configuration.

## Threat: [User Impersonation (Credential Stuffing/Brute Force) - *Server-Side Impact*](./threats/user_impersonation__credential_stuffingbrute_force__-_server-side_impact.md)

*   **Description:** While initiated by an attacker against a user, the *server* is the component that must defend against successful impersonation. An attacker uses stolen credentials or brute-force attacks to guess a user's master password or bypass 2FA *on the server*.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to a user's Bitwarden vault, leading to the compromise of all stored secrets.
*   **Affected Component:** Authentication module (`IdentityServer` project, specifically authentication endpoints and related logic).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict, adaptive rate limiting on login attempts (both IP-based and account-based).
    *   Lock accounts after a small number of failed login attempts.
    *   Use Argon2id with appropriate parameters for password hashing.
    *   Ensure 2FA cannot be easily bypassed (e.g., through password reset flows) *on the server*. The server must correctly validate 2FA.

## Threat: [Server Code Modification](./threats/server_code_modification.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the server's filesystem (e.g., through a vulnerability in a dependency, a misconfigured server, or a compromised administrator account) and modifies the server's code to introduce a backdoor or weaken security.
*   **Impact:** Complete control over the server, allowing the attacker to steal data, modify user vaults, or disrupt service.
*   **Affected Component:** All server components are potentially vulnerable.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use containerization (Docker) with minimal privileges. Deploy on a hardened operating system.
    *   File Integrity Monitoring (FIM): Monitor critical files and directories for changes.
    *   Implement a secure update process and keep all software up-to-date.
    *   Run the server process with the lowest possible privileges.
    *   Digitally sign releases to verify integrity.

## Threat: [Vault Data Corruption](./threats/vault_data_corruption.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains write access to the database and modifies or deletes encrypted vault data. While they cannot decrypt the data, they can cause data loss or denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Loss of user vault data, potentially causing significant disruption and damage.
*   **Affected Component:** Database interaction layer (`SqlServerDataContext`, `PostgreSqlDataContext`, etc., and related database access code).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strong database passwords, restricted network access, encryption at rest.
    *   Implement checksums or other integrity checks on stored vault data *within the server code*. This is *essential*.
    *   Encrypted, secure, and regularly tested backups.
    *   Grant the Bitwarden server application only the necessary permissions to the database (read, write, but *not* schema modification).

## Threat: [In-Transit Data Tampering (Post-Decryption/Pre-Encryption)](./threats/in-transit_data_tampering__post-decryptionpre-encryption_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the server process itself (e.g., through a memory corruption vulnerability) and modifies data *after* TLS decryption or *before* TLS encryption. This is a very sophisticated attack.
*   **Impact:** Potential leakage or modification of sensitive data, even with TLS in place.
*   **Affected Component:** Any component handling sensitive data in memory (e.g., API controllers, data access layers).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use memory-safe languages (like Rust) where possible, or employ robust memory protection techniques (ASLR, DEP/NX).
    *   Rigorous input validation *before* any processing.
    *   Security Audits: Focus on identifying memory corruption vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion](./threats/resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests to the server, consuming its resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and making it unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** Service outage, preventing users from accessing their vaults.
*   **Affected Component:** All server components, particularly API endpoints.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints.
    *   Configure resource limits for the server process.
    *   Use a DDoS protection service.
    *   Distribute traffic across multiple server instances using a load balancer.
    *   Optimize code for performance and resource usage.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation Vulnerability](./threats/privilege_escalation_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability (e.g., a buffer overflow, command injection, or a logic flaw) to gain higher privileges on the server (e.g., escalating from a regular user to an administrator, or from the application user to root).
*   **Impact:** Complete control over the server, allowing the attacker to access all data and potentially compromise the entire system.
*   **Affected Component:** Any component that handles user input or performs privileged operations.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Run the server with minimal privileges.
    *   Follow secure coding guidelines to prevent common vulnerabilities.
    *   Strictly validate all user input.
    *   Conduct code reviews and penetration testing.
    *   Implement role-based access control to limit user permissions *within the server application*.
