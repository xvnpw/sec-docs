## Attack Tree Path: [1. Gain Unauthorized Access/Control of User Secrets {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/1__gain_unauthorized_accesscontrol_of_user_secrets_{critical}.md)

*   **Description:** This is the overarching objective of a malicious actor targeting a Bitwarden instance. It represents the complete compromise of the system's primary purpose: protecting user secrets.
*   **Impact:** Catastrophic. Loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data. Severe reputational damage, potential legal and financial consequences.
*    **Why Critical:** This is the ultimate failure state for a password manager.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Compromise Server Infrastructure/Hosting:](./attack_tree_paths/2__compromise_server_infrastructurehosting.md)

*   **2.a. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **Description:** Attackers target known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries, frameworks, or the operating system used by the Bitwarden server. This is a common attack vector because dependencies are often less scrutinized than the core application code.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Dependencies are a common attack vector, but regular patching reduces this)
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Could lead to full server compromise, allowing access to the database and all user data)
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires finding and exploiting a vulnerability; exploit availability varies)
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High (Requires vulnerability research and exploit development skills, or the ability to use existing exploits)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Good logging and intrusion detection can help, but zero-days are harder; vulnerability scanners can detect known issues)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement a robust vulnerability scanning and patching process for *all* server components.
        *   Use a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool.
        *   Prioritize patching based on severity and exploitability.
        *   Regularly update all dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Authentication Bypass/Weaknesses [HIGH RISK] {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/3__authentication_bypassweaknesses__high_risk__{critical}.md)

*   **Description:** This category encompasses all attacks that aim to circumvent the authentication mechanisms protecting the Bitwarden server.  Successful authentication bypass grants the attacker access as if they were a legitimate user.
*   **Impact:** Very High (Direct access to user data and administrative functions)
*   **Why Critical:** Authentication is the primary defense against unauthorized access.  Bypassing it is a direct path to the attacker's goal.

    *   **3.a. Exploit 2FA Bypass Mechanisms:**
        *   **Description:** Attackers attempt to bypass two-factor authentication through flaws in its implementation (e.g., improper validation, timing attacks, replay attacks).
        *   **Mitigation:** Thoroughly test 2FA implementation, including edge cases. Ensure codes cannot be reused. Implement robust rate-limiting. Consider a dedicated 2FA library.

    *   **3.b. Session Hijacking/Fixation:**
        *   **Description:** Attackers steal a valid user session or force a user to use a known session ID, allowing them to impersonate the user.
        *   **Mitigation:** Use strong, randomly generated session IDs. Implement HSTS. Use secure, HTTP-only cookies. Invalidate sessions on logout and inactivity. Consider session binding (with privacy considerations).

    *   **3.c. Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** Attackers try to guess passwords (brute-force) or use credentials leaked from other breaches (credential stuffing).
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (Common and automated attack)
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Depends on success rate and value of compromised accounts)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Can be easily automated)
        *   **Skill Level:** Low (Many automated tools available)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium (Rate limiting and account lockouts should trigger alerts)
        *   **Mitigation:** Enforce strong password policies. Implement robust rate limiting and account lockouts. Monitor for suspicious login activity. Consider integrating with "Have I Been Pwned."

    *   **3.d. Exploit Rate Limiting Weaknesses:**
        *   **Description:** Attackers find ways to bypass or circumvent rate limits, enabling them to perform brute-force attacks more effectively.
        *   **Mitigation:** Test rate-limiting thoroughly. Use a tiered approach. Use CAPTCHAs.

    *   **3.e. Exploit Account Recovery Flaws:**
        *   **Description:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in the account recovery process (e.g., predictable security questions, weak reset tokens) to take over accounts.
        *   **Mitigation:** Use strong, unpredictable security questions. Implement multi-factor authentication for account recovery. Use time-limited, cryptographically secure reset tokens. Send notifications to the primary email.

    *   **3.f. Exploit Email Verification Flaws:**
        *   **Description:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in email verification to create accounts with unverified emails or hijack existing accounts.
        *   **Mitigation:** Ensure verification links are unique, time-limited, and cryptographically secure. Prevent account activation until verified.

    *   **3.g. Exploit Organization Management Flaws:**
        *   **Description:** If organization features are used, attackers exploit vulnerabilities in user management, role assignment, or sharing to gain unauthorized access.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust access controls and permissions. Regularly audit roles and permissions. Implement strong authentication/authorization for organization administrators.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Direct Database Access {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/4__direct_database_access_{critical}.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain direct access to the database server, bypassing application-level security controls. This could be through a compromised server, weak database credentials, or a network misconfiguration.
*   **Impact:** Very High (Direct access to all stored, potentially unencrypted, user data)
*   **Why Critical:** This bypasses all application-level security and provides complete access to the sensitive data.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Use strong, unique passwords for the database user.
    *   Restrict database access to only necessary application servers (network segmentation).
    *   Implement database auditing and monitoring.
    *   Consider database encryption at rest and in transit.
    *   Use the principle of least privilege for database user accounts.
    *   Regularly review and update firewall rules.
