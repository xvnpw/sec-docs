# Threat Model Analysis for bitwarden/server

## Threat: [Compromise of the Identity Server](./threats/compromise_of_the_identity_server.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Identity Server through vulnerabilities in **its code**, dependencies, or misconfigurations within the Bitwarden server's Identity module. This allows them to bypass authentication for any user.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Bitwarden instance. Attackers can access all vaults, modify data, create new users, and potentially lock out legitimate users.

**Affected Component:** Identity Server Module (within the Bitwarden server).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Regularly patch the Identity Server component and its direct dependencies. Implement strong access controls within the Identity Server module. Enforce multi-factor authentication for administrative access to the server. Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing focusing on the authentication mechanisms.

## Threat: [Exposure of Master Encryption Key](./threats/exposure_of_master_encryption_key.md)

**Description:** The master encryption key, used to protect vault data, is exposed due to insecure storage or vulnerabilities in **Bitwarden's key management processes or code**. An attacker gaining access to this key can decrypt all stored vault data.

**Impact:** Complete data breach. All stored passwords, notes, and other sensitive information become accessible to the attacker.

**Affected Component:** Key Management System/Configuration (within the Bitwarden server codebase).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**  Use secure key storage mechanisms as implemented by Bitwarden. Implement strict access controls to the key storage within the server. Regularly rotate encryption keys as supported by the server. Avoid storing the key directly in easily accessible configuration files within the server deployment.

## Threat: [Direct Database Access and Exploitation (via Bitwarden Vulnerability)](./threats/direct_database_access_and_exploitation__via_bitwarden_vulnerability_.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability **within the Bitwarden server's code** that allows them to bypass the application layer and directly interact with the underlying database. This could be through SQL injection flaws in custom queries or insecure database connection handling within the server.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, denial of service. Attackers can access, modify, or delete vault data. They could also potentially compromise the integrity of the Bitwarden instance.

**Affected Component:** Data Access Layer, API Endpoints interacting with the database (within the Bitwarden server).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**  Implement secure coding practices to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions. Regularly audit database access logic within the server code. Enforce least privilege for database access from the application.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries (Directly Used by Bitwarden Server)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_libraries__directly_used_by_bitwarden_server_.md)

**Description:** The Bitwarden server relies on various third-party libraries **directly included in its codebase**. Unpatched vulnerabilities in these libraries can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code within the server's context, or cause denial of service.

**Impact:**  Range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, from information disclosure and code execution to denial of service within the Bitwarden server.

**Affected Component:** All server components utilizing vulnerable third-party libraries.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:** Maintain an up-to-date list of dependencies used by the Bitwarden server. Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to identify known vulnerabilities in these dependencies. Have a process for promptly patching or updating vulnerable dependencies.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Attachments](./threats/insecure_handling_of_attachments.md)

**Description:** If the Bitwarden server allows file attachments, vulnerabilities **in its code** related to how these are stored, scanned, or served could allow attackers to upload malware that could execute on the server, bypass security checks, or access attachments they are not authorized to view.

**Impact:** Malware distribution, information disclosure, potential server compromise.

**Affected Component:** Attachment Handling Module, API Endpoints for file uploads/downloads (within the Bitwarden server).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement robust malware scanning for uploaded files within the server. Store attachments in a secure location with restricted access enforced by the server. Enforce file size and type restrictions within the server's logic. Sanitize file names and metadata within the server.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the Admin Panel](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the_admin_panel.md)

**Description:** Exploits **within the Bitwarden server's admin panel code** could allow unauthorized users to gain control of the server, manage users, modify settings, or access sensitive information.

**Impact:** Complete server compromise, unauthorized access to all data and functionalities.

**Affected Component:** Admin Panel Module (within the Bitwarden server).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for the admin panel within the server's code. Restrict access to the admin panel based on roles and permissions within the server. Regularly patch the admin panel code and its dependencies. Conduct security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting the admin panel functionality.
