# Attack Surface Analysis for bitwarden/server

## Attack Surface: [Weak Password Reset Mechanism](./attack_surfaces/weak_password_reset_mechanism.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Weak Password Reset Mechanism**
    *   **Description:** Flaws in the password reset process allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
    *   **How Server Contributes:** The server implements and manages the password reset workflow, including email verification, security questions, or recovery codes. Vulnerabilities in this implementation are direct server contributions.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could exploit a predictable password reset token generation algorithm or bypass email verification to reset a user's password.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of user accounts, access to stored credentials, potential data exfiltration, and unauthorized actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement strong, unpredictable, and time-limited password reset tokens.
            *   Enforce robust email verification processes.
            *   Consider multi-factor authentication for password resets.
            *   Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed reset attempts.
            *   Avoid exposing sensitive information in password reset emails.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Attack Surface: API Authentication and Authorization Bypass**
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the server's API authentication or authorization mechanisms allow unauthorized access to API endpoints and data.
    *   **How Server Contributes:** The server defines and enforces the authentication and authorization rules for its API. Flaws in these rules or their implementation are server-specific.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could exploit a missing authorization check on an API endpoint to retrieve another user's vault data or modify server settings.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential data breaches, manipulation of server configurations, and disruption of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0).
            *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for API access.
            *   Thoroughly validate all API requests and parameters.
            *   Regularly audit API endpoints and access controls.
            *   Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Key Derivation Function (KDF)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_key_derivation_function__kdf_.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Insecure Key Derivation Function (KDF)**
    *   **Description:** A weak KDF used to derive encryption keys from the user's master password makes it easier for attackers to crack passwords through offline attacks.
    *   **How Server Contributes:** The server dictates the KDF used and its parameters (iterations, salt). A weak choice directly contributes to this attack surface.
    *   **Example:** If the server uses a KDF with a low iteration count, an attacker who obtains the encrypted vault data can more easily brute-force master passwords.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of all stored credentials if the master password is compromised.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Use strong and industry-standard KDFs like Argon2id with sufficiently high iteration counts and salt lengths.
            *   Regularly review and update KDF parameters based on security best practices.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data**
    *   **Description:** Sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or encryption secrets are exposed through insecure configuration practices.
    *   **How Server Contributes:** The server relies on configuration files or environment variables. Improper handling or storage of these contributes to the attack surface.
    *   **Example:** Database credentials stored in plain text in a publicly accessible configuration file or exposed through server information disclosure.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server and its data, including access to the database and the ability to decrypt stored vaults.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Store sensitive configuration data securely using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions.
            *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in code or configuration files.
            *   Implement strict access controls on configuration files.
            *   Regularly audit configuration settings for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_dependencies.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Dependencies**
    *   **Description:** Security flaws in libraries or frameworks used by the Bitwarden server can be exploited to compromise the application.
    *   **How Server Contributes:** The server integrates and relies on these dependencies. Failing to manage and update them introduces vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability in a web framework used by the server could allow for remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, from denial-of-service to remote code execution and data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Maintain a comprehensive Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for all dependencies.
            *   Implement automated dependency scanning and vulnerability monitoring.
            *   Apply security patches and updates to dependencies promptly.
            *   Follow secure coding practices to minimize the impact of dependency vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of File Attachments](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_file_attachments.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Insecure Handling of File Attachments**
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how the server handles file attachments can lead to various attacks, such as path traversal or malware hosting.
    *   **How Server Contributes:** The server manages the upload, storage, and retrieval of file attachments. Flaws in these processes are server-specific.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could upload a malicious file that, when accessed, executes code on the server or compromises user devices.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for malware distribution, server compromise, and data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for uploaded files.
            *   Store attachments outside the web root to prevent direct access.
            *   Use content security policies (CSP) to restrict the execution of scripts from untrusted sources.
            *   Implement antivirus scanning for uploaded files.
