## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit API Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_api_vulnerabilities.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit API Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Critical Node: Authentication Bypass:** Attackers exploit flaws in the authentication mechanisms, such as weak JWT validation or insecure session management, to gain unauthorized access to API endpoints without proper credentials. This allows them to bypass security controls and potentially access sensitive data directly.
    * **Critical Node: Authorization Flaws:** Attackers leverage vulnerabilities like Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) or privilege escalation flaws to access resources or perform actions that they are not authorized to. This can lead to accessing secrets belonging to other users or organizations.
    * **Critical Node: Exploit Input Validation Issues:** Attackers inject malicious code or commands through API inputs that are not properly validated. This can lead to command injection, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the server, or SQL injection (though less likely in the core Bitwarden project), enabling them to manipulate or extract data from the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Critical Node: Vulnerable Libraries or Frameworks:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or frameworks used by the Bitwarden server. This often involves leveraging publicly disclosed Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) to gain remote code execution or access sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/default_credentials.md)

**High-Risk Path: Default Credentials:**
    * **Critical Node: Default Credentials (for admin panel or database):** Attackers attempt to log in using default usernames and passwords that were not changed after installation. Successful login grants them administrative access to the server, allowing them to modify configurations, access secrets, or potentially compromise the entire system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Network Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_network_configuration.md)

**High-Risk Path: Insecure Network Configuration:**
    * **Critical Node: Exposed Admin Panel without proper authentication:** Attackers can access the administrative interface of the Bitwarden server over the network without proper authentication. This allows them to gain full administrative control over the server and its data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Direct Database Access](./attack_tree_paths/direct_database_access.md)

**Critical Node: Direct Database Access:** If the database server is exposed without proper network restrictions or if default database credentials are used, attackers can directly connect to the database, bypassing application logic and accessing sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SQL Injection](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sql_injection.md)

**Critical Node: Exploit SQL Injection:** If custom SQL queries are used without proper sanitization or if vulnerabilities exist in database interaction layers, attackers can inject malicious SQL code to extract sensitive data or manipulate database records.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak Encryption Algorithms or Implementation Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_encryption_algorithms_or_implementation_flaws.md)

**Critical Node: Exploit Weak Encryption Algorithms or Implementation Flaws:** Attackers exploit the use of weak or outdated encryption algorithms or flaws in their implementation to decrypt stored secrets.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Key Management Issues](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_key_management_issues.md)

**Critical Node: Exploit Key Management Issues:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in how encryption keys are stored, generated, or managed. This could involve insecure key storage locations or predictable key generation methods, allowing them to obtain the keys needed to decrypt sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Master Key](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_master_key.md)

**Critical Node: Compromise Master Key:** If attackers can gain access to the storage location of the master encryption key, they can decrypt all stored secrets within the Bitwarden vault.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Key Derivation Function Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_key_derivation_function_weaknesses.md)

**Critical Node: Exploit Key Derivation Function Weaknesses:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in the key derivation function used to generate encryption keys from user passwords. This could potentially allow them to brute-force user passwords or derive encryption keys.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Build Process or Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_build_process_or_dependencies.md)

**Critical Node: Compromise Build Process or Dependencies:** Attackers compromise the software supply chain by injecting malicious code into the Bitwarden server's build process or its dependencies. This can result in a backdoored server that allows persistent access and data exfiltration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Obtain Administrator Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/obtain_administrator_credentials.md)

**Critical Node: Obtain Administrator Credentials:** Attackers use social engineering tactics, such as phishing emails or impersonation, to trick administrators into revealing their login credentials. This grants the attacker full control over the Bitwarden server and its data.
