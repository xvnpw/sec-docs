## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Bitwarden Server Software Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_bitwarden_server_software_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Leveraging publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the Bitwarden server software.
    *   Attackers research CVE databases and security advisories to find vulnerabilities affecting the deployed version of Bitwarden server.
    *   If a vulnerable version is identified, attackers use public or custom exploits to target the server.
    *   **Gain Unauthorized Access (Data Breach, Privilege Escalation) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Successful exploitation leads to unauthorized access, potentially resulting in data breaches (access to vault data) or privilege escalation (gaining administrative control over the server).
*   **Code Injection Vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, Command Injection, etc.) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Exploiting flaws in the server's code that allow attackers to inject malicious code.
    *   **SQL Injection:** Injecting malicious SQL queries into input fields or API endpoints to manipulate database operations, potentially bypassing authentication, extracting data, or modifying data.
    *   **Command Injection:** Injecting malicious commands into input fields or API endpoints that are executed by the server's operating system, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   **Gain Unauthorized Access (Data Breach, Privilege Escalation) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Successful code injection can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or privilege escalation, similar to exploiting known vulnerabilities.
*   **Authentication/Authorization Bypass [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Exploiting flaws in the server's authentication or authorization mechanisms to bypass security controls.
    *   This could involve logic errors in the code, weaknesses in the authentication process, or flaws in role-based access control.
    *   **Gain Unauthorized Access (Data Breach, Privilege Escalation) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Successful bypass allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to the server and its data, potentially leading to data breaches or privilege escalation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Bitwarden Server Infrastructure Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_bitwarden_server_infrastructure_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Compromise Underlying Operating System [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Targeting vulnerabilities in the operating system on which the Bitwarden server is running.
    *   This includes exploiting known OS vulnerabilities (CVEs) or zero-day vulnerabilities.
    *   **Gain Root/Administrator Access to Server [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Successful OS exploitation leads to gaining root or administrator-level access to the server.
    *   **Access Bitwarden Server Data/Processes [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** With root/administrator access, attackers can directly access Bitwarden server files, configuration, database, and processes, leading to complete data compromise.
*   **Compromise Database Server [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Targeting vulnerabilities in the database server used by Bitwarden server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
    *   This includes exploiting known database vulnerabilities (CVEs), zero-day vulnerabilities, or database misconfigurations.
    *   **Gain Access to Database Credentials or Directly to Database [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Successful database exploitation allows attackers to gain access to database credentials or directly access the database server.
    *   **Access Bitwarden Server Data (Vault Data, Keys) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** With database access, attackers can directly access the Bitwarden server database, which contains encrypted vault data and encryption keys, leading to complete data compromise if encryption is broken or keys are accessible.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigurations [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigurations__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Weak Passwords/Default Credentials [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Exploiting weak or default passwords used for administrative accounts, database accounts, or other server components.
    *   Attackers may attempt brute-force attacks or use lists of default credentials.
    *   **Gain Unauthorized Access [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Successful credential compromise leads to unauthorized access to the server or its components, potentially allowing further exploitation and data access.
*   **Insecure Permissions/Access Controls [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Exploiting misconfigured file or directory permissions that allow unauthorized access to sensitive files.
    *   This includes overly permissive permissions on configuration files, private keys, or database files.
    *   **Exploit Permissions to Access Sensitive Files (Configuration, Keys) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attackers leverage insecure permissions to directly access sensitive files containing configuration details, encryption keys, or other critical information, leading to potential data compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Bitwarden Server Functionality (Logical Attacks) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_bitwarden_server_functionality__logical_attacks___high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing Attacks on User Accounts [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Targeting user login endpoints with automated attacks to guess user passwords or use lists of compromised credentials (credential stuffing).
    *   **Gain Access to User Account [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Successful brute-force or credential stuffing leads to gaining access to legitimate user accounts.
    *   **Access User Vault Data (Potentially Application Credentials) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Once a user account is compromised, attackers can access the user's vault data, which may contain credentials for the application being protected by Bitwarden.
*   **Account Takeover via Password Reset Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Exploiting flaws in the password reset process to take over user accounts.
    *   This could involve weak security questions, predictable reset tokens, or vulnerabilities in the password reset logic.
    *   **Take Over User Account [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Successful exploitation of password reset flaws allows attackers to take control of user accounts.
    *   **Access User Vault Data (Potentially Application Credentials) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Similar to brute-force attacks, account takeover allows access to the user's vault data and potentially application credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Compromise (Less Direct, but Relevant) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_compromise__less_direct__but_relevant___high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Compromise Dependencies (Libraries, Packages) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or packages used by the Bitwarden server.
    *   Attackers identify vulnerable dependencies and leverage exploits targeting those dependencies.
    *   **Indirectly Compromise Bitwarden Server [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Compromising a dependency can indirectly compromise the Bitwarden server if the vulnerability can be exploited within the context of the server application.
*   **Compromise Build/Deployment Pipeline [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Gaining unauthorized access to the build or deployment systems used to create and deploy the Bitwarden server software.
    *   Attackers might target vulnerabilities in build servers, CI/CD pipelines, or repositories.
    *   **Compromise Application Data [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** By compromising the build/deployment pipeline, attackers can inject malicious code into the Bitwarden server software before it is deployed, leading to widespread compromise of application data when the compromised server is used.
