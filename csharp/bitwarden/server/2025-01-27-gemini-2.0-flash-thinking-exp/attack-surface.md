# Attack Surface Analysis for bitwarden/server

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Flaws](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in the server's API authentication and authorization mechanisms, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities.
*   **Server Contribution:** Server code implements and enforces API security. Flaws in this code directly create this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A bypass in the server's JWT verification allows attackers to forge valid tokens and access any API endpoint, potentially exporting all vault data.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of user vaults, data theft, account takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust, industry-standard API authentication (OAuth 2.0, strong JWT).
        *   Enforce strict authorization checks on all API endpoints in server code.
        *   Regularly audit and penetration test server-side API security logic.
    *   **Users (Administrators):**
        *   Enforce strong user passwords and MFA (server configuration).
        *   Regularly review user permissions (server administration).

## Attack Surface: [Database Access Control Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/database_access_control_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in controlling access to the database by the server, leading to potential unauthorized data access or modification.
*   **Server Contribution:** Server configuration and deployment scripts influence database access security. Insecure server defaults increase this risk.
*   **Example:** Server setup scripts configure the database with a default, weak root password, allowing attackers to directly access and dump the database.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of all vault data, data integrity loss.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Provide secure default database configurations in server setup.
        *   Document best practices for database security hardening for server deployments.
    *   **Users (Administrators):**
        *   Set strong, unique database passwords (server deployment step).
        *   Restrict database access to only the Bitwarden server (server configuration/firewall).
        *   Regularly update database server software (server maintenance).

## Attack Surface: [Admin Panel Authentication and Authorization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/admin_panel_authentication_and_authorization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in securing the server's admin panel, granting attackers full control over the Bitwarden instance upon compromise.
*   **Server Contribution:** Server code provides the admin panel and its security mechanisms. Vulnerabilities in server-side admin panel code are the root cause.
*   **Example:** Lack of rate limiting in the server's admin panel login allows brute-force attacks, leading to administrator account takeover and full server control.
*   **Impact:** Full server compromise, control over all user accounts and vaults, data theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement strong admin panel authentication with rate limiting in server code.
        *   Enforce strict authorization within the admin panel in server code.
        *   Regularly audit and penetration test server-side admin panel security.
    *   **Users (Administrators):**
        *   Set a strong, unique administrator password (server administration).
        *   Enable MFA for the administrator account (server configuration).
        *   Restrict admin panel access to trusted networks (server/network configuration).

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Server)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__server_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by the Bitwarden server application, potentially leading to server compromise.
*   **Server Contribution:** Server application includes and relies on various dependencies. Vulnerable dependencies within the server codebase create this attack surface.
*   **Example:** The server uses an outdated library with a known Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. Attackers exploit this to gain shell access to the server.
*   **Impact:** Server compromise, data theft, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Maintain SBOM for server dependencies.
        *   Regularly scan server dependencies for vulnerabilities.
        *   Promptly update server dependencies to patched versions.
    *   **Users (Administrators):**
        *   Regularly update the Bitwarden server instance (server maintenance).
        *   Monitor security advisories for Bitwarden server and its dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configurations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configurations.md)

*   **Description:** Insecure default settings in the server configuration, leaving it vulnerable if not hardened post-installation.
*   **Server Contribution:** Server installation scripts and default configuration files define initial security posture. Insecure server defaults create this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** Server defaults include unnecessary services enabled or overly permissive firewall rules, increasing the attack surface.
*   **Impact:** Ranging from database compromise to admin panel takeover, data theft, server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Provide secure default server configurations.
        *   Minimize enabled services by default in server configuration.
        *   Clearly document required server security hardening steps.
    *   **Users (Administrators):**
        *   Thoroughly review and change all default server configurations post-installation.
        *   Follow server security hardening guides.
        *   Regularly review server configurations for security best practices.

## Attack Surface: [Input Validation Vulnerabilities (API)](./attack_surfaces/input_validation_vulnerabilities__api_.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in server-side input validation for API endpoints, leading to injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
*   **Server Contribution:** Server code is responsible for API input validation. Insufficient server-side validation creates this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An API endpoint in the server is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper sanitization of user input in database queries.
*   **Impact:** Data manipulation, information disclosure, potentially remote code execution on the server.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust server-side input validation for all API endpoints.
        *   Use parameterized queries/ORM in server code to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Sanitize user input in server code to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Users (Administrators):**
        *   Ensure running the latest Bitwarden server version with security patches (server maintenance).
        *   Report potential vulnerabilities to the Bitwarden team.
