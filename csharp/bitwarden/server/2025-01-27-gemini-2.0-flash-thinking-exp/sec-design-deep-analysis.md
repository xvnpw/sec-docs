### 2. Security Implications of Key Components and Mitigation Strategies

Here's a breakdown of the security implications for each key component, along with tailored mitigation strategies:

#### 4.1. Client Applications (Browser Extension, Desktop App, Mobile App, Web Vault)

**Security Implications:**

*   **Browser Extension:**
    *   **XSS Vulnerabilities:**  If the extension is vulnerable to XSS, malicious scripts could be injected to steal credentials, session tokens, or manipulate vault data within the browser context.
    *   **CSRF Vulnerabilities (in Extension Context):**  Although less traditional CSRF, vulnerabilities could allow malicious websites to trigger actions within the extension on behalf of the user.
    *   **Insecure Communication:**  If communication between the extension and the Core API is not strictly HTTPS, it could be vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, leading to credential theft or data interception.
    *   **Local Storage Vulnerabilities:**  If the extension uses local storage for sensitive data (even temporarily), and it's not properly protected, it could be vulnerable to local access and theft.
    *   **Phishing via Extension Vulnerabilities:**  Attackers could exploit extension vulnerabilities to inject phishing prompts or overlays, tricking users into revealing their master password.
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Vulnerabilities in JavaScript libraries used by the extension.
