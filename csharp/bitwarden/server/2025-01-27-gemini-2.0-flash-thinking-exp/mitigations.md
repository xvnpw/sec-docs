        *   **Backup Encryption:** Encrypt database backups to protect sensitive data in case backups are compromised.
    5.  **Database Vulnerability Scanning and Patching:** Regularly scan the database server for vulnerabilities and apply security patches promptly.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized database access (Severity: High):** Attackers gaining unauthorized access to the database server and sensitive vault data.
        *   **Data breaches due to database compromise (Severity: Critical):**  Compromise of the database leading to exfiltration of sensitive vault data.
        *   **Data leaks from unencrypted database storage (Severity: High):** Sensitive data exposed if database storage is not encrypted and physical access is gained.
        *   **Data loss due to database failures or attacks (Severity: High):** Lack of backups leading to permanent data loss in case of database corruption, hardware failure, or ransomware attacks.
        *   **Data interception during database communication (Severity: Medium):** Sensitive data intercepted during unencrypted communication between the Bitwarden server and the database.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized database access: **Significantly** reduces risk by preventing unauthorized access to the database and sensitive data.
        *   Data breaches due to database compromise: **Significantly** reduces risk by making database compromise more difficult and protecting data even if compromised (encryption at rest).
        *   Data leaks from unencrypted database storage: **Significantly** reduces risk by protecting data at rest from physical access or theft.
        *   Data loss due to database failures or attacks: **Significantly** reduces risk by ensuring data recoverability through regular backups.
        *   Data interception during database communication: **Moderately** reduces risk by protecting data in transit between the server and database.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** **Partially** - Bitwarden server documentation likely recommends some database security practices. However, full database security hardening, encryption at rest, and robust backup strategies require user implementation and configuration.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Comprehensive database security hardening, database encryption at rest, and automated secure backup solutions are often missing in user deployments. Users need to actively implement these database security measures.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secrets Management for Server Credentials](./mitigation_strategies/secrets_management_for_server_credentials.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Server Secrets:** Identify all sensitive credentials used by the Bitwarden server, such as:
        *   Database passwords.
        *   API keys for external services.
        *   Encryption keys used by the server.
        *   Service account credentials.
    2.  **Secure Secrets Storage:** Implement a secure secrets management solution to store and manage server credentials.
        *   **Dedicated Secrets Vaults:** Utilize dedicated secrets management tools or services (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
        *   **Environment Variables:** Store secrets as environment variables instead of hardcoding them in configuration files or code (less secure than dedicated vaults, but better than hardcoding).
    3.  **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets:** Never hardcode secrets directly in configuration files, code repositories, or container images.
    4.  **Access Control:** Implement strict access control to secrets, granting access only to authorized server components and administrators.
    5.  **Secrets Rotation:** Rotate secrets regularly, especially for critical credentials like database passwords and encryption keys.
    6.  **Auditing and Logging:** Enable auditing and logging of secret access and modifications to track usage and detect potential misuse.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Credential theft and exposure (Severity: High):** Attackers gaining access to sensitive server credentials due to insecure storage or hardcoding.
        *   **Unauthorized access due to compromised credentials (Severity: High):** Attackers using stolen server credentials to gain unauthorized access to the server or related systems.
        *   **Privilege escalation due to exposed administrative credentials (Severity: High):** Exposure of administrative credentials leading to privilege escalation and full server control.
        *   **Data breaches due to compromised encryption keys (Severity: Critical):** Compromise of encryption keys leading to decryption of sensitive vault data.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Credential theft and exposure: **Significantly** reduces risk by securely storing and managing server credentials, making them harder to steal.
        *   Unauthorized access due to compromised credentials: **Significantly** reduces risk by limiting the impact of credential theft through secure storage and access control.
        *   Privilege escalation due to exposed administrative credentials: **Significantly** reduces risk by protecting administrative credentials and limiting their exposure.
        *   Data breaches due to compromised encryption keys: **Significantly** reduces risk by securely managing and rotating encryption keys, protecting sensitive data.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** **Partially** - Bitwarden server likely uses environment variables for some configuration, but comprehensive secrets management with dedicated vaults and rotation is not typically implemented by default in self-hosted setups.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Dedicated secrets management solutions and automated secrets rotation are often missing in user deployments. Users need to actively implement secure secrets management practices for their Bitwarden servers.

        *   Server misconfigurations and security weaknesses: **Moderately** reduces risk by identifying and highlighting server security weaknesses for remediation.
        *   Insider threats and unauthorized activities on the server: **Moderately** reduces risk by providing visibility into server activity and detecting suspicious behavior.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** **Partially** - Basic server monitoring (performance, resource utilization) is often implemented. However, comprehensive server security scanning and real-time security monitoring with SIEM and IDS are less common in standard self-hosted setups.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Automated server vulnerability scanning, real-time security monitoring, SIEM integration, and IDS/IPS deployment are often missing in user deployments. Users need to actively implement these server security monitoring and scanning solutions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Least Privilege Principle (Server Access)](./mitigation_strategies/least_privilege_principle__server_access_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Server Roles and Permissions:** Define different roles and permissions required for accessing and managing the Bitwarden server.
    2.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Apply the principle of least privilege to server access control. Grant users and processes only the minimum necessary permissions required to perform their tasks on the server.
