# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for bitwarden/server

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Enforce Strong Password Policies for Server Administrators](./mitigation_strategies/1__enforce_strong_password_policies_for_server_administrators.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Strong Password Policies for Server Administrators.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configuration via `global.override.env`:**  Developers should configure password complexity requirements within the Bitwarden server's `global.override.env` file (or similar configuration mechanism). This involves setting parameters for minimum password length, character requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special symbols), and potentially password history to prevent reuse. Refer to Bitwarden server documentation for specific configuration keys.
    2.  **Application Enforcement:** The Bitwarden server application code itself will enforce these policies during the creation and modification of administrator accounts through the admin web vault or command-line tools.
    3.  **Documentation and Guidance:** Provide clear documentation for administrators on the configured password policies and best practices for creating and managing strong passwords for their Bitwarden server admin accounts.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks on Admin Accounts (High Severity):** Weak admin passwords make the server vulnerable to brute-force attacks, potentially leading to full server compromise.
    *   **Credential Stuffing Attacks (Medium Severity):** Reused admin passwords across different services can be exploited if credentials from other breaches are used against the Bitwarden server.
    *   **Dictionary Attacks (Medium Severity):** Simple or dictionary-based passwords are easily cracked using dictionary attacks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** High risk reduction. Significantly increases the difficulty and time required for successful brute-force attacks.
    *   **Credential Stuffing Attacks:** Medium risk reduction. Encourages unique passwords, reducing the risk from compromised credentials elsewhere.
    *   **Dictionary Attacks:** High risk reduction. Makes dictionary attacks ineffective.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Bitwarden server likely has default password complexity requirements. The extent of configurability via `global.override.env` needs to be verified in official documentation.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Potentially more granular configuration options for password policies exposed in `global.override.env`.
    *   Proactive password strength feedback during admin account creation/modification within the web vault.
    *   Built-in password rotation enforcement within the application itself.

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Server Administration](./mitigation_strategies/2__implement_multi-factor_authentication__mfa__for_server_administration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Server Administration.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable MFA in Admin Settings:**  Administrators should enable MFA for their accounts within the Bitwarden server's web vault admin panel. This is a feature provided directly by the Bitwarden server application.
    2.  **MFA Method Selection:** Bitwarden server should offer options for different MFA methods, such as TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) via authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.) and potentially WebAuthn/FIDO2 security keys. Developers should ensure these methods are properly integrated and functioning within the server application.
    3.  **Enforcement by Application:** The Bitwarden server application enforces MFA during administrator login attempts to the web vault admin panel.
    4.  **Recovery Mechanism:** Bitwarden server should provide a secure recovery mechanism (e.g., recovery codes generated during MFA setup) in case an administrator loses access to their MFA device. Developers need to ensure this recovery process is secure and user-friendly.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised Administrator Credentials (High Severity):** Even if an attacker obtains admin usernames and passwords (through phishing, malware, or data breaches), MFA prevents unauthorized access without the second factor.
    *   **Insider Threats (Medium Severity):** MFA adds a layer of protection against unauthorized access by malicious insiders who might have access to administrator credentials.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised Administrator Credentials:** High risk reduction. Makes it extremely difficult for attackers to gain access even with stolen credentials.
    *   **Insider Threats:** Medium risk reduction. Increases the difficulty for insiders to abuse their access.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely implemented. MFA for administrator accounts is a standard security feature expected in Bitwarden server. Verify supported MFA methods and configuration in official documentation.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Potentially wider range of MFA methods supported by the application.
    *   More granular MFA policies configurable within the server application (e.g., different MFA requirements based on admin roles).
    *   Centralized MFA management and auditing features within the admin panel could be enhanced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [3. Implement Robust Rate Limiting on API Endpoints](./mitigation_strategies/3__implement_robust_rate_limiting_on_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Robust Rate Limiting on API Endpoints.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Application-Level Rate Limiting:** Developers should implement rate limiting logic directly within the Bitwarden server application code, specifically for sensitive API endpoints. This could involve using middleware or libraries within the server's framework to track and limit requests based on IP address, user ID, or other criteria.
    2.  **Configuration of Limits:** Rate limits should be configurable, ideally through `global.override.env` or a similar configuration mechanism, allowing administrators to adjust limits based on their environment and usage patterns.  Configuration should include limits for login attempts, password reset requests, sync requests, and other critical API functions.
    3.  **Error Handling within Application:** The Bitwarden server application should handle rate limiting events gracefully, returning appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests) and informative error messages to clients exceeding the limits.
    4.  **Logging and Monitoring within Application:** Implement logging within the Bitwarden server application to track rate limiting events. This allows administrators to monitor for potential attacks or misconfigurations.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks on Login Endpoint (High Severity):** Rate limiting significantly slows down brute-force password guessing attempts against the Bitwarden API.
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks (Medium Severity):** Rate limiting can help mitigate certain types of DoS attacks that attempt to overwhelm the server with API requests.
    *   **Password Reset Abuse (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from flooding the system with password reset requests, potentially causing disruption or revealing valid email addresses.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** High risk reduction. Makes brute-force attacks impractical by drastically limiting the number of attempts.
    *   **DoS Attacks:** Medium risk reduction. Can mitigate some types of DoS, but may not be effective against distributed DoS attacks.
    *   **Password Reset Abuse:** Medium risk reduction. Prevents large-scale password reset abuse.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely partially implemented. Bitwarden server probably has some basic rate limiting in place, especially for login attempts within its API. The extent and configurability need to be verified by examining the server codebase or documentation.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   More configurable and granular rate limiting settings exposed to administrators via configuration files.
    *   Rate limiting applied to a wider range of API endpoints beyond just login, configurable by administrators.
    *   Dynamic rate limiting that adjusts based on real-time traffic patterns within the application logic.
    *   Centralized rate limiting management and monitoring dashboards within the admin panel.

## Mitigation Strategy: [4. File Storage Security (Attachments Feature if Enabled)](./mitigation_strategies/4__file_storage_security__attachments_feature_if_enabled_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** File Storage Security for Attachments Feature.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Secure Storage Path Configuration:**  If the attachments feature is enabled in Bitwarden server, developers should ensure that the storage path for attachments is configurable via `global.override.env` or similar. Administrators should be guided to choose a secure location on the server's filesystem with appropriate access controls (restrict read/write access to the Bitwarden server application user only).
    2.  **Encryption at Rest for Attachments (Application Level):** Ideally, the Bitwarden server application itself should encrypt attachments at rest before storing them on disk. This adds an extra layer of security beyond filesystem permissions.  This encryption should be managed by the application, using keys separate from database encryption if possible.
    3.  **Access Control Enforcement by Application:** The Bitwarden server application must enforce access control for attachments. Only authorized users (based on Bitwarden's permission model) should be able to download or access attachments associated with their vaults or organizations. This access control logic must be implemented within the application code.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breach of Attachments due to Server Compromise (High Severity):** If an attacker gains access to the server's filesystem, unencrypted attachments could be directly accessed.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Attachments (Medium Severity):**  Without proper application-level access control, users might be able to access attachments they are not authorized to view.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach of Attachments:** High risk reduction. Encryption at rest and secure storage paths significantly protect attachments from unauthorized access in case of server compromise.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Attachments:** High risk reduction. Application-level access control ensures that only authorized users can access attachments.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Likely partially implemented. Bitwarden server probably has basic file storage for attachments and some level of access control. Encryption at rest for attachments specifically by the application needs verification.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Explicit configuration options for attachment storage path in `global.override.env`.
    *   Application-level encryption at rest for attachments as a built-in feature.
    *   More granular access control settings for attachments within the Bitwarden server admin panel.
    *   Auditing of attachment access and modifications within the application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [5. Antivirus and Malware Scanning for Uploaded Attachments](./mitigation_strategies/5__antivirus_and_malware_scanning_for_uploaded_attachments.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Antivirus and Malware Scanning for Uploaded Attachments.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Integration with Antivirus/Malware Scanning Service:** Developers should integrate the Bitwarden server application with an antivirus or malware scanning service. This could be done through a library or API call to a local antivirus engine (like ClamAV) or a cloud-based scanning service.
    2.  **Scanning on Upload:** The Bitwarden server application should perform malware scanning on all files uploaded as attachments *before* they are stored.
    3.  **Action on Detection:**  Define actions to be taken when malware is detected. This could include:
        *   Rejecting the upload and informing the user.
        *   Quarantining the attachment and notifying administrators.
        *   Logging the malware detection event.
    4.  **Configuration of Scanning:**  Ideally, administrators should be able to configure the malware scanning feature (enable/disable, choose scanning engine, configure actions) through `global.override.env` or admin settings.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malware Introduction via Attachments (Medium to High Severity):** Users could unknowingly upload and share malware through Bitwarden attachments, potentially infecting other users or systems when attachments are downloaded.
    *   **Compromise of Server via Malicious Attachments (Low Severity):** In some scenarios, vulnerabilities in file processing could be exploited by maliciously crafted attachments to compromise the Bitwarden server itself (less likely but possible).
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malware Introduction via Attachments:** Medium to High risk reduction. Significantly reduces the risk of malware being distributed through Bitwarden attachments.
    *   **Compromise of Server via Malicious Attachments:** Low risk reduction. Provides a layer of defense against certain types of server-side exploits via file uploads.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Likely not implemented by default in the open-source Bitwarden server. Malware scanning is a resource-intensive feature and might be considered an optional enhancement.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Built-in integration with antivirus/malware scanning services within the Bitwarden server application.
    *   Configuration options to enable and configure malware scanning in `global.override.env` or admin settings.
    *   Clear documentation and guidance on how to implement malware scanning for attachments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [6. File Size and Type Restrictions for Attachments](./mitigation_strategies/6__file_size_and_type_restrictions_for_attachments.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** File Size and Type Restrictions for Attachments.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configuration in `global.override.env`:** Developers should provide configuration options in `global.override.env` (or similar) to allow administrators to set limits on:
        *   Maximum file size for attachments (in MB or GB).
        *   Allowed file types for attachments (whitelist of extensions) or disallowed file types (blacklist).
    2.  **Enforcement by Application:** The Bitwarden server application should enforce these restrictions during file uploads. If a user attempts to upload a file exceeding the size limit or of a disallowed type, the upload should be rejected with an informative error message.
    3.  **Documentation and Guidance:** Provide clear documentation for administrators on how to configure file size and type restrictions and the security benefits of doing so.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Large Attachments (Medium Severity):**  Attackers could attempt to exhaust server resources by uploading extremely large files as attachments. Size limits mitigate this.
    *   **Storage Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Unrestricted file uploads can lead to rapid storage exhaustion on the server. Size limits help manage storage usage.
    *   **Upload of Executable or Risky File Types (Medium Severity):** Restricting file types can prevent users from uploading and sharing potentially dangerous file types (e.g., executables, scripts) as attachments.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS via Large Attachments:** Medium risk reduction. Prevents resource exhaustion from excessively large uploads.
    *   **Storage Exhaustion:** Medium risk reduction. Helps control storage usage and prevent server outages due to full disks.
    *   **Upload of Executable or Risky File Types:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the risk of users sharing and potentially executing dangerous file types.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely partially implemented. Bitwarden server probably has some default file size limits. File type restrictions might be less common or configurable.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   More configurable file size limits exposed in `global.override.env`.
    *   Configuration options for whitelisting or blacklisting file types for attachments in `global.override.env`.
    *   User-friendly error messages within the web vault when file size or type restrictions are violated.

## Mitigation Strategy: [7. Access Control for Attachments](./mitigation_strategies/7__access_control_for_attachments.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Access Control for Attachments.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Application-Level Access Control:** Developers must ensure that the Bitwarden server application strictly enforces access control for attachments based on Bitwarden's existing permission model (user roles, organization memberships, vault access).
    2.  **Authorization Checks on Download/Access:** Before allowing a user to download or access an attachment, the Bitwarden server application must perform authorization checks to verify that the user has the necessary permissions to access the associated vault item and organization (if applicable).
    3.  **Consistent Access Control Across Interfaces:** Access control must be consistently enforced across all interfaces (web vault, desktop app, mobile apps, API) through which attachments can be accessed.
    4.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the Bitwarden server application code to verify that access control for attachments is correctly implemented and free from vulnerabilities.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Attachments (High Severity):** If access control is not properly implemented, unauthorized users could potentially gain access to sensitive files stored as attachments, leading to data breaches and privacy violations.
    *   **Data Leakage via Attachments (High Severity):** Weak access control could lead to unintentional data leakage if users can access attachments they should not be able to see.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Attachments:** High risk reduction. Properly implemented access control is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive data.
    *   **Data Leakage via Attachments:** High risk reduction. Prevents unintentional data leakage by ensuring users only access attachments they are authorized to view.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely implemented. Access control is a fundamental security feature for a password manager, and Bitwarden server should have access control for attachments as part of its core functionality.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Potentially more granular access control settings for attachments (e.g., different permission levels for viewing vs. downloading attachments).
    *   Detailed logging and auditing of attachment access events for security monitoring and compliance.
    *   Regular penetration testing specifically focused on verifying the robustness of attachment access control within the Bitwarden server application.
