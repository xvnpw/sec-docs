## Attack Tree Path: [[1. Exploit Custom Validator Logic]](./attack_tree_paths/_1__exploit_custom_validator_logic_.md)

*   **[!] `***[1. Exploit Custom Validator Logic]***` (High-Risk Path and Critical Node):**
    *   **Description:** This is the primary attack vector, focusing on exploiting vulnerabilities within the custom validators written by developers using FluentValidation. This is the most likely path for an attacker to succeed.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** Custom code is inherently more prone to errors than well-tested library code. Developers may introduce flaws that allow invalid data to bypass validation.
    *   **Why Critical Node:** Successful exploitation of this node directly achieves the attacker's goal of bypassing validation, leading to potential application-specific vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.1 Logic Errors]](./attack_tree_paths/_1_1_logic_errors_.md)

*   **`***[1.1 Logic Errors]***` (High-Risk Path):**
            *   **Description:** This encompasses a range of logical flaws within the custom validator code itself.
            *   **Why High-Risk:** Logic errors are common in programming, and custom validators are no exception.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.1.1 Incorrect Validation Logic]](./attack_tree_paths/_1_1_1_incorrect_validation_logic_.md)

*   **`***[1.1.1 Incorrect Validation Logic]***` (High-Risk Path):**
                    *   **Description:** The custom validator contains incorrect validation rules, such as flawed regular expressions, incorrect comparisons, or other logical errors that allow invalid data to pass.
                    *   **Example:** A custom validator for a phone number might use an incorrect regular expression that allows invalid characters or formats.
                    *   **Likelihood:** High
                    *   **Impact:** Medium to High
                    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
                    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
                    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.1.2 Failure to Handle Null/Empty Values]](./attack_tree_paths/_1_1_2_failure_to_handle_nullempty_values_.md)

*   **`***[1.1.2 Failure to Handle Null/Empty Values]***` (High-Risk Path):**
                    *   **Description:** The custom validator does not properly handle null, empty strings, or other unexpected input types, leading to exceptions or incorrect validation results.
                    *   **Example:** A custom validator that operates on a string might throw a `NullReferenceException` if the input is null, or might incorrectly treat an empty string as valid.
                    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
                    *   **Impact:** Medium
                    *   **Effort:** Low
                    *   **Skill Level:** Low
                    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.1.3 Incorrect Assumptions about Input Data]](./attack_tree_paths/_1_1_3_incorrect_assumptions_about_input_data_.md)

*   **`[1.1.3 Incorrect Assumptions about Input Data]`:**
                    *   **Description:** The custom validator makes incorrect assumptions about the format, range, or type of the input data, leading to vulnerabilities.
                    *   **Example:** A custom validator for a date might assume a specific date format without proper validation, leading to parsing errors or potential injection vulnerabilities.
                    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
                    *   **Impact:** Medium to High
                    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
                    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
                    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.2 Side Effects in Custom Validators]](./attack_tree_paths/_1_2_side_effects_in_custom_validators_.md)

*   **`[1.2 Side Effects in Custom Validators]`:**
            *   **Description:** The custom validator has unintended side effects, modifying external state or performing actions other than pure validation.
            *   **Example:** A custom validator might write to a log file or database, potentially introducing vulnerabilities if the logging mechanism is not secure.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low
            *   **Impact:** Medium to High
            *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.3 Resource Exhaustion in Custom Validators]](./attack_tree_paths/_1_3_resource_exhaustion_in_custom_validators_.md)

*   **`[1.3 Resource Exhaustion in Custom Validators]`:**
            *   **Description:** The custom validator consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory), leading to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.
            *   **Example:** A custom validator might perform a computationally expensive operation on a large input string, allowing an attacker to trigger a DoS by providing a very long string.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
            *   **Impact:** Medium
            *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [[2.1.2 Deserialization]](./attack_tree_paths/_2_1_2_deserialization_.md)

* **[!] `[2.1.2 Deserialization]` (Critical Node, *Not* in High-Risk Sub-tree, but included for context as a Critical Node):**
    * **Description:** If validation rules are loaded from external source (file, database) and deserialized, it is critical node.
    * **Why Critical Node:** If present, this represents a significant vulnerability, as unsafe deserialization can lead to arbitrary code execution.
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Depends on application architecture)
    * **Impact:** Very High
    * **Effort:** Medium to High
    * **Skill Level:** High
    * **Detection Difficulty:** High
