# Attack Surface Analysis for fluentvalidation/fluentvalidation

## Attack Surface: [Rule Bypass/Manipulation (Due to Implementation Errors)](./attack_surfaces/rule_bypassmanipulation__due_to_implementation_errors_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers circumvent validation rules defined *using* FluentValidation, submitting invalid data that the application incorrectly accepts. This is due to *developer error* in how FluentValidation is used, not a flaw in the library itself, but the library is the *tool* being misused.
*   **FluentValidation Contribution:** FluentValidation provides the rule definition mechanism.  Incorrect implementation (e.g., missing server-side checks, flawed conditional logic) directly leads to the bypass.
*   **Example:** An attacker bypasses client-side validation (which uses FluentValidation's client-side integration) and submits a malicious payload because the server-side code doesn't *re-validate* using the *same* FluentValidation rules.
*   **Impact:** Data integrity violations, potential for further attacks (e.g., SQL injection), unauthorized access, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical if it leads to significant data breaches or system compromise).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Server-Side Validation:** *Always* re-validate all input on the server-side using the *same* FluentValidation rules. This is the most crucial mitigation.
    *   **Comprehensive Rule Sets:** Ensure rules cover all security-relevant constraints. Don't omit checks.
    *   **Careful Conditional Logic:** Thoroughly review and test `When()` and `Unless()` conditions.
    *   **Secure Configuration:** If rules are dynamically generated or user-configurable, strictly validate and sanitize the configuration inputs.

## Attack Surface: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](./attack_surfaces/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit poorly crafted regular expressions *within FluentValidation rules* to cause excessive CPU consumption (denial of service).
*   **FluentValidation Contribution:** FluentValidation's `Matches()` rule *allows* the use of regular expressions, providing the direct mechanism for this attack. The vulnerability is in the *developer-supplied* regex, but FluentValidation is the *conduit*.
*   **Example:** A validator uses a vulnerable regex like `(a+)+$` within a `Matches()` rule. An attacker provides crafted input to trigger catastrophic backtracking.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, application unavailability, server resource exhaustion.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regex Analysis:** Use tools to identify potentially vulnerable regex patterns *before* using them in FluentValidation rules.
    *   **Avoid Nested Quantifiers:** Minimize or avoid nested quantifiers in regexes used with `Matches()`.
    *   **Character Class Restraint:** Use specific character classes instead of overly broad ones.
    *   **Regex Timeouts (Application Level):** Implement timeouts for regex execution *outside* of FluentValidation (at the application level). This is *not* a built-in FluentValidation feature.
    *   **Input Length Limits:** Enforce reasonable maximum input lengths *before* applying regex validation.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Validator Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/custom_validator_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws *within custom validation logic* implemented using FluentValidation's `Custom()`, `Must()`, or by extending `AbstractValidator`.
*   **FluentValidation Contribution:** FluentValidation provides the *framework* for creating custom validators. The vulnerabilities are in the *developer-written code* within these validators, but FluentValidation is the *enabling mechanism*.
*   **Example:** A custom validator (using `Must()`) performs a database query using string concatenation, making it vulnerable to SQL injection. The vulnerability is *within* the custom validator's code, facilitated by FluentValidation.
*   **Impact:** Varies widely; could include SQL injection, command injection, XSS, data breaches, denial of service â€“ all depending on the flawed custom logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability within the custom validator).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Apply *all* standard secure coding principles *within* the custom validator code.
    *   **Input Sanitization (Within Validator):** Sanitize input *before* using it in potentially dangerous operations within the validator.
    *   **Parameterized Queries:** Use parameterized queries (or an ORM) to prevent SQL injection within custom validators.
    *   **Avoid Side Effects:** Design custom validators to be as close to pure functions as possible.
    *   **Resource Management:** Handle resources properly within custom validators.
    *   **Thorough Testing:** Extensively test custom validators with malicious input.
