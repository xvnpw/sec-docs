# Threat Model Analysis for fluentvalidation/fluentvalidation

## Threat: [Threat 1: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Custom Validator](./threats/threat_1_regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__in_custom_validator.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker submits a crafted string to a field validated by a custom validator that uses a vulnerable regular expression. The vulnerable regex exhibits catastrophic backtracking, causing the validator to consume excessive CPU resources and potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.  This is a direct vulnerability *within* the custom validator code provided to FluentValidation.
    *   **Impact:**  Application becomes unresponsive or crashes, denying service to legitimate users.
    *   **Affected Component:** `CustomValidator` or `Must()`/`MustAsync()` methods that contain regular expression logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regex Analysis:** Carefully analyze any regular expressions used in custom validators for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities. Use tools like Regex101 with a large timeout to test for backtracking issues.
        *   **Simple Regexes:** Prefer simple, well-understood regular expressions over complex ones.
        *   **Regex Timeouts:** If possible, set a timeout for regular expression execution to prevent indefinite processing. This is *not* directly supported by FluentValidation, but can be implemented *within* the custom validator logic.
        *   **Avoid User-Supplied Regexes:**  Never allow users to directly input regular expressions that will be used for validation.

## Threat: [Threat 2: Injection Attack Through Custom Validator](./threats/threat_2_injection_attack_through_custom_validator.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a custom validator that uses user-supplied input in an unsafe way. For example, the custom validator might construct a SQL query or execute a shell command using the input without proper sanitization or escaping. This is a direct vulnerability *within* the custom validator code provided to FluentValidation.
    *   **Impact:**  SQL injection, command injection, or other injection attacks, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** `CustomValidator`, `Must()`/`MustAsync()` methods.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize and escape any user-supplied input used within custom validators before using it in potentially dangerous operations.
        *   **Parameterized Queries:**  Use parameterized queries or ORMs to prevent SQL injection.
        *   **Avoid Shell Commands:**  Avoid executing shell commands directly; use safer alternatives whenever possible.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the application runs with the least privilege necessary, limiting the potential damage from injection attacks.

## Threat: [Threat 3: Incorrect CascadeMode Leading to Bypass (High Severity Cases)](./threats/threat_3_incorrect_cascademode_leading_to_bypass__high_severity_cases_.md)

*   **Description:** The developer sets `CascadeMode` to `Continue` on a rule chain where a *critical* validation check (e.g., checking for a valid user role or authorization token) should *always* stop further validation if it fails. An attacker provides input that fails the first (critical) validator but passes a subsequent, less strict validator.
    *   **Impact:** Invalid data is accepted, and a *critical* security check is bypassed, potentially allowing unauthorized access or actions.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `RuleFor()` configuration and the `CascadeMode` setting.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Understand CascadeMode:** Thoroughly understand the implications of `CascadeMode.Continue` and `CascadeMode.Stop`. The default is often `Stop`.
        *   **Code Review:** Carefully review the `CascadeMode` setting for each rule chain, *especially* those involving security-critical checks, ensuring it aligns with the intended validation logic.
        *   **Unit Tests:** Create unit tests that specifically target the `CascadeMode` behavior, verifying that validation stops or continues as expected, particularly for critical validation rules.

## Threat: [Threat 4: Race Condition in Asynchronous Validator (High Severity Cases)](./threats/threat_4_race_condition_in_asynchronous_validator__high_severity_cases_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker exploits a race condition in an asynchronous validator that checks a *security-critical* external resource (e.g., verifying a token's validity against a database). The attacker sends multiple requests, and if the resource's state changes between the validation check and data usage, it could lead to unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Invalid data related to authorization or authentication may be accepted, leading to unauthorized access or actions.
    *   **Affected Component:** `MustAsync()`, `CustomAsync()` methods.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Idempotent Validation:** Design asynchronous validators to be idempotent.
        *   **Atomic Operations:** Use atomic operations or transactions to ensure the validation check and data usage are a single unit.
        *   **Locking:** Use appropriate locking to prevent concurrent access to the external resource during validation.
        *   **Optimistic Concurrency:** Use optimistic concurrency control (e.g., version numbers) to detect and handle conflicts.
