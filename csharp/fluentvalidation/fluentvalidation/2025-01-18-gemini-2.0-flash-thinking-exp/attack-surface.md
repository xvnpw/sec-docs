# Attack Surface Analysis for fluentvalidation/fluentvalidation

## Attack Surface: [Overly Complex or Inefficient Validation Rules](./attack_surfaces/overly_complex_or_inefficient_validation_rules.md)

*   **Description:** Validation rules, especially those using complex regular expressions or custom validators with inefficient algorithms, can consume excessive CPU resources during validation.
    *   **How FluentValidation Contributes:** FluentValidation provides the framework for defining and executing these rules. If developers create overly complex rules within this framework, it can lead to performance issues.
    *   **Example:** A regex validator defined using FluentValidation that attempts to match extremely complex patterns in user input, leading to significant processing time for each request.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) by exhausting server resources, potentially making the application unavailable.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Simplify validation logic defined within FluentValidation.
        *   Set timeouts for validation processes executed by FluentValidation.
        *   Conduct performance testing of FluentValidation rules with realistic and potentially malicious input.
        *   Perform code reviews of FluentValidation rule definitions for potential performance bottlenecks.

## Attack Surface: [Logic Errors in Custom Validators](./attack_surfaces/logic_errors_in_custom_validators.md)

*   **Description:** Developers implementing custom validators, integrated with FluentValidation, might introduce logical flaws that allow invalid or malicious data to pass validation.
    *   **How FluentValidation Contributes:** FluentValidation's extensibility allows for the creation of custom validation logic. The security of this logic is entirely dependent on the developer's implementation within the FluentValidation framework.
    *   **Example:** A custom validator, registered with FluentValidation, intended to prevent SQL injection but fails to sanitize input correctly, allowing malicious SQL queries to pass.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing intended security measures, leading to vulnerabilities like SQL injection, command injection, or data corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Apply secure coding practices when developing custom validators used with FluentValidation, including input sanitization and output encoding.
        *   Thoroughly test custom validators integrated with FluentValidation, including testing with malicious input.
        *   Conduct code reviews specifically for custom validators used within the FluentValidation pipeline.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities in Error Messages](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities_in_error_messages.md)

*   **Description:** If user-provided input is directly included in validation error messages generated by FluentValidation without proper sanitization, it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **How FluentValidation Contributes:** If developers directly embed user input into custom error messages within FluentValidation's `WithMessage` or similar methods without encoding, it can become an XSS vector.
    *   **Example:** A FluentValidation rule defined as `RuleFor(x => x.Name).NotEmpty().WithMessage("The name '{PropertyValue}' is required.");` where `{PropertyValue}` is directly rendered in the HTML without encoding.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or performing actions on their behalf.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   HTML encode any user-provided input included in error messages generated by FluentValidation before displaying them in the UI.
        *   Avoid directly embedding user input in FluentValidation error messages. Use generic messages or map input to predefined error codes.
        *   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities arising from FluentValidation error messages.
