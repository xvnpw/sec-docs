# Threat Model Analysis for fluentvalidation/fluentvalidation

## Threat: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](./threats/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input strings specifically designed to exploit overly complex regular expressions used within FluentValidation's `RegularExpressionValidator`. This causes the regex engine to backtrack excessively, leading to high CPU consumption and a potential denial of service. The vulnerability lies in the inefficient regex processing within FluentValidation when using this validator.
    *   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to server resource exhaustion.
    *   **Affected Component:** `RegularExpressionValidator`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test all regular expressions used within `RegularExpressionValidator` for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities.
        *   Prefer simpler, more efficient regular expressions.
        *   Consider implementing timeouts for regular expression matching within the application's validation pipeline to limit processing time.
        *   Utilize static analysis tools capable of identifying potentially problematic regular expressions.
