## Attack Tree Path: [1. Incorrect Rule Definition [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__incorrect_rule_definition__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Developers define insufficient or incorrect validation rules, allowing invalid or malicious data to bypass validation.
* **How it Works:**
    * **Missing Null Checks:** Validation rules fail to account for null or empty values, allowing them to pass through.
    * **Incorrect Regex Patterns:** Regular expressions used for validation are flawed, allowing unintended characters or formats.
    * **Insufficient Length Constraints:** Maximum or minimum length restrictions are not properly enforced, leading to buffer overflows or other issues in subsequent processing.
    * **Logical Errors in Rules:** The combination of validation rules contains logical flaws that can be exploited to bypass intended restrictions.
* **Potential Impact:** Data corruption, unexpected application behavior, exploitation of other vulnerabilities due to invalid data being processed.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Logic Errors in Custom Validators [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__logic_errors_in_custom_validators__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Developers implement custom validation logic with security vulnerabilities.

    * **2.1. Code Injection in Custom Validator [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Malicious user input is incorporated into the execution of the custom validator, leading to arbitrary code execution.
        * **How it Works:** (While highly unlikely with FluentValidation's intended usage)  If a custom validator were to dynamically execute code based on user input (e.g., using `eval` or similar mechanisms), an attacker could inject malicious code.
        * **Potential Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system.

    * **2.2. Resource Exhaustion in Custom Validator [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack Vector:**  A custom validator performs computationally expensive operations or makes excessive external calls based on user-provided input, leading to a denial of service.
        * **How it Works:**
            * **Complex Calculations:** Custom validator performs intensive calculations without proper safeguards.
            * **Excessive Database Queries:** Validator makes numerous or inefficient database calls based on input.
            * **External Service Abuse:** Validator makes excessive calls to external services, potentially overwhelming them or incurring costs.
        * **Potential Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation for legitimate users.

    * **2.3. Security Flaws in Custom Logic [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** The custom validator interacts with other parts of the system in an insecure manner, leading to unintended side effects or data manipulation.
        * **How it Works:**
            * **Direct Database Modification:** Custom validator directly updates the database without proper authorization checks.
            * **File System Access:** Validator reads or writes to the file system without proper validation of paths or permissions.
            * **Insecure API Calls:** Validator makes calls to other APIs without proper authentication or authorization.
        * **Potential Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Denial of Service via Excessive Validation Errors [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__denial_of_service_via_excessive_validation_errors__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts input specifically designed to trigger a large number of validation errors, overwhelming the server with processing requests and error handling.
* **How it Works:**
    * **Large Number of Invalid Fields:** Submitting requests with numerous invalid field values.
    * **Repeated Invalid Requests:** Sending a high volume of requests that are intentionally designed to fail validation.
    * **Complex Validation Rules:** Exploiting complex or inefficient validation rules that consume significant resources when triggered repeatedly.
* **Potential Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation, resource exhaustion.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Passing Untrusted Data to Validation Context [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4__passing_untrusted_data_to_validation_context__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  An object being validated by FluentValidation is deserialized from an untrusted source without proper sanitization, leading to deserialization vulnerabilities.
* **How it Works:**
    * **Insecure Deserialization:**  The application deserializes data (e.g., JSON, XML) from user input without verifying its integrity or safety.
    * **Malicious Payload:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code or triggers other security vulnerabilities.
    * **Validation of Compromised Object:** FluentValidation then validates this already compromised object, but the damage has already been done during deserialization.
* **Potential Impact:** Remote code execution, complete system compromise.
