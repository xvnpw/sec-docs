# Attack Surface Analysis for fluentvalidation/fluentvalidation

## Attack Surface: [Validation Logic Injection/Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/validation_logic_injectionmanipulation.md)

**Description:** Attackers can inject or manipulate the validation logic itself, leading to bypasses or unexpected behavior.

**How FluentValidation Contributes:** If validation rules are dynamically generated based on user input or external, untrusted sources without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious logic within the rule definitions.

**Example:** An application allows administrators to define validation rules through a web interface. If the input for these rules isn't properly sanitized, an attacker could inject a rule that always returns true, effectively disabling validation for certain fields.

**Impact:** Bypassing intended validation, allowing invalid or malicious data to be processed, potentially leading to data corruption, security vulnerabilities, or application errors.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid dynamic generation of validation rules based on untrusted input.
* If dynamic rule generation is necessary, implement strict input sanitization and validation for the rule definitions themselves.
* Store validation rules in a secure location with restricted access.
* Use a predefined set of validation rules where possible, rather than allowing arbitrary input.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Validator Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/custom_validator_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Security flaws exist within custom validators created by developers to extend FluentValidation's functionality.

**How FluentValidation Contributes:** FluentValidation's extensibility allows developers to create custom validation logic. If these custom validators are not implemented securely, they can introduce vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A custom validator for checking if a username exists in a database directly executes a SQL query using user-provided input without proper sanitization, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability in the custom validator, impacts can range from data breaches (SQL injection) to remote code execution or denial-of-service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE or data breach is possible)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Follow secure coding practices when developing custom validators, including input sanitization and parameterized queries for database interactions.
* Thoroughly test custom validators for potential vulnerabilities.
* Consider code reviews for custom validator implementations.
* Limit the privileges of the account used by custom validators when interacting with external systems.

## Attack Surface: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Validators](./attack_surfaces/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__in_validators.md)

**Description:**  Poorly written or overly complex regular expressions used within FluentValidation validators can be exploited to cause excessive CPU consumption, leading to denial of service.

**How FluentValidation Contributes:** FluentValidation's `Matches()` validator and potentially custom validators rely on regular expressions. Vulnerable regex patterns can be targeted with specific input strings that cause catastrophic backtracking.

**Example:** A validator uses the regex `(a+)+b` to validate a string. Providing an input like "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac" will cause the regex engine to work exponentially, potentially freezing the application.

**Impact:** Denial of service, making the application unavailable or unresponsive.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully design regular expressions used in validators, avoiding constructs known to be prone to backtracking.
* Test regular expressions with various inputs, including potentially malicious ones, to assess their performance.
* Consider using alternative validation methods if complex pattern matching is required and ReDoS is a concern.
* Implement timeouts for regular expression matching to prevent indefinite execution.
