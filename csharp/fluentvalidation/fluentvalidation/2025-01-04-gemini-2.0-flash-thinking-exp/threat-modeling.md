# Threat Model Analysis for fluentvalidation/fluentvalidation

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Complex Validation Rules](./threats/denial_of_service_through_complex_validation_rules.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input specifically designed to trigger computationally expensive validation rules defined using FluentValidation. This could involve deeply nested conditions, excessive use of regular expressions, or validation against large datasets within the rules. By sending numerous requests with such input, the attacker can consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory), leading to performance degradation or complete service unavailability for legitimate users.
*   **Impact:**  Service disruption, application slowdown, increased infrastructure costs due to resource consumption, negative user experience.
*   **Affected Component:** `AbstractValidator` (the base class for defining validators), the rule execution pipeline within FluentValidation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement timeouts for validation execution to prevent indefinitely long validation processes.
    *   Monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory) during validation, especially when handling user input.
    *   Carefully review the complexity of validation rules, especially those involving regular expressions or external data sources.
    *   Consider implementing input size limits to prevent processing excessively large payloads.
    *   Perform performance testing with realistic and potentially malicious input to identify bottlenecks in validation logic.

## Threat: [Logic Errors in Custom Validators Leading to Vulnerabilities](./threats/logic_errors_in_custom_validators_leading_to_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Developers can create custom validation rules using FluentValidation's `Custom` method, embedding arbitrary C# code. If this custom code contains logical errors or vulnerabilities (e.g., infinite loops, resource exhaustion, insecure API calls, unintended side effects), an attacker can provide specific input that triggers these flaws. This could lead to various outcomes, from application crashes to data corruption or even remote code execution depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom code.
*   **Impact:** Application crashes, data corruption, security breaches, potential for remote code execution (depending on the vulnerability in the custom validator).
*   **Affected Component:** The `Custom` validator extension method provided by FluentValidation, the user-defined code within the custom validator.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is possible), High (for other significant impacts).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and test all custom validator implementations.
    *   Apply secure coding practices when writing custom validators, treating input with suspicion.
    *   Avoid performing actions with significant side effects within validation rules. Validation should primarily focus on checking data validity.
    *   Consider using static analysis tools to scan custom validator code for potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement proper error handling within custom validators to prevent unhandled exceptions from crashing the application.
