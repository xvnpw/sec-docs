## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via FluentValidation Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_fluentvalidation_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal. Success means the attacker has gained unauthorized access, control, or caused damage to the application by exploiting weaknesses related to FluentValidation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass FluentValidation Validation [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_fluentvalidation_validation__critical_node___high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   This is the primary step to achieve the root goal. If validation is bypassed, malicious input can reach application logic and potentially cause harm.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploiting situations where validation is not executed at all.
    *   Exploiting flaws in the validation logic itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [No Validation Implemented [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/no_validation_implemented__critical_node___high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   This is a critical failure where validation logic, despite potentially being defined, is not actually running in the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Missing Validator Invocation:** The developer simply forgets to call the `Validate()` method of the validator class before processing user input. This is a common oversight, especially in complex codebases or during rapid development.
    *   **Misconfigured Validation Pipeline:** In web applications, validation is often implemented as middleware or filters. If these are not correctly configured in the application's request pipeline, validation will not be executed for incoming requests.
    *   **Accidental Disablement:** Validation logic might be commented out during debugging or development and mistakenly not re-enabled before deployment to production.

## Attack Tree Path: [Validation Logic Not Integrated [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/validation_logic_not_integrated__critical_node___high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   This is the direct cause of "No Validation Implemented". The validation logic exists in code, but it's not properly connected to the application's input processing flow.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Same as "No Validation Implemented" - these are essentially different ways of describing the same underlying problem: validation logic is present but not *active* in the application's execution path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Developer forgets to call validator [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/developer_forgets_to_call_validator__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   This is a specific and highly likely scenario within "Validation Logic Not Integrated". Human error leads to validation being skipped.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Code Omission:** During development, the developer simply misses the step of invoking the validator. This can happen due to oversight, lack of understanding of the validation flow, or simply forgetting in a complex sequence of operations.
    *   **Refactoring Errors:** During code refactoring, the validation call might be accidentally removed or moved to an incorrect location in the code, effectively bypassing it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Validation Logic Errors [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/validation_logic_errors__critical_node___high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   Even if validation is implemented, flaws in the validation rules themselves can render it ineffective.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Insufficient Validation Rules:** The defined validation rules do not cover all necessary checks, leaving gaps for attackers to exploit.
    *   **Incorrect Validation Logic:** The validation rules contain logical errors, allowing invalid input to pass as valid.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insufficient Validation Rules [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/insufficient_validation_rules__critical_node___high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   A specific type of "Validation Logic Errors" where the rules are simply not comprehensive enough.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Missing Validation for Critical Fields:**  Crucial input fields that are essential for security or business logic are not validated at all. This is a major vulnerability.
    *   **Weak Validation Rules:** Validation rules are present but are too permissive or easily bypassed. Examples include weak regex patterns, overly generous length limits, or missing encoding/sanitization checks within the validation process (though FluentValidation primarily focuses on validation, not sanitization).

## Attack Tree Path: [Missing validation for critical fields [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/missing_validation_for_critical_fields__critical_node___high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   A critical subset of "Insufficient Validation Rules" focusing on the most dangerous omissions.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Unvalidated Injection Points:** Input fields that are directly used in SQL queries, displayed in web pages without encoding, or used in system commands are not validated. This directly leads to injection vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Command Injection).
    *   **Unvalidated Business Logic Fields:** Fields that control critical business operations (e.g., price, quantity, user roles, permissions) are not validated for allowed values, ranges, or formats. This can lead to business logic flaws and unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Fields vulnerable to injection (SQL, XSS, Command) not validated [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/fields_vulnerable_to_injection__sql__xss__command__not_validated__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   This is the most critical and high-impact scenario within the high-risk path. Failure to validate injection points directly leads to severe security vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** If input fields used in database queries are not validated (e.g., for malicious SQL syntax), attackers can inject their own SQL code to manipulate the database, potentially gaining unauthorized access, modifying data, or even taking control of the database server.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If input fields displayed on web pages are not validated and encoded, attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in other users' browsers, potentially stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website.
    *   **Command Injection:** If input fields are used to construct system commands without validation, attackers can inject malicious commands that will be executed by the server operating system, potentially gaining full control of the server.
