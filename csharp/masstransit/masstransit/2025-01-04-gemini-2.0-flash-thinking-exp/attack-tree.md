## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via MassTransit [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_masstransit__critical_node_.md)

**Compromise Application via MassTransit [CRITICAL NODE]:** This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker, achieved through exploiting weaknesses in the MassTransit implementation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Message [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_message__critical_node_.md)

    *   **Gain Access to Publisher Credentials [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:** The attacker obtains valid credentials for a publisher application, allowing them to send messages as a trusted source. This can be achieved through:
        *   Phishing or social engineering tactics targeting users with access to publisher credentials.
        *   Exploiting weak credential storage mechanisms within the publisher application (e.g., hardcoded passwords, insecurely stored secrets).

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to Publisher Credentials [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_publisher_credentials__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

    *   **Gain Unauthorized Access to Message Broker Management Interface [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:** The attacker gains access to the broker's administrative interface, often web-based, which allows for extensive control over the message bus.
        *   **Exploit Default Credentials [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:** The attacker uses default usernames and passwords that were not changed during the initial setup of the message broker. This is a common and easily exploitable vulnerability.

        *   **Gain Access to Consumer Credentials/Environment [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:** The attacker obtains valid credentials or access to the environment where a consumer application is running.

            *   Phishing or social engineering tactics targeting users or systems associated with the consumer application.
            *   Exploiting weak credential storage mechanisms within the consumer application or its environment.
