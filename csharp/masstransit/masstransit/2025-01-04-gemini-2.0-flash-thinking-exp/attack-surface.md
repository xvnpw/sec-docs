# Attack Surface Analysis for masstransit/masstransit

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Transport Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_transport_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** The underlying message transport (e.g., RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus) is not configured with sufficient security measures, allowing unauthorized access or eavesdropping.
*   **How MassTransit Contributes:** MassTransit's configuration directly dictates how it connects to the transport. If developers configure MassTransit to use insecure protocols (like unencrypted TCP) or weak authentication, MassTransit directly facilitates the insecure communication.
*   **Example:**  MassTransit is configured with connection strings that point to a RabbitMQ instance without TLS enabled (`amqp://`) or using default credentials. This allows attackers on the network to intercept messages or connect to the broker.
*   **Impact:** Confidential information within messages could be exposed, messages could be tampered with, or the messaging infrastructure could be compromised, leading to a denial of service or unauthorized actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce TLS/SSL:** Configure MassTransit to use secure transport protocols like `amqps://` for RabbitMQ or equivalent secure configurations for other transports.
    *   **Secure Credentials Management:** Use secure methods for storing and retrieving message broker credentials (e.g., environment variables, secrets management systems). Avoid hardcoding credentials.
    *   **Transport-Level Authentication:** Ensure MassTransit is configured with strong, unique authentication credentials for the message broker.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

*   **Description:** MassTransit deserializes messages received from the transport. If a vulnerable serializer is configured or if the deserialization process is not handled securely, malicious payloads embedded in messages can lead to code execution.
*   **How MassTransit Contributes:** MassTransit is responsible for the message serialization and deserialization process. The choice of serializer and how MassTransit is configured to handle message types directly impacts the susceptibility to deserialization vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** The application uses the default serializer or is explicitly configured to use `BinaryFormatter`. An attacker sends a crafted message containing a malicious payload. When MassTransit deserializes this message, it executes the embedded code within the consumer application's context.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the consumer application, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Insecure Serializers:**  Explicitly configure MassTransit to use secure serializers like JSON.NET (with appropriate secure settings) or `System.Text.Json`. **Never use `BinaryFormatter`**.
    *   **Restrict Deserialization Bindings (if applicable to the serializer):** Configure the serializer to only allow deserialization of expected types, preventing the instantiation of arbitrary classes.
    *   **Message Type Validation:**  Implement mechanisms to validate the expected message type before deserialization, preventing attempts to deserialize unexpected or malicious types.
