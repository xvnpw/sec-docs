# Attack Surface Analysis for masstransit/masstransit

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Broker Connection Strings](./attack_surfaces/insecure_broker_connection_strings.md)

- **Description:** Exposure of sensitive credentials (username/password, connection strings) used to connect to the message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus).
- **How MassTransit Contributes:** MassTransit requires configuration with broker connection details. If these details are stored insecurely (e.g., in plain text configuration files, committed to version control), they become an attack vector directly impacting MassTransit's ability to connect securely.
- **Example:** A developer hardcodes the RabbitMQ username and password directly into the `appsettings.json` file used by MassTransit, which is then accidentally committed to a public GitHub repository.
- **Impact:**  Full compromise of the message broker, allowing attackers to read, write, and delete messages, potentially disrupting the application's functionality, accessing sensitive data, or injecting malicious messages through the MassTransit infrastructure.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Configure MassTransit to retrieve connection strings from secure configuration providers like Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, or AWS Secrets Manager.
    - Utilize environment variables for sensitive configuration used by MassTransit, ensuring they are not exposed in version control.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Message Payloads](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_message_payloads.md)

- **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from deserializing message payloads without proper validation, potentially allowing attackers to inject malicious code or manipulate application state.
- **How MassTransit Contributes:** MassTransit handles the serialization and deserialization of messages using configured serializers (e.g., JSON.NET). If the application doesn't validate the structure and content of incoming messages processed by MassTransit, it's susceptible to deserialization attacks.
- **Example:** An attacker sends a crafted JSON message to a MassTransit consumer that exploits a known deserialization vulnerability in the JSON library configured for use with MassTransit, leading to remote code execution within the consuming service.
- **Impact:** Remote code execution on the consumer service, data corruption within the application's domain, denial of service affecting message processing.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement strict input validation on all incoming message payloads processed by MassTransit consumers.
    - Configure MassTransit consumers to expect specific message types and schemas, rejecting unexpected structures.
    - Consider using safer serialization formats if possible, or ensure the chosen serializer used by MassTransit is patched against known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL) for Broker Communication](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_transport_layer_security__tlsssl__for_broker_communication.md)

- **Description:** Communication between the application (using MassTransit) and the message broker is not encrypted, allowing attackers to eavesdrop on message traffic.
- **How MassTransit Contributes:** MassTransit's configuration dictates how it connects to the message broker. If TLS/SSL is not explicitly enabled or configured correctly within the MassTransit transport configuration, messages will be transmitted in plain text.
- **Example:** A MassTransit configuration for RabbitMQ does not specify the use of SSL, allowing an attacker on the network to intercept messages containing sensitive customer data being sent or received by the application through MassTransit.
- **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data transmitted through messages handled by MassTransit.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Explicitly configure MassTransit to use TLS/SSL for connections to the message broker.
    - Ensure proper certificate validation is configured within MassTransit's transport settings.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Message Injection and Handling](./attack_surfaces/malicious_message_injection_and_handling.md)

- **Description:** Attackers sending crafted messages that exploit vulnerabilities in the consumer's message handling logic.
- **How MassTransit Contributes:** MassTransit is the mechanism through which these messages are routed and delivered to the consumers. While the vulnerability lies in the consumer logic, MassTransit facilitates the delivery of potentially malicious payloads.
- **Example:** An attacker sends a message through MassTransit with a negative value for a quantity field, which the receiving consumer's logic doesn't handle, leading to incorrect calculations or database updates within the application's domain.
- **Impact:** Data corruption within the application, unauthorized actions triggered by message processing, denial of service if message processing is resource-intensive.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement robust input validation and sanitization within MassTransit message consumers.
    - Design MassTransit consumers to be resilient to unexpected or malformed data.
    - Consider using message schemas and validation libraries in conjunction with MassTransit to enforce message structure before processing.

## Attack Surface: [Retry Storms due to Misconfigured Retry Policies](./attack_surfaces/retry_storms_due_to_misconfigured_retry_policies.md)

- **Description:**  Aggressive retry policies for failed message processing leading to excessive resource consumption and potential denial of service.
- **How MassTransit Contributes:** MassTransit provides configurable retry mechanisms (e.g., UseMessageRetry, UseDelayedRedelivery). If these are not configured carefully within MassTransit, a single failing message can trigger numerous retries, overwhelming the consumer or the broker.
- **Example:** A MassTransit consumer encounters an error processing a message, and the configured retry policy is set to retry immediately and indefinitely, leading to a resource bottleneck on the consumer service and potentially the message broker.
- **Impact:** Performance degradation of the consuming service, potential denial of service for message processing, increased load on the message broker.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Configure MassTransit retry policies with exponential backoff and circuit breaker patterns.
    - Set reasonable limits on the number of retry attempts within MassTransit's retry configurations.
    - Utilize MassTransit's dead-letter queue functionality for messages that consistently fail after a certain number of retries.
    - Monitor MassTransit retry metrics and adjust policies as needed.
