## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Message Transport Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_message_transport_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Compromise Underlying Transport Infrastructure [CRITICAL_NODE]:
    *   Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses:
        *   Exploit default credentials: Attackers attempt to log in to the message broker using commonly known default usernames and passwords. This requires very low effort and beginner-level skills if default credentials haven't been changed.
    *   Exploit Unpatched Vulnerabilities in Transport Broker Software: Attackers identify and exploit known security flaws (CVEs) in the message broker software. This requires intermediate skills to find and utilize exploits, and the likelihood depends on how up-to-date the broker software is.
*   Exploit MassTransit's Transport Integration:
    *   Exploit Insecure Connection String Handling: Attackers leverage vulnerabilities arising from how the application stores and handles connection strings for the message broker. If connection strings are stored in plaintext or are easily accessible, attackers can inject malicious parameters to gain unauthorized access or control. This requires beginner-level skills and low effort if the configuration is poorly managed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send Malicious Messages](./attack_tree_paths/send_malicious_messages.md)

*   Exploit Message Deserialization Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL_NODE]:
    *   Send Maliciously Crafted Serialized Payloads: Attackers craft messages with malicious payloads that exploit vulnerabilities in the libraries used to serialize and deserialize messages (e.g., JSON.NET, System.Text.Json). Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution. This requires intermediate skills to understand deserialization vulnerabilities and craft effective payloads.
*   Exploit Message Handling Logic (Consumers):
    *   Send Messages with Malicious Content: Attackers send messages containing malicious data that, when processed by the application's message consumers, leads to unintended and harmful actions. This could involve command injection, where attacker-controlled data is executed as a command on the server. This requires intermediate skills to understand the application's message processing logic and craft effective malicious payloads.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Access Sensitive Configuration Data:
    *   Exploit Insecure Storage of Connection Strings or Credentials [CRITICAL_NODE]: Attackers gain access to sensitive configuration files or storage locations where connection strings or other credentials are stored insecurely (e.g., in plaintext or with weak encryption). This provides attackers with credentials to other systems or the message broker itself. This requires beginner-level skills and low effort if security practices for storing secrets are weak.
