# Threat Model Analysis for masstransit/masstransit

## Threat: [Eavesdropping on Message Traffic](./threats/eavesdropping_on_message_traffic.md)

Description: An attacker intercepts network traffic between MassTransit producers, consumers, and the message broker. By passively monitoring the network, they can read message content, including potentially sensitive data transmitted in plaintext if TLS/SSL encryption is not enabled or properly configured within MassTransit.
Impact:
    Confidentiality: Exposure of sensitive information contained within messages.
    Integrity:  While passive eavesdropping doesn't directly modify messages, the exposed information could be used for further attacks.
Affected MassTransit Component: Message Transport Layer (MassTransit's transport configuration, specifically TLS/SSL settings).
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    Ensure TLS/SSL encryption is enabled and enforced for all MassTransit communication channels. This is configured within MassTransit's transport configuration when connecting to the message broker.
    Verify proper TLS/SSL configuration in MassTransit code, checking connection strings and transport options.
    Use secure network infrastructure and consider network segmentation to further protect message traffic.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Message Transport](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_message_transport.md)

Description: An attacker actively intercepts communication between MassTransit components (producers, consumers, broker) when TLS/SSL is not properly implemented or configured in MassTransit. They can then eavesdrop on message traffic and, more critically, modify messages in transit before they reach their intended destination, potentially altering application behavior or injecting malicious data.
Impact:
    Confidentiality: Exposure of message content.
    Integrity: Modification of messages in transit, leading to data corruption, application malfunction, or malicious actions based on altered messages.
Affected MassTransit Component: Message Transport Layer (MassTransit's transport configuration, TLS/SSL implementation within MassTransit).
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    Mandatory and correctly configured TLS/SSL for all MassTransit communication. This is a core configuration aspect within MassTransit when setting up transport connections.
    Properly configure TLS/SSL certificates within MassTransit if required by the broker.
    Use strong cipher suites supported by both MassTransit and the message broker.
    Regularly review and test TLS/SSL configuration in MassTransit applications.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: If MassTransit is configured to use insecure serialization formats or libraries, or if custom serializers are implemented with vulnerabilities and integrated into MassTransit, an attacker could craft malicious messages. When these messages are deserialized by consumers using MassTransit's deserialization pipeline, it could lead to arbitrary code execution on the consumer's machine or denial of service.
Impact:
    Confidentiality: Potential exposure of data due to code execution and system compromise.
    Integrity: Data corruption or modification due to code execution.
    Availability: Denial of service due to code execution or resource exhaustion.
    Elevation of Privilege: Potential to gain control of the consumer application server.
Affected MassTransit Component: Message Serialization/Deserialization (MassTransit's serializer configuration, custom serializers integrated with MassTransit).
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    Use secure and well-vetted serialization libraries. MassTransit defaults to JSON.NET, which is generally secure. Stick to this default unless there's a strong reason to change.
    Avoid using insecure serialization formats like BinaryFormatter with MassTransit unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
    If custom serializers are required and integrated with MassTransit, ensure they are thoroughly reviewed and security tested for deserialization vulnerabilities.
    Keep serialization libraries used by MassTransit and custom serializers up-to-date with security patches.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

Description: Sensitive information required for MassTransit to connect to the message broker (like broker connection strings, usernames, passwords, API keys) is stored insecurely. If configuration files, environment variables, or code containing these secrets are exposed (e.g., through insecure storage, version control, or access control issues), attackers can retrieve these credentials and compromise the MassTransit infrastructure and potentially the message broker itself.
Impact:
    Confidentiality: Exposure of sensitive credentials and potentially access to the message broker and dependent systems.
    Integrity: Potential for unauthorized modification of the message bus or dependent systems using compromised credentials.
    Availability: Potential for denial of service by misusing compromised credentials to disrupt the message bus.
Affected MassTransit Component: MassTransit Configuration (Connection strings, credentials configured within MassTransit application).
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    Never store sensitive information directly in configuration files or environment variables in plaintext.
    Utilize secure secrets management systems (e.g., Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store and retrieve sensitive configuration data used by MassTransit.
    Configure MassTransit to retrieve connection strings and credentials from these secure secrets management systems.
    Implement proper access control to configuration files and secrets management systems.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Access Control Policies in MassTransit or Broker](./threats/misconfigured_access_control_policies_in_masstransit_or_broker.md)

Description: MassTransit's configuration allows for setting up access control, routing, and exchange bindings. If these are misconfigured, it can lead to unintended access or message flow. For example, a consumer might be incorrectly granted permissions to subscribe to queues it shouldn't, or a producer might be able to send messages to restricted exchanges due to misconfigured routing rules within MassTransit.
Impact:
    Integrity: Unauthorized modification or deletion of messages or queues due to misrouted messages or incorrect permissions.
    Confidentiality: Potential unauthorized access to messages in queues due to misconfigured subscriptions.
    Availability: Potential for denial of service by misusing excessive permissions or disrupting message flow.
Affected MassTransit Component: MassTransit Configuration (Exchange bindings, routing, authorization policies configured within MassTransit).
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    Apply the principle of least privilege when configuring MassTransit's exchange bindings, routing, and any authorization policies.
    Regularly review and audit MassTransit configurations related to message routing and access control.
    Clearly define roles and permissions for producers and consumers within MassTransit configuration based on their required functionality.
    Use well-defined message contracts and ensure routing and subscriptions in MassTransit align with these contracts and intended access patterns.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Malicious Messages](./threats/denial_of_service_via_malicious_messages.md)

Description: An attacker sends a large volume of malicious or oversized messages specifically designed to overwhelm MassTransit consumers or the message bus infrastructure. This can exploit vulnerabilities in MassTransit's message handling or resource management, leading to consumer crashes, queue congestion, and overall denial of service for legitimate message processing.
Impact:
    Availability: Denial of service of message processing and dependent applications relying on MassTransit.
    Performance Degradation: Severe slowdown of message processing for legitimate messages due to resource exhaustion.
Affected MassTransit Component: MassTransit Consumer Applications, Message Bus Integration within MassTransit, potentially MassTransit's message handling pipeline.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    Implement input validation and message size limits within MassTransit consumers. This can be done in consumer code and potentially through MassTransit's message filtering capabilities if available for the chosen transport.
    Implement rate limiting on message producers or consumers if necessary, potentially using MassTransit's features or external rate limiting mechanisms.
    Monitor queue depths and message processing times within MassTransit and the message broker to detect anomalies and potential denial of service attacks.
    Configure resource limits for consumers and the message broker to prevent complete resource exhaustion.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to MassTransit Dashboard or Broker UI](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_masstransit_dashboard_or_broker_ui.md)

Description: If a MassTransit dashboard (or any monitoring UI specifically provided by MassTransit or integrated with it) is exposed without proper authentication and authorization, attackers can gain access. This allows them to monitor message flow, queue status, and potentially gain insights into application architecture and message content, which could be used for further attacks. Depending on the dashboard's capabilities, it might also allow for some level of system manipulation.
Impact:
    Confidentiality: Potential exposure of message flow, queue status, and application architecture details.
    Integrity: Potential for unauthorized modification of system configuration or message manipulation if the dashboard provides such capabilities.
    Availability: Potential for denial of service by misconfiguring or disrupting the system through the dashboard if such actions are possible.
Affected MassTransit Component: MassTransit Dashboard (if deployed and used).
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    Secure access to any MassTransit dashboards with strong authentication and authorization.
    Restrict access to the dashboard based on IP address whitelisting or network segmentation.
    Disable remote access to the dashboard if not strictly necessary and only allow access from trusted networks.
    Regularly audit user access to the dashboard and ensure only authorized personnel have access.
    Use HTTPS for dashboard access to protect credentials in transit.
