# Attack Surface Analysis for masstransit/masstransit

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Message Broker Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_message_broker_access.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus) that MassTransit connects to.
*   **MassTransit Contribution:** MassTransit applications establish and maintain connections to message brokers. Misconfiguration or weak security practices in these connections directly expose the application.
*   **Example:**  Using default credentials for the RabbitMQ user that MassTransit uses to connect. An attacker exploits these credentials to access the RabbitMQ management interface, potentially stealing messages or disrupting message flow.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (reading sensitive messages), data manipulation (injecting malicious messages), denial of service (deleting queues, disrupting message flow).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Credentials:** Mandate and enforce the use of strong, unique passwords or key-based authentication for all MassTransit broker connections.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Configure broker user permissions to grant only the necessary access levels required for MassTransit applications to function (e.g., restrict management interface access).
    *   **Secure Connection Protocols:** Always enforce encrypted connections (TLS/SSL) between MassTransit applications and the message broker.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the message broker within a secured network zone, limiting access from untrusted networks.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of broker configurations, access controls, and user permissions related to MassTransit connections.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities during the deserialization of message payloads processed by MassTransit consumers to execute arbitrary code or cause other harmful effects.
*   **MassTransit Contribution:** MassTransit handles message serialization and deserialization as part of its message delivery pipeline. The choice of serializer and how message types are handled within MassTransit directly impacts this attack surface.
*   **Example:**  Using a vulnerable binary serializer with MassTransit and receiving a crafted message payload containing malicious serialized objects. When MassTransit (or the consumer) deserializes this message, the malicious code is executed on the consumer's server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data corruption, denial of service, potential for complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Prioritize Secure Serializers:** Strongly prefer JSON-based serializers (like `System.Text.Json` or `Newtonsoft.Json` with secure settings) over binary serializers, as they are generally less prone to deserialization vulnerabilities.
    *   **Avoid Binary Serializers (unless absolutely necessary and rigorously secured):** If binary serializers are unavoidable (e.g., for performance reasons), ensure they are from trusted, actively maintained libraries and are configured with the highest security settings. Implement strict type filtering and validation during deserialization.
    *   **Message Contract Validation & Type Safety:** Enforce strict message contracts and type validation within MassTransit consumers to prevent unexpected message types or structures that could be exploited.
    *   **Regularly Update Libraries:** Keep MassTransit, serialization libraries, and all dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.
    *   **Consider Containerization & Sandboxing:** Deploy MassTransit consumers in containerized environments with resource limits and security sandboxing to limit the impact of potential deserialization exploits.

## Attack Surface: [Message Content Injection/Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/message_content_injectionmanipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious data into message payloads or manipulate messages in transit to compromise MassTransit consumers or downstream systems.
*   **MassTransit Contribution:** MassTransit is the message transport mechanism. While MassTransit itself doesn't directly introduce injection flaws, it facilitates the delivery of messages that can be exploited if consumers are not secure.
*   **Example:**  An attacker publishes a message through MassTransit with a malicious SQL injection payload embedded in a message field. A consumer, designed to process this message and interact with a database without proper input sanitization, executes the malicious SQL, leading to data breach or manipulation.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, command injection, SQL injection, cross-site scripting (if consumers generate web content based on message data), business logic bypass.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (Consumers):** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for *all* data received from message payloads within MassTransit consumer applications *before* any processing or interaction with other systems.
    *   **Output Encoding (Consumers):**  If consumers generate output based on message data (e.g., web pages, reports), ensure proper output encoding to prevent injection vulnerabilities like XSS.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Consumers & Downstream Systems):** Grant MassTransit consumers and downstream systems only the minimum necessary permissions to access resources based on validated and sanitized message content.
    *   **Message Signing/Integrity Checks (Optional but Recommended):** For highly sensitive applications, consider implementing message signing or integrity checks to detect message tampering in transit, although end-to-end encryption is generally a stronger approach.
    *   **Secure Message Design:** Design message contracts to minimize the risk of injection vulnerabilities. For example, use structured data types and avoid free-form text fields where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Message Flooding](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_message_flooding.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers overwhelm the message broker or MassTransit consumers with a massive volume of messages, leading to performance degradation, service outages, or resource exhaustion.
*   **MassTransit Contribution:** MassTransit applications are designed to process messages from queues. A flood of messages directed at queues consumed by MassTransit applications can overwhelm the system, especially if consumers are not designed to handle high message volumes or if broker resources are limited.
*   **Example:** An attacker floods a queue that is consumed by a MassTransit application with millions of messages. This overwhelms the message broker, saturates network bandwidth, and exhausts consumer resources (CPU, memory), leading to slow message processing or complete service unavailability for the MassTransit application and potentially other services sharing the broker.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, application unavailability, performance degradation, resource exhaustion, potential cascading failures to dependent systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting/Throttling (Broker & Consumers):** Implement rate limiting or throttling mechanisms at both the message broker level (e.g., queue limits, connection limits) and within MassTransit consumers to control message processing rates and prevent overload.
    *   **Queue Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement robust monitoring of queue depths, message processing times, and consumer resource utilization. Set up alerts to detect and respond to potential message floods or performance degradation.
    *   **Resource Limits & Scalability:** Configure appropriate resource limits for message brokers and MassTransit consumer applications. Design consumers to be horizontally scalable to handle increased message loads.
    *   **Dead Letter Queues & Message Expiration:** Properly configure dead letter queues to handle messages that cannot be processed after a certain number of retries, preventing queue buildup. Set appropriate message expiration times (TTL) to discard old or irrelevant messages.
    *   **Input Validation & Filtering (Publishers - if applicable):** If message publishers are within your control, implement input validation and filtering at the publishing stage to prevent malicious or excessively large message volumes from being published in the first place.
    *   **Circuit Breaker Pattern (Consumers):** Implement the circuit breaker pattern in consumers to prevent cascading failures and provide graceful degradation in case of overload or downstream system failures.
