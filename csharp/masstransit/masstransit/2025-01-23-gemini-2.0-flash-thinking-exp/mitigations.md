## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Rate Limiting and Throttling using MassTransit Concurrency Limits](./mitigation_strategies/implement_rate_limiting_and_throttling_using_masstransit_concurrency_limits.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement rate limiting and throttling using MassTransit's concurrency limit features.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify critical consumers/endpoints:** Determine which consumers or receive endpoints are most susceptible to DoS attacks or require rate limiting.
    2.  **Configure `ConcurrentMessageLimit`:** For each critical receive endpoint or consumer, configure the `ConcurrentMessageLimit` setting within MassTransit's endpoint configuration. This setting limits the maximum number of messages that can be processed concurrently by that endpoint.  You can configure this globally for all endpoints or specifically for individual endpoints.
    3.  **Adjust `PrefetchCount` (Broker Specific):**  In conjunction with `ConcurrentMessageLimit`, adjust the `PrefetchCount` setting on the underlying transport (e.g., RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus). `PrefetchCount` controls how many messages are delivered to the consumer at a time. A lower `PrefetchCount` can help with finer-grained rate limiting.
    4.  **Monitor Consumer Performance:** Monitor consumer processing rates and resource utilization after implementing concurrency limits to ensure they are effective and not negatively impacting legitimate traffic. Adjust limits as needed based on monitoring data.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks via Message Flooding (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from overwhelming consumers with a flood of messages, causing service disruption or application crashes by limiting the processing rate at the MassTransit level.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, database connections) caused by excessive message processing by controlling concurrency within MassTransit.
*   **Impact:** Medium - Effectively mitigates DoS risks related to message flooding by directly controlling message processing concurrency within MassTransit.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `ConcurrentMessageLimit` is configured for some critical endpoints, but not consistently applied across all relevant consumers.
    *   **Location:** MassTransit endpoint configuration in application code (e.g., `ReceiveEndpointDefinition`, `ConfigureConsumer`).
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Systematically applying `ConcurrentMessageLimit` to all consumers where rate limiting is beneficial, and fine-tuning `PrefetchCount` in conjunction with `ConcurrentMessageLimit` for optimal rate control.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review MassTransit Configuration for Security Best Practices](./mitigation_strategies/review_masstransit_configuration_for_security_best_practices.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly review MassTransit configuration to ensure adherence to security best practices and secure defaults.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Consult MassTransit Documentation:**  Refer to the official MassTransit documentation and security guidelines for recommended configuration settings and security considerations.
    2.  **Review Transport Configuration:**  Ensure the chosen transport (e.g., RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus) is configured securely within MassTransit. This includes verifying TLS/SSL usage (though broker TLS config is separate, MassTransit config *uses* it), authentication mechanisms, and connection settings.
    3.  **Examine Serialization Configuration:** Review the message serialization configuration in MassTransit.  While MassTransit itself doesn't introduce serialization vulnerabilities directly, ensure you are using secure serializers and are aware of potential deserialization issues if custom serializers are used.  Consider using built-in serializers and avoid insecure deserialization practices in custom serializers if any.
    4.  **Inspect Error Handling Configuration:** Review MassTransit's error handling configuration, including retry policies and dead-letter queue settings. Ensure error handling mechanisms are configured to prevent information leakage in error messages and logs, and that DLQs are properly set up for security monitoring.
    5.  **Audit Logging Configuration:** Review MassTransit's logging configuration. Ensure sensitive information is not inadvertently logged. Configure logging levels appropriately for security monitoring and incident response.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Prevents vulnerabilities arising from insecure or default MassTransit configurations that could expose the application to attacks.
    *   **Information Leakage via Logs/Errors (Low to Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of sensitive information being leaked through MassTransit logs or error messages due to misconfigured logging or error handling.
*   **Impact:** Medium - Proactively identifies and mitigates potential security weaknesses stemming from MassTransit configuration errors or insecure defaults.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic configuration is in place, but a dedicated security review of MassTransit configuration against best practices has not been performed recently.
    *   **Location:** MassTransit configuration code within application startup (e.g., `ConfigureServices`, `CreateBus`).
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Conducting a formal security audit of MassTransit configuration against documented best practices, establishing a regular schedule for configuration reviews, and documenting secure configuration guidelines for developers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Message Size Limits within MassTransit](./mitigation_strategies/implement_message_size_limits_within_masstransit.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configure message size limits within MassTransit to prevent excessively large messages.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Determine Appropriate Message Size Limits:** Analyze your application's message payload requirements and determine reasonable maximum message sizes. Consider the performance impact of large messages and potential DoS scenarios.
    2.  **Configure `LimitRequestBodySize` (Transport Specific):**  For transports like RabbitMQ, configure the `LimitRequestBodySize` option within MassTransit's transport configuration. This setting limits the maximum size of message bodies that MassTransit will accept and process.
    3.  **Broker Level Limits (Complementary):** While MassTransit can enforce limits, it's also recommended to configure message size limits at the message broker level itself for an additional layer of defense.
    4.  **Handle Message Size Exceeded Exceptions:** Implement error handling in MassTransit to gracefully handle exceptions that occur when message size limits are exceeded. Log these events for monitoring and potential security incident investigation.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks via Large Messages (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from sending excessively large messages to overwhelm the system, consume excessive resources (bandwidth, memory), and cause DoS.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion due to Large Payloads (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of resource exhaustion caused by processing and storing unnecessarily large message payloads.
*   **Impact:** Medium - Mitigates DoS risks associated with large messages by enforcing size limits directly within MassTransit.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Message size limits are not currently configured within MassTransit.
    *   **Location:** MassTransit transport configuration (e.g., `RabbitMqTransportOptions`).
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implementing `LimitRequestBodySize` configuration for relevant transports in MassTransit, determining appropriate size limits based on application needs, and adding error handling for message size exceeded exceptions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Dead-Letter Queues (DLQs) with MassTransit for Security Monitoring](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_dead-letter_queues__dlqs__with_masstransit_for_security_monitoring.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configure and actively monitor Dead-Letter Queues (DLQs) within MassTransit for security-relevant events.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Ensure DLQs are Enabled:** Verify that Dead-Letter Queues are enabled and properly configured for your MassTransit endpoints. MassTransit typically handles DLQ setup automatically based on endpoint configuration.
    2.  **Configure Retry Policies:**  Define appropriate retry policies in MassTransit for message consumers.  Messages that fail processing after a certain number of retries will be moved to the DLQ. This helps differentiate transient errors from potentially malicious or problematic messages.
    3.  **Monitor DLQ Content:** Implement monitoring and alerting for the DLQ. Regularly inspect messages in the DLQ to identify patterns or anomalies. Look for messages that consistently fail processing, messages with unusual content, or a sudden increase in DLQ message volume.
    4.  **Analyze DLQ Messages for Security Incidents:** Analyze DLQ messages to identify potential security incidents.  For example, a large number of messages failing validation might indicate an attempted injection attack. Messages failing deserialization could indicate malformed or malicious messages.
    5.  **Automate DLQ Analysis (Optional):**  Consider automating DLQ analysis using scripts or tools to parse DLQ messages, identify patterns, and trigger alerts for suspicious activity.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Detection of Malicious Messages (Medium Severity):** DLQs can serve as a repository for potentially malicious or malformed messages that fail processing, allowing for post-incident analysis and threat detection.
    *   **Identification of Consumer Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):**  Analysis of DLQ messages can help identify vulnerabilities in consumer logic that might be triggered by specific message payloads.
    *   **Early Warning System for Attacks (Low to Medium Severity):**  A sudden increase in DLQ messages or specific patterns in DLQ content can serve as an early warning sign of a potential attack or system issue.
*   **Impact:** Medium - Enhances security monitoring and incident response capabilities by leveraging DLQs to capture and analyze potentially problematic messages processed by MassTransit.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. DLQs are enabled by default in MassTransit, but active monitoring and analysis of DLQ content for security purposes is not consistently performed.
    *   **Location:** MassTransit endpoint configuration (DLQ setup is often implicit), monitoring dashboards (if basic queue monitoring is in place).
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implementing dedicated monitoring and alerting for DLQ activity, establishing procedures for regular DLQ message analysis, and potentially automating DLQ analysis for security incident detection.
