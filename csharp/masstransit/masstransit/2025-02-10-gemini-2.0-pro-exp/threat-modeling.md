# Threat Model Analysis for masstransit/masstransit

## Threat: [Message Spoofing by Unauthorized Publisher (via MassTransit API)](./threats/message_spoofing_by_unauthorized_publisher__via_masstransit_api_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, having gained access to application code or configuration that allows interaction with the MassTransit `IBusControl`, uses the `Publish` method to send fraudulent messages that appear to originate from a legitimate service. This bypasses any external network-level protections on the broker itself.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Incorrect data processing leading to data corruption.
    *   Unauthorized actions executed by consumers.
    *   Potential privilege escalation.
    *   Denial of service.
*   **Affected MassTransit Component:**
    *   `IBusControl.Publish<T>` (and related publish methods): The attacker *directly* uses MassTransit's publishing API.
    *   Any consumer configured to receive the spoofed message type.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Message Signing:** Use MassTransit's `UseEncryptedSerializer` (or a custom serializer with signing) for digital signatures. Consumers *must* verify.
    *   **Code Access Security:** Protect the application code and configuration that allows access to the `IBusControl`. Prevent unauthorized code from publishing messages.
    *   **Message-Level Authorization:** Implement authorization checks *within* the consuming service, even after signature verification.

## Threat: [Replay Attack (Exploiting MassTransit Consumer Logic)](./threats/replay_attack__exploiting_masstransit_consumer_logic_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker resends a previously valid message. While the message may be valid from the broker's perspective, the *consumer logic* within MassTransit is vulnerable if it doesn't handle idempotency. The attacker doesn't necessarily need direct access to the `IBusControl`, but exploits the lack of idempotency handling *within* the MassTransit consumer.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Duplicate processing, leading to unintended side effects.
    *   Data inconsistencies.
*   **Affected MassTransit Component:**
    *   `IConsumer<T>`: The consumer implementation is vulnerable.
    *   `ConsumeContext<T>`: The context within the consumer.
    *   Potentially custom middleware or filters intended for idempotency, if incorrectly implemented.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Idempotency Handling (Consumer-Side):** Implement robust idempotency *within* consumers. This is *crucial* and is a direct responsibility of the MassTransit consumer implementation:
        *   **Message ID Tracking:** Store processed IDs and check before processing.
        *   **Unique Request Identifiers:** Use unique IDs in messages to track status.
    *   **MassTransit Features (Supportive, Not Sufficient):** `UseMessageRetry` and `UseInMemoryOutbox` (or persistent outbox) can *help*, but are not a replacement for proper consumer-side idempotency.

## Threat: [Poison Message Denial of Service (Targeting MassTransit Consumer)](./threats/poison_message_denial_of_service__targeting_masstransit_consumer_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a message that consistently causes the *MassTransit consumer* to fail. This directly impacts the MassTransit consumer's ability to process messages, potentially blocking the queue. The vulnerability lies within the consumer's code or its interaction with MassTransit's error handling.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of service for the specific consumer.
    *   Message backlog.
*   **Affected MassTransit Component:**
    *   `IConsumer<T>`: The consumer implementation is the direct target.
    *   `UseMessageRetry`: Misconfiguration can worsen the problem.
    *   Error handling pipeline (e.g., `IFaultConsumer<T>`), if not properly implemented.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Error Handling (Consumer-Side):** Implement *comprehensive* error handling within the `IConsumer<T>` implementation.
    *   **Poison Message Queue (Dead-Letter Queue):** Configure MassTransit to move consistently failing messages to a DLQ. This is a *critical* MassTransit configuration.
    *   **Retry with Backoff and Jitter:** Use `UseMessageRetry` *correctly* with exponential backoff and jitter.
    *   **Circuit Breaker:** Use `UseCircuitBreaker` to temporarily stop processing if the consumer is failing repeatedly.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Unencrypted Messages (Published via MassTransit)](./threats/information_disclosure_via_unencrypted_messages__published_via_masstransit_.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data is sent in plain text within messages *published using MassTransit's API*. The vulnerability is the lack of encryption when using `IBusControl.Publish`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data breach and exposure of sensitive information.
    *   Compliance violations.
*   **Affected MassTransit Component:**
    *   `IBusControl.Publish<T>`: The point where the unencrypted message is sent.
    *   `ConsumeContext<T>`: Where the unencrypted message is received.
    *   The lack of use of `UseEncryptedSerializer`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Message Encryption:** *Always* use `UseEncryptedSerializer` when publishing messages containing sensitive data. This is a direct MassTransit configuration.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Message Consumption (Due to MassTransit Configuration)](./threats/unauthorized_message_consumption__due_to_masstransit_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:** A service consumes messages it shouldn't due to *misconfiguration within MassTransit* (e.g., incorrect queue bindings, overly broad subscriptions). The vulnerability is in how the `IReceiveEndpointConfigurator` is used.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data leakage.
    *   Incorrect data processing.
    *   Potential privilege escalation.
*   **Affected MassTransit Component:**
    *   `IReceiveEndpointConfigurator.Consumer<T>` (and related configuration): The *incorrect* subscription configuration within MassTransit.
    *   `ConsumeContext<T>`: Within the unauthorized consumer.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Precise Subscriptions:** Carefully configure message routing and subscriptions using `IReceiveEndpointConfigurator`. Use specific queue/topic names; avoid wildcards unless absolutely necessary and well-understood.
    *   **Message-Level Authorization (Consumer-Side):** Implement authorization checks *within* the `IConsumer<T>` implementation.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities (Within MassTransit's Deserialization Process)](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities__within_masstransit's_deserialization_process_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the *deserializer used by MassTransit*. This is a direct threat to how MassTransit handles message content.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote code execution (RCE).
    *   System compromise.
    *   Data breaches.
*   **Affected MassTransit Component:**
    *   `ISerializer` / `IDeserializer`: The component responsible for deserialization. This is often a third-party library, but MassTransit's *choice and configuration* of the serializer are key.
    *   `ConsumeContext<T>`: Where the deserialized message is accessed.
    *   `IAllowedMessageTypeDeserializer`: If not used or misconfigured.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Secure Deserializers:** Choose a well-vetted and secure deserializer. Keep it updated.
    *   **Type Filtering (Allow List):** Use `IAllowedMessageTypeDeserializer` to *strictly* control which types can be deserialized. This is a *critical* MassTransit-specific mitigation.
    *   **Avoid Polymorphic Deserialization:** Be extremely cautious with polymorphic deserialization. If necessary, implement *very* strict type validation within MassTransit's configuration.
