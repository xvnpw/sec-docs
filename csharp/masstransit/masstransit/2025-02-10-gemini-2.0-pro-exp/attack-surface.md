# Attack Surface Analysis for masstransit/masstransit

## Attack Surface: [Message Poisoning (Deserialization Attacks)](./attack_surfaces/message_poisoning__deserialization_attacks_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers craft malicious messages that exploit vulnerabilities in the consumer's message handling logic, particularly during deserialization.
*   **How MassTransit Contributes:** MassTransit handles message serialization and deserialization. While it uses secure defaults (JSON.NET), custom serializers or misconfigurations can introduce vulnerabilities.  This is a *direct* MassTransit concern because the framework is responsible for the (de)serialization process.
*   **Example:**  An attacker sends a message containing a malicious JSON payload designed to exploit a known vulnerability in an older version of Newtonsoft.Json (if misconfigured to allow type handling), or a custom serializer that doesn't properly sanitize input.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote code execution (RCE) on the consumer.
    *   Data breaches.
    *   System compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Secure Serializers:** Stick to MassTransit's default JSON.NET serializer and ensure it's configured securely (avoid `TypeNameHandling.All`).  *This is a direct action within MassTransit configuration.*
    *   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate *all* message content *after* deserialization.  Don't assume deserialized data is safe.  Use a schema validation library if possible.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run consumers with the lowest necessary privileges.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Keep all dependencies, including serialization libraries, up-to-date.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** If applicable (e.g., for web-based consumers), use CSP to restrict the types of content that can be loaded.
    *   **Consider Message Signing:** Digitally sign messages to ensure integrity and prevent tampering.

## Attack Surface: [Message Replay Attacks](./attack_surfaces/message_replay_attacks.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers resend previously valid messages to cause unintended side effects.
*   **How MassTransit Contributes:** MassTransit provides mechanisms for handling message idempotency (e.g., `InMemoryOutbox`, saga repositories), but these must be implemented correctly by the developer *using MassTransit's features*. This is a direct concern because the framework offers the tools to mitigate this, and their misuse creates the vulnerability.
*   **Example:**  An attacker intercepts and replays a "create order" message multiple times, resulting in duplicate orders.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data corruption.
    *   Financial loss.
    *   Reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Idempotency Keys:**  Include a unique idempotency key (e.g., a GUID) in each message.
    *   **`InMemoryOutbox`:** Use MassTransit's `InMemoryOutbox` to prevent duplicate message publishing. *This is a direct use of a MassTransit feature.*
    *   **Saga Repositories:** For long-running processes (sagas), use a persistent saga repository to track message processing and prevent replays. *This is a direct use of a MassTransit feature.*
    *   **Database Constraints:**  Use database constraints (e.g., unique keys) to prevent duplicate records from being created.
    *   **Message Expiration:** Set appropriate Time-To-Live (TTL) values for messages to limit the window for replay attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Message Integrity Verification](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_message_integrity_verification.md)

*   **Description:** Messages are processed without verifying their authenticity and integrity, allowing attackers to tamper with message content.
*   **How MassTransit Contributes:** MassTransit doesn't inherently enforce message integrity; it's the developer's responsibility to implement it, *often using features or patterns within the MassTransit ecosystem*. While not *strictly* enforced by the framework, the lack of integrity checks is a direct consequence of how messages are handled within the MassTransit context.
*   **Example:** An attacker intercepts a message and modifies the "amount" field in a payment message, causing an incorrect payment to be processed.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data corruption.
    *   Financial loss.
    *   Reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Digital Signatures:** Use digital signatures (e.g., HMAC, RSA) to sign messages and verify their integrity at the consumer. This would likely involve custom MassTransit middleware or message observers.
    *   **Encryption:** Encrypting the message payload can also provide integrity protection (if using authenticated encryption). This would likely involve custom MassTransit middleware.
    *   **Message Broker Features:** Some message brokers offer built-in integrity checks (e.g., checksums).

## Attack Surface: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Messages](./attack_surfaces/sensitive_data_exposure_in_messages.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information (passwords, API keys, PII) is included in messages without adequate protection.
*   **How MassTransit Contributes:** MassTransit transmits messages; it's the developer's responsibility to ensure sensitive data is protected *within the messages handled by MassTransit*. This is a direct concern because the framework is the vehicle for transmitting this potentially sensitive data.
*   **Example:** A message containing a user's password in plain text is sent over the message bus.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data breaches.
    *   Identity theft.
    *   Compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Sensitive Data:** Do not include sensitive data in messages unless absolutely necessary.
    *   **Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data *within the message payload* using strong encryption algorithms and secure key management. This would likely involve custom MassTransit middleware or message observers.
    *   **Tokenization:** Replace sensitive data with non-sensitive tokens.
    *   **Data Masking:** Mask or redact sensitive data before including it in messages.
    *   **Secure Key Management:** Use a secure key management system (e.g., Azure Key Vault, AWS KMS) to store and manage encryption keys.
