Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving SignalR with high or critical risk severity:

*   **Hub Method Invocation Abuse:**
    *   **Description:** Clients can attempt to call server-side hub methods they are not intended to access or with malicious parameters.
    *   **How SignalR Contributes:** SignalR exposes server-side logic through Hubs and methods, making them directly callable by clients. Lack of proper authorization checks on these methods allows unauthorized access.
    *   **Example:** A client-side script attempts to call an administrative function on the hub, like `DeleteUser(userId)`, without proper authentication or authorization.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, execution of privileged operations, potential for privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side Authorization:** Implement robust authentication and authorization checks within hub methods. Use attributes like `[Authorize]` in .NET SignalR or similar mechanisms in other implementations.
        *   **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate all input parameters received by hub methods to prevent unexpected behavior or exploitation.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only expose necessary functionality through hub methods and restrict access based on user roles or permissions.

*   **Message Injection/Manipulation:**
    *   **Description:** Malicious clients can inject or manipulate messages broadcasted through the SignalR hub, potentially affecting other connected clients.
    *   **How SignalR Contributes:** SignalR facilitates real-time message broadcasting. If message content is not properly sanitized or validated, it can be used to inject malicious scripts or data.
    *   **Example:** A client sends a message containing a `<script>` tag, which is then broadcasted to other clients and executed in their browsers (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS).
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on other clients, leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement. Disruption of application functionality or spreading misinformation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side Sanitization:** Sanitize all outgoing messages on the server before broadcasting them to clients to remove or escape potentially harmful content.
        *   **Client-Side Output Encoding:** Ensure client-side code properly encodes data received from SignalR before rendering it in the UI to prevent XSS.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement and configure CSP headers to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.

*   **Connection Exhaustion/Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   **Description:** An attacker can establish a large number of connections to the SignalR hub, overwhelming server resources and making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **How SignalR Contributes:** SignalR maintains persistent connections. If not properly managed, a flood of connection requests can consume server resources.
    *   **Example:** An attacker script rapidly opens hundreds or thousands of connections to the SignalR hub, consuming server memory and CPU, causing timeouts and failures for other users.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption, potential financial loss, and damage to reputation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Connection Limits:** Implement limits on the number of concurrent connections allowed per client or IP address.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on connection requests to prevent rapid connection attempts.
        *   **Resource Monitoring and Scaling:** Monitor server resource usage and implement auto-scaling mechanisms to handle unexpected spikes in traffic.
        *   **Connection Throttling:** Implement mechanisms to temporarily block or slow down clients making excessive connection requests.
