## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application via Polly Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_via_polly_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Achieving this means successfully exploiting one or more weaknesses introduced by Polly to disrupt the application's availability or compromise its integrity.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Retry Mechanism (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/2___high-risk_path__exploit_retry_mechanism__critical_node_.md)

*   This path focuses on abusing Polly's retry capabilities to negatively impact the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Trigger Excessive Retries (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   **Cause Persistent Downstream Failures:** The attacker makes the downstream service consistently unavailable or erroring, forcing Polly to retry repeatedly.
        *   **Manipulate Request to Always Fail:** The attacker crafts specific requests that are guaranteed to fail at the downstream service, leading to continuous retries.
        *   **Exploit Flawed Retry Logic:** The attacker identifies and triggers conditions where the application's Polly configuration or custom retry logic results in an infinite or excessively long retry loop.
    *   **Exhaust Application Resources (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   High volumes of retry attempts consume CPU resources on the application server.
        *   Storing retry context or responses for numerous attempts leads to memory exhaustion.
        *   Rapidly opening and closing network connections during retries can exhaust available connections.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Fallback Mechanism (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/3___high-risk_path__exploit_fallback_mechanism__critical_node_.md)

*   This path targets the fallback logic that executes when retries fail.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Trigger Fallback Execution (CRITICAL NODE):** The attacker successfully causes persistent failures that exceed retry limits, forcing the application to execute its fallback mechanism.
    *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Fallback Logic (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure Fallback Data Handling:** The fallback mechanism returns data that is not properly sanitized, allowing the attacker to inject malicious content (e.g., for Cross-Site Scripting).
