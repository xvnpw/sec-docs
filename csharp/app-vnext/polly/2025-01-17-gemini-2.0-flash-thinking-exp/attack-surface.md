# Attack Surface Analysis for app-vnext/polly

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration of Resilience Policies](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_of_resilience_policies.md)

**Description:**  Polly's resilience policies (retry, circuit breaker, fallback, timeout) can be misconfigured, creating vulnerabilities.

**How Polly Contributes:** Polly provides the framework and flexibility to define these policies. Incorrectly configured policies directly lead to exploitable weaknesses.

**Example:** Setting an extremely high retry count with no backoff strategy for a failing external service.

**Impact:** Resource exhaustion on the application server due to excessive retries, potentially leading to Denial of Service (DoS).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement thorough testing of resilience policies under various failure scenarios.
* Define reasonable limits for retry attempts, backoff durations, and circuit breaker thresholds.
* Use configuration management tools to enforce consistent and secure policy configurations.
* Regularly review and audit Polly configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Overly Permissive Retry Policies Leading to Amplification Attacks](./attack_surfaces/overly_permissive_retry_policies_leading_to_amplification_attacks.md)

**Description:**  Aggressive retry policies can amplify the impact of a failure in a downstream service, potentially overwhelming it or the application itself.

**How Polly Contributes:** Polly's retry policies, when configured without proper consideration for downstream capacity, can exacerbate the problem.

**Example:** A microservice A retries requests to a failing microservice B 10 times immediately upon failure. If many instances of A do this simultaneously, B could be overwhelmed even if the initial failure was minor.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) on downstream services or the application itself.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement exponential backoff with jitter in retry policies.
* Introduce circuit breakers to prevent repeated calls to failing services.
* Implement bulkheads to isolate failures and prevent cascading effects.
* Monitor the health and capacity of downstream services.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Fallback Actions](./attack_surfaces/insecure_fallback_actions.md)

**Description:** The fallback action defined in Polly might introduce security vulnerabilities if not carefully implemented.

**How Polly Contributes:** Polly allows defining custom fallback actions to be executed when resilience policies kick in. If this action is insecure, it becomes an attack vector.

**Example:** A fallback action that returns cached data without proper authorization checks, potentially exposing sensitive information to unauthorized users.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized access, potential for further exploitation depending on the fallback action's functionality.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature of the fallback action).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Treat fallback actions with the same security scrutiny as primary operations.
* Ensure fallback actions enforce proper authorization and authentication.
* Avoid performing complex or potentially risky operations within fallback actions.
* Log and monitor fallback action executions for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Custom Resilience Strategies (If Implemented)](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_custom_resilience_strategies__if_implemented_.md)

**Description:** If the application extends Polly by implementing custom resilience strategies that involve deserializing data, it could be vulnerable to deserialization attacks.

**How Polly Contributes:** Polly provides extensibility points for custom strategies. If these strategies involve insecure deserialization, Polly indirectly contributes to the attack surface.

**Example:** A custom caching strategy deserializes data received from an untrusted source without proper validation, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data corruption, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources.
* If deserialization is necessary, use secure deserialization methods and validate the input thoroughly.
* Consider using alternative data serialization formats that are less prone to deserialization vulnerabilities.
