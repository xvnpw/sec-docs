# Threat Model Analysis for app-vnext/polly

## Threat: [Threat: Non-Idempotent Operation Retries](./threats/threat_non-idempotent_operation_retries.md)

*   **Description:** A system flaw (not necessarily an attacker) causes a non-idempotent operation (e.g., "create user," "process payment") to fail *after* its side effect occurs but *before* a success response. Polly's `RetryPolicy`, if misapplied, retries the operation, leading to duplicates.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Duplicate data (multiple user accounts, orders).
        *   Financial loss (double-charging).
        *   Data inconsistency and corruption.
        *   Violation of business rules.
    *   **Affected Component:** `RetryPolicy`, `RetryTResultPolicy`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (significant data and financial risks)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Idempotency Keys:** Implement server-side idempotency keys.
        *   **Check Before Retry:** (Complex) Attempt to determine if the previous operation succeeded before retrying.
        *   **Transactional Operations:** (If possible) Wrap the operation and retry in a transaction.
        *   **Avoid Retries:** Do *not* use `RetryPolicy` for inherently non-idempotent operations. Use `FallbackPolicy`.
        *   **CQRS:** Separate commands (state changes) from queries (reads). Retries are safer on queries.

## Threat: [Threat: Denial of Service via Excessive Retries](./threats/threat_denial_of_service_via_excessive_retries.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, or a system fault, triggers repeated failures.  An overly aggressive `RetryPolicy` (too many retries, short intervals) amplifies this, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) attack against the downstream service (potentially self-inflicted).
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Downstream service unavailability.
        *   Cascading failures.
        *   Application unresponsiveness.
        *   Resource exhaustion.
    *   **Affected Component:** `RetryPolicy`, `WaitAndRetryPolicy`, `RetryTResultPolicy`, `WaitAndRetryTResultPolicy`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can lead to service outages)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Exponential Backoff with Jitter:** Use `WaitAndRetryPolicy` with increasing delays and random jitter.
        *   **Circuit Breaker:** Use a `CircuitBreakerPolicy` *before* the `RetryPolicy`.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement client-side rate limiting *in addition to* Polly.
        *   **Reasonable Timeouts:** Set appropriate timeouts.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor retry counts, durations, and downstream service health.

## Threat: [Threat: Inadequate or Failing Fallback](./threats/threat_inadequate_or_failing_fallback.md)

*   **Description:** If all resilience strategies fail (retries, circuit breaker), and there's no `FallbackPolicy`, or the fallback itself fails (throws an exception, returns bad data), the application may crash or provide a very poor user experience. An attacker might trigger failures to expose this.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Application crashes.
        *   Unhandled exceptions exposed to the user.
        *   Incorrect or stale data returned.
        *   Poor user experience.
    *   **Affected Component:** `FallbackPolicy`, `FallbackAsyncPolicy`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can lead to application crashes and data issues)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always Use Fallback:** Always configure a `FallbackPolicy`.
        *   **Robust Fallback Action:** Ensure the fallback is simple, reliable, and fast; it should *not* throw exceptions.
        *   **Return Sensible Defaults:** Return a default value, cached response (if appropriate), or a user-friendly error.
        *   **Log Fallback Execution:** Log whenever the fallback is used.
        *   **Test Fallback Thoroughly:** Test the fallback under failure conditions.

## Threat: [Threat: Polly Dependency Vulnerability](./threats/threat_polly_dependency_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability is discovered in Polly itself or one of its dependencies. An attacker exploits this to compromise the application.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Varies widely; could range from information disclosure to remote code execution (RCE).
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire Polly library, or a specific dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Variable (depends on the vulnerability; could be Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use a software composition analysis (SCA) tool (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk).
        *   **Keep Polly Updated:** Regularly update to the latest version of Polly.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Monitor Polly's GitHub and security channels.
