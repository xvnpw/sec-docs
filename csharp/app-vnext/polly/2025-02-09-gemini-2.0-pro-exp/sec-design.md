# Project Design Document: Polly

## BUSINESS POSTURE

Polly is a .NET resilience and transient-fault-handling library that allows developers to express policies such as Retry, Circuit Breaker, Timeout, Bulkhead Isolation, and Fallback in a fluent and thread-safe manner. From a business perspective, Polly aims to:

*   Improve application resilience: By providing easy-to-use mechanisms for handling transient faults, Polly helps applications recover from temporary network glitches, service unavailability, and other common issues, leading to a better user experience.
*   Reduce operational costs: Automated fault handling reduces the need for manual intervention and troubleshooting, freeing up developers and operations teams to focus on other tasks.
*   Increase developer productivity: Polly's fluent syntax and well-defined policies simplify the implementation of resilience patterns, allowing developers to write more robust code faster.
*   Enhance application stability: By preventing cascading failures and providing graceful degradation, Polly contributes to the overall stability and reliability of applications.

Business priorities:

*   High availability and reliability of applications using Polly.
*   Ease of use and adoption for developers.
*   Comprehensive coverage of common resilience patterns.
*   Minimal performance overhead.
*   Active community support and maintenance.

Business risks:

*   Incorrect configuration of Polly policies could lead to unexpected behavior or even worsen application stability.
*   Over-reliance on Polly without addressing underlying infrastructure issues could mask problems and delay resolution.
*   Lack of understanding of Polly's features and limitations could lead to suboptimal implementation and reduced effectiveness.
*   Vulnerabilities in the Polly library itself could be exploited by attackers.
*   Supply chain attacks.

## SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:

*   security control: The library is designed to be thread-safe, preventing race conditions and other concurrency issues. (Mentioned in the project description).
*   security control: Input validation is performed to ensure that policy parameters are within acceptable ranges. (Needs to be verified in the codebase).
*   security control: Polly is regularly updated to address any identified security vulnerabilities. (Needs to be verified by checking the project's release history and vulnerability reporting process).
*   security control: Code reviews and static analysis are used to identify and fix potential security issues. (Needs to be verified by checking the project's development process).
*   security control: Polly project uses GitHub workflow for build and test automation.

Accepted risks:

*   accepted risk: Polly relies on the underlying .NET runtime and libraries for security. Any vulnerabilities in those components could affect Polly's security.
*   accepted risk: Misuse of the library by developers.

Recommended security controls:

*   security control: Implement a comprehensive security testing strategy, including fuzzing and penetration testing, to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities in Polly.
*   security control: Provide clear and concise documentation on how to securely configure and use Polly, including examples of common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
*   security control: Establish a clear vulnerability reporting process and encourage security researchers to report any issues they find.
*   security control: Consider signing the Polly NuGet package to ensure its integrity and authenticity.
*   security control: Implement supply chain security controls, such as software composition analysis (SCA), to identify and mitigate risks associated with third-party dependencies.
*   security control: Use SLSA framework to improve security of build process.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable to Polly, as it is a library, not a service.
*   Authorization: Not directly applicable to Polly.
*   Input Validation: Polly should validate all input parameters to ensure they are within acceptable ranges and do not contain any malicious code. This is particularly important for parameters that are used to construct external calls or execute code.
*   Cryptography: Polly does not handle any sensitive data directly, so cryptography is not a primary concern. However, if Polly is used to interact with secure services, it should support secure communication protocols such as TLS.
*   Software Composition Analysis: Polly should be scanned for known vulnerabilities in its dependencies.

Possible deployment solutions:

1.  Application deployed as a containerized application using Docker and Kubernetes.
2.  Application deployed as a serverless function using Azure Functions or AWS Lambda.
3.  Application deployed as a traditional web application on a virtual machine or physical server.

Chosen deployment solution (example: containerized application using Docker and Kubernetes):

```mermaid

*   security control: GitHub Actions provides a secure and automated build environment.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   The primary business process is ensuring the resilience and reliability of applications that depend on Polly. Any failure in Polly could directly impact the availability and performance of these applications.

Data Protection:

*   Polly itself does not handle sensitive data directly. However, it is used to make calls to external services, which may handle sensitive data. The sensitivity of the data depends on the specific application and the external services it interacts with.
*   Data Sensitivity: Varies depending on the application using Polly. Polly itself does not store or process sensitive data.
