## Attack Tree Path: [1. Abuse Retry Policies](./attack_tree_paths/1__abuse_retry_policies.md)

*   **1.1 Trigger Infinite Retries (DoS)**
    *   **Description:** The attacker crafts input that consistently triggers the retry policy's failure condition, leading to an infinite retry loop and denial of service.
    *   **Critical Node:** 1.1.1 Craft Input to Always Fail Transient Condition
        *   *Steps:*
            *   1.1.1.1 Identify Transient Failure Detection Logic: Understand how the application determines a transient failure.
            *   1.1.1.2 Craft Input to Match Failure Condition: Create input that matches the identified failure logic.
            *   1.1.1.3 Flood System with Malicious Requests: Send a large volume of the crafted requests.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Strictly define transient failure conditions, limit retry attempts, and use exponential backoff.

*   **1.1.2 Exploit Weak Retry Condition (DoS)**
    *   **Description:** The attacker identifies an overly broad exception handling mechanism in the retry policy and triggers errors that, while not truly transient, match the broad condition, causing excessive retries.
    *   **Critical Node:** 1.1.2.1 Identify Broad Exception Handling in Policy
        *   *Steps:*
            *   1.1.2.1 Identify Broad Exception Handling in Policy: Analyze the policy configuration or code to find overly general exception handling.
            *   1.1.2.2 Trigger Non-Transient Errors That Match Broad Condition:  Cause errors that are caught by the broad exception handler.
    *   **Mitigation:** Use specific exception types in retry policies.

*   **1.2 Exhaust Resources with Excessive Retries (DoS)**
    *   **Description:** The attacker triggers retries on operations that consume significant resources (CPU, memory, database connections), leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service.
    *   **High-Risk Path:** 1.2.2 Trigger Retries on Resource-Intensive Operations
        *   *Steps:*
            *   1.2.2.1 Identify Operations Wrapped by Retry: Determine which operations are protected by retry policies.
            *   1.2.2.2 Craft Input to Trigger Retries on These Operations: Create input that causes these operations to fail and trigger retries.
    *   **Mitigation:** Limit retry attempts, use a backoff strategy, and monitor resource usage.

*   **1.3 Data Inconsistency via Retries**
    *   **Description:** The attacker triggers retries on operations that are *not* idempotent, leading to data corruption or unintended side effects.
    *   **Critical Node:** 1.3.1 Identify non-idempotent operations
        *   *Steps:*
            *   1.3.1 Identify non-idempotent operations: Analyze the code to find operations that are not idempotent.
            *   1.3.2 Trigger retries on non-idempotent operations: Craft input to cause failures and retries on these operations.
    *   **Mitigation:** Ensure all retried operations are idempotent.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Abuse Circuit Breaker Policies](./attack_tree_paths/2__abuse_circuit_breaker_policies.md)

*   **2.1 Force Open Circuit (DoS)**
    *   **Description:** The attacker generates enough failures to trip the circuit breaker, preventing legitimate requests from reaching the protected service.
    *   **Critical Node:** 2.1.2 Generate Sufficient Failures to Trip Circuit
        *   *Steps:*
            *   2.1.2.1 Craft Input to Trigger Failures: Create input that causes the protected operation to fail.
            *   2.1.2.2 Flood System with Malicious Requests: Send a large volume of the crafted requests.
    *   **Mitigation:** Tune circuit breaker thresholds appropriately.

*   **2.2 Prevent Circuit from Closing (DoS)**
    *   **Description:** The attacker continuously triggers failures during the circuit breaker's half-open state, preventing it from closing and restoring normal operation.
        *   *Steps:*
            *   2.2.1 Identify Half-Open State Behavior: Understand how the half-open state works.
            *   2.2.2 Continuously Trigger Failures During Half-Open Attempts: Send requests that cause failures during the half-open state.
    *   **Mitigation:** Limit the number of requests allowed in the half-open state.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Abuse Timeout Policies](./attack_tree_paths/3__abuse_timeout_policies.md)

*   **3.1 Trigger Timeouts to Disrupt Operations (DoS)**
    *   **Description:** The attacker crafts input or manipulates the network to cause delays that exceed the configured timeout, disrupting normal operation.
    *   **Critical Node:** 3.1.2 Craft Input or Manipulate Network to Cause Delays Exceeding Timeout
        *   *Steps:*
            *   3.1.1 Identify Timeout Durations: Determine the configured timeout values.
            *   3.1.2 Craft Input or Manipulate Network to Cause Delays Exceeding Timeout: Create input that causes long processing times or manipulate the network to introduce delays.

*   **4.2 Exploit Weaknesses in Fallback Logic**
    *   **Description:** The attacker triggers the fallback mechanism and exploits vulnerabilities within the fallback logic itself (e.g., information disclosure, insecure defaults).
    *   **Critical Node:** 4.2.2 Analyze Fallback for Security Issues
        *   *Steps:*
            *   4.1.1 Identify Fallback Trigger Conditions: Understand what causes the fallback to be executed.
            *   4.1.2 Trigger Conditions to Force Fallback: Cause the conditions that trigger the fallback.
            *   4.2.1 Identify Fallback Implementation: Analyze the code or configuration of the fallback mechanism.
            *   4.2.2 Analyze Fallback for Security Issues: Look for vulnerabilities in the fallback logic.

            *   5.1.2.2 Flood System with Requests Targeting the Bulkhead: Send a large number of requests to the protected resource.
    *   **Mitigation:** Set appropriate bulkhead capacity limits and use queuing.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Abuse Cache Policies](./attack_tree_paths/6__abuse_cache_policies.md)

*   **6.1 Cache Poisoning**
    *   **Description:** The attacker injects malicious data into the cache, which is then served to other users.

        *   *Steps:*
            *   6.1.1 Identify caching keys: Determine how cache keys are generated.
            *   6.1.2 Inject malicious data for valid keys: Craft requests that cause malicious data to be stored in the cache under legitimate keys.

*   **6.2 Cache Exhaustion (DoS)**
    *   **Description:** The attacker floods the cache with unique keys, causing legitimate entries to be evicted and leading to performance degradation or denial of service.
