## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Rate Limiting for Retry Policies](./mitigation_strategies/implement_rate_limiting_for_retry_policies.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Rate Limiting in Polly Retry Policies
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Retry Policy with Limits:** When creating Polly retry policies using `RetryPolicyBuilder` or similar, explicitly set limits to the number of retries and the delay between retries.
    2.  **Set `RetryCount`:** Use the `RetryCount(int retryCount)` method to define a maximum number of retry attempts. For example, `policyBuilder.RetryCount(3)`.
    3.  **Implement Exponential Backoff with `WaitAndRetry` and `maxDelay`:** Utilize `WaitAndRetry` or `WaitAndRetryAsync` and configure the `sleepDurationProvider` to use exponential backoff.  Crucially, set a `maxDelay` to prevent unbounded delays. Example: `policyBuilder.WaitAndRetryAsync(retryCount, attempt => TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Math.Pow(2, attempt)), maxDelay: TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1))`.
    4.  **Integrate Circuit Breaker:** Combine retry policies with a Polly circuit breaker policy. The circuit breaker will halt retries when the circuit is open, effectively limiting retries during outages.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Downstream Services (High Severity):** Uncontrolled Polly retries can overload failing services.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion in Own Application (Medium Severity):** Excessive Polly retries can consume application resources.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS against Downstream Services:** High reduction in risk by preventing retry storms initiated by Polly.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion in Own Application:** Medium reduction in risk by limiting Polly's retry activity.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in the `OrderService` and `PaymentService` API calls using `RetryPolicyBuilder` with `RetryCount` set to 3 and exponential backoff with a max delay of 30 seconds. Configuration is in `Startup.cs` of each service.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Not yet implemented for background job processing in the `BackgroundWorkerService`. Polly retries in background jobs are currently unbounded.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Carefully Configure Circuit Breaker Thresholds and Durations](./mitigation_strategies/carefully_configure_circuit_breaker_thresholds_and_durations.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Polly Circuit Breaker Configuration Tuning
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use `CircuitBreakerPolicyBuilder`:** Implement circuit breaker policies using Polly's `CircuitBreakerPolicyBuilder` or `AdvancedCircuitBreakerPolicyBuilder`.
    2.  **Tune `FailureThreshold` and `MinimumThroughput`:**  Adjust the `FailureThreshold` (e.g., percentage of failures) and `MinimumThroughput` (minimum calls before considering failures) in the `CircuitBreakerPolicyBuilder`.
        *   Example: `policyBuilder.CircuitBreakerAsync(exceptionsAllowedBeforeBreaking: 5, durationOfBreak: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30))`.  Or using percentage: `policyBuilder.AdvancedCircuitBreakerAsync(failureThreshold: 0.5, samplingDuration: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10), minimumThroughput: 10, durationOfBreak: TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1))`.
    3.  **Tune `BreakDuration`:** Set an appropriate `BreakDuration` (time the circuit remains open) in the `CircuitBreakerPolicyBuilder`.
    4.  **Monitor Polly Circuit Breaker State:** Utilize Polly's `OnCircuitBreakerOpen`, `OnCircuitBreakerClose`, and `OnHalfOpen` delegates to log and monitor circuit breaker state changes.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cascading Failures (High Severity):** Poorly configured Polly circuit breakers might fail to prevent cascading failures.
    *   **Reduced Availability (Medium Severity):** Overly sensitive Polly circuit breakers can lead to premature circuit breaks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cascading Failures:** High reduction in risk by effectively using Polly to isolate failures.
    *   **Reduced Availability:** Medium reduction in risk through balanced Polly circuit breaker configuration.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Circuit breakers are implemented for all external API calls in `ApiService` classes using `CircuitBreakerPolicyBuilder`. Default thresholds are set to 20% failure rate and 10 seconds break duration. Configuration is in base `ApiService` class.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Thresholds and break durations in Polly circuit breakers are currently default values and haven't been specifically tuned for each downstream service.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Polly Logging and Telemetry](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_polly_logging_and_telemetry.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Polly Logging Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Polly Logging Delegates:** Examine any logging delegates configured within Polly policies (e.g., `OnRetry`, `OnBreak`, `OnHalfOpen`).
    2.  **Sanitize Data in Logging Delegates:** Within these delegates, ensure that sensitive data is not directly logged.
        *   **Filter Sensitive Parameters:**  Avoid logging entire request or response objects. Log only necessary information.
        *   **Mask Sensitive Data:** If logging parameters, mask or redact any sensitive information before logging within the delegate.
        *   Example: Instead of logging `request.Body`, log a summary or only non-sensitive headers.
    3.  **Use Structured Logging:**  If possible, use structured logging within Polly logging delegates to make logs easier to analyze and sanitize programmatically.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Unsanitized Polly logs can expose sensitive data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Medium to High reduction in risk by preventing sensitive data from being logged by Polly.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic logging is enabled for Polly policies using `Logger` delegates in policy builders. Logs are written to application logs using Serilog.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Log sanitization within Polly logging delegates is not implemented. Polly logs might currently contain request details that could be considered sensitive.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Exponential Backoff and Jitter in Polly Retry Policies](./mitigation_strategies/implement_exponential_backoff_and_jitter_in_polly_retry_policies.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Exponential Backoff with Jitter in Polly Retries
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use `WaitAndRetry` with `sleepDurationProvider`:** Implement retry policies using Polly's `WaitAndRetry` or `WaitAndRetryAsync`.
    2.  **Exponential Backoff Calculation:** Configure the `sleepDurationProvider` to calculate delays exponentially. Example: `attempt => TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Math.Pow(2, attempt))`.
    3.  **Introduce Jitter with Randomness:** Add jitter to the backoff delay by incorporating a random element within the `sleepDurationProvider`. Example: `attempt => TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Math.Pow(2, attempt)) + TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(new Random().Next(0, 1000))`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Retry Storms (High Severity):** Fixed backoff in Polly retries can lead to retry storms.
    *   **Increased Downstream Service Load (Medium Severity):** Synchronized Polly retries can overload downstream services.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Retry Storms:** High reduction in risk by using Polly to prevent synchronized retries.
    *   **Increased Downstream Service Load:** Medium reduction in risk by smoothing out Polly retry traffic.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Exponential backoff is implemented in `OrderService` and `PaymentService` Polly retry policies.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Jitter is not currently implemented in Polly retry policies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Align Polly Policies with Security Context](./mitigation_strategies/align_polly_policies_with_security_context.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Security-Aware Polly Policy Design
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Contextual Policy Application:** When applying Polly policies using `PolicyWrap` or individual policy application, consider the security context of the operation.
    2.  **Re-authentication/Re-authorization Logic in Polly Delegates:**  Within Polly's `ExecuteAndCaptureAsync` or similar methods, and potentially within `OnRetry` delegates, incorporate logic to re-validate authentication tokens or re-perform authorization checks before retrying security-sensitive operations.
    3.  **Conditional Policy Application:**  Use conditional policy application based on the type of operation or resource being accessed. Apply more restrictive or security-focused Polly policies to sensitive operations.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Bypassing Security Controls (Medium Severity):** Polly retries might inadvertently bypass security checks.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Medium Severity):** Uncontrolled Polly retries without re-authorization could lead to unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Bypassing Security Controls:** Medium reduction in risk by ensuring Polly respects security boundaries.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Medium reduction in risk by incorporating re-authentication/re-authorization into Polly usage.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic authentication and authorization are in place for API endpoints. Polly policies are applied to API calls but without explicit consideration for re-authentication/re-authorization within Polly itself.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Explicit re-authentication/re-authorization logic within Polly retry policies or execution context is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Review and Audit Polly Configurations](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_review_and_audit_polly_configurations.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Polly Configuration Audits and Reviews
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Schedule Polly Policy Reviews:**  Establish a schedule for periodic reviews of all Polly policy configurations in the application code.
    2.  **Document Polly Policies:** Maintain documentation of each Polly policy, its purpose, and configuration parameters.
    3.  **Version Control Polly Configurations:** Manage Polly policy definitions as code under version control to track changes and enable audits.
    4.  **Include in Code Reviews:** Ensure Polly policy configurations are reviewed as part of standard code review processes.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Misconfigurations (Medium Severity):** Polly misconfigurations can weaken resilience or introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Outdated Policies (Low Severity):** Polly policies might become ineffective over time if not reviewed.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Misconfigurations:** Medium reduction in risk by proactively identifying and correcting Polly misconfigurations.
    *   **Outdated Policies:** Low reduction in risk by ensuring Polly policies remain relevant.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Polly configurations are defined in code within service projects and are subject to basic code reviews.
*   **Missing Implementation:** No formal scheduled reviews or audits specifically focused on Polly configurations are in place. Dedicated documentation of Polly policies is limited.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Consider Bulkhead Isolation with Polly](./mitigation_strategies/consider_bulkhead_isolation_with_polly.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Polly Bulkhead Isolation for Critical Operations
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Critical Operations for Bulkheads:** Determine operations that would benefit from bulkhead isolation using Polly.
    2.  **Implement `BulkheadPolicy`:** Apply Polly's `BulkheadPolicy` or `BulkheadPolicyAsync` to critical operations using `PolicyWrap` or individual policy application.
    3.  **Configure `MaxParallelization` and `MaxQueuingActions`:** Set appropriate values for `MaxParallelization` (maximum concurrent executions) and optionally `MaxQueuingActions` (maximum queued requests) in the `BulkheadPolicyBuilder`. Example: `policyBuilder.BulkheadAsync(maxParallelization: 5, maxQueuingActions: 10)`.
    4.  **Monitor Polly Bulkhead Metrics:** Utilize Polly's bulkhead policy events or integrate with monitoring systems to track bulkhead usage and performance.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Uncontrolled concurrency can lead to resource exhaustion, which Polly bulkheads can mitigate.
    *   **Impact of Failures on Unrelated Operations (Medium Severity):** Polly bulkheads can isolate failures and prevent them from spreading.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Medium reduction in risk by using Polly to limit concurrency for critical operations.
    *   **Impact of Failures on Unrelated Operations:** Medium reduction in risk by using Polly to isolate critical operations.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Bulkhead isolation using Polly is not currently implemented in the project.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Polly bulkhead policies should be considered for critical operations like payment processing and order placement.
