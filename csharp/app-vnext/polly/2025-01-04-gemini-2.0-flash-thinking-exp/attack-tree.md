## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Manipulating Retry Logic via Configuration Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_manipulating_retry_logic_via_configuration_vulnerability.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability (e.g., injection flaw) in how the application loads or processes Polly's configuration.
*   **Steps:**
    *   The attacker identifies a way to inject malicious data into the configuration source (e.g., environment variables, configuration files, database).
    *   The injected data modifies Polly's retry policies, potentially setting extremely high retry counts, long delays, or targeting specific error types.
    *   When an operation fails, Polly follows the manipulated retry logic, potentially leading to resource exhaustion (DoS) or unintended application behavior.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **Manipulate Retry Logic:** Gaining control over retry behavior is a significant step towards disrupting the application.
    *   **Exploit Configuration Vulnerability (e.g., injection):** This is the entry point for the attack, allowing the attacker to influence Polly's core functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Injecting Malicious Fallback Logic](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_injecting_malicious_fallback_logic.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker compromises the fallback mechanism, injecting malicious code or logic that gets executed when Polly's policies trigger a fallback.
*   **Steps:**
    *   The attacker identifies a vulnerability in the fallback handler's implementation (e.g., lack of input sanitization, insecure deserialization).
    *   The attacker crafts malicious input or code that, when processed by the fallback handler, leads to code execution, data exfiltration, or further compromise.
    *   When a protected operation fails, Polly invokes the compromised fallback handler, executing the malicious logic.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **Manipulate Fallback Mechanisms:** Controlling the fallback behavior allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the application's context.
    *   **Inject Malicious Fallback Logic:** This is the core action of the attack, directly leading to the execution of malicious code.
    *   **Exploit Injection Vulnerability in Fallback Implementation:** This is the vulnerability that enables the injection of malicious logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Cache Poisoning due to Lack of Input Validation](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_cache_poisoning_due_to_lack_of_input_validation.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If Polly is used for caching, an attacker injects malicious data into the cache due to insufficient input validation before caching.
*   **Steps:**
    *   The attacker identifies an operation where Polly caches the response.
    *   The attacker crafts malicious input that, when processed by the backend service, returns a malicious payload.
    *   Due to the lack of input validation before caching, Polly stores this malicious payload in the cache.
    *   Subsequent requests retrieve the poisoned data from the cache, leading to incorrect application behavior, serving malicious content, or other security issues.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **Abuse Cache Policies (if Polly is used for caching):** Targeting the cache allows for widespread impact by serving malicious data to multiple users.
    *   **Cache Poisoning:** The act of injecting malicious data into the cache.
    *   **Exploit Lack of Input Validation Before Caching:** This is the fundamental weakness that allows the cache poisoning attack to succeed.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 4: Exploiting Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_4_exploiting_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers directly exploit vulnerabilities in the application's configuration management to manipulate Polly's settings.
*   **Steps:**
    *   The attacker identifies vulnerabilities in how the application handles configuration data (e.g., insecure storage, lack of encryption, injection flaws).
    *   The attacker modifies Polly's configuration to weaken its security posture (e.g., disabling circuit breakers, setting overly permissive retry policies) or to facilitate other attacks.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **Exploit Polly's Configuration or Integration:** Targeting the configuration allows for broad control over Polly's behavior.
    *   **Configuration Vulnerabilities:** This is the category of weaknesses that allows the attacker to manipulate Polly's settings.
    *   **Configuration Injection:** A specific type of configuration vulnerability where attackers inject malicious data.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 5: Improper Input Validation Before Polly Policies](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_5_improper_input_validation_before_polly_policies.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application fails to validate input before passing it to operations protected by Polly policies.
*   **Steps:**
    *   The attacker crafts malicious input intended to exploit vulnerabilities in downstream services.
    *   The application, lacking proper input validation, passes this malicious input to a Polly-protected operation.
    *   Polly's resilience policies (e.g., retries) might inadvertently amplify the attack on the downstream service.
    *   The downstream service, vulnerable to the malicious input, is compromised.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **Exploit Polly's Configuration or Integration:** This highlights issues in how Polly is integrated with the application's overall security measures.
    *   **Improper Integration with Application Logic:**  This points to a flaw in the application's design regarding input handling.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation Before Polly Policies:** This is the core vulnerability that allows malicious input to reach downstream services.
