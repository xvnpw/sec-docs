# Threat Model Analysis for app-vnext/polly

## Threat: [Retry Storm Amplification](./threats/retry_storm_amplification.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a failing downstream service or resource. The application, configured with an aggressive retry policy *in Polly*, repeatedly attempts to connect to the failing service. This amplifies the initial failure, potentially overwhelming the failing service or exhausting the application's own resources (e.g., threads, connections). An attacker might intentionally trigger this downstream failure to cause a denial of service (DoS) on the application or the downstream dependency.

**Impact:** Denial of service (DoS) for the application and potentially the downstream service. Degraded performance and availability. Resource exhaustion leading to application instability.

**Polly Component Affected:** `RetryPolicy`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement exponential backoff with jitter in retry policies.
*   Set reasonable maximum retry attempts.
*   Combine retry policies with circuit breaker patterns to prevent repeated attempts to failing services.
*   Monitor the health and performance of downstream dependencies.
*   Implement rate limiting on requests to downstream services.

## Threat: [Retrying Non-Idempotent Operations](./threats/retrying_non-idempotent_operations.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the system or network to cause transient errors during operations that are not idempotent (i.e., performing the operation multiple times has different effects than performing it once). The *Polly* `RetryPolicy` then re-executes these operations, leading to unintended side effects such as duplicate transactions, corrupted data, or unauthorized actions.

**Impact:** Data corruption or inconsistency. Financial loss due to duplicate transactions. Undesired state changes in the application or downstream systems.

**Polly Component Affected:** `RetryPolicy`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure all operations retried by Polly are idempotent.
*   Implement idempotency keys or mechanisms to prevent duplicate processing of requests.
*   Carefully consider the side effects of operations before applying retry policies.
*   Log and monitor retried operations for potential issues.

## Threat: [Cache Poisoning via Polly's Caching (If Used)](./threats/cache_poisoning_via_polly's_caching__if_used_.md)

**Description:** If *Polly's* caching functionality is used and not properly secured, an attacker might find ways to inject malicious or incorrect data into the cache. This could happen if the cache key generation is predictable or if there are vulnerabilities in the caching mechanism itself. Subsequent requests would then retrieve the poisoned data, leading to incorrect application behavior or potentially further security breaches.

**Impact:** Serving incorrect or malicious data to users. Application malfunction. Potential for further exploitation based on the poisoned data.

**Polly Component Affected:** `CachePolicy` (if implemented via Polly)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement secure cache invalidation mechanisms.
*   Validate data before storing it in the cache.
*   Use strong and unpredictable cache key generation strategies.
*   Consider using signed cache entries to verify data integrity.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Polly Library](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_polly_library.md)

**Description:** Like any software dependency, *Polly* itself might contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application. This could range from denial of service to remote code execution, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.

**Impact:** Wide range of potential impacts, from denial of service to complete application compromise.

**Polly Component Affected:** Entire Polly library

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update Polly to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to Polly.
*   Implement a software composition analysis (SCA) process to identify and manage dependencies with known vulnerabilities.
