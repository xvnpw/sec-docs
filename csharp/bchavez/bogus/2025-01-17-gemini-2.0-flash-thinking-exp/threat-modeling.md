# Threat Model Analysis for bchavez/bogus

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the `bogus` Library](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the__bogus__library.md)

* **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in the `bogus` Library
    * **Description:** An attacker exploits a known security vulnerability within the `bogus` library itself (e.g., code injection, arbitrary code execution).
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application, data breach, denial of service.
    * **Affected Component:** The entire `bogus` library.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update the `bogus` library to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        * Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in `bogus`.
        * Follow security best practices for using third-party libraries.

## Threat: [Compromised `bogus` Repository or Distribution](./threats/compromised__bogus__repository_or_distribution.md)

* **Threat:** Compromised `bogus` Repository or Distribution
    * **Description:** An attacker compromises the official `bogus` repository or distribution channels and injects malicious code into the library. Developers unknowingly download and integrate this compromised version.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application, data breach, supply chain attack.
    * **Affected Component:** The entire `bogus` library and the application's dependency management process.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Verify the integrity of downloaded libraries (e.g., using checksums).
        * Use trusted package managers and repositories.
        * Implement software composition analysis (SCA) tools to detect potentially malicious dependencies.
