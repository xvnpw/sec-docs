## Attack Tree Path: [1. Predictable Data Generation](./attack_tree_paths/1__predictable_data_generation.md)

The overarching threat category focusing on the predictability of the data generated by `bogus`.

## Attack Tree Path: [-> HIGH RISK -> 1.1 Seed Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/-_high_risk_-_1_1_seed_manipulation.md)

Attacks that focus on controlling or predicting the seed used by the `bogus` library's pseudo-random number generator (PRNG).

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] 1.1.1 Default Seed Used](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__1_1_1_default_seed_used.md)

*   **Description:** The application developer fails to explicitly set a seed when initializing the `bogus` library.  This results in `bogus` using a default seed (or a seed derived from a predictable source like a low-resolution timestamp).
*   **Likelihood:** Very High - Common developer oversight.
*   **Impact:** Medium-High - Predictable data can lead to various issues, including compromised security if the data is used in security-sensitive contexts (even though `bogus` is not designed for this, misuse is possible).
*   **Effort:** Very Low - The attacker simply uses the application without providing a seed, or uses the same default environment.
*   **Skill Level:** Very Low - No special skills are required.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires code review or dynamic analysis to determine if a custom seed is being set.

## Attack Tree Path: [-> HIGH RISK -> 1.1.2 Predictable Seed Pattern](./attack_tree_paths/-_high_risk_-_1_1_2_predictable_seed_pattern.md)

*   **Description:** The application sets a seed, but the seed itself is generated using a predictable pattern (e.g., incrementing a counter, using a weak PRNG for the seed).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Less common than using a default seed, but still a significant risk.
*   **Impact:** Medium-High - Similar to using a default seed; predictable data generation.
*   **Effort:** Low-Medium - The attacker needs to analyze the seed generation process, potentially requiring access to source code or configuration.
*   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium - Requires some understanding of PRNGs and seed generation.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-High - Requires deeper code review and analysis of the seed generation logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Rule Set Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_rule_set_exploitation.md)

Attacks that focus on the rules used by `bogus` to generate data.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Known Rule Set Exposure](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_known_rule_set_exposure.md)

*  **Description:** The application's `bogus` rule set is exposed, allowing an attacker to analyze it and understand the data generation process.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Rule sets might be exposed through configuration files, API endpoints, or by analyzing generated data.
*   **Impact:** Medium. Knowing the rule set allows prediction of generated data, the impact depends on data usage.
*   **Effort:** Low. The attacker might need to find exposed configuration files or reverse-engineer the application.
*   **Skill Level:** Low. Basic understanding of configuration files and application structure.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low-Medium. Detectable through security audits, penetration testing, or monitoring for unusual access.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] 1.2.2 Custom Rule Injection](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__1_2_2_custom_rule_injection.md)

*   **Description:** The application allows user input (directly or indirectly) to influence the `bogus` rule set, enabling an attacker to inject malicious rules.
*   **Likelihood:** Low - Requires a significant application design flaw.
*   **Impact:** High-Very High - The attacker can completely control the generated data, potentially leading to severe security breaches (e.g., generating data that triggers SQL injection, XSS, or other vulnerabilities if the generated data is used insecurely).
*   **Effort:** Medium-High - The attacker needs to find a way to inject malicious rules, potentially requiring exploiting other vulnerabilities.
*   **Skill Level:** High - Requires a good understanding of `bogus`, the application's logic, and potentially other web application vulnerabilities.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-High - Requires careful code review, input validation testing, and potentially dynamic analysis.
