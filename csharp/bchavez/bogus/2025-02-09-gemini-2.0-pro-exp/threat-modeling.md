# Threat Model Analysis for bchavez/bogus

## Threat: [Threat 1: Production Exposure of Data Generation Endpoints](./threats/threat_1_production_exposure_of_data_generation_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers that endpoints or functions designed for development/testing, which utilize `bogus` to generate fake data, are accessible in the production environment.  The attacker sends requests to these endpoints, potentially with varying parameters, to trigger data generation. They might use automated tools to scan for common endpoint names (e.g., `/dev/users`, `/test/data`, etc.) or analyze client-side JavaScript for clues.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:**  Reveals internal API structure, data models, and potentially sensitive data patterns (even if the data itself is "fake").
        *   **Reconnaissance:**  Provides the attacker with valuable information for planning further attacks.
        *   **Potential for Data Misuse:**  Generated data, if substantial, could be used for malicious purposes (e.g., creating fake accounts on other services if patterns are predictable).
    *   **Bogus Component Affected:**  Any `bogus` function or module used within exposed endpoints or server-side logic (e.g., `faker.Person.FirstName()`, `faker.Internet.Email()`, entire modules like `bogus.Person`, `bogus.Address`, etc.). The vulnerability isn't in a specific `bogus` function, but rather in *any* `bogus` call that is exposed.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Code Separation:**  Use preprocessor directives (`#if DEBUG`), environment variables, or build configurations to *completely exclude* `bogus`-related code from production builds. This is the most crucial mitigation.
        *   **Endpoint Protection:**  Implement strict access controls on any development/testing endpoints. These should *never* be accessible in production. Use authentication and authorization even in development environments.
        *   **Code Reviews:**  Mandatory code reviews to identify and remove any `bogus` usage before deployment to production.
        *   **Automated Testing:**  Include automated tests that specifically check for the *absence* of `bogus` calls or related strings in production builds.
        *   **Feature Flags:** Use feature flags to disable any functionality that might inadvertently use `bogus`, even if the code is present.

## Threat: [Threat 2: Predictable Data Generation due to Fixed Seed (When Misused for Security)](./threats/threat_2_predictable_data_generation_due_to_fixed_seed__when_misused_for_security_.md)

*   **Description:**  The application uses `bogus` with a hardcoded or easily guessable seed value for the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG).  Crucially, this threat is HIGH severity *only when* `bogus` is misused to generate data that is then used in a security context (which it should *never* be). An attacker, knowing or guessing the seed, can predict the sequence of data generated by `bogus`. They might analyze the application's code (if available) or observe the generated data over time to deduce the seed.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Compromised Security:** If `bogus` is (incorrectly) used for security-sensitive data (e.g., temporary passwords, tokens), predictability makes these values easily guessable, directly compromising security.
    *   **Bogus Component Affected:**  The `faker.SetSeed()` function (or any mechanism used to set the seed) and, indirectly, all `bogus` data generation functions that rely on the seeded PRNG.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (only if misused for security-sensitive data generation)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never Use Bogus for Security:** This is the paramount mitigation. Use cryptographically secure random number generators (CSRNGs) for *any* security-related data generation (passwords, tokens, session IDs, etc.). `bogus` is *not* designed for this purpose.
        *   **Dynamic Seeding:** If a seed is needed for reproducibility in testing (and the data is *not* security-sensitive), use a different, randomly generated seed for each test run, or derive the seed from a non-predictable source.
        *   **Environment-Specific Seeds:** Use different seeds for different environments. Never use a production seed in a non-production environment.
        *   **Avoid Hardcoded Seeds:** Do not hardcode seed values. Use configuration files or environment variables.
