# Attack Surface Analysis for bchavez/bogus

## Attack Surface: [Production Data Leakage](./attack_surfaces/production_data_leakage.md)

*   **1. Production Data Leakage**

    *   **Description:** Unintentional exposure of fake data generated by `bogus` in the production environment.
    *   **How Bogus Contributes:** `bogus` is designed to create fake data; its primary function increases this risk if not properly controlled.
    *   **Example:** A user signs up, and their profile displays a fake address generated by `bogus` (e.g., "123 Fake St, Anytown, USA") because a development-only code path was accidentally included in the production build.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   User confusion and loss of trust.
        *   Potential legal or compliance issues (depending on the nature of the data).
        *   Reputational damage.
        *   Exposure of internal system details (naming conventions, data structures).
        *   Facilitates social engineering.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Environment Separation:** Ensure `bogus` is *only* a development dependency and is never included in production builds. Use build tools and CI/CD pipelines to enforce this.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Implement mandatory code reviews with a specific focus on preventing `bogus` calls from reaching production code.
        *   **Linting Rules:** Use linter configurations to flag and prevent the use of `bogus` in production code.
        *   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to conditionally execute `bogus` code, ensuring it's *only* active in development/testing environments.
        *   **Testing Database:** Use a separate, dedicated testing database that is regularly wiped and never contains real user data.
        *   **Feature Flags:** Wrap any `bogus`-related functionality in feature flags that are disabled by default in production.

## Attack Surface: [Predictable Data Generation (Seed Misuse)](./attack_surfaces/predictable_data_generation__seed_misuse_.md)

*   **2. Predictable Data Generation (Seed Misuse)**

    *   **Description:** Using a predictable or hardcoded seed for the `bogus` random number generator, leading to reproducible and potentially guessable data.
    *   **How Bogus Contributes:** `bogus` allows setting a seed, which, if misused, eliminates the randomness of the generated data.
    *   **Example:** A developer uses a hardcoded seed (e.g., `12345`) for generating "random" user IDs during testing. An attacker, knowing this, can predict the IDs of newly created test accounts.  (This is most dangerous if these test accounts somehow leak into production or have elevated privileges).
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromise of test accounts (if they have any significance).
        *   Increased predictability of system behavior, potentially aiding in the exploitation of other vulnerabilities.
        *   *Severe* impact if `bogus` is (incorrectly) used for security-sensitive data generation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** (if `bogus` data is used inappropriately);
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Security-Sensitive Use:** *Never* use `bogus` to generate data for security-critical functions (passwords, tokens, etc.).
        *   **Cryptographically Secure Seeds:** If a seed *must* be used (e.g., for reproducible test scenarios), use a cryptographically secure random number generator to create the seed.  Do *not* hardcode seeds.
        *   **No Seed by Default:** In most testing scenarios, avoid setting a seed explicitly to allow for more varied data generation.
        *   **Documentation:** Clearly document the intended use of seeds and the risks of predictable data.
