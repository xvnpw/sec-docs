# Threat Model Analysis for bchavez/bogus

## Threat: [Accidental Data Overwrite or Modification in Production](./threats/accidental_data_overwrite_or_modification_in_production.md)

Description:
    In a scenario with inadequate development practices and insufficient environment controls, developers might mistakenly deploy or execute code containing `bogus` library usage in a production environment.
    If this `bogus` code is designed to generate and write data (e.g., for database seeding or testing purposes), and if it is executed with write permissions in production, it could overwrite or modify real production data with fake data generated by `bogus`.
    This could happen due to accidental script execution, misconfiguration, or flawed deployment processes.
    An attacker exploiting a code injection vulnerability in production *could theoretically* also leverage accidentally present `bogus` code to overwrite data, although this is a more complex and less direct attack vector related to `bogus` itself. The primary risk is from accidental developer error.
Impact:
    Integrity Impact (Critical):  Severe corruption or loss of production data, leading to data inconsistencies, application malfunction, and potential business disruption.
    Availability Impact (High):  Application downtime required for data recovery and system restoration.
Bogus Component Affected:
    Entire Bogus Library: Any part of the library used to generate and potentially write data, especially features used for data seeding or bulk data generation.
Risk Severity: High (in environments with weak development and deployment controls; otherwise, risk is lower but impact remains critical if it occurs)
Mitigation Strategies:
    Strict Environment Separation (Critical):  Maintain absolutely rigid separation between development, testing, and production environments. Production environments should be locked down to prevent any accidental execution of development or testing code.
    Principle of Least Privilege (Critical):  Apply the principle of least privilege in production. Ensure that application code running in production has the minimum necessary permissions, and that development/testing tools or scripts (including those using `bogus`) do not have write access to production data stores.
    Immutable Infrastructure (High):  Utilize immutable infrastructure principles to minimize the possibility of runtime code changes in production. Deployments should be fully automated and controlled, preventing ad-hoc code execution.
    Automated Deployment Pipelines with Checks (High): Implement robust automated deployment pipelines with rigorous testing, code scanning, and configuration checks to prevent unintended code (like `bogus` usage) from reaching production. Pipelines should include steps to explicitly exclude development/testing dependencies from production builds.
    Code Reviews and Static Analysis (High):  Mandatory code reviews and static code analysis should specifically look for and flag any usage of `bogus` library in code intended for production deployment.
    Rollback Procedures (High):  Establish and regularly test comprehensive rollback procedures to quickly recover from accidental deployments or data corruption incidents, including scenarios where bogus data might have been introduced.
    Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) (Optional, High Value): Consider RASP solutions that can monitor application behavior in runtime and prevent unauthorized data modifications, potentially detecting and blocking accidental execution of data-writing `bogus` code in production.
