# Attack Tree Analysis for netchx/netch

Objective: To compromise application that use given project by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the project itself. This could lead to data breaches, service disruption, or lateral movement within the network.

## Attack Tree Visualization

            * Resource Exhaustion [HIGH RISK PATH]
                * Sending a large number of connection requests or malformed packets to overwhelm netch
            * Panic/Crash Exploits [HIGH RISK PATH]
                * Sending specific input that causes netch to panic or crash, disrupting service

                * Netch configured with overly permissive settings (e.g., allowing connections from any IP)
            * Insufficient Input Validation/Sanitization [HIGH RISK PATH]
                * Application passes unsanitized user input directly to netch functions, leading to exploits (if applicable - check netch API usage)
            * Lack of Rate Limiting/Throttling [HIGH RISK PATH]
                * Application doesn't limit the rate of requests to netch, making it vulnerable to DoS
    * [AND] Exploit Network Exposure via Netch [CRITICAL NODE]
        * [OR] Unauthorized Access via Port Mapping [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]
            * Lack of Access Control on Mapped Ports [HIGH RISK PATH]
                * Mapped ports are not properly secured by the application, allowing unauthorized access to services behind NAT

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Attack Goal: Compromise Application Using Netch [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__attack_goal_compromise_application_using_netch__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the overarching objective. Success at any of the sub-nodes contributes to achieving this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Netch Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_netch_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This node represents attacks that directly target weaknesses within the `netch` library's code or design.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Resource Exhaustion [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a large volume of connection requests or malformed network packets specifically crafted to overwhelm `netch`'s resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth).
            *   **Impact:** Service disruption, application unavailability, potential infrastructure instability.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Relatively easy to execute).
            *   **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting, input validation, resource management within `netch` and the application using it.
        *   **Panic/Crash Exploits [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Sending specific, crafted input (e.g., malformed STUN/TURN/ICE messages, unexpected data in network protocols) that triggers a panic or crash within the `netch` library.
            *   **Impact:** Service disruption, application crash, potential data corruption if crashes occur during critical operations.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Depends on code robustness and error handling in `netch`).
            *   **Mitigation:** Robust error handling in `netch`, input validation, fuzz testing to identify crash-inducing inputs.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Misconfiguration of Netch in Application [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__misconfiguration_of_netch_in_application__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

This node focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how developers configure and integrate `netch` into their applications.
    *   **Insecure Default Configuration [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** `netch` or the application using it is configured with overly permissive default settings. For example, allowing connections from any IP address without proper authentication or authorization.
        *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, increased attack surface, potential for further exploitation of the application.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Default configurations are often overlooked or assumed to be secure).
        *   **Mitigation:** Provide secure default configurations for `netch`, clearly document secure configuration practices, enforce principle of least privilege in configuration.
    *   **Insufficient Input Validation/Sanitization [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The application using `netch` fails to properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input before passing it to `netch` functions. This could lead to various vulnerabilities depending on how `netch` processes this input (e.g., if `netch` API allows for potentially unsafe operations based on input).
        *   **Impact:**  Depends on the specific vulnerability exposed by unsanitized input. Could range from information disclosure to code execution if `netch` API is misused.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common application vulnerability).
        *   **Mitigation:** Rigorous input validation and sanitization in the application before interacting with `netch` API. Follow secure coding practices.
    *   **Lack of Rate Limiting/Throttling [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The application does not implement rate limiting or throttling on requests made to `netch`. This makes the application vulnerable to DoS attacks targeting `netch`'s resources.
        *   **Impact:** Service disruption, application unavailability due to resource exhaustion in `netch`.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (DoS protection is often overlooked).
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms in the application to control the rate of requests to `netch`.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Network Exposure via Netch [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_network_exposure_via_netch__critical_node_.md)

This node addresses risks associated with `netch`'s core functionality of enabling network exposure and NAT traversal.
    *   **Unauthorized Access via Port Mapping [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Lack of Access Control on Mapped Ports [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** When `netch` creates port mappings to allow external access to services behind NAT, the application fails to implement proper access controls on these newly exposed ports. This allows unauthorized users to directly access internal services.
            *   **Impact:** Direct access to internal services, data breaches, potential for lateral movement within the network.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Developers might rely on NAT for security instead of application-level access controls).
            *   **Mitigation:** Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for services exposed through `netch` port mappings. Follow principle of least privilege for port exposure.

By focusing on mitigating these high-risk paths and securing these critical nodes, the development team can significantly improve the security of applications using `netch`. Remember to continuously monitor, test, and update security measures as the application and `netch` library evolve.
