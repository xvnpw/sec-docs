# Threat Model Analysis for netchx/netch

## Threat: [Unintentional Sensitive Data Capture](./threats/unintentional_sensitive_data_capture.md)

An attacker might gain access to logs or storage containing network traffic captured by `netch`. If `netch` capture filters are not properly configured, sensitive data like credentials, API keys, personal information, or confidential business data transmitted over the network could be unintentionally captured and stored. The attacker could then exploit this exposed data for malicious purposes such as identity theft or unauthorized access.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Captured Data](./threats/insecure_storage_of_captured_data.md)

An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the storage location used by `netch` to store captured network traffic. This could include weaknesses in file system permissions, database security, or insecure cloud storage configurations. By gaining unauthorized access to this storage, the attacker can retrieve and exploit the captured network traffic data, potentially including sensitive information.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in `netch` or Dependencies](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in__netch__or_dependencies.md)

An attacker could discover and exploit security vulnerabilities present within the `netch` library code itself or in its dependencies (such as `libpcap` or other network-related libraries). Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow the attacker to achieve remote code execution within the application using `netch`, escalate privileges, bypass security controls, or cause a denial of service.
