## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Netch's Core Logic](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_netch's_core_logic.md)

*   *Description:* This represents the primary attack surface directly related to the `netch` application's code. Exploiting vulnerabilities here gives the attacker direct control over `netch`'s behavior.
*   *Why Critical:*  Direct manipulation of `netch`'s core logic is the most straightforward path to achieving the attacker's goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: 1. Mode Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_1__mode_bypass.md)

*   *Description:*  `netch` uses different "modes" (TUN/TAP, Proxy, etc.) to manage network traffic. Bypassing these modes allows the attacker to circumvent intended security controls and configurations.
    *   *Why Critical:*  Modes are the core of `netch`'s functionality.  Bypassing them undermines the entire security model.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: 1a. Bypass Mode Selection Logic](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1a__bypass_mode_selection_logic.md)

*   *Description:*  The attacker manipulates the mechanism used to select the active mode in `netch`. This could involve modifying configuration files, exploiting flaws in command-line argument parsing, or interfering with the application's internal state.
    *   *Attack Vectors:*
        *   *Configuration File Tampering:*  Modifying `netch`'s configuration file to force it into a specific, vulnerable mode.
        *   *Command-Line Argument Injection:*  Providing malicious command-line arguments that override the intended mode selection.
        *   *Environment Variable Manipulation:*  Altering environment variables that influence mode selection.
        *   *Exploiting Input Validation Flaws:*  Finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in the code that parses and validates mode selection inputs.
        *   *Race Conditions:*  Exploiting timing vulnerabilities in the mode selection process.
    *  *Why High-Risk:* Relatively low effort, high impact, and medium likelihood.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: 1b. Bypass Mode Filtering Logic](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1b__bypass_mode_filtering_logic.md)

*   *Description:*  Each mode likely has associated filtering rules that determine which processes or traffic are routed through the VPN or proxy.  The attacker attempts to bypass these filters.
    *   *Attack Vectors:*
        *   *Filter Rule Manipulation:*  Modifying the filtering rules (if accessible) to allow unauthorized traffic or processes.
        *   *Process ID Spoofing:*  Masquerading as a legitimate process to bypass process-based filtering.
        *   *Exploiting Filter Implementation Flaws:*  Finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in the code that implements the filtering logic.
        *   *Bypassing Kernel-Level Filters:* If `netch` uses kernel-level filtering (e.g., iptables), the attacker might try to bypass or disable these filters.
    * *Why High-Risk:* Medium effort, high impact, and medium likelihood.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: 3a. Improper Permission Checks](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_3a__improper_permission_checks.md)

*   *Description:* `netch` likely requires elevated privileges for some operations.  If permission checks are flawed, an attacker could exploit `netch` to gain unauthorized privileges on the system.
    *   *Attack Vectors:*
        *   *Exploiting `setuid`/`setgid` Vulnerabilities:* If `netch` uses `setuid` or `setgid`, flaws in the code could allow privilege escalation.
        *   *Insufficient Privilege Dropping:*  If `netch` temporarily elevates privileges but fails to drop them properly, an attacker could exploit this.
        *   *Incorrect File Permissions:*  If configuration files or other sensitive resources have overly permissive permissions, an attacker could modify them to gain control.
        *   *Exploiting System Calls:*  Finding vulnerabilities in the way `netch` interacts with system calls that require elevated privileges.
    *   *Why Critical:*  Direct path to gaining full system control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: 4a. MITM via Mode (e.g., TUN)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_4a__mitm_via_mode__e_g___tun_.md)

*   *Description:*  If the attacker can control the configuration of a TUN/TAP interface created by `netch`, they can position themselves as a Man-in-the-Middle, intercepting and potentially modifying network traffic.
    *   *Attack Vectors:*
        *   *Compromising TUN/TAP Configuration:*  Gaining write access to the configuration files or settings that control the TUN/TAP interface.
        *   *Exploiting Mode Bypass (1a/1b):*  Using mode bypass techniques to force `netch` to create a TUN/TAP interface with attacker-controlled settings.
        *   *DNS Spoofing/Poisoning:*  Redirecting traffic to the attacker's controlled interface by manipulating DNS resolution.
        *   *ARP Spoofing/Poisoning:*  (Less likely with TUN, but possible) Manipulating ARP tables to redirect traffic.
    *   *Why Critical:*  Allows for complete interception and manipulation of network traffic, a very high-impact outcome.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: 5a. Config Exploitation (v2ray-core)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_5a__config_exploitation__v2ray-core_.md)

*   *Description:* Attacker crafts a malicious configuration file for the `v2ray-core` dependency, exploiting vulnerabilities within `v2ray-core` itself.
    *   *Attack Vectors:*
        *   *Injecting Malicious Configuration Directives:*  Inserting configuration options that trigger known vulnerabilities in `v2ray-core`.
        *   *Exploiting Parser Flaws:*  Finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in the code that parses the `v2ray-core` configuration file.
        *   *Using Outdated/Vulnerable `v2ray-core` Versions:*  Exploiting known vulnerabilities in older versions of `v2ray-core` if `netch` doesn't use the latest version.
    * *Why Critical:* `v2ray-core` is a complex component, and vulnerabilities here can have significant consequences.
