## Threat: [Malicious Configuration Injection](./threats/malicious_configuration_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Configuration Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious `.nch` (or other configuration file format) and distributes it to users.  The malicious configuration redirects the user's traffic through an attacker-controlled server, allowing for traffic interception, modification, or blocking.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete compromise of user's network traffic routed through Netch.
        *   Potential for data theft (credentials, game data, personal information).
        *   Man-in-the-middle attacks.
        *   Redirection to malicious websites or services.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration parsing module (`ConfigLoader`, `ConfigParser`, or similar), file handling routines, network setup routines that use the loaded configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Implement strong input validation and sanitization for all configuration file data.
            *   Use a secure configuration file format (e.g., digitally signed, encrypted).
            *   Implement integrity checks (checksums, digital signatures) for configuration files.
            *   Sandbox the configuration loading process to limit its privileges.
            *   Provide a mechanism to verify the server's identity (e.g., display IP, hostname, certificate details).
        *   **User:**
            *   Only use configuration files from trusted sources.
            *   Verify the configuration file's integrity (if checksums are provided).
