### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving `netch`

This list details high and critical severity threats that directly involve the `netch` library.

* **Threat:** Insecure Default TLS Configuration
    * **Description:** An attacker could exploit `netch`'s default settings if they don't enforce strong TLS configurations *within the `netch` library's configuration*. This allows for downgrade attacks or interception of communication if the server supports weaker protocols or ciphers, and `netch` doesn't prevent it. The attacker might perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack to eavesdrop on or modify the data exchanged between the application and the external service.
    * **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted via `netch`. Sensitive information could be exposed or manipulated.
    * **Affected `netch` Component:** TLS Configuration (e.g., `tls` option, `rejectUnauthorized`).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Explicitly configure `netch` to enforce strong TLS protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher) when initializing the client.
        * Enable certificate verification (`rejectUnauthorized: true`) in `netch`'s options.
        * Consider using certificate pinning within the `netch` configuration for critical services.

* **Threat:** Disabled TLS Verification
    * **Description:** A developer might mistakenly disable TLS verification *in `netch`'s configuration* (e.g., `rejectUnauthorized: false`) for testing or due to misunderstanding. An attacker could then easily perform a MITM attack, as `netch` will trust any certificate presented by the server, even if it's self-signed or invalid.
    * **Impact:** Complete loss of confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted via `netch`. The attacker can intercept and modify all communication handled by `netch`.
    * **Affected `netch` Component:** TLS Configuration (`rejectUnauthorized` option).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Never disable TLS verification in `netch`'s configuration in production environments.
        * Implement code reviews to catch instances of disabled TLS verification in `netch`'s setup.
        * Use environment-specific configurations to ensure strict security settings for `netch` in production.

* **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities in `netch` or its Dependencies
    * **Description:** `netch` itself or its underlying dependencies might contain known security vulnerabilities. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities if the application uses an outdated version of the library. This directly involves the security of the `netch` library and its ecosystem.
    * **Impact:** Various impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, ranging from information disclosure to remote code execution *within the application using `netch`*.
    * **Affected `netch` Component:** The entire library and its dependencies.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update `netch` to the latest version.
        * Use dependency scanning tools to identify and address vulnerabilities in `netch` and its dependencies.
        * Monitor security advisories specifically for `netch` and its ecosystem.
