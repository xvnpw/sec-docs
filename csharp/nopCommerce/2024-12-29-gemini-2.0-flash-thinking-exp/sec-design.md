    end
```

## 5. Data Flow

The following describes the data flow for several common user interactions, providing more detail than the previous version:

*   **Customer Browsing Products:**
    *   User sends an HTTP GET request to the Presentation Layer (Web UI), specifically the Storefront, to view a product catalog or details.
    *   The Presentation Layer's controller action calls the appropriate service in the Application Layer (e.g., `IProductService.GetProducts()`).
    *   The Application Layer service utilizes the Data Access Layer's repository or database context to query the Database for product information (including details, images, pricing, etc.).
    *   The Database returns the requested product data to the Data Access Layer.
    *   The Data Access Layer maps the database results to domain entities and returns them to the Application Layer.
    *   The Application Layer processes the data (e.g., applies discounts, formats prices) and returns a data transfer object (DTO) to the Presentation Layer.
    *   The Presentation Layer's view engine renders the product information into HTML and sends it back to the user's browser as an HTTP response.
*   **Customer Adding Product to Cart:**
    *   User interacts with the Storefront (e.g., clicks an "Add to Cart" button), sending an HTTP POST request to the Presentation Layer.
    *   The Presentation Layer's controller action calls the Application Layer's shopping cart service (e.g., `IShoppingCartService.AddToCart()`).
    *   The Application Layer service retrieves the product information from the Data Access Layer.
    *   The service updates the shopping cart data, typically stored in the Database (for persistent carts) or in a session store (for temporary carts).
    *   If using a database, the Data Access Layer is used to persist the changes.
    *   The updated cart information (e.g., item count, total price) is returned to the Presentation Layer.
    *   The Presentation Layer updates the cart display on the user's interface.
*   **Customer Placing an Order:**
    *   User initiates the checkout process through the Storefront, involving multiple steps and interactions with the Presentation Layer.
    *   The Presentation Layer interacts with various services in the Application Layer for order processing steps:
        *   Address selection (`IAddressService`).
        *   Shipping method selection (`IShippingService`).
        *   Payment method selection and processing (`IPaymentService`, potentially involving Plugins for specific payment gateways).
    *   The Application Layer interacts with external services (e.g., payment gateways) through Plugins or direct integrations, securely transmitting payment information.
    *   Order details, including customer information, shipping details, and payment information, are persisted in the Database via the Data Access Layer.
    *   Inventory levels are updated in the Database.
    *   Confirmation emails are sent to the customer and administrator via the Infrastructure Layer's email service.
    *   The Presentation Layer displays an order confirmation page to the user.
*   **Administrator Managing Products:**
    *   Administrator logs into the Administration Panel (Presentation Layer) using secure authentication.
    *   Administrator interacts with the UI to create, update, or delete product information, sending HTTP requests to the Presentation Layer.
    *   The Presentation Layer's controller actions call the appropriate services in the Application Layer (e.g., `IProductService.CreateProduct()`, `IProductService.UpdateProduct()`, `IProductService.DeleteProduct()`).
    *   The Application Layer services use the Data Access Layer to modify product data in the Database.
    *   Changes are reflected in the Administration Panel's user interface.
    *   Audit logs are generated via the Infrastructure Layer's logging service to track administrative actions.
