# Attack Surface Analysis for jamesnk/newtonsoft.json

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Deserialization via `TypeNameHandling`](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_deserialization_via__typenamehandling_.md)

*   **Description:** Deserializing JSON with `TypeNameHandling` enabled allows the deserializer to instantiate types specified within the JSON payload. This feature, when misused, becomes a critical vulnerability as it can be exploited to instantiate arbitrary, potentially malicious types.
*   **Newtonsoft.Json Contribution:** `TypeNameHandling` is a core feature of Newtonsoft.Json that directly introduces this attack surface. It provides the mechanism to embed and interpret type information during deserialization, which can be abused if not strictly controlled.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a JSON payload containing type information for a known gadget class (e.g., `System.Windows.Forms.AxHost+State`) that can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code when deserialized by Newtonsoft.Json with permissive `TypeNameHandling` settings. This payload, when processed by the application, leads to code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid `TypeNameHandling`:**  The most effective mitigation is to completely avoid using `TypeNameHandling` if possible. Re-design application logic to not rely on embedding type information in JSON.
    *   **Use `TypeNameHandling.None`:** Explicitly set `TypeNameHandling` to `None` to disable type handling and prevent the deserializer from interpreting type information from the JSON.
    *   **Restrictive `TypeNameHandling.Auto` with `SerializationBinder`:** If `TypeNameHandling` is absolutely necessary, use `TypeNameHandling.Auto` in conjunction with a highly restrictive and carefully curated `SerializationBinder`. This `SerializationBinder` should act as a whitelist, allowing only explicitly permitted types to be deserialized and denying all others.  Regularly review and update the whitelist.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data Exploiting Custom Logic Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data_exploiting_custom_logic_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** When applications implement custom deserialization logic using Newtonsoft.Json's extensibility points (like `JsonConverter` or manual `JObject`/`JToken` parsing), vulnerabilities within this custom code can be exploited through crafted JSON input. This attack surface arises from flaws in developer-written deserialization code interacting with Newtonsoft.Json.
*   **Newtonsoft.Json Contribution:** Newtonsoft.Json provides the framework and tools (`JsonConverter`, `JObject`, `JToken`) that enable custom deserialization.  While not directly vulnerable itself in this scenario, it is the library through which the application processes malicious JSON that triggers vulnerabilities in the *custom* deserialization logic.
*   **Example:** A custom `JsonConverter` designed to handle a specific data type might contain a buffer overflow vulnerability when processing excessively long strings from the JSON. An attacker can send a JSON payload with a very long string in a field handled by this converter, triggering the buffer overflow during deserialization performed by Newtonsoft.Json using the custom converter.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure, potentially Remote Code Execution (depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom deserialization logic).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Code Review and Testing of Custom Logic:**  Conduct thorough security code reviews and rigorous testing specifically targeting all custom deserialization code (including `JsonConverter` implementations and manual parsing). Focus on identifying potential vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, injection flaws, and logic errors.
    *   **Follow Secure Coding Practices:** Adhere to secure coding principles when developing custom deserialization logic. Pay close attention to input validation, error handling, and memory management within the custom code.
    *   **Minimize Custom Code:**  Whenever feasible, leverage built-in Newtonsoft.Json features and attributes to reduce the need for complex custom deserialization logic. Simpler code is generally easier to secure.
    *   **Unit and Integration Testing:** Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests for custom deserialization components. Include test cases with malformed, unexpected, and potentially malicious JSON inputs to ensure robustness and identify vulnerabilities early in the development cycle.
