## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the overarching high-risk category. It encompasses exploiting weaknesses in how Newtonsoft.Json deserializes data, potentially leading to code execution, denial of service, or other security breaches.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  Prioritize secure deserialization practices, input validation, and minimizing the attack surface related to JSON processing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse TypeNameHandling Settings](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_typenamehandling_settings.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on the most critical vulnerability: insecure use of `TypeNameHandling`. When `TypeNameHandling` is enabled with settings like `Auto`, `Objects`, `All`, or `Arrays`, it allows an attacker to control the types being deserialized. This can be leveraged to instantiate arbitrary .NET types, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  **Completely disable `TypeNameHandling` if possible.** If absolutely necessary, use `TypeNameHandling.None` by default and implement strict allow lists for specific scenarios. Thoroughly review code for insecure `TypeNameHandling` configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Deserialization Endpoint](./attack_tree_paths/identify_deserialization_endpoint.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers must first identify endpoints in the application that accept JSON data and use Newtonsoft.Json for deserialization. This is a prerequisite for exploiting any deserialization vulnerability.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   Analyze application routes and APIs.
    *   Review code for usage of `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject`, `JsonConvert.PopulateObject`, or `JsonSerializerSettings`.
    *   Examine documentation or API specifications.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  Minimize the number of exposed JSON deserialization endpoints. Implement strict authentication and authorization on these endpoints.

## Attack Tree Path: [Determine TypeNameHandling Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/determine_typenamehandling_configuration.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Once a deserialization endpoint is found, attackers need to determine if and how `TypeNameHandling` is configured. This information is crucial for crafting a successful exploit.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   Analyze application code and configuration files (e.g., `web.config`, `appsettings.json`).
    *   Debug the running application to inspect `JsonSerializerSettings`.
    *   Attempt to trigger errors that might reveal configuration details.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  Securely manage configuration and prevent unauthorized access to configuration files. Avoid exposing configuration details in error messages.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Malicious JSON Payload with TypeNameHandling](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_json_payload_with_typenamehandling.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Based on the `TypeNameHandling` configuration, attackers craft a malicious JSON payload that exploits deserialization vulnerabilities. This typically involves using the `$type` property to specify a malicious .NET type.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   Utilize known .NET gadget chains (e.g., using tools like `ysoserial.net`).
    *   Embed gadget chains within the `$type` property in the JSON payload.
    *   Target vulnerable types based on the `TypeNameHandling` setting.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  Disable insecure `TypeNameHandling`. Implement input validation and sanitization even if `TypeNameHandling` is used (though disabling is the strongest mitigation).

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Gadget Chains](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce__via_gadget_chains.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the most severe outcome of `TypeNameHandling` abuse. Attackers use known .NET gadget chains within the malicious JSON payload to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   Leverage pre-built gadget chains or develop custom chains.
    *   Embed the chosen gadget chain within the `$type` property.
    *   Send the malicious JSON to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  **Prevent `TypeNameHandling` abuse.** Regularly update Newtonsoft.Json and .NET framework to patch known vulnerabilities. Implement robust security monitoring to detect suspicious activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass TypeNameHandling Restrictions (if any)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_typenamehandling_restrictions__if_any_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the application attempts to mitigate `TypeNameHandling` risks by implementing whitelists, blacklists, or custom deserialization logic, attackers will try to bypass these restrictions.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  Avoid relying solely on whitelists or blacklists for `TypeNameHandling` mitigation as they are often bypassable.  Focus on disabling `TypeNameHandling` entirely. If restrictions are used, ensure they are rigorously tested and regularly reviewed for bypasses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Implemented TypeNameHandling Restrictions](./attack_tree_paths/identify_implemented_typenamehandling_restrictions.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** To bypass restrictions, attackers must first understand what restrictions are in place. This involves analyzing code for custom deserialization logic, binders, or type filters.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   Code review to identify custom deserialization logic.
    *   Reverse engineering to understand implemented filters or binders.
    *   Testing with various payloads to probe for restrictions.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  Minimize the complexity of custom deserialization logic. Securely manage and protect any custom security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Find Bypass for Restrictions](./attack_tree_paths/find_bypass_for_restrictions.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Once restrictions are understood, attackers research and attempt to find bypasses. This often involves exploiting weaknesses in the restriction logic itself or using type confusion techniques.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   Research known bypasses for common restriction patterns.
    *   Experiment with type confusion attacks.
    *   Analyze custom logic for vulnerabilities or loopholes.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  Assume that any restrictions can be bypassed. Focus on defense-in-depth and layered security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Weak Whitelists](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_weak_whitelists.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Whitelists intended to limit allowed types for deserialization can be weak if they are too broad or include types that can still be exploited indirectly.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   Analyze the whitelist for overly permissive entries.
    *   Identify types within the whitelist that can be used as part of gadget chains or for other exploits.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  If whitelists are used, make them as narrow and specific as possible. Regularly review and update whitelists.

## Attack Tree Path: [Type Confusion Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/type_confusion_attacks.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Type confusion attacks aim to confuse the deserializer by providing unexpected types or structures that bypass intended restrictions.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   Experiment with different JSON structures and type hints.
    *   Attempt to exploit differences in how the deserializer handles various types.
    *   Look for edge cases or unexpected behaviors in the deserialization process.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  Implement robust input validation and schema validation to enforce expected data types and structures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Logic Errors in Custom Deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_logic_errors_in_custom_deserialization.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If custom deserialization logic is implemented, it may contain logic errors or vulnerabilities that can be exploited to bypass security measures or achieve unintended behavior.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   Analyze custom deserialization code for logic flaws.
    *   Identify potential injection points or vulnerabilities in custom logic.
    *   Craft payloads that exploit these logic errors.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  Thoroughly review and test custom deserialization logic. Follow secure coding practices and minimize the complexity of custom code.
