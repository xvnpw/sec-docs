# Threat Model Analysis for jamesnk/newtonsoft.json

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization via `TypeNameHandling`](./threats/insecure_deserialization_via__typenamehandling_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload containing type information (when `TypeNameHandling` is enabled). Upon deserialization using `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject` or `JsonSerializer.Deserialize`, Newtonsoft.Json instantiates attacker-controlled types. This can be exploited to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by instantiating classes that execute arbitrary code during construction or through other lifecycle methods. The attacker might gain full control of the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete system compromise, data breach, Denial of Service (DoS).
    *   **Newtonsoft.Json Component Affected:** `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject`, `JsonSerializer.Deserialize`, `TypeNameHandling` setting, `SerializationBinder`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable `TypeNameHandling`:**  Avoid using `TypeNameHandling` altogether if possible.
        *   **Use `TypeNameHandling.None`:**  Explicitly set `TypeNameHandling` to `None` to disable type name handling. This is the most secure default for deserializing untrusted data.
        *   **Implement a Strict Whitelist `SerializationBinder`:** If `TypeNameHandling` is absolutely necessary (e.g., for legacy systems or specific interoperability requirements), use `TypeNameHandling.Objects` or `TypeNameHandling.Arrays` **only** in conjunction with a highly restrictive `SerializationBinder`. This binder must explicitly whitelist only the absolutely necessary types for deserialization and reject all others.  Default to deny.
        *   **Regularly Update Newtonsoft.Json:** Ensure you are using the latest patched version of Newtonsoft.Json to mitigate known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Large JSON Payloads](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_large_json_payloads.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends excessively large JSON payloads to the application endpoint that uses Newtonsoft.Json for deserialization.  When `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject` or similar methods are used to process this payload, it can consume excessive CPU and memory resources on the server. This can lead to the application becoming unresponsive, slow, or crashing, effectively denying service to legitimate users. The attacker aims to exhaust server resources.
    *   **Impact:** Service unavailability, application slowdown, resource exhaustion, potential application crash, impacting business continuity.
    *   **Newtonsoft.Json Component Affected:** `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject`, `JsonTextReader`, JSON parsing engine, memory allocation during parsing.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Input Size Limits:** Restrict the maximum allowed size of incoming JSON requests at the application or infrastructure level (e.g., web server, API gateway).
        *   **Set Nesting Depth Limits:** Configure `JsonSerializerSettings` to limit the maximum depth of nested JSON objects and arrays during deserialization. This prevents deeply nested malicious payloads from consuming excessive resources.
        *   **Implement Deserialization Timeouts:** Set timeouts for JSON deserialization operations to prevent indefinite processing of potentially malicious payloads. If deserialization takes longer than the timeout, terminate the operation.
        *   **Use Streaming API for Large Data (if applicable):** If dealing with potentially large JSON datasets, consider using `JsonTextReader` for streaming parsing instead of loading the entire payload into memory at once. This can reduce memory footprint and improve performance for large inputs.
        *   **Resource Monitoring and Rate Limiting:** Implement robust server resource monitoring (CPU, memory) and rate limiting to detect and mitigate DoS attempts.  Alerting should be in place to notify administrators of unusual resource consumption.

## Threat: [Memory Exhaustion via Complex JSON Structures](./threats/memory_exhaustion_via_complex_json_structures.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts JSON payloads with highly complex structures, such as deeply nested objects or arrays, or extremely long strings within JSON values. When Newtonsoft.Json attempts to deserialize these structures using `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject` or similar methods, it can trigger excessive memory allocation. This can lead to memory exhaustion, causing the application to crash or become unstable. The attacker aims to crash the application by forcing it to consume all available memory.
    *   **Impact:** Application crashes, service unavailability, memory exhaustion, instability, potentially impacting other applications on the same server if resources are shared.
    *   **Newtonsoft.Json Component Affected:** `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject`, `JsonSerializer.Deserialize`, memory allocation mechanisms within Newtonsoft.Json during deserialization.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation and Schema Enforcement:** Validate the structure and content of incoming JSON payloads against a predefined schema. Reject payloads that do not conform to the expected schema or contain suspicious structures (e.g., excessive nesting, unusually long strings).
        *   **Limit String and Array Lengths in Deserialization Settings:** Configure `JsonSerializerSettings` to set maximum limits for string lengths and array sizes during deserialization. This can prevent the deserializer from allocating excessive memory for very large strings or arrays.
        *   **Resource Limits (Memory Limits at OS/Container Level):** Configure operating system or container-level memory limits for the application process. This prevents uncontrolled memory consumption from crashing the entire system and isolates the impact of memory exhaustion to the application itself.
        *   **Regular Memory Usage Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement continuous monitoring of application memory usage. Set up alerts to notify administrators when memory consumption exceeds predefined thresholds, allowing for proactive intervention and investigation.

## Threat: [Critical Vulnerabilities Introduced by Insecure Custom `JsonConverter` Implementations](./threats/critical_vulnerabilities_introduced_by_insecure_custom__jsonconverter__implementations.md)

*   **Description:** Developers may create custom `JsonConverter` classes to handle serialization and deserialization of specific types within Newtonsoft.Json. If these custom converters are not implemented with robust security considerations, they can introduce critical vulnerabilities. For example, a poorly written custom converter might perform insecure deserialization itself, be susceptible to injection flaws, or mishandle data in a way that leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE) or other high-impact issues when used within the Newtonsoft.Json deserialization process. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by crafting specific JSON payloads that trigger the vulnerable custom converter logic.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, depending on the specific vulnerability introduced in the custom converter.  Can lead to complete system compromise in RCE scenarios.
    *   **Newtonsoft.Json Component Affected:** Custom `JsonConverter` classes, `JsonSerializer`, `JsonConvert`, the overall extensibility mechanism of Newtonsoft.Json.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom converter)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory Security Code Reviews for Custom Converters:** Implement mandatory and rigorous security-focused code reviews for all custom `JsonConverter` implementations before deployment. Reviews should specifically look for insecure deserialization patterns, injection vulnerabilities, and improper data handling.
        *   **Secure Coding Practices for Converter Development:** Enforce secure coding practices during the development of custom converters. This includes thorough input validation, output encoding, proper error handling, and adherence to the principle of least privilege.
        *   **Prefer Built-in Converters and Minimize Custom Code:** Whenever possible, utilize the built-in converters provided by Newtonsoft.Json. Minimize the use of custom converters to reduce the attack surface and the risk of introducing vulnerabilities through custom code.
        *   **Thorough Testing and Vulnerability Scanning of Converters:** Conduct comprehensive testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and vulnerability scanning, specifically targeting custom `JsonConverter` implementations.  Include fuzzing and penetration testing to identify potential weaknesses.
        *   **Security Audits for Applications Using Custom Converters:** Regularly perform security audits of applications that utilize custom `JsonConverter` classes to identify and remediate any potential vulnerabilities introduced by these converters.
