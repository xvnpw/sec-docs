## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This is the primary attack vector when using Newtonsoft.Json, especially when deserializing data from untrusted sources. The library's ability to deserialize JSON into .NET objects can be abused if not handled carefully.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) (HIGH RISK PATH) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/2__achieve_remote_code_execution__rce___high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

The most severe outcome, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

    *   **Exploit Insecure Type Handling (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   Newtonsoft.Json allows embedding type information within the JSON payload using the `$type` property. If `TypeNameHandling` is enabled (especially `Auto` or `All`), an attacker can control the types that are instantiated during deserialization.

        *   **Send Malicious JSON with Type Information ($type) (CRITICAL NODE):**
            *   The attacker crafts a JSON payload that instructs Newtonsoft.Json to instantiate a dangerous class that can lead to code execution.

            *   **Utilize known gadget chains within .NET Framework or application dependencies (HIGH RISK PATH):**
                *   Attackers leverage existing classes with specific properties and methods that, when combined in a particular sequence during deserialization, can execute arbitrary code. Popular gadget chains involve classes like `ObjectDataProvider` or `LosFormatter`. By specifying these types in the `$type` property, the attacker can force their instantiation and trigger the malicious sequence.

    *   **Exploit Deserialization Bugs in Newtonsoft.Json (CRITICAL NODE) (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        *   Like any software, Newtonsoft.Json might contain bugs that can be exploited during deserialization.

        *   **Trigger known RCE vulnerabilities in specific Newtonsoft.Json versions (CRITICAL NODE):**
            *   Attackers target applications using outdated or vulnerable versions of the library. Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) often provide details on how to exploit specific versions of Newtonsoft.Json.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Achieve Denial of Service (DoS) (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/3__achieve_denial_of_service__dos___high_risk_path_.md)

Rendering the application unavailable.

    *   **Send Malicious JSON causing excessive resource consumption (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   This involves crafting JSON payloads that consume significant server resources, leading to performance degradation or application crashes.

        *   Specifically, this includes:
            *   Sending deeply nested JSON objects leading to stack overflow.
            *   Sending extremely large JSON strings causing memory exhaustion.
            *   Sending JSON with circular references leading to infinite loops.
