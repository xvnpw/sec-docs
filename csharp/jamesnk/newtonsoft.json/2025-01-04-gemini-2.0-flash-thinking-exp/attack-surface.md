# Attack Surface Analysis for jamesnk/newtonsoft.json

## Attack Surface: [Type Confusion/Polymorphic Deserialization Vulnerability](./attack_surfaces/type_confusionpolymorphic_deserialization_vulnerability.md)

*   **Newtonsoft.Json Contribution:** When `TypeNameHandling` is enabled (especially `Auto`, `Objects`, `Arrays`, or `All`), Newtonsoft.Json includes type information in the serialized JSON. This allows deserialization to a specific type. Attackers can manipulate this type information to force deserialization into unexpected, potentially dangerous types.
    *   **Example:** A JSON payload like `{"$type": "System.Windows.Forms.AxHost+State, System.Windows.Forms, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089", "control": "System.Diagnostics.Process, System, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089", "fileName": "cmd", "arguments": "/c calc"}` could be used if `TypeNameHandling` is enabled, potentially leading to code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid using `TypeNameHandling.Auto` or `All` unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.**
        *   If `TypeNameHandling` is required, use more restrictive settings like `Objects` or `Arrays` and carefully control the allowed types for deserialization using `SerializationBinder`.
        *   Implement strong input validation and sanitization on data before deserialization.
        *   Consider using a whitelist of allowed types for deserialization.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data Leading to Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data_leading_to_exploitation.md)

*   **Newtonsoft.Json Contribution:** The library's core functionality is deserializing JSON into objects. If the application deserializes data from untrusted sources without proper validation, attackers can craft malicious JSON payloads to exploit vulnerabilities in the application's object model or dependencies. This can occur even without explicit `TypeNameHandling` if the application's structure allows for gadget chains.
    *   **Example:** An attacker might send a JSON payload that, when deserialized, triggers a chain of method calls leading to arbitrary code execution through existing vulnerabilities in the application's dependencies or the .NET framework.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Treat all data from external sources as untrusted.**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization before deserialization.
        *   Consider using a schema validation library to ensure the JSON structure conforms to expectations.
        *   Minimize the attack surface by only deserializing the necessary data.
        *   Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
