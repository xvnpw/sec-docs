# Threat Model Analysis for jamesnk/newtonsoft.json

## Threat: [Type Confusion via Deserialization](./threats/type_confusion_via_deserialization.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious JSON payloads containing type information that, when deserialized by Newtonsoft.Json, instantiates objects of unexpected and potentially dangerous types. The attacker might leverage this to execute arbitrary code by instantiating classes with harmful side effects in their constructors or methods. This directly exploits the functionality of Newtonsoft.Json's `TypeNameHandling`.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to gain full control over the application server or client. Sensitive data could also be accessed or modified.

**Affected Component:** `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject`, `JsonSerializer.Deserialize`, `TypeNameHandling` settings, `SerializationBinder`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid using `TypeNameHandling` unless absolutely necessary.**  The default `TypeNameHandling.None` is the most secure.
*   **If `TypeNameHandling` is required, use the most restrictive setting possible (e.g., `Objects` or `Arrays`).** Avoid `Auto` and `All`.
*   **Implement a secure `SerializationBinder` that strictly validates the incoming type names against a whitelist of allowed types.** Do not rely on blacklists.
*   **Do not deserialize JSON from untrusted sources.**  Validate the source and integrity of the data.
*   **Keep Newtonsoft.Json updated to the latest version** to benefit from security patches.

## Threat: [Gadget Chain Exploitation during Deserialization](./threats/gadget_chain_exploitation_during_deserialization.md)

**Description:** An attacker constructs a JSON payload that, when deserialized by Newtonsoft.Json, triggers a chain of method calls within the application's dependencies or the application itself. These method calls, when executed in sequence, can lead to unintended and harmful actions, such as arbitrary code execution. Newtonsoft.Json's deserialization process is the direct mechanism by which these chains are activated.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to gain control over the application.

**Affected Component:** `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject`, `JsonSerializer.Deserialize`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Keep Newtonsoft.Json and all application dependencies updated** to patch known gadget chain vulnerabilities.
*   **Implement the principle of least privilege.** Limit the permissions of the application and its components.
*   **Consider using static analysis tools** to identify potential gadget chain entry points and vulnerable code paths.
*   **Avoid deserializing JSON from untrusted sources.**

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Large or Deeply Nested JSON Payloads](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_large_or_deeply_nested_json_payloads.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted JSON payload that is extremely large or contains deeply nested structures. When Newtonsoft.Json attempts to parse and deserialize this payload, it can consume excessive CPU and memory resources, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users. This is a direct consequence of how Newtonsoft.Json processes JSON data.

**Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation, resource exhaustion on the server.

**Affected Component:** `JsonTextReader`, `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject`, `JsonSerializer.Deserialize`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Implement limits on the size of incoming JSON payloads.**
*   **Configure Newtonsoft.Json's `JsonSerializerSettings` to limit the maximum depth of the object graph and the maximum number of objects to deserialize.** Use `MaxDepth` and related settings.
*   **Implement timeouts for deserialization operations.**

## Threat: [Insecure Custom `SerializationBinder`](./threats/insecure_custom__serializationbinder_.md)

**Description:** When using `TypeNameHandling`, developers might implement a custom `SerializationBinder` to control type mapping during deserialization. A poorly implemented binder that doesn't properly validate type names or allows loading arbitrary types can be exploited by attackers to perform type confusion attacks. This directly relates to how Newtonsoft.Json utilizes the provided `SerializationBinder`.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Information Disclosure, similar to type confusion vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** Custom `SerializationBinder` implementation interacting with Newtonsoft.Json's deserialization process.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Ensure the custom `SerializationBinder` strictly validates the incoming type names against a whitelist of allowed types.**
*   **Avoid using dynamic type loading or reflection within the binder without thorough security checks.**
*   **Keep the `SerializationBinder` logic simple and auditable.**
*   **Thoroughly test the `SerializationBinder` with various malicious inputs.**
