## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable `TypeNameHandling` and Implement Strict Controls](./mitigation_strategies/disable__typenamehandling__and_implement_strict_controls.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable `TypeNameHandling` and Implement Strict Controls
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Locate `TypeNameHandling` usage:** Search your codebase for instances where `TypeNameHandling` is set within `JsonSerializerSettings` or in `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject/SerializeObject` calls when using Newtonsoft.Json.
    2.  **Set `TypeNameHandling.None`:**  Modify your Newtonsoft.Json configurations to explicitly set `TypeNameHandling = TypeNameHandling.None` as the default. This disables the problematic type name handling feature of Newtonsoft.Json globally.
    3.  **Analyze Polymorphism Needs:** Review areas where you previously relied on Newtonsoft.Json's `TypeNameHandling`. Determine if polymorphic deserialization is truly essential for your application's functionality when using Newtonsoft.Json.
    4.  **Whitelist Allowed Types (if polymorphism needed):** If polymorphic deserialization with Newtonsoft.Json is unavoidable:
        *   **Create Custom `SerializationBinder`:** Implement a custom class inheriting from Newtonsoft.Json's `SerializationBinder`. Override the `BindToType` method to strictly validate and only allow deserialization of types explicitly included in your whitelist.
        *   **Apply Custom Binder:** Configure Newtonsoft.Json's `JsonSerializerSettings.SerializationBinder` to use your custom binder when deserializing JSON in areas requiring polymorphism.
    5.  **Validate Deserialized Objects:**  Regardless of `TypeNameHandling` settings, after deserialization using Newtonsoft.Json, thoroughly validate the properties and state of the resulting objects to ensure they conform to expected values and business logic. This adds a layer of defense even if unexpected types are somehow deserialized by Newtonsoft.Json.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (Remote Code Execution - RCE) via `TypeNameHandling`:** Severity: **High**. This directly mitigates the most critical vulnerability in Newtonsoft.Json related to insecure deserialization through `TypeNameHandling`.
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (Denial of Service - DoS) via `TypeNameHandling`:** Severity: **Medium**. Malicious payloads exploiting `TypeNameHandling` in Newtonsoft.Json can lead to resource exhaustion.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (RCE):** **High Reduction**. Disabling `TypeNameHandling` in Newtonsoft.Json effectively eliminates the primary attack vector for RCE through this library. Whitelisting further strengthens security if polymorphism is necessary with Newtonsoft.Json.
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (DoS):** **Medium Reduction**. Reduces the attack surface for DoS related to complex type deserialization in Newtonsoft.Json.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** `TypeNameHandling` is generally avoided in new code using Newtonsoft.Json. However, legacy code using Newtonsoft.Json might still utilize `TypeNameHandling.Auto` in specific modules.
    *   **Location:** Global Newtonsoft.Json settings are defined in `Startup.cs` (or equivalent configuration file). Specific Newtonsoft.Json deserialization calls are throughout data processing services and API controllers.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Complete codebase audit for Newtonsoft.Json `TypeNameHandling`:** A full audit is needed to identify and remove or secure all instances of `TypeNameHandling` in legacy modules using Newtonsoft.Json.
    *   **Custom `SerializationBinder` for Newtonsoft.Json:** A custom `SerializationBinder` with a whitelist of allowed types is not yet implemented for Newtonsoft.Json usage in modules where polymorphism is still required.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Maximum Depth and Size of JSON Payloads for Newtonsoft.Json](./mitigation_strategies/limit_maximum_depth_and_size_of_json_payloads_for_newtonsoft_json.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Limit Maximum Depth and Size of JSON Payloads for Newtonsoft.Json
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure `MaxDepth` in `JsonSerializerSettings` for Newtonsoft.Json:** Set `JsonSerializerSettings.MaxDepth` to a reasonable value (e.g., 32 or less) when configuring Newtonsoft.Json. This limits the nesting level allowed during deserialization by Newtonsoft.Json.
    2.  **Implement Request Size Limits:**  Configure web server or application level limits to restrict the maximum size of incoming JSON requests that will be processed by Newtonsoft.Json. This prevents excessively large payloads from being handled by Newtonsoft.Json.
    3.  **Document Limits for Newtonsoft.Json Payloads:** Clearly document the maximum allowed depth and size for JSON payloads that your application expects to process using Newtonsoft.Json in API documentation and internal development guidelines.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via resource exhaustion when using Newtonsoft.Json:** Severity: **Medium to High**. Large and deeply nested JSON processed by Newtonsoft.Json can consume excessive CPU and memory, leading to DoS.
    *   **Stack Overflow Exceptions during Newtonsoft.Json deserialization:** Severity: **Medium**. Extremely deep nesting in JSON can cause stack overflow exceptions within Newtonsoft.Json's deserialization process.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** **Medium Reduction**. Significantly reduces the impact of DoS attacks based on oversized or deeply nested JSON processed by Newtonsoft.Json.
    *   **Stack Overflow Exceptions:** **High Reduction**. `MaxDepth` in Newtonsoft.Json directly prevents stack overflow exceptions caused by excessive nesting during deserialization.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** `MaxDepth` is set in global `JsonSerializerSettings` for Newtonsoft.Json to a default value of 32. Request size limits are configured at the web server level (IIS).
    *   **Location:** `MaxDepth` is configured in `Startup.cs` where Newtonsoft.Json settings are initialized. Request size limits are in IIS configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Application-level request size limits for Newtonsoft.Json endpoints:** Application-level request size limits are not consistently enforced for all API endpoints that utilize Newtonsoft.Json for deserialization.
    *   **Dynamic `MaxDepth` adjustment for Newtonsoft.Json:** Consider dynamically adjusting `MaxDepth` in Newtonsoft.Json based on the specific endpoint or expected payload complexity, rather than a single global setting.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Newtonsoft.Json Library Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_newtonsoft_json_library_updated.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Keep Newtonsoft.Json Library Updated
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Newtonsoft.Json Updates:** Regularly check for new releases and security advisories specifically for the Newtonsoft.Json NuGet package. Utilize NuGet package update notifications or security mailing lists to stay informed about Newtonsoft.Json updates.
    2.  **Establish Newtonsoft.Json Update Process:** Define a process for regularly reviewing and applying updates specifically for the Newtonsoft.Json library. This should include testing Newtonsoft.Json updates in a staging environment before deploying to production.
    3.  **Automate Dependency Checks for Newtonsoft.Json:** Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk) as part of your CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect outdated and vulnerable dependencies, specifically including Newtonsoft.Json.
    4.  **Prioritize Newtonsoft.Json Security Updates:** Treat security updates for Newtonsoft.Json with high priority and apply them promptly to minimize exposure to known vulnerabilities within the library.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Newtonsoft.Json:** Severity: Varies (can be High, Medium, or Low depending on the specific vulnerability). Outdated versions of Newtonsoft.Json are susceptible to publicly known vulnerabilities within the library itself.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Newtonsoft.Json:** **High Reduction**. Staying updated with the latest version of Newtonsoft.Json significantly reduces the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities that are patched in newer releases of the library.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** Developers are generally aware of the need to update libraries, including Newtonsoft.Json. However, a formal, automated update process specifically for Newtonsoft.Json is not fully in place.
    *   **Location:** NuGet package management is used for dependency management, including Newtonsoft.Json.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Automated Dependency Scanning for Newtonsoft.Json:** Integration of dependency scanning tools into the CI/CD pipeline, specifically configured to monitor Newtonsoft.Json, is missing.
    *   **Formal Update Process for Newtonsoft.Json:** A documented and enforced process for regularly checking, testing, and applying updates specifically for Newtonsoft.Json is needed.
    *   **Security Advisory Monitoring for Newtonsoft.Json:** Proactive monitoring of security advisories specifically for Newtonsoft.Json is not consistently performed.
