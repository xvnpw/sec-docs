## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Type Handling Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]**: This is the most dangerous area of attack, focusing on how Json.NET handles type information during deserialization.
    *   **`TypeNameHandling.All` [CRITICAL] [HIGH RISK]**:
        *   **Description:** This setting instructs Json.NET to deserialize objects based on type information provided within the JSON payload itself (using the `$type` property). It allows the attacker to specify *any* .NET type.
        *   **Why it's Critical/High-Risk:** This is the most dangerous setting because it gives the attacker complete control over the types being instantiated. It's almost a guaranteed path to RCE if untrusted data is deserialized.
        *   **Exploitation:** The attacker crafts a JSON payload with the `$type` property set to a malicious type (e.g., a type that executes code in its constructor, `OnDeserialized` method, or through a gadget chain).
        *   **Mitigation:** *Never* use `TypeNameHandling.All` with untrusted data. Use `TypeNameHandling.None` or a custom `SerializationBinder`.

    *   **`$type` Property [HIGH RISK]**:
        *   **Description:** This is the JSON property used to specify the type to be deserialized when `TypeNameHandling` is enabled (even with settings other than `All`).
        *   **Why it's High-Risk:** Even with more restrictive `TypeNameHandling` settings, manipulating the `$type` property can still lead to RCE if the application doesn't perform its own type validation or if a bypass for the Json.NET security checks is found.
        *   **Exploitation:** The attacker crafts a JSON payload, manipulating the `$type` property to point to a vulnerable type, even if it's not explicitly allowed by the `TypeNameHandling` setting (e.g., exploiting a known gadget chain or a type with a dangerous deserialization callback).
        *   **Mitigation:** Use a custom `SerializationBinder` to strictly control allowed types. Implement thorough application-level type validation *after* deserialization.

    *   **No Type Validation (Application-Level) [HIGH RISK]**:
        *   **Description:** This refers to the situation where the application deserializes JSON data without performing its *own* checks on the resulting object types. It relies solely on Json.NET's settings.
        *   **Why it's High-Risk:** Even if `TypeNameHandling` is set to a safer value (like `None` or `Objects`), vulnerabilities can still exist.  Attackers might exploit type converters, custom deserialization logic, or other subtle weaknesses.  Without application-level checks, these vulnerabilities can lead to RCE.
        *   **Exploitation:** The attacker crafts a JSON payload that, while not necessarily specifying a malicious type directly (via `$type`), results in the instantiation of an object that can be used to execute code (e.g., a type with a vulnerable property setter or a type that triggers dangerous behavior when certain methods are called).
        *   **Mitigation:** *Always* perform thorough type validation *after* deserialization. Check that the deserialized objects are of the expected types and that their properties have safe values.

    *   **Known Vulnerable Type [HIGH RISK]**:
        *   **Description:** This refers to exploiting a type that is *known* to be vulnerable in a specific version of Json.NET (or a related library). These vulnerabilities are often documented in CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).
        *   **Why it's High-Risk:** Exploits for known vulnerabilities are often publicly available, making them easy to use.  If an application uses a vulnerable version and doesn't mitigate the specific vulnerability, it's highly susceptible.
        *   **Exploitation:** The attacker uses a publicly available exploit or crafts a payload based on the known vulnerability details. The payload will typically include the `$type` property set to the vulnerable type.
        *   **Mitigation:** Keep Newtonsoft.Json updated to the latest version.  Monitor for CVEs related to Json.NET and apply patches promptly.  Use a custom `SerializationBinder` to prevent deserialization of known vulnerable types, even if the library is not yet patched.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/cause_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Resource Exhaustion**
    *   **Large Payload [HIGH RISK]**:
        *   **Description:** Sending a very large JSON payload to the server.
        *   **Why it's High-Risk:** This is a simple and effective DoS attack. It requires minimal effort and can easily overwhelm server resources (memory, CPU).
        *   **Exploitation:** The attacker sends a very large JSON file (e.g., several gigabytes) to the application's endpoint that handles JSON input.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement strict limits on the size of JSON payloads that the application will accept.  Use input validation to reject excessively large requests.
