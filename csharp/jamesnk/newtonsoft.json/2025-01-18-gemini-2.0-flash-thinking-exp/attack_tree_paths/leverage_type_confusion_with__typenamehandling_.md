## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Leverage Type Confusion with `TypeNameHandling` in Newtonsoft.Json

This document provides a deep analysis of a specific attack path identified in an attack tree for an application utilizing the Newtonsoft.Json library (https://github.com/jamesnk/newtonsoft.json).

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Leverage Type Confusion with `TypeNameHandling`

**Attack Tree Path:**

```
Leverage Type Confusion with `TypeNameHandling`

- (Goal) Force Deserialization of Malicious Type
  - (OR) Provide Malicious JSON with `$type` directive pointing to a vulnerable or exploitable type
- (Goal) Trigger Execution of Malicious Code
  - (Action) Ensure the deserialized object's lifecycle or methods lead to code execution
```

**Detailed Breakdown:**

**4.1. Understanding `TypeNameHandling`**

Newtonsoft.Json's `TypeNameHandling` setting controls how type information is included and used during serialization and deserialization. When set to values other than `None` (e.g., `Auto`, `Objects`, `Arrays`, `All`), Newtonsoft.Json embeds type information within the JSON payload using the `$type` directive. This allows the deserializer to reconstruct the original object type, even if the declared type of the deserialization target is an interface or a base class.

While this feature can be useful for scenarios like polymorphism and preserving type fidelity, it introduces a significant security risk if not handled carefully. If an attacker can control the value of the `$type` directive, they can instruct the deserializer to instantiate arbitrary types, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code.

**4.2. (Goal) Force Deserialization of Malicious Type**

This goal is achieved by providing a specially crafted JSON payload that includes the `$type` directive.

**4.2.1. (OR) Provide Malicious JSON with `$type` directive pointing to a vulnerable or exploitable type**

The core of this attack lies in the attacker's ability to specify the type to be instantiated during deserialization. The attacker crafts a JSON payload where the `$type` property points to a class that can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code.

**Example Malicious JSON Payload:**

```json
{
  "$type": "System.Windows.Forms.AxHost+State, System.Windows.Forms, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089",
  "assemblyName": "System.Diagnostics.Process, System, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089",
  "typeName": "System.Diagnostics.Process",
  "properties": {
    "StartInfo": {
      "$type": "System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo, System, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089",
      "FileName": "cmd.exe",
      "Arguments": "/c calc.exe"
    }
  }
}
```

**Explanation of the Example:**

* **`$type`: `System.Windows.Forms.AxHost+State, System.Windows.Forms, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089`**: This directive instructs the deserializer to instantiate an object of the `AxHost.State` class. This class is known to be a potential gadget for deserialization attacks.
* **`assemblyName` and `typeName`**: These properties within the `AxHost.State` object are used to specify the assembly and type to be loaded. In this case, it's `System.Diagnostics.Process`.
* **`properties`**: This section sets the properties of the `System.Diagnostics.Process` object.
* **`StartInfo`**:  This property is set to a `ProcessStartInfo` object.
* **`FileName`: "cmd.exe"` and `Arguments`: "/c calc.exe"`**: These properties instruct the `Process` object to execute the `calc.exe` command.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Finding Gadget Chains:** Attackers often rely on "gadget chains," which are sequences of method calls within existing .NET libraries that can be chained together to achieve a desired outcome, such as code execution. The `AxHost.State` example is a classic gadget.
* **Assembly Qualified Names:** The `$type` directive requires the fully qualified name of the type, including the assembly name, version, culture, and public key token. This information can be obtained through reflection or by examining error messages.
* **Target Application Context:** The success of this attack depends on the presence of the specified assemblies in the target application's environment.

**4.3. (Goal) Trigger Execution of Malicious Code**

Simply deserializing a malicious type is not enough. The attacker needs to ensure that the deserialized object's lifecycle or methods lead to the execution of the intended malicious code.

**4.3.1. (Action) Ensure the deserialized object's lifecycle or methods lead to code execution**

Several mechanisms can trigger code execution after a malicious type is deserialized:

* **Constructor Injection:** If the malicious type's constructor performs actions that lead to code execution (e.g., starting a process, executing a script).
* **Property Setters:** If setting a specific property of the deserialized object triggers code execution.
* **Method Calls:** If the application subsequently calls methods on the deserialized object that contain malicious logic.
* **IDisposable Pattern:**  Certain gadget chains leverage the `Dispose()` method of objects implementing `IDisposable`. When the deserialized object is garbage collected or explicitly disposed of, the `Dispose()` method can be used to execute code. The `AxHost.State` example often relies on this.
* **Event Handlers:** If the deserialized object has event handlers that are triggered after deserialization and execute malicious code.

**In the `AxHost.State` example:**

The `AxHost.State` object, when deserialized, attempts to load the specified assembly and type (`System.Diagnostics.Process`). The properties set on the `ProcessStartInfo` object are then used when the `AxHost.State` object is further processed, ultimately leading to the execution of the command specified in `FileName` and `Arguments`.

**4.4. Potential Impact**

A successful exploitation of this attack path can have severe consequences:

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server or client machine running the application.
* **Data Breach:** The attacker can access sensitive data stored within the application or on the underlying system.
* **System Compromise:** The attacker can gain full control of the compromised system, potentially installing malware, creating backdoors, or launching further attacks.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker could execute commands that disrupt the application's availability.

**4.5. Mitigation Strategies (Briefly Touched Upon)**

While a full discussion of mitigation is outside the scope, here are key strategies to prevent this type of attack:

* **Avoid `TypeNameHandling` if possible:**  The safest approach is to avoid using `TypeNameHandling` altogether. If possible, design your application to avoid the need for preserving type information during serialization.
* **Use `TypeNameHandling.None` as the default:** If `TypeNameHandling` is necessary, use `TypeNameHandling.None` as the default and only enable it selectively for specific scenarios where you have complete control over the serialized data.
* **Implement Allow Lists for Allowed Types:** If `TypeNameHandling` is unavoidable, implement a strict allow list of types that are permitted for deserialization. This prevents the deserialization of arbitrary types.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While not a direct mitigation for `TypeNameHandling`, robust input validation can help prevent malicious JSON payloads from reaching the deserialization process.
* **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**  Proactively identify and address potential deserialization vulnerabilities in your code.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful attack.

### 5. Conclusion

Leveraging type confusion with `TypeNameHandling` in Newtonsoft.Json presents a significant security risk. By crafting malicious JSON payloads with carefully chosen `$type` directives, attackers can force the deserialization of exploitable types and achieve remote code execution. Understanding the mechanics of this attack path and implementing appropriate mitigation strategies is crucial for securing applications that utilize Newtonsoft.Json. Developers should prioritize avoiding `TypeNameHandling` where possible and, when necessary, implement strict controls to prevent the deserialization of untrusted types.
