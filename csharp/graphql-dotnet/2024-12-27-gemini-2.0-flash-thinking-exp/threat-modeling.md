## High and Critical Threats Directly Involving graphql-dotnet

This table outlines high and critical threats that directly involve the `graphql-dotnet` library.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected graphql-dotnet Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Excessive Data Exposure (Over-fetching Prevention Bypass)** | Attacker crafts a query that, due to vulnerabilities in `graphql-dotnet`'s query processing or interaction with resolvers, retrieves more data than intended, bypassing intended data filtering or access controls. | Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized users. | Query Parser & Execution Engine | High | - Thoroughly test resolvers to ensure they adhere to intended data access logic and permissions. <br> - Utilize `graphql-dotnet`'s features for field-level authorization within resolvers (e.g., using `AuthorizeAttribute` or custom authorization logic). <br> - Implement robust data filtering and sanitization within resolvers. |
| **Complex Query Attacks (Query Depth/Complexity DoS)** | Attacker crafts extremely deep or wide queries with many nested selections or a large number of fields in a list, overwhelming the server's processing capabilities. | Denial of Service, server slowdown or crashes due to resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, database). | Query Parser, Query Executor | High | - Configure `graphql-dotnet`'s query complexity and depth limits (using `MaxQueryDepth` and custom complexity analyzers). <br> - Implement query cost analysis to reject overly expensive queries. <br> - Monitor server resource usage and implement rate limiting on the GraphQL endpoint. |
| **Mutation Abuse (Lack of Input Validation)** | Attacker sends malicious or unexpected data through mutation arguments as `graphql-dotnet` by default does not enforce strict input validation. | Data integrity issues, potential for application errors or unexpected behavior, and in some cases, security vulnerabilities in downstream systems. | Input Object Handling | High | - Define clear input types and validation rules within the GraphQL schema. <br> - Utilize `graphql-dotnet`'s input validation features or implement custom validation logic within resolvers. <br> - Sanitize and escape user input before processing it in resolvers. |
| **Schema Definition Vulnerabilities (Overly Permissive Schema)** | A poorly designed or overly permissive schema, interpreted by `graphql-dotnet`, exposes mutations or queries that should be restricted, allowing unauthorized access or actions. | Elevation of privilege, unauthorized data modification or access. | Schema Definition | High | - Design the schema with the principle of least privilege in mind. Only expose necessary operations and data. <br> - Carefully review the access control implications of each query and mutation. <br> - Utilize `graphql-dotnet`'s features for field-level authorization and access control. |
