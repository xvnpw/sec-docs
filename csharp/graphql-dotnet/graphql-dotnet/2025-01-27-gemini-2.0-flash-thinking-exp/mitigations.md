# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Introspection in Production](./mitigation_strategies/disable_introspection_in_production.md)

*   **Description:**
        *   Step 1: Identify the configuration settings for your GraphQL server initialization in your `graphql-dotnet` application. This is typically within your `Startup.cs` file or wherever you configure your GraphQL schema and services.
        *   Step 2: Locate the code section where you configure the `GraphQLHttpMiddleware` or similar component that handles GraphQL requests.
        *   Step 3: Find the option or setting that controls introspection. In `graphql-dotnet`, this might involve configuring the `Schema` or the `GraphQLHttpMiddlewareOptions`.  Look for properties related to introspection or schema publishing.
        *   Step 4: Implement conditional logic based on the environment (e.g., using `IWebHostEnvironment` in ASP.NET Core).  Disable introspection when the application is running in a production environment.  For example, you might check `env.IsProduction()`.
        *   Step 5: Ensure introspection remains enabled in development and staging environments for debugging and schema exploration during development.
        *   Step 6: Deploy the updated configuration to your production environment.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Schema Exposure:  Attackers can use introspection to understand the entire GraphQL schema, including types, fields, and relationships. - Severity: High
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Schema Exposure: High reduction. Completely prevents unauthorized schema discovery via introspection in production.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** No -  This is a configuration change that needs to be implemented in the application's startup or configuration files.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Within the GraphQL server setup logic in `Startup.cs` or equivalent configuration file, environment-based introspection control needs to be added.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Access Control for Introspection](./mitigation_strategies/implement_access_control_for_introspection.md)

*   **Description:**
        *   Step 1: Define a mechanism to identify authorized users or roles that should be allowed to perform introspection. This could involve checking for specific API keys, user roles, or authentication status.
        *   Step 2: Implement an authorization check within your GraphQL middleware or schema setup.  This check should be executed before allowing introspection queries to proceed.
        *   Step 3: In `graphql-dotnet`, you can use middleware or custom execution strategies to intercept introspection requests.
        *   Step 4: Within the authorization check, verify if the current user or request context meets the defined authorization criteria.
        *   Step 5: If authorized, allow the introspection query to execute. If unauthorized, return an error response (e.g., "Unauthorized") or prevent the introspection query from running.
        *   Step 6: Document the access control mechanism for introspection for authorized developers and administrators.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Schema Exposure to Unauthorized Users: Prevents unauthorized individuals from gaining insights into the schema via introspection. - Severity: Medium
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Schema Exposure to Unauthorized Users: Medium to High reduction. Significantly reduces the risk by limiting schema exposure to only authorized entities.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** No -  Authorization logic needs to be implemented within the GraphQL middleware or execution pipeline.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Authorization middleware or custom execution logic needs to be added to the GraphQL server setup to control access to introspection queries.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Query Complexity Analysis](./mitigation_strategies/implement_query_complexity_analysis.md)

*   **Description:**
        *   Step 1: Define a complexity scoring system for your GraphQL schema. Assign complexity points to each field based on its computational cost, data fetching overhead, and potential impact on server resources.  More complex fields or fields returning large datasets should have higher scores.
        *   Step 2: Set a maximum allowed query complexity threshold for your GraphQL API. This threshold should be determined based on your server's capacity and performance requirements.
        *   Step 3: Integrate a query complexity analyzer into your `graphql-dotnet` application.  Libraries or custom logic can be used to parse and analyze incoming GraphQL queries.
        *   Step 4: Before executing a query, use the analyzer to calculate its complexity score based on the defined scoring system.
        *   Step 5: Compare the calculated complexity score against the defined threshold.
        *   Step 6: If the query complexity exceeds the threshold, reject the query with an error message indicating that it is too complex.
        *   Step 7: If the query complexity is within the threshold, allow the query to execute.
        *   Step 8: Regularly review and adjust the complexity scoring system and threshold as your application evolves and server capacity changes.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Queries: Attackers can craft overly complex queries to exhaust server resources and cause service disruption. - Severity: High
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Queries: High reduction. Effectively mitigates DoS attacks based on query complexity by preventing execution of resource-intensive queries.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** No - Query complexity analysis logic needs to be integrated into the GraphQL execution pipeline.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  A query complexity analyzer and scoring system need to be implemented and integrated into the GraphQL request processing flow, likely as middleware or within the execution strategy.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Set Query Depth Limits](./mitigation_strategies/set_query_depth_limits.md)

*   **Description:**
        *   Step 1: Determine a reasonable maximum query depth for your GraphQL API. This depth should be sufficient for legitimate use cases but limit excessively nested queries.
        *   Step 2: Configure `graphql-dotnet` to enforce this maximum query depth.  This might involve setting options within the `GraphQLHttpMiddleware` or using validation rules within your schema definition.
        *   Step 3: When a GraphQL query is received, the `graphql-dotnet` engine should automatically check the query depth against the configured limit.
        *   Step 4: If the query depth exceeds the limit, reject the query with an error message indicating that it is too deeply nested.
        *   Step 5: If the query depth is within the limit, allow the query to execute.
        *   Step 6: Periodically review and adjust the query depth limit as needed based on application requirements and observed query patterns.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) via Deeply Nested Queries: Attackers can create deeply nested queries to overload the server and cause DoS. - Severity: High
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) via Deeply Nested Queries: High reduction. Prevents DoS attacks based on query depth by limiting the nesting level of allowed queries.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** No - Query depth limits need to be configured within the `graphql-dotnet` server setup.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Configuration for maximum query depth needs to be added to the `graphql-dotnet` middleware or schema validation settings.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Set Query Breadth Limits](./mitigation_strategies/set_query_breadth_limits.md)

*   **Description:**
        *   Step 1: Determine a reasonable maximum number of fields that can be selected at each level of a GraphQL query. This limit should prevent overly broad queries that fetch excessive amounts of data.
        *   Step 2: Implement logic within your `graphql-dotnet` application to analyze the breadth of incoming queries. This might involve parsing the query and counting the number of fields selected at each level.
        *   Step 3: Before executing a query, check if the number of fields selected at any level exceeds the defined breadth limit.
        *   Step 4: If the breadth limit is exceeded, reject the query with an error message indicating that it is too broad.
        *   Step 5: If the breadth is within the limit, allow the query to execute.
        *   Step 6: Regularly review and adjust the query breadth limit as needed based on application requirements and data fetching patterns.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) via Broad Queries: Attackers can craft queries selecting a large number of fields to overload data fetching and cause DoS. - Severity: Medium
        *   Data Over-fetching:  Broad queries can lead to fetching more data than necessary, impacting performance and potentially exposing more data than intended. - Severity: Medium
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) via Broad Queries: Medium reduction. Reduces the risk of DoS attacks based on query breadth.
        *   Data Over-fetching: Medium reduction. Helps to limit unnecessary data retrieval.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** No - Query breadth limit logic needs to be implemented within the GraphQL request processing flow.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Logic to analyze query breadth and enforce limits needs to be added, likely as middleware or within a custom query validation step.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Field-Level Authorization](./mitigation_strategies/implement_field-level_authorization.md)

*   **Description:**
        *   Step 1: Define a comprehensive authorization model that specifies which users or roles are allowed to access specific fields in your GraphQL schema.
        *   Step 2: Implement authorization checks at the field resolver level. For each field, determine if the current user has the necessary permissions to access the underlying data.
        *   Step 3: Utilize `graphql-dotnet`'s features like resolvers, middleware, or directives to implement this authorization logic.
        *   Step 4: In resolvers, access the user context (typically available through the `IResolveFieldContext` or similar context object).
        *   Step 5: Based on the user context and the field being resolved, perform authorization checks against your authorization model.
        *   Step 6: If authorized, resolve the field and return the data. If unauthorized, return an authorization error or prevent data access.
        *   Step 7: Ensure consistent authorization enforcement across all fields in your schema.
        *   Step 8: Regularly review and update your authorization model and implementation as your application evolves and access control requirements change.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Unauthorized Data Access: Prevents users from accessing data they are not permitted to see, even if they can query the schema. - Severity: High
        *   Data Breaches: Reduces the risk of data breaches by enforcing granular access control at the field level. - Severity: High
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized Data Access: High reduction. Effectively prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data exposed through GraphQL fields.
        *   Data Breaches: High reduction. Significantly reduces the risk of data breaches by enforcing fine-grained authorization.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** No - Field-level authorization is a development task that needs to be implemented within resolvers or authorization middleware.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Authorization logic needs to be implemented within resolvers, middleware, or using directives for all fields that require access control.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Resolvers for Authorization Logic](./mitigation_strategies/use_resolvers_for_authorization_logic.md)

*   **Description:**
        *   Step 1: For each field in your GraphQL schema that requires authorization, implement the authorization logic directly within its resolver function.
        *   Step 2: Within the resolver, access the user context (e.g., from `IResolveFieldContext`).
        *   Step 3: Retrieve any necessary information from the user context (e.g., user roles, permissions).
        *   Step 4: Implement authorization checks based on the user's information and the specific field being resolved. This might involve checking user roles against required roles for the field, or evaluating custom authorization rules.
        *   Step 5: If authorized, proceed with resolving the field and fetching the data.
        *   Step 6: If unauthorized, throw an authorization exception or return an error indicating insufficient permissions.
        *   Step 7: Ensure consistent error handling for authorization failures across all resolvers.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Unauthorized Data Access: Prevents unauthorized access to data at the field level. - Severity: High
        *   Data Breaches: Reduces the risk of data breaches by enforcing authorization in resolvers. - Severity: High
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized Data Access: High reduction. Provides fine-grained control over data access within resolvers.
        *   Data Breaches: High reduction. Contributes significantly to reducing data breach risks.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - Some resolvers might have basic authorization checks, but comprehensive field-level authorization across all sensitive fields is likely missing.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Authorization logic needs to be implemented and consistently applied within resolvers for all fields requiring access control.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Leverage Middleware for Authorization](./mitigation_strategies/leverage_middleware_for_authorization.md)

*   **Description:**
        *   Step 1: Implement authorization middleware in your `graphql-dotnet` pipeline. Middleware sits between the request and the resolvers, allowing you to intercept and process requests before they reach resolvers.
        *   Step 2: Configure your GraphQL server to include this authorization middleware in the request processing pipeline.
        *   Step 3: Within the middleware, access the request context and user authentication information.
        *   Step 4: Implement authorization logic within the middleware to check if the current user is authorized to access the requested GraphQL operation (query, mutation, or specific fields).
        *   Step 5: Middleware can perform broader authorization checks, such as verifying user authentication, checking API keys, or enforcing rate limiting before requests reach resolvers.
        *   Step 6: If the middleware determines that the request is unauthorized, it should short-circuit the pipeline and return an authorization error.
        *   Step 7: If authorized, the middleware should pass the request to the next stage in the pipeline (typically resolvers).
        *   Step 8: Middleware can be used in conjunction with resolver-level authorization for layered security.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Unauthorized Access (Broader Scope): Prevents unauthorized access at a higher level, before reaching individual resolvers. - Severity: Medium
        *   API Abuse: Middleware can enforce rate limiting and other broader security policies to prevent API abuse. - Severity: Medium
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized Access (Broader Scope): Medium reduction. Provides an additional layer of authorization before resolvers.
        *   API Abuse: Medium reduction. Helps to mitigate API abuse through broader security policies.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially -  Basic authentication middleware might be present, but dedicated GraphQL authorization middleware might be missing.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Specific GraphQL authorization middleware needs to be implemented and configured in the `graphql-dotnet` pipeline to handle broader authorization checks before resolvers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Consider Directives for Declarative Authorization](./mitigation_strategies/consider_directives_for_declarative_authorization.md)

*   **Description:**
        *   Step 1: Define custom GraphQL directives to represent authorization rules within your schema. Directives are annotations that can be added to schema elements (fields, types, etc.).
        *   Step 2: Implement directive logic in your `graphql-dotnet` application to interpret and enforce these authorization directives. This typically involves creating a custom directive visitor or execution strategy.
        *   Step 3: Apply authorization directives to fields or types in your schema to declaratively specify access control rules. For example, you might create a `@authorize` directive and apply it to fields that require authorization.
        *   Step 4: When a GraphQL query is executed, the custom directive logic should intercept the execution and enforce the authorization rules defined by the directives.
        *   Step 5: Directives can make authorization rules more visible and maintainable within the schema definition itself.
        *   Step 6: Ensure that your directive implementation correctly handles authorization checks and returns appropriate errors for unauthorized access.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Unauthorized Data Access: Provides a declarative way to enforce field-level authorization. - Severity: High
        *   Schema Maintainability: Improves schema readability and maintainability by embedding authorization rules directly in the schema. - Severity: Low (Security-related maintainability)
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized Data Access: High reduction. Offers a structured and declarative approach to field-level authorization.
        *   Schema Maintainability: Low reduction (in terms of direct threat mitigation, but improves overall security posture through better maintainability).
    *   **Currently Implemented:** No - Custom directives for authorization are likely not implemented. This requires schema modifications and custom directive handling logic.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Custom authorization directives need to be defined in the schema, and corresponding directive handling logic needs to be implemented in `graphql-dotnet`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate Input Arguments in Resolvers](./mitigation_strategies/validate_input_arguments_in_resolvers.md)

*   **Description:**
        *   Step 1: For each resolver that accepts input arguments, implement input validation logic within the resolver function.
        *   Step 2: Use validation libraries (e.g., FluentValidation, DataAnnotations in .NET) or custom validation code to check input arguments against expected formats, types, ranges, and constraints.
        *   Step 3: Validate all required arguments are present and that optional arguments are within acceptable limits.
        *   Step 4: If validation fails for any input argument, throw a validation exception or return an error message indicating the invalid input.
        *   Step 5: Ensure that error messages are informative but do not reveal sensitive server-side details.
        *   Step 6: Sanitize or escape invalid input data before logging or further processing to prevent potential injection issues.
        *   Step 7: Consistently apply input validation to all resolvers that handle user-provided input.

        *   Injection Vulnerabilities (GraphQL Injection, etc.): Prevents injection attacks by validating and sanitizing inputs. - Severity: Medium
        *   Data Integrity Issues: Ensures data consistency and integrity by rejecting invalid input data. - Severity: Medium
        *   Application Errors: Reduces application errors caused by unexpected or malformed input data. - Severity: Low (Security-related reliability)
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Injection Vulnerabilities: Medium reduction. Reduces the risk of injection attacks by validating inputs.
        *   Data Integrity Issues: Medium reduction. Improves data integrity by preventing invalid data from being processed.
        *   Application Errors: Low reduction (in terms of direct threat mitigation, but improves overall application robustness).
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - Some basic input validation might be present in some resolvers, but comprehensive validation across all input arguments is likely missing.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Input validation logic needs to be implemented and consistently applied within resolvers for all input arguments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Input Data](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_input_data.md)

*   **Description:**
        *   Step 1: Identify resolvers that process user-provided string inputs that might be used in database queries, external API calls, or other sensitive operations.
        *   Step 2: Implement input sanitization logic within these resolvers.
        *   Step 3: Use appropriate sanitization techniques based on the context where the input data will be used. This might include:
            *   Encoding or escaping special characters to prevent injection attacks (e.g., HTML encoding, URL encoding).
            *   Using parameterized queries or ORM features to prevent SQL injection.
            *   Validating and whitelisting allowed characters or patterns.
        *   Step 4: Sanitize input data *before* using it in any sensitive operations.
        *   Step 5: Ensure that sanitization logic is applied consistently and correctly.
        *   Step 6: Regularly review and update sanitization techniques as new vulnerabilities and attack vectors emerge.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Injection Vulnerabilities (GraphQL Injection, SQL Injection, etc.): Prevents injection attacks by sanitizing potentially malicious input data. - Severity: Medium to High (depending on the context)
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Injection Vulnerabilities: Medium to High reduction. Significantly reduces the risk of injection attacks by neutralizing malicious input.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - Parameterized queries might be used in some data access layers, but explicit input sanitization within resolvers might be missing.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Input sanitization logic needs to be implemented within resolvers, especially for string inputs used in sensitive operations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Error Messages in Production](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_error_messages_in_production.md)

*   **Description:**
        *   Step 1: Configure your `graphql-dotnet` application to handle errors globally. This might involve customizing the `GraphQLHttpMiddleware` or implementing a custom error handler.
        *   Step 2: In your error handling logic, differentiate between development and production environments (e.g., using `IWebHostEnvironment`).
        *   Step 3: In production environments, sanitize error messages before returning them to clients.
        *   Step 4: Replace detailed technical error messages (e.g., stack traces, internal exception details) with generic, user-friendly error messages. For example, instead of a database connection error, return "An unexpected error occurred."
        *   Step 5: Log detailed error information server-side (e.g., to application logs, error tracking systems) for debugging and monitoring purposes.
        *   Step 6: In development environments, allow detailed error messages to be displayed to aid in debugging.
        *   Step 7: Ensure that sanitized error messages are consistent and do not reveal any sensitive information about the server's internal workings.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Information Disclosure via Error Messages: Prevents attackers from gaining sensitive information about the server's internal workings through detailed error messages. - Severity: Low to Medium
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Information Disclosure via Error Messages: Medium reduction. Reduces the risk of information disclosure through error messages.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - Generic error handling might be in place, but environment-aware error message sanitization might be missing.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Environment-based error message sanitization needs to be implemented in the global error handling logic of the `graphql-dotnet` application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Custom Error Handling](./mitigation_strategies/implement_custom_error_handling.md)

*   **Description:**
        *   Step 1: Define custom error types and structures for your GraphQL API. This allows you to categorize and structure errors in a consistent and controlled manner.
        *   Step 2: Implement custom error handlers within your `graphql-dotnet` application. This might involve creating custom exception filters or error formatting logic.
        *   Step 3: In your custom error handlers, map internal exceptions or errors to your defined custom error types.
        *   Step 4: Control the information included in error responses based on the error type and environment.
        *   Step 5: Ensure that custom error responses are user-friendly, informative (without revealing sensitive details), and consistent across the API.
        *   Step 6: Use custom error handling to implement specific security-related error responses, such as authorization errors, validation errors, and rate limiting errors.
        *   Step 7: Log detailed error information server-side for custom error types as needed.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Information Disclosure via Error Messages: Provides more control over error responses to prevent information leakage. - Severity: Low to Medium
        *   Inconsistent Error Handling: Ensures consistent and predictable error responses across the API. - Severity: Low (Security-related usability)
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Information Disclosure via Error Messages: Medium reduction. Enhances control over error responses and reduces information disclosure.
        *   Inconsistent Error Handling: Low reduction (in terms of direct threat mitigation, but improves overall security posture through better error management).
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - Basic error handling might be present, but custom error types and structured error responses might be missing.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Custom error types and handlers need to be implemented to provide more structured and secure error responses in the GraphQL API.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep `graphql-dotnet` and Dependencies Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep__graphql-dotnet__and_dependencies_updated.md)
