## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Input Validation Vulnerabilities in Resolvers (graphql-dotnet)

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Input Validation Vulnerabilities in Resolvers" attack path within a GraphQL application built using `graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet`. We aim to understand the specific risks associated with this path, identify potential attack vectors, analyze the impact of successful exploitation, and propose effective mitigation strategies. This analysis will focus on the two sub-paths highlighted: Injection Attacks and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via resolvers. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights for the development team to secure their graphql-dotnet application against these vulnerabilities.

### 2. Scope

This deep analysis is scoped to the following:

*   **Attack Tree Path:** Specifically the "Input Validation Vulnerabilities in Resolvers" path as defined:
    *   Injection Attacks (SQL Injection, NoSQL Injection, Command Injection) due to resolvers directly using unsanitized user input in backend queries/commands.
    *   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via resolvers due to resolvers making external requests based on user-provided data without proper validation and sanitization of URLs/endpoints.
*   **Technology Stack:** Focus on applications built using `graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet`.  While general GraphQL security principles apply, the analysis will consider the specific context of this library.
*   **Vulnerability Types:**  Deep dive into Injection Attacks (SQL, NoSQL, Command) and SSRF.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**  Identification and description of relevant mitigation techniques applicable to graphql-dotnet applications.

This analysis will **not** cover:

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Input Validation Vulnerabilities in Resolvers

#### 4.1. Injection Attacks (e.g., SQL Injection, NoSQL Injection, Command Injection) [HIGH-RISK PATH]

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit resolvers that directly incorporate user-provided input into backend queries or commands without proper sanitization or validation. This allows attackers to inject malicious code or commands that are then executed by the backend system.

**4.1.1. Resolvers directly use user input in backend queries/commands without sanitization [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]: User input is directly used in backend operations without proper sanitization, leading to injection vulnerabilities.**

*   **Explanation:** This is the core vulnerability. GraphQL resolvers are functions that fetch data based on client requests. If a resolver takes arguments from the GraphQL query (user input) and directly uses these arguments to construct database queries (SQL, NoSQL) or system commands without sanitization, it becomes vulnerable to injection attacks.  `graphql-dotnet` resolvers, being standard C# functions, are susceptible to this if developers don't implement proper input handling.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Attackers can bypass intended data access controls and retrieve sensitive data from the database.
    *   **Data Modification/Deletion:**  Attackers can modify or delete data in the database, leading to data integrity issues and potential service disruption.
    *   **System Compromise (Command Injection):** If resolvers execute system commands based on user input, attackers can gain control of the server by injecting malicious commands.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers might be able to craft queries that cause the backend database or system to become overloaded or crash.

*   **Example Scenario (SQL Injection in graphql-dotnet):**

    Let's assume a GraphQL schema with a query to fetch users by name:

    ```graphql
    type Query {
      userByName(name: String!): User
    }

    type User {
      id: ID!
      name: String!
      email: String!
    }
    ```

    And a vulnerable resolver in graphql-dotnet (simplified for illustration):

    ```csharp
    public class Query
    {
        private readonly IDbConnection _dbConnection; // Assume an IDbConnection is injected

        public Query(IDbConnection dbConnection)
        {
            _dbConnection = dbConnection;
        }

        public User UserByName(string name)
        {
            // Vulnerable code - directly embedding user input into SQL query
            string sqlQuery = $"SELECT id, name, email FROM Users WHERE name = '{name}'";
            return _dbConnection.QueryFirstOrDefault<User>(sqlQuery);
        }
    }
    ```

    **Attack Query:**

    ```graphql
    query {
      userByName(name: "'; DROP TABLE Users; --") {
        id
        name
        email
      }
    }
    ```

    **Explanation of Attack:** The attacker injects `'; DROP TABLE Users; --` as the `name` argument. The vulnerable resolver constructs the following SQL query:

    ```sql
    SELECT id, name, email FROM Users WHERE name = ''; DROP TABLE Users; --'
    ```

    This query now contains a malicious SQL command (`DROP TABLE Users`) that could be executed by the database, potentially deleting the entire `Users` table.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**

    *   **Input Validation:**  Implement strict input validation in resolvers. Validate the format, type, and allowed characters of user inputs.  Reject inputs that do not conform to expectations. For example, if the `name` should only contain alphanumeric characters, validate this in the resolver.
    *   **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  Use parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by your database library (e.g., Dapper, Entity Framework Core in .NET). Parameterized queries separate the SQL code from the user-provided data, preventing injection.

        **Example of Parameterized Query (Dapper in graphql-dotnet):**

        ```csharp
        public User UserByName(string name)
        {
            string sqlQuery = "SELECT id, name, email FROM Users WHERE name = @Name";
            return _dbConnection.QueryFirstOrDefault<User>(sqlQuery, new { Name = name }); // Using parameters
        }
        ```

    *   **Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) / Object-Document Mappers (ODMs):** Utilize ORMs (like Entity Framework Core for SQL databases) or ODMs (for NoSQL databases) that often handle query construction and parameterization securely, reducing the risk of manual SQL/NoSQL injection.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure the database user account used by the application has the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the damage an attacker can do even if injection is successful.
    *   **Output Encoding (Context-Aware Output Encoding):** While primarily for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), context-aware output encoding is a good general practice. However, it's less relevant for backend injection vulnerabilities but important for preventing data displayed to users from being manipulated.

#### 4.2. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Resolvers [HIGH-RISK PATH]

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit resolvers that make external HTTP requests based on user-provided data, without proper validation and sanitization of the URLs or endpoints. This allows attackers to force the server to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources.

**4.2.1. Resolvers make external requests based on user-provided data without proper validation and sanitization of URLs/endpoints [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]: User-controlled input is used to construct external requests without validation, leading to SSRF.**

*   **Explanation:** If a GraphQL resolver takes user input (e.g., a URL, hostname, or path) and uses it to construct and execute an HTTP request to an external service, without proper validation, it's vulnerable to SSRF. Attackers can manipulate the user input to make the server send requests to unintended destinations, potentially internal resources or malicious external sites.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Access to Internal Resources:** Attackers can use the server as a proxy to access internal services and resources that are not directly accessible from the internet (e.g., internal APIs, databases, cloud metadata services).
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can potentially exfiltrate sensitive data from internal systems by making requests to external attacker-controlled servers.
    *   **Port Scanning and Service Discovery:** Attackers can use the server to scan internal networks and discover running services.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can overload internal or external services by making a large number of requests through the vulnerable resolver.
    *   **Bypass Security Controls:** SSRF can be used to bypass firewalls, network segmentation, and other security controls.

*   **Example Scenario (SSRF in graphql-dotnet):**

    Let's assume a GraphQL schema with a mutation to fetch content from a URL:

    ```graphql
    type Mutation {
      fetchContent(url: String!): String
    }
    ```

    And a vulnerable resolver in graphql-dotnet (simplified for illustration):

    ```csharp
    public class Mutation
    {
        private readonly HttpClient _httpClient; // Assume HttpClient is injected

        public Mutation(HttpClient httpClient)
        {
            _httpClient = httpClient;
        }

        public async Task<string> FetchContent(string url)
        {
            // Vulnerable code - directly using user-provided URL without validation
            var response = await _httpClient.GetAsync(url);
            response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode(); // Basic error handling, not security
            return await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        }
    }
    ```

    **Attack Query (Accessing Internal Metadata Service - AWS EC2 example):**

    ```graphql
    mutation {
      fetchContent(url: "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/") { # AWS EC2 metadata endpoint
        # ... (response will be the metadata content)
      }
    }
    ```

    **Explanation of Attack:** The attacker provides the URL `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`, which is the AWS EC2 instance metadata service endpoint. If the graphql-dotnet application is running on an AWS EC2 instance, the vulnerable resolver will make a request to this internal endpoint, potentially exposing sensitive instance metadata (including IAM roles, instance IDs, etc.) to the attacker.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**

    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization for URLs:**
        *   **URL Scheme Whitelisting:** Only allow specific URL schemes (e.g., `https://`, `http://` if absolutely necessary and carefully considered). Disallow schemes like `file://`, `ftp://`, `gopher://`, etc., which can be used for more complex SSRF attacks.
        *   **Hostname/Domain Whitelisting:**  If possible, restrict allowed hostnames or domains to a predefined list of trusted external services.
        *   **URL Parsing and Validation:**  Properly parse the URL and validate its components (hostname, path, query parameters). Use robust URL parsing libraries to avoid bypasses.
        *   **Blacklisting Internal IP Ranges:**  Prevent requests to private IP address ranges (e.g., `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`, `127.0.0.0/8`) and loopback addresses.
    *   **Avoid Direct User Input in URL Construction:**  If possible, avoid directly using user input to construct URLs. Instead, use user input to select from a predefined set of URLs or parameters.
    *   **Server-Side Request Validation:** Before making the external request, perform server-side validation of the resolved URL to ensure it's within allowed boundaries.
    *   **Network Segmentation and Firewalls:**  Implement network segmentation to isolate backend services and limit the impact of SSRF. Use firewalls to restrict outbound traffic from the application server to only necessary external services.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Outbound Connections:**  If the application server needs to make external requests, configure network policies to allow only necessary outbound connections to specific destinations and ports.
    *   **Disable or Restrict Redirections:**  Carefully handle HTTP redirects. In some SSRF scenarios, attackers can use redirects to bypass URL validation. Consider disabling automatic redirects or strictly controlling allowed redirect destinations.
    *   **Use a Dedicated HTTP Client with Security Configurations:** Configure the `HttpClient` (or equivalent HTTP client library) with appropriate security settings, such as timeouts, limits on request size, and potentially a proxy for outbound requests to further control and monitor external communication.

### 5. Conclusion

Input validation vulnerabilities in GraphQL resolvers, specifically Injection Attacks and SSRF, represent significant security risks for graphql-dotnet applications.  The "Resolvers directly use user input in backend queries/commands without sanitization" and "Resolvers make external requests based on user-provided data without proper validation and sanitization of URLs/endpoints" nodes are critical points of failure in the attack tree.

Developers must prioritize secure coding practices in resolvers, focusing on robust input validation, sanitization, and the use of secure query construction techniques like parameterized queries. For SSRF, careful URL validation, whitelisting, and network security measures are essential.

By implementing the mitigation strategies outlined in this analysis, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of these high-risk vulnerabilities and build more secure graphql-dotnet applications. Regular security reviews and penetration testing should also be conducted to identify and address any remaining vulnerabilities.
