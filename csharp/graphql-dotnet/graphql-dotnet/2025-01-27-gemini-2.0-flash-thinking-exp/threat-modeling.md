# Threat Model Analysis for graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet

## Threat: [Query Complexity and Depth Attacks](./threats/query_complexity_and_depth_attacks.md)

*   **Description**:
    *   **Attacker Action:** A malicious actor crafts and sends GraphQL queries with excessive nesting levels or a large number of fields to the GraphQL endpoint.
    *   **Method:** By exploiting the flexibility of GraphQL, the attacker creates queries that require significant server-side processing, database lookups, and resource consumption. Repeatedly sending these complex queries can exhaust server resources.
*   **Impact**:
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Server resources (CPU, memory, database connections) are exhausted, leading to slow response times or complete server unavailability for legitimate users.
*   **Affected GraphQL.NET Component**:
    *   GraphQL Execution Engine (query parsing and execution phases)
*   **Risk Severity**:
    *   High
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   Implement Query Complexity Analysis and Limits within GraphQL.NET middleware.
    *   Set Maximum Query Depth Limits in GraphQL.NET execution options.
    *   Utilize Persisted Queries to pre-analyze and whitelist allowed queries.
    *   Implement Rate Limiting at the GraphQL endpoint level.

## Threat: [Field Authorization Bypass](./threats/field_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description**:
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker attempts to access data fields they are not authorized to view or manipulate through GraphQL queries.
    *   **Method:** By crafting GraphQL queries targeting protected fields, the attacker exploits vulnerabilities in resolver logic where authorization checks are missing, improperly implemented, or bypassed within the GraphQL.NET application.
*   **Impact**:
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers gain access to sensitive data they should not be able to see, potentially leading to data breaches and privacy violations.
*   **Affected GraphQL.NET Component**:
    *   Resolvers (authorization logic implementation)
*   **Risk Severity**:
    *   High
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   Implement Robust Authorization Checks in Resolvers for all sensitive data access.
    *   Use a Consistent Authorization Strategy across all resolvers, potentially using middleware or decorators.
    *   Thoroughly Test Authorization Logic for all fields, especially those returning sensitive data.
    *   Utilize Attribute-Based or Policy-Based Authorization mechanisms provided by .NET.
