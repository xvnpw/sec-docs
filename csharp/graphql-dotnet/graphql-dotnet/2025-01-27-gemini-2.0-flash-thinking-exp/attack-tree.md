## Attack Tree Path: [1. Denial of Service (DoS) via Query Complexity [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__denial_of_service__dos__via_query_complexity__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Attackers craft complex GraphQL queries to overwhelm the server, leading to service disruption.
    *   Deeply Nested Queries [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
        *   No query depth limiting configured [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:  Attackers send excessively nested queries exploiting the lack of depth limits.
    *   Wide Queries (Excessive Field Selection) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
        *   No query complexity analysis based on field count [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]: Attackers select a large number of fields, exploiting the lack of complexity analysis based on field count.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Authorization/Authentication Bypass in Resolvers [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__authorizationauthentication_bypass_in_resolvers__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Attackers bypass authorization checks in resolvers to gain unauthorized access to data or operations.
    *   Missing Authorization Checks in Resolvers [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
        *   No consistent authorization framework implemented [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]: Lack of a framework leads to inconsistent and potentially missing authorization.
        *   Developers fail to implement authorization in specific resolvers [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]: Developer oversight results in resolvers without authorization logic.
    *   Flawed Authorization Logic in Resolvers [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
        *   Insecure authorization logic (e.g., relying on client-side data, flawed role checks) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]: Weaknesses in the implemented authorization logic allow for bypasses.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Input Validation Vulnerabilities in Resolvers [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__input_validation_vulnerabilities_in_resolvers__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Attackers inject malicious input through GraphQL queries due to lack of input validation in resolvers.
    *   Injection Attacks (e.g., SQL Injection, NoSQL Injection, Command Injection) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
        *   Resolvers directly use user input in backend queries/commands without sanitization [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]: User input is directly used in backend operations without proper sanitization, leading to injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Resolvers [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
        *   Resolvers make external requests based on user-provided data without proper validation and sanitization of URLs/endpoints [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]: User-controlled input is used to construct external requests without validation, leading to SSRF.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Business Logic Vulnerabilities Exposed via GraphQL Schema [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__business_logic_vulnerabilities_exposed_via_graphql_schema__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Attackers exploit flaws in the application's business logic that are exposed through the GraphQL schema and resolvers.
    *   GraphQL schema exposes sensitive business logic or operations without proper access control [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]: The schema design unintentionally exposes sensitive business logic without adequate access controls.
    *   Resolvers implement flawed business logic that can be exploited through crafted queries [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]: Bugs or weaknesses in the business logic within resolvers are exploitable through specific queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Outdated GraphQL-dotnet Version with Known Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/5__outdated_graphql-dotnet_version_with_known_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Attackers exploit known security vulnerabilities present in an outdated version of the GraphQL-dotnet library.
    *   Outdated GraphQL-dotnet version with known vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]: The application uses an outdated version of the library containing publicly known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploit Implementation Weaknesses (Developer Errors) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_implementation_weaknesses__developer_errors___high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Attackers exploit vulnerabilities arising from common developer errors in implementing the GraphQL API.
    *   Over-Exposure of Data in Schema [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
        *   Lack of schema design review focusing on data exposure [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]: Insufficient security focus during schema design leads to unintentional exposure of sensitive data.
    *   Insecure Resolver Implementation [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
        *   Resolvers directly accessing databases without proper abstraction and security measures [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]: Resolvers directly interact with databases without secure data access patterns, increasing vulnerability risks.
        *   Resolvers using insecure external APIs or services [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]: Resolvers interact with external APIs or services in an insecure manner, inheriting or introducing vulnerabilities.
