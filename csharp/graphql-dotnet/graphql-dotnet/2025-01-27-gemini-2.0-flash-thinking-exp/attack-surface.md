# Attack Surface Analysis for graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted Query Complexity and Depth Leading to Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_query_complexity_and_depth_leading_to_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:**  GraphQL's flexible query structure allows for deeply nested and complex queries. If `graphql-dotnet` applications don't enforce limits, attackers can exploit this to create queries that consume excessive server resources, causing DoS.
*   **GraphQL.NET Contribution:** `graphql-dotnet` provides the engine to execute GraphQL queries. Without explicit configuration within `graphql-dotnet` to limit query complexity or depth, the application is inherently vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks via complex queries. The framework itself doesn't enforce these limits by default; it's the developer's responsibility to implement them using `graphql-dotnet`'s features.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a deeply nested query with multiple aliases targeting relationships in the schema. Executing this query forces `graphql-dotnet` to resolve numerous fields and objects, overwhelming server CPU, memory, and potentially database connections, leading to service disruption.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, server unavailability, application downtime, financial loss due to service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Query Complexity Analysis using `graphql-dotnet`:** Utilize `graphql-dotnet`'s built-in mechanisms or custom logic to calculate query complexity based on factors like field selections, nesting depth, and aliases. Reject queries exceeding a defined complexity threshold.
    *   **Enforce Query Depth Limits in `graphql-dotnet`:** Configure `graphql-dotnet` to enforce a maximum query depth. Reject queries that exceed this depth to prevent excessively nested requests.
    *   **Resource Monitoring and Throttling:** Monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory, database connections) and implement throttling or request limiting based on resource consumption to mitigate DoS attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Schema Introspection Exposing Sensitive API Details](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_schema_introspection_exposing_sensitive_api_details.md)

*   **Description:**  `graphql-dotnet` enables schema introspection by default, allowing anyone to query the `__schema` and `__type` fields to discover the entire API structure. In production, this can reveal sensitive information about the data model, business logic, and internal systems, aiding attackers in reconnaissance and targeted attacks.
*   **GraphQL.NET Contribution:** `graphql-dotnet`'s default configuration allows full schema introspection.  If developers do not explicitly disable or restrict introspection within their `graphql-dotnet` setup, the schema is publicly accessible. This default behavior directly contributes to the attack surface by readily providing API blueprints to potential attackers.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses an introspection query to retrieve the complete schema. This reveals field names that might indicate sensitive data (e.g., `socialSecurityNumber`, `internalAdminPanel`), relationships that expose business logic, and types that hint at backend database structures. This information is then used to formulate targeted queries or identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, increased risk of targeted attacks, easier identification of sensitive data and business logic, potential for bypassing security measures based on revealed schema details.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (Can be Critical if schema reveals highly sensitive business logic or data structures directly exploitable for high-impact attacks)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable Introspection in Production using `graphql-dotnet` Configuration:**  The most effective mitigation is to disable introspection entirely in production environments by configuring `graphql-dotnet` to prevent access to introspection queries.
    *   **Implement Access Control for Introspection within `graphql-dotnet`:** If introspection is necessary for specific authorized users or internal tools, implement authorization logic within `graphql-dotnet` to restrict access to introspection queries based on user roles or authentication status.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Input Validation Leading to Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_input_validation_leading_to_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** While `graphql-dotnet` provides a type system for defining schemas, it's the developer's responsibility to implement robust input validation within resolvers. If resolvers directly use user-provided input from GraphQL queries without proper validation and sanitization, applications become vulnerable to injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, NoSQL injection) when interacting with backend systems.
*   **GraphQL.NET Contribution:** `graphql-dotnet` facilitates the flow of user input from GraphQL queries to resolvers. However, `graphql-dotnet` itself does not automatically sanitize or validate input *within resolvers*. The framework relies on developers to implement these crucial security measures in their resolver code.  The *lack* of built-in, enforced input validation within resolvers by `graphql-dotnet` directly contributes to this attack surface if developers are not security-conscious.
*   **Example:** A GraphQL mutation takes a `searchQuery` string as input. A resolver directly constructs a database query using this `searchQuery` without sanitization. An attacker could inject malicious SQL code within the `searchQuery` variable, leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation when `graphql-dotnet` executes the resolver and the crafted database query.
*   **Impact:** Data Breach, Data Manipulation, Unauthorized Access to backend systems, potential for server compromise depending on the injection type and backend system vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Robust Input Validation in Resolvers:**  Within each resolver in your `graphql-dotnet` application, implement thorough input validation for all arguments derived from GraphQL queries. Validate data types, formats, ranges, and patterns according to expected input.
    *   **Use Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements in Resolvers:** When resolvers interact with databases or external systems, always use parameterized queries or prepared statements. This prevents injection attacks by separating SQL code from user-provided data, ensuring that input is treated as data, not executable code. This is a crucial practice to adopt within `graphql-dotnet` resolvers.
    *   **Input Sanitization in Resolvers:** Sanitize user inputs within resolvers before processing them, especially when dealing with string inputs that might be used in contexts susceptible to injection (e.g., command execution, dynamic code generation). Choose sanitization methods appropriate for the context.

## Attack Surface: [Verbose Error Responses Exposing Internal Server Details](./attack_surfaces/verbose_error_responses_exposing_internal_server_details.md)

*   **Description:**  `graphql-dotnet`'s default error handling, or poorly configured custom error handling, can lead to verbose error responses being sent to clients. These responses might inadvertently leak sensitive information about the server's internal state, file paths, database details, or application logic, aiding attackers in understanding the system and identifying potential weaknesses.
*   **GraphQL.NET Contribution:** `graphql-dotnet` provides mechanisms for error handling, but the default behavior or incorrect customization can result in overly detailed error messages being exposed.  If developers don't configure `graphql-dotnet` to sanitize error responses, the framework might inadvertently contribute to information disclosure by revealing internal server details in error messages.
*   **Example:** A resolver encounters an exception due to a database connection failure. The `graphql-dotnet` error response, if not properly configured, might include the full database connection string, internal server paths from stack traces, or specific error messages from the database system. This detailed information can be valuable for an attacker trying to understand the application's infrastructure and identify vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, increased risk of targeted attacks, easier reconnaissance for attackers, potential exposure of sensitive configuration details.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Custom Error Handling in `graphql-dotnet`:**  Customize `graphql-dotnet`'s error handling pipeline to sanitize error responses in production. Ensure that error messages sent to clients are generic and do not reveal sensitive internal details.
    *   **Filter Error Details in `graphql-dotnet`:**  Within your custom error handling logic in `graphql-dotnet`, filter error details before sending responses to clients. Remove sensitive information like stack traces, internal paths, database connection strings, and specific error messages that could reveal internal workings.
    *   **Secure Error Logging (Server-Side):** Log detailed error information securely on the server for debugging and monitoring purposes. Ensure these logs are not accessible to unauthorized users and are stored and managed securely.

## Attack Surface: [Batching Vulnerabilities (If Enabled and Improperly Implemented)](./attack_surfaces/batching_vulnerabilities__if_enabled_and_improperly_implemented_.md)

*   **Description:** `graphql-dotnet` supports batching, allowing clients to send multiple GraphQL operations in a single HTTP request. If batching is enabled but not implemented with robust security considerations, vulnerabilities can arise in parsing, validation, authorization, or execution of batched operations. This can lead to bypasses of security checks or unexpected behavior when processing multiple operations together.
*   **GraphQL.NET Contribution:** `graphql-dotnet` provides the functionality to handle batched requests. However, the security implications of batching are heavily dependent on how developers implement and integrate batching within their application's security framework using `graphql-dotnet`.  If not carefully implemented, `graphql-dotnet`'s batching feature can introduce new attack vectors.
*   **Example:** An application uses batching but has inconsistent authorization checks.  A malicious user crafts a batched request containing one authorized operation and one unauthorized operation. Due to flaws in batch processing logic within the `graphql-dotnet` application, the unauthorized operation might be executed along with the authorized one, bypassing intended access controls. Another example could involve DoS if batch processing logic is inefficient and amplifies resource consumption.
*   **Impact:** Authorization Bypass, Data Breach, Denial of Service, unexpected application behavior, potential for exploiting vulnerabilities in batch processing logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (Can be Critical if batching implementation flaws lead to significant authorization bypass or critical data breaches)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Security Testing of Batching Implementation:**  If using batching in `graphql-dotnet`, conduct rigorous security testing specifically focused on batched requests. Test for authorization bypasses, input validation issues, and DoS vulnerabilities in batch processing logic.
    *   **Consistent Validation and Authorization for Batched Operations:** Ensure that validation and authorization checks are consistently and correctly applied to *each individual operation* within a batched request. Do not assume that because one operation in a batch is authorized, all operations in the batch are implicitly authorized.
    *   **Careful Error Handling for Batched Requests:** Implement robust error handling for batched requests. Ensure that errors in one operation within a batch do not inadvertently affect the processing or security of other operations in the same batch. Prevent information leakage through error messages in batched responses.
