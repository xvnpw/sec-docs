# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, graphql-dotnet, provides a GraphQL server implementation for .NET. It aims to enable .NET developers to easily build and deploy GraphQL APIs.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a robust, performant, and developer-friendly GraphQL library for the .NET ecosystem.
  - Facilitate the adoption of GraphQL in .NET applications.
  - Maintain an active and supportive open-source community around the library.

- Most Important Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities within the graphql-dotnet library could be exploited in applications that depend on it, leading to data breaches, service disruption, or other security incidents.
  - Poor performance or scalability of the library could limit its adoption and negatively impact the performance of applications using it.
  - Lack of community support or maintenance could lead to the library becoming outdated or insecure over time.
  - Incompatibility with newer .NET versions or other ecosystem changes could require significant rework and hinder adoption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code reviews by project maintainers and community contributors, implemented as part of the pull request process on GitHub.
  - security control: Public issue reporting on GitHub, allowing users to report potential security vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Version control using Git and GitHub, providing traceability and history of code changes.
  - security control: Open source licensing, allowing for community scrutiny and contribution to security improvements.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: As an open-source project, the project relies on community contributions for security vulnerability discovery and patching, which might introduce delays in addressing security issues.
  - accepted risk: Security testing is primarily the responsibility of the community and users of the library, and might not be as comprehensive as in commercial software.
  - accepted risk:  Dependency vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by graphql-dotnet are a potential risk.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - recommended security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools in the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to detect potential code-level vulnerabilities early in the development cycle.
  - recommended security control: Integrate Dependency Vulnerability Scanning into the CI pipeline to automatically identify and alert on known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
  - recommended security control: Conduct periodic security audits or penetration testing, potentially by engaging external security experts, to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.
  - recommended security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response policy to handle security issues reported by the community in a timely and transparent manner.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: While graphql-dotnet itself does not enforce authentication, it should provide mechanisms and guidance for developers to easily integrate authentication into their GraphQL APIs built with the library. This could include documentation and examples on how to use authentication middleware or directives within the GraphQL schema.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Similar to authentication, graphql-dotnet should offer patterns and best practices for implementing authorization within GraphQL resolvers. This should include mechanisms to control access to specific fields, types, or operations based on user roles or permissions.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: graphql-dotnet must provide robust input validation capabilities to prevent common injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection if data sources are SQL databases, or NoSQL injection). This should include features for validating query parameters, variables, and input types against defined schemas. The library should encourage or enforce validation before query execution.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: While graphql-dotnet might not directly handle cryptographic operations, it should be designed to be compatible with secure communication protocols like HTTPS.  If the library provides features for data persistence or caching, it should support or recommend encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit. Developers using graphql-dotnet should be guided on best practices for secure data handling and encryption within their applications.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Development and maintenance of the graphql-dotnet library itself.
  - Development and operation of applications that rely on graphql-dotnet.
  - Distribution of the graphql-dotnet library to .NET developers.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Source code of graphql-dotnet: High sensitivity. Confidentiality and integrity are crucial to prevent unauthorized modifications or exposure of vulnerabilities.
  - NuGet packages: High sensitivity. Integrity and authenticity are paramount to prevent supply chain attacks and ensure users are using a trusted and unmodified library.
  - Data processed by applications using graphql-dotnet: Sensitivity depends on the specific application. Could range from low to high sensitivity, including personal data, financial data, or other confidential information. The graphql-dotnet library itself should be designed to facilitate secure handling of sensitive data by applications using it.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the current process for handling security vulnerability reports for graphql-dotnet? Is there a dedicated security team or contact?
  - Are there any existing SAST/DAST or dependency scanning tools integrated into the graphql-dotnet CI/CD pipeline?
  - What are the guidelines or recommendations provided to developers using graphql-dotnet regarding secure coding practices, especially concerning authentication, authorization, and input validation in GraphQL APIs?
  - Is there a formal security audit or penetration testing plan for graphql-dotnet?

- Assumptions:
  - The primary use case for graphql-dotnet is building backend GraphQL APIs for web and mobile applications.
  - Security is a significant concern for developers choosing to use graphql-dotnet in their projects.
  - The graphql-dotnet project aims to follow best practices for open-source software development, including security considerations.
  - The deployment scenario described (ASP.NET Core application on Azure App Service) is a representative example of how applications using graphql-dotnet might be deployed.
