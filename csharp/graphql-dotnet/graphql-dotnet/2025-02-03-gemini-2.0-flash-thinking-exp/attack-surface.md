# Attack Surface Analysis for graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet

## Attack Surface: [Complexity Attacks (Query Depth and Breadth)](./attack_surfaces/complexity_attacks__query_depth_and_breadth_.md)

*   **Description:** Abuse of GraphQL's flexible query structure to create excessively complex queries that consume significant server resources.
*   **GraphQL.NET Contribution:** GraphQL.NET, by default, does not enforce limits on query complexity. Without explicit configuration, applications are vulnerable to resource exhaustion.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a deeply nested query with multiple levels of relationships and numerous fields selected at each level. When executed by GraphQL.NET, this query consumes excessive CPU and memory, potentially leading to a Denial of Service.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), server instability, performance degradation, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement query complexity analysis and limits within your GraphQL.NET application. Utilize libraries or custom logic to calculate query complexity based on depth, breadth, and field weights.
    *   Configure maximum query depth and breadth limits in your GraphQL.NET setup. This prevents excessively nested or wide queries from being executed.
    *   Consider using cost analysis to assign weights to different fields and operations within your schema. Limit the total allowed cost of a query.
    *   Implement rate limiting based on query complexity or execution time to further mitigate abuse.

## Attack Surface: [Input Validation Issues in Resolvers](./attack_surfaces/input_validation_issues_in_resolvers.md)

*   **Description:** Lack of proper input validation and sanitization in resolvers, leading to injection vulnerabilities when processing user-provided arguments in GraphQL queries.
*   **GraphQL.NET Contribution:** GraphQL.NET relies on resolvers to handle input arguments. If resolvers within a GraphQL.NET application do not perform adequate validation, they become the point of entry for injection attacks.
*   **Example:** A resolver in a GraphQL.NET schema accepts a `username` argument to fetch user data. If this resolver directly uses the `username` argument in a database query (e.g., SQL) without sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `username` argument, potentially leading to SQL injection and data breaches.
*   **Impact:** Injection attacks (SQL, NoSQL, Command Injection), data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation, and potentially remote code execution depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within **all** resolvers that handle user-provided arguments in your GraphQL.NET application.
    *   Utilize parameterized queries or ORM features provided by your data access layer to prevent SQL injection. Avoid string concatenation of user input into queries.
    *   Apply appropriate encoding and escaping techniques to prevent other types of injection vulnerabilities, such as HTML injection or command injection, depending on how the input is used within the resolver.
    *   Adopt secure coding practices and conduct thorough input validation testing for all resolvers in your GraphQL.NET schema.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Directives and Extensions Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/custom_directives_and_extensions_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws introduced by poorly implemented custom directives or extensions within a GraphQL.NET application, extending the default functionality of GraphQL.
*   **GraphQL.NET Contribution:** GraphQL.NET allows developers to create custom directives and extensions to enhance schema behavior. If these custom components are not developed with security in mind, they can introduce vulnerabilities directly into the GraphQL.NET application.
*   **Example:** A custom authorization directive is created in GraphQL.NET to control access to certain fields. If this directive has a logical flaw in its implementation, attackers might be able to bypass the authorization checks and gain unauthorized access to protected data or operations exposed through the GraphQL API.
*   **Impact:** Bypass of security controls, unauthorized access to data or functionality, potential for various vulnerabilities depending on the purpose and implementation of the custom directive/extension.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and security test **all** custom directives and extensions implemented in your GraphQL.NET application. Treat them as critical security components.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom directives and extensions. Ensure proper input validation, authorization checks, and error handling within these components.
    *   Implement unit and integration tests specifically focused on the security aspects of custom directives and extensions.
    *   Keep custom components updated and patched for any identified vulnerabilities. Regularly audit their code for potential security weaknesses.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Resolvers](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__in_resolvers.md)

*   **Description:** Resolvers within a GraphQL.NET application making external requests based on user-controlled input without proper validation, leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities.
*   **GraphQL.NET Contribution:** GraphQL.NET resolvers are application code and have the capability to perform external HTTP requests. If resolvers in a GraphQL.NET application construct external requests using data directly from GraphQL query arguments without validation, SSRF vulnerabilities can arise.
*   **Example:** A resolver in a GraphQL.NET schema takes a `websiteUrl` argument and attempts to fetch content from that URL. If the resolver doesn't validate the `websiteUrl` and directly uses it to make an HTTP request, an attacker can provide a URL pointing to an internal server or a restricted resource, causing the GraphQL.NET server to make a request to that internal resource, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing further attacks within the internal network.
*   **Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), access to internal resources, potential data breaches by accessing internal services or files, port scanning of internal networks, and potentially further exploitation of internal systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid making external requests directly based on user-controlled input from GraphQL queries whenever possible in your GraphQL.NET resolvers.
    *   If external requests are absolutely necessary, strictly validate and sanitize the input used to construct the request URL or parameters. Implement robust URL validation and sanitization.
    *   Use allowlists to restrict the domains or resources that resolvers are permitted to access. Only allow requests to pre-defined, trusted external domains.
    *   Implement proper network segmentation and firewalls to limit the potential impact of SSRF vulnerabilities, even if they exist in the application code.

## Attack Surface: [GraphQL.NET Version Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/graphql_net_version_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Known security vulnerabilities present in specific versions of the `graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet` library itself.
*   **GraphQL.NET Contribution:** Using older, vulnerable versions of the GraphQL.NET library directly exposes applications to any security flaws that exist within those versions of the library code.
*   **Example:** A critical security vulnerability is discovered and patched in GraphQL.NET version X. Applications that continue to use versions older than X remain vulnerable to this specific security issue, potentially allowing attackers to exploit the vulnerability if they can identify the GraphQL.NET version in use.
*   **Impact:** Various impacts depending on the specific GraphQL.NET vulnerability. These could range from Denial of Service or information disclosure to remote code execution or bypass of security features within the GraphQL.NET library itself.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the specific vulnerability in the GraphQL.NET version)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always use the latest stable and supported version of GraphQL.NET.** Regularly update your GraphQL.NET dependency to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
    *   Actively monitor security advisories and release notes published by the GraphQL.NET project. Subscribe to relevant security mailing lists or channels to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement a process for quickly applying security updates and patches to your GraphQL.NET applications when new versions are released that address known vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using dependency scanning tools to automatically detect outdated and potentially vulnerable versions of GraphQL.NET and its dependencies in your projects.
