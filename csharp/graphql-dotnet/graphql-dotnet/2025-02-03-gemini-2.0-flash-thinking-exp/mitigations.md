# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Introspection in Production](./mitigation_strategies/disable_introspection_in_production.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify the code in your `Startup.cs` or GraphQL configuration where introspection is enabled. This usually involves setting an option or middleware configuration for GraphQL.NET.
    2.  Wrap the introspection enabling code within a conditional statement that checks the current environment.  For example, in ASP.NET Core, you can use `_env.IsDevelopment()` or check an environment variable like `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT`.
    3.  If the environment is *not* development or a designated safe environment (like staging), disable introspection.  This might involve commenting out the introspection enabling line or setting a configuration flag to `false`.
    4.  Deploy the updated code to your production environment.
    5.  Verify that introspection is disabled in production by attempting an introspection query using a tool like GraphiQL or a GraphQL client. You should receive an error or an empty schema.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Schema Exposure (High Severity): Attackers can easily understand the entire API structure, including types, fields, and relationships, aiding in vulnerability discovery and exploitation.
    *   Information Disclosure (Medium Severity): Schema details can sometimes reveal sensitive information about the application's data model and business logic.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Schema Exposure: High Reduction - Completely prevents unauthorized schema discovery via introspection.
    *   Information Disclosure: Medium Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of information leakage through schema analysis.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, in `Startup.cs` within the `ConfigureServices` method, using `_env.IsDevelopment()` to conditionally enable introspection.
*   **Missing Implementation:** N/A

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Query Complexity Analysis](./mitigation_strategies/implement_query_complexity_analysis.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Choose a query complexity analysis library for GraphQL.NET or develop a custom complexity calculation function.  Factors to consider in complexity calculation include query depth, field selections, and multipliers based on arguments (e.g., lists).
    2.  Integrate the complexity analysis into your GraphQL.NET pipeline. This typically involves creating a middleware or schema validation rule that intercepts incoming queries before execution.
    3.  Configure a maximum allowed query complexity score. This threshold should be determined based on your server's capacity and acceptable performance limits.
    4.  In the middleware or validation rule, calculate the complexity score of the incoming GraphQL query.
    5.  Compare the calculated complexity score against the configured maximum.
    6.  If the query's complexity exceeds the limit, reject the query with an appropriate error message (e.g., "Query too complex").
    7.  Monitor query complexity and adjust the maximum threshold as needed based on performance observations and attack patterns.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Queries (High Severity): Attackers can craft extremely complex queries that consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, database connections), leading to service unavailability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   DoS via Complex Queries: High Reduction - Effectively prevents resource exhaustion from overly complex queries by limiting their execution.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Needs to be implemented as a custom middleware in `Startup.cs` or as a schema validation rule. A complexity analysis library needs to be chosen and integrated.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Set Query Depth Limits](./mitigation_strategies/set_query_depth_limits.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify where schema validation rules are configured in your GraphQL.NET setup. This might be within schema building or middleware configuration.
    2.  Add a validation rule that enforces a maximum query depth. GraphQL.NET provides mechanisms to define custom validation rules.
    3.  Set a reasonable maximum query depth limit. This limit should be deep enough to accommodate legitimate use cases but shallow enough to prevent excessively nested queries. A depth of 5-10 is often a good starting point, but adjust based on your application's needs.
    4.  When a query exceeds the depth limit during validation, reject it with an error message indicating that the query is too deeply nested.
    5.  Test the depth limit by sending queries with varying depths to ensure it's enforced correctly.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) via Deeply Nested Queries (Medium Severity): Deeply nested queries, even if not inherently complex in terms of field count, can still strain server resources and database performance due to repeated data fetching.
*   **Impact:**
    *   DoS via Deeply Nested Queries: Medium Reduction - Reduces the impact of DoS attacks based on query depth by limiting nesting, but might not fully prevent all resource exhaustion scenarios.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, a basic depth limit of 7 is configured in the schema validation settings.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Consider making the depth limit configurable via environment variables for easier adjustments in different environments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Query Timeout Mechanisms](./mitigation_strategies/implement_query_timeout_mechanisms.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Configure timeouts at the GraphQL execution level within GraphQL.NET.  This might involve setting timeouts on the execution options or using middleware that enforces timeouts.
    2.  Alternatively, implement timeouts at the data access layer (e.g., database query timeouts). This provides a more granular level of control and prevents long-running database operations. *While data layer timeouts are beneficial, focusing on GraphQL.NET level timeouts is more directly related to the library itself.*
    3.  Set appropriate timeout values. Timeouts should be long enough to allow legitimate queries to complete under normal load but short enough to prevent indefinite resource consumption by malicious or poorly performing queries.
    4.  When a query execution exceeds the timeout, terminate the execution and return an error to the client indicating a timeout.
    5.  Log timeout events for monitoring and analysis.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) via Long-Running Queries (Medium Severity): Attackers can send queries that take an excessively long time to execute, tying up server resources and potentially leading to service degradation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   DoS via Long-Running Queries: Medium Reduction - Prevents queries from running indefinitely, limiting resource consumption, but might not fully mitigate all DoS scenarios if many medium-length queries are sent concurrently.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, a global query timeout of 30 seconds is set in the GraphQL execution options.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Consider implementing more granular timeouts at the resolver level for specific fields or operations that are known to be potentially time-consuming, if GraphQL.NET allows such fine-grained control.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize `AuthorizeAttribute` for Field-Level Security](./mitigation_strategies/utilize__authorizeattribute__for_field-level_security.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Define authorization policies and roles within your application's authentication and authorization framework (e.g., ASP.NET Core Identity).
    2.  Apply the `[Authorize]` attribute (or custom authorization attributes inheriting from it) to specific fields in your GraphQL schema.
    3.  Configure the `AuthorizeAttribute` to specify required roles, policies, or authentication schemes for accessing the field.
    4.  Ensure that your GraphQL execution context is properly populated with user authentication and authorization information (e.g., from HTTP context).
    5.  GraphQL.NET will automatically enforce the authorization rules defined by the `AuthorizeAttribute` before resolving the field. If the user is not authorized, the field will not be resolved, and an authorization error will be returned.
    6.  Test field-level authorization thoroughly to ensure that access is restricted as intended.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity): Prevents users from accessing data they are not permitted to see, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.
    *   Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity): Reduces the risk of users gaining access to sensitive data or operations beyond their authorized privileges.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access: High Reduction - Directly prevents unauthorized access to fields protected by authorization attributes.
    *   Privilege Escalation: Medium Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of privilege escalation by enforcing granular access control.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. `AuthorizeAttribute` is used on some mutations related to administrative tasks, but not consistently across all sensitive fields.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to audit the entire GraphQL schema and apply `AuthorizeAttribute` to all fields that require authorization, especially fields returning sensitive user data or modifying data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate Arguments and Variables](./mitigation_strategies/validate_arguments_and_variables.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Define input types in your GraphQL schema for mutations and queries that accept arguments.
    2.  Within the input type definitions, use GraphQL.NET's validation features (e.g., attributes, custom validation logic) to specify constraints on input values.  Examples include required fields, data type validation, length limits, and regular expression matching.
    3.  In resolvers, access the validated arguments and variables. GraphQL.NET will automatically perform validation based on the input type definitions before resolvers are executed.
    4.  Handle validation errors gracefully. If validation fails, GraphQL.NET will return error messages to the client indicating the validation failures. Customize error messages to be informative but not overly revealing of internal details.
    5.  For complex validation logic that cannot be expressed through input type definitions, implement custom validation within resolvers *using GraphQL.NET's validation mechanisms if possible, otherwise, this becomes less directly related to the library itself.*
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Input Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity): Prevents invalid or malformed data from being processed by the application, ensuring data consistency and preventing unexpected behavior.
    *   Injection Attacks (Low Severity - mitigated more effectively by sanitization):  While validation helps, it's not a primary defense against injection. However, strong validation can reduce the attack surface by rejecting obviously malicious inputs.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Input Data Integrity Issues: High Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of data integrity problems caused by invalid input.
    *   Injection Attacks: Low Reduction - Provides a minor layer of defense against injection attacks, but sanitization is more critical.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, input types are defined for mutations, and basic validation attributes (like `[Required]`) are used in some input types.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to enhance validation rules in input types to cover a wider range of constraints (e.g., format validation, range checks, custom validation logic) using GraphQL.NET's features. Also, review and improve error messages for validation failures.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Customize Error Responses](./mitigation_strategies/customize_error_responses.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Configure GraphQL.NET error handling to customize error responses, especially in production environments.
    2.  Implement a custom error formatter or error handler that intercepts GraphQL errors before they are sent to the client.
    3.  In the error handler, filter error details based on the environment.
        *   In production, return generic error messages to clients (e.g., "An error occurred"). Avoid exposing stack traces, internal exception details, or sensitive system information.
        *   In development, you can provide more detailed error information for debugging purposes.
    4.  Log detailed error information server-side for debugging and monitoring. Ensure that logs are stored securely.
    5.  Test error handling to verify that generic errors are returned in production and detailed errors are available in development logs.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure via Error Messages (Medium Severity): Verbose error messages can reveal sensitive information about the application's internal workings, database structure, file paths, or dependencies, aiding attackers in reconnaissance and vulnerability exploitation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure via Error Messages: Medium Reduction - Prevents accidental disclosure of sensitive information through error responses by providing generic messages to clients in production.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, a custom error formatter is implemented in `Startup.cs` that filters error details based on `_env.IsDevelopment()`. Generic messages are returned in production.
*   **Missing Implementation:** N/A
