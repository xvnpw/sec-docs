# Threat Model Analysis for graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet

## Threat: [Query Complexity Attacks](./threats/query_complexity_attacks.md)

*   **Threat:** Query Complexity Attacks
*   **Description:** An attacker crafts and sends extremely complex GraphQL queries with deep nesting, numerous selections, and resource-intensive resolvers. These queries are designed to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, database connections) during execution, leading to server overload and denial of service. The attacker aims to exhaust server resources and make the application unavailable for legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** Server overload, performance degradation, application unavailability, denial of service for legitimate users, potential financial loss due to downtime.
*   **Affected GraphQL.NET Component:** `GraphQL.Execution.DocumentExecuter`, `GraphQL.Execution.ExecutionStrategy` (Core execution engine responsible for processing and resolving queries).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement query complexity analysis and limits using GraphQL.NET's features or external libraries like `graphql-dotnet/complexity`.
    *   Set maximum query depth and breadth limits using validation rules or custom middleware.
    *   Define cost limits for fields and resolvers based on their computational intensity and enforce these limits during query execution.
    *   Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single IP address or user within a time window to mitigate brute-force complexity attacks.

## Threat: [Inadequate Field-Level Authorization](./threats/inadequate_field-level_authorization.md)

*   **Threat:** Inadequate Field-Level Authorization
*   **Description:** Developers might apply authorization checks only at the type level or forget to implement authorization for specific sensitive fields within types. An attacker could exploit this by crafting queries that target these unprotected fields, even if they are generally authorized to access the type. This allows them to bypass intended access controls and retrieve sensitive data they should not have access to.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, data breaches, privilege escalation if users can access fields containing sensitive information they are not authorized to view, violating data confidentiality and integrity.
*   **Affected GraphQL.NET Component:** Resolvers, `AuthorizeAttribute`, custom authorization logic implemented within resolvers or middleware.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust authorization logic at the field resolver level using GraphQL.NET's authorization features or custom logic.
    *   Define clear authorization policies and rules for each field based on user roles or permissions.
    *   Use attributes like `[Authorize]` on field resolvers or implement custom authorization checks within resolvers.
    *   Regularly review and audit authorization rules to ensure they are correctly implemented and up-to-date, covering all sensitive fields.

## Threat: [Type-Level Authorization Bypass](./threats/type-level_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Threat:** Type-Level Authorization Bypass
*   **Description:** Due to vulnerabilities in authorization logic, misconfigurations, or flaws in custom authorization implementations, an attacker might find ways to bypass type-level authorization checks. This could involve exploiting loopholes in the authorization middleware, finding alternative query paths, or manipulating request parameters to circumvent intended access controls and gain unauthorized access to entire types and their associated data.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data within types, potential data breaches, complete bypass of intended access controls, significant violation of data confidentiality and integrity.
*   **Affected GraphQL.NET Component:** Authorization middleware, custom authorization logic, potentially core GraphQL.NET authorization features if misconfigured or exploited.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure authorization is consistently applied and enforced at both type and field levels, avoiding reliance solely on type-level checks.
    *   Thoroughly test authorization logic with various scenarios and edge cases to identify and fix any bypass vulnerabilities.
    *   Use a consistent and well-defined authorization framework throughout the GraphQL API, minimizing inconsistencies and potential loopholes.
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address authorization bypass vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in GraphQL.NET and its Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_graphql_net_and_its_dependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities in GraphQL.NET and its Dependencies
*   **Description:** GraphQL.NET and its dependencies are software libraries that might contain known security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities in outdated versions of GraphQL.NET or its dependencies to compromise the application, gain unauthorized access, or cause denial of service. Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in these libraries can be easily targeted if applications are not kept up-to-date.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, data breaches, exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the library or its dependencies, potential for remote code execution or other severe security breaches.
*   **Affected GraphQL.NET Component:** The entire GraphQL.NET library and its dependencies (NuGet packages).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update GraphQL.NET and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE databases, NuGet security advisories) for GraphQL.NET and its dependencies.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk) to automatically identify and report known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
    *   Establish a process for promptly patching or upgrading dependencies when vulnerabilities are discovered.
