# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a robust, performant, and easy-to-use GraphQL implementation for the .NET ecosystem.
*   Enable developers to build GraphQL APIs in .NET with minimal friction.
*   Maintain compatibility with the GraphQL specification.
*   Foster a strong community and ecosystem around GraphQL on .NET.
*   Ensure the library is well-documented and easy to learn.
*   Provide a stable and reliable platform for building production-ready GraphQL APIs.
*   Support a wide range of .NET versions and platforms.

Business Risks:

*   Inability to keep up with the evolving GraphQL specification, leading to compatibility issues.
*   Performance bottlenecks that limit the scalability of applications built using the library.
*   Security vulnerabilities that could be exploited in production environments.
*   Lack of community adoption and contribution, hindering the long-term viability of the project.
*   Insufficient documentation or support, making it difficult for developers to use the library effectively.
*   Competition from other GraphQL implementations in the .NET ecosystem.
*   Breaking changes that disrupt existing applications.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Regular dependency updates to address known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. (Visible in the project's dependency management and build process).
*   security control: Use of static analysis tools (e.g., linters) to identify potential code quality and security issues. (Implied by the project's build process and contribution guidelines).
*   security control: Code reviews to ensure code quality and security. (Implied by the project's contribution guidelines and open-source nature).
*   security control: Test coverage to identify and prevent regressions, including security-related issues. (Visible in the project's test suite).
*   security control: Adherence to secure coding practices. (Implied by the project's maturity and community involvement).
*   security control: The project uses GitHub's built-in security features, such as Dependabot, for vulnerability scanning.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The project relies on community contributions, which may introduce security risks if not properly reviewed.
*   accepted risk: The project supports a wide range of .NET versions, which may increase the attack surface.
*   accepted risk: The project is open-source, making its source code publicly available, which could potentially aid attackers in finding vulnerabilities.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a comprehensive security policy that outlines the project's approach to security, including vulnerability disclosure procedures.
*   security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent common web vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and injection attacks.
*   security control: Implement authorization mechanisms to control access to sensitive data and functionality.
*   security control: Use a secure configuration management system to store and manage sensitive configuration data.
*   security control: Implement logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents.
*   security control: Integrate SAST (Static Application Security Testing) and DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) tools into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   security control: Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   The library itself does not handle authentication. It is the responsibility of the application using the library to implement authentication mechanisms. The library should provide hooks or integration points for applications to integrate their authentication solutions.
*   Authorization:
    *   The library should provide mechanisms for implementing authorization at the field level. This could include directives, middleware, or other extension points.
    *   Authorization logic should be clearly separated from business logic.
    *   Support for role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) should be considered.
*   Input Validation:
    *   The library should validate all incoming data against the GraphQL schema.
    *   Customizable validation rules should be supported.
    *   Input sanitization should be performed to prevent injection attacks.
*   Cryptography:
    *   The library should not handle sensitive data directly. If necessary, it should rely on established cryptographic libraries provided by the .NET framework.
    *   Any use of cryptography should adhere to industry best practices.

2.  **Source Code Triggers Build:** The commit triggers a build in the CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions).
3.  **CI/CD Pipeline Builds and Tests:** The CI/CD pipeline performs the following steps:
    *   Checks out the source code.
    *   Restores dependencies.
    *   Compiles the code.
    *   Runs unit tests.
    *   Runs integration tests.
    *   Performs static analysis (SAST) using tools like SonarQube or similar.
    *   Performs dependency scanning (SCA) to identify vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
    *   Packages the application into a build artifact (e.g., a .NET package).
4.  **CI/CD Pipeline Publishes Artifact:** If all checks pass, the CI/CD pipeline publishes the build artifact to a package registry (NuGet).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Providing a reliable and performant GraphQL API service to users.
*   Maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of data accessed through the GraphQL API.
*   Ensuring the availability of the GraphQL API service.

Data Sensitivity:

*   The GraphQL .NET library itself does not handle sensitive data directly. However, it is used to build GraphQL APIs that may handle sensitive data. The sensitivity of the data depends on the specific application using the library.
*   Data sensitivity levels could range from public (non-sensitive) to highly confidential (e.g., PII, financial data, health data).
*   The application using the GraphQL .NET library is responsible for classifying and protecting data according to its sensitivity.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific types of data will be exposed through GraphQL APIs built using this library?
*   What are the specific authentication and authorization requirements for applications using this library?
