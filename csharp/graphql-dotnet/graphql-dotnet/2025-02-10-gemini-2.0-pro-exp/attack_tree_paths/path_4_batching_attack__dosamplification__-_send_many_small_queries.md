# Deep Analysis: GraphQL Batching Attack - Send Many Small Queries

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Send Many Small Queries" batching attack vector against a GraphQL application utilizing the `graphql-dotnet` library.  This includes identifying the specific vulnerabilities, assessing the potential impact, proposing mitigation strategies, and outlining detection methods.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to harden the application against this specific attack.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses *exclusively* on the attack path: **Attacker's Goal -> 4. Batching Attack -> 4.1 Send Many Small Queries**.  We will consider:

*   **`graphql-dotnet` Specifics:** How the library handles batched requests, including default configurations and potential weaknesses.
*   **.NET Environment:**  The underlying .NET runtime and its potential influence on the attack's success (e.g., thread pool exhaustion, memory allocation).
*   **Application Logic:** How the application's specific GraphQL schema and resolvers might exacerbate or mitigate the attack.  We will *not* analyze specific application code, but rather consider general design patterns.
*   **Network Layer:** While the primary focus is on the application layer, we will briefly touch upon network-level mitigations as a secondary defense.
* **Detection:** How to detect such attacks.

We will *not* cover:

*   Other GraphQL attack vectors (e.g., introspection abuse, field suggestion attacks).
*   General denial-of-service attacks unrelated to GraphQL batching.
*   Vulnerabilities in dependencies *other than* `graphql-dotnet` itself (unless directly relevant to this specific attack).

### 1.3 Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Literature Review:**  Examine existing documentation on `graphql-dotnet`, GraphQL security best practices, and known batching attack patterns.
2.  **Code Review (Conceptual):**  Analyze the *conceptual* behavior of `graphql-dotnet` based on its documentation and publicly available source code, focusing on how it processes batched requests.  We will not perform a line-by-line code audit.
3.  **Threat Modeling:**  Apply threat modeling principles to identify potential attack scenarios and their consequences.
4.  **Mitigation Analysis:**  Evaluate potential mitigation strategies, considering their effectiveness, performance impact, and ease of implementation.
5.  **Detection Strategy:**  Develop a strategy for detecting this specific attack, including logging, monitoring, and alerting.
6.  **Reporting:**  Summarize findings and provide clear, actionable recommendations.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Send Many Small Queries

### 2.1 Attack Description and Mechanism

The "Send Many Small Queries" attack exploits the GraphQL batching feature, which allows multiple queries to be sent in a single HTTP request.  The attacker crafts a request containing a large array of individual, valid GraphQL queries.  Each query might be simple (e.g., fetching a single field), but the sheer *volume* of queries overwhelms the server.

The attack works by exploiting several potential bottlenecks:

*   **Parsing Overhead:**  `graphql-dotnet` must parse and validate *each* query in the batch.  A large number of queries increases the CPU time spent on parsing.
*   **Execution Context Creation:**  For each query, `graphql-dotnet` likely creates an execution context, which involves object allocation and initialization.  This adds to memory pressure and garbage collection overhead.
*   **Resolver Execution:**  Even if the resolvers are simple, executing them thousands of times within a single request consumes significant resources.  If resolvers involve database access or external API calls, the impact is amplified.
*   **Thread Pool Exhaustion:**  `graphql-dotnet` (and the underlying ASP.NET Core infrastructure) uses a thread pool to handle requests.  A large batch of queries can consume all available threads, preventing the server from processing other legitimate requests.
*   **Memory Allocation:**  Each query, its associated data, and the execution context consume memory.  A massive batch can lead to excessive memory allocation, potentially causing out-of-memory errors or performance degradation due to swapping.

### 2.2 `graphql-dotnet` Specific Considerations

*   **Default Batching Behavior:**  `graphql-dotnet` *does* support batching by default.  It processes the queries in the batch sequentially.  Crucially, it does *not* have a built-in limit on the number of queries allowed in a batch *by default*. This is the core vulnerability.
*   **`ExecutionOptions.MaxParallelExecutionCount`:** While not directly related to batch *size*, this setting (if used) controls the maximum number of *concurrent* resolvers.  It doesn't prevent a large batch from being parsed and queued, but it can limit the parallelism of resolver execution.  It's a partial mitigation, but insufficient on its own.
*   **`DocumentExecuter.ExecuteAsync`:** This is the core method that processes the GraphQL request.  It iterates through the operations in a batched request.  Understanding its internal logic (through documentation and source code review) is crucial for identifying potential optimization points and vulnerabilities.
* **Complexity Analysis:** `graphql-dotnet` does not have built-in support for complexity analysis.

### 2.3 .NET Environment Considerations

*   **Thread Pool:**  ASP.NET Core uses a thread pool to handle incoming requests.  Exhausting this thread pool is a primary concern.  The default thread pool size is dynamic, but it's not infinite.
*   **Memory Management:**  .NET's garbage collector (GC) can be stressed by the rapid allocation and deallocation of objects associated with each query in the batch.  Frequent GC cycles can significantly impact performance.
*   **I/O Operations:**  If resolvers perform I/O operations (database queries, network requests), the attack can exacerbate I/O bottlenecks.

### 2.4 Attack Scenarios

*   **Scenario 1: Simple Field Requests:**  The attacker sends a batch containing thousands of requests, each fetching a single, simple field from a readily available object.  This overwhelms the parsing and execution context creation.
*   **Scenario 2: Database-Intensive Queries:**  The attacker sends a batch of queries, each triggering a simple database query.  Even if each individual query is fast, the cumulative database load can become significant.
*   **Scenario 3: Nested Queries (Amplification):**  While this path focuses on *many small queries*, a slightly more sophisticated attacker could combine batching with *slightly* nested queries.  Each query in the batch might fetch a list of objects, and then a few fields from each object.  This amplifies the impact.

### 2.5 Impact Assessment

*   **Availability:**  The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS).  The application becomes unresponsive to legitimate users.
*   **Performance:**  Even if the server doesn't completely crash, performance will be severely degraded.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:**  CPU, memory, and potentially database connections will be exhausted.
*   **Financial:**  If the application is hosted on a cloud platform with pay-per-use billing, the attack can lead to increased costs.
*   **Reputational:**  A successful DoS attack can damage the reputation of the application and the organization behind it.

### 2.6 Likelihood and Effort

*   **Likelihood:** Medium.  The attack is relatively easy to execute, and the vulnerability (lack of default batch size limits) is common.
*   **Effort:** Low.  The attacker only needs a basic understanding of GraphQL and a tool to send HTTP requests.
*   **Skill Level:** Novice.  No advanced exploitation techniques are required.

## 3. Mitigation Strategies

The following mitigation strategies are recommended, ordered from most to least critical:

1.  **Limit Batch Size (Essential):**
    *   **Implementation:**  Implement a hard limit on the number of queries allowed in a single batch request.  This is the *most crucial* mitigation.  This can be done by:
        *   **Custom Middleware:**  Create ASP.NET Core middleware that intercepts GraphQL requests, parses the request body (before it reaches `graphql-dotnet`), and counts the number of operations.  If the count exceeds a predefined limit (e.g., 10-20), reject the request with a 400 Bad Request error.
        *   **Validation Rule (Less Preferred):**  Create a custom validation rule within `graphql-dotnet`.  This is less preferred because the request has already been parsed by `graphql-dotnet` before validation occurs, so some overhead has already been incurred.
    *   **Configuration:**  The limit should be configurable, but a reasonable default (e.g., 10) should be enforced.
    *   **Error Handling:**  Provide a clear and informative error message to the client when the batch size limit is exceeded.

2.  **Query Complexity Analysis (Highly Recommended):**
    *   **Implementation:**  Implement query complexity analysis to limit the overall "cost" of a query, regardless of whether it's batched.  This prevents attackers from crafting complex queries that consume excessive resources.
        *   **`graphql-dotnet-server` (Recommended):** Use a library like `graphql-dotnet-server`, which provides built-in support for complexity analysis.
        *   **Custom Implementation:**  If using a third-party library is not feasible, implement a custom complexity analysis solution.  This involves assigning a cost to each field in the schema and calculating the total cost of the query before execution.
    *   **Configuration:**  Define a maximum allowed complexity score per request.

3.  **Rate Limiting (Important):**
    *   **Implementation:**  Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests a client can make within a given time window.  This can be done at the application level (e.g., using a library like `AspNetCoreRateLimit`) or at the network level (e.g., using a web application firewall or API gateway).
    *   **Granularity:**  Consider rate limiting based on IP address, user ID (if authenticated), or other relevant identifiers.

4.  **Timeout Configuration (Important):**
    *   **Implementation:**  Set appropriate timeouts for GraphQL requests and database queries.  This prevents long-running queries from tying up resources indefinitely.
    *   **`ExecutionOptions.CancellationToken`:**  Use the `CancellationToken` in `ExecutionOptions` to enforce timeouts at the GraphQL execution level.
    *   **Database Timeouts:**  Configure timeouts for database connections and queries.

5.  **Resource Monitoring and Alerting (Important):**
    *   **Implementation:**  Monitor key server metrics, such as CPU usage, memory usage, thread pool utilization, and database connection pool usage.  Set up alerts to notify administrators when these metrics exceed predefined thresholds.

6.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF) (Secondary Defense):**
    *   **Implementation:**  Use a WAF to filter out malicious traffic, including requests with excessively large payloads or unusual patterns.  Many WAFs have built-in rules for detecting and mitigating common GraphQL attacks.

7. **Disable Batching (Drastic Measure - Not Recommended):**
    * **Implementation:** It is possible to disable batching entirely.
    * **Considerations:** This is generally *not recommended* because it removes a legitimate and useful feature of GraphQL.  The other mitigations are much more preferable.

## 4. Detection Strategy

Detecting this attack requires a combination of logging, monitoring, and analysis:

1.  **Request Logging:**
    *   Log the full request body for all GraphQL requests (at least for a limited time or under suspicious circumstances).  This allows for post-incident analysis to identify the specific queries used in the attack.
    *   Log the number of operations in each batched request.  This is crucial for identifying requests that exceed the batch size limit.
    *   Log the execution time of each request and each individual query within a batch.

2.  **Performance Monitoring:**
    *   Monitor CPU usage, memory usage, thread pool utilization, and database connection pool usage.  Sudden spikes in these metrics can indicate an attack.
    *   Monitor the number of active GraphQL requests and the average request duration.

3.  **Error Monitoring:**
    *   Monitor the number of 400 Bad Request errors returned due to exceeding the batch size limit.  A sudden increase in these errors is a strong indicator of an attack.
    *   Monitor the number of timeout errors.

4.  **Alerting:**
    *   Set up alerts to notify administrators when:
        *   The batch size limit is exceeded.
        *   Performance metrics exceed predefined thresholds.
        *   The number of errors increases significantly.

5.  **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**
    *   Integrate logs and monitoring data into a SIEM system for centralized analysis and correlation.  This can help identify attack patterns and automate incident response.

6.  **Regular Security Audits:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and assess the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The "Send Many Small Queries" batching attack is a serious threat to GraphQL applications using `graphql-dotnet`.  The lack of a default batch size limit in the library makes it relatively easy for attackers to launch a denial-of-service attack.

**Key Recommendations:**

1.  **Implement a hard limit on the batch size.** This is the *most critical* mitigation.
2.  **Implement query complexity analysis.** This provides a strong defense against a wide range of GraphQL attacks, including those that exploit batching.
3.  **Implement rate limiting.** This limits the overall number of requests a client can make.
4.  **Configure appropriate timeouts.** This prevents long-running queries from consuming resources.
5.  **Implement robust monitoring and alerting.** This enables early detection and response to attacks.

By implementing these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this attack and improve the overall security and resilience of the GraphQL application.
