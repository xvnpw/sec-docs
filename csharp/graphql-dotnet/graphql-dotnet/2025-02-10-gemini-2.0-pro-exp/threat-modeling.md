# Threat Model Analysis for graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet

## Threat: [Query Complexity DoS](./threats/query_complexity_dos.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a deliberately complex, deeply nested GraphQL query, or a query with many aliases, designed to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory).  `graphql-dotnet`'s execution engine is directly responsible for processing these queries.
*   **Impact:** Server becomes unresponsive (Denial of Service), potentially crashing due to resource exhaustion. Legitimate users are unable to access the service.
*   **Affected Component:** `ExecutionStrategy` (and its subclasses like `ParallelExecutionStrategy`), `DocumentExecuter`. The core query execution engine is directly involved.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on server resources and existing protections).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Query Complexity Analysis:** Implement a mechanism to calculate query complexity *before* execution using `IValidationRule` implementations (e.g., a custom rule or `MaxComplexityValidationRule` if available). Reject queries exceeding a threshold.
    *   **Maximum Query Depth:** Configure `Schema.MaxDepth` to limit the maximum nesting depth.
    *   **Query Cost Analysis:** Assign costs to fields and limit the total cost per query, implemented via custom validation rules or middleware.
    *   **Timeout:** Set a reasonable execution timeout using `ExecutionOptions.CancellationToken`.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor server resources to detect attacks.

## Threat: [Batching Attack DoS](./threats/batching_attack_dos.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a single HTTP request containing a large number of GraphQL operations in a batch, exploiting `graphql-dotnet`'s batch processing capabilities to amplify the attack.
*   **Impact:** Server slowdown, resource exhaustion, and potential Denial of Service.
*   **Affected Component:** `DocumentExecuter`, specifically the logic that handles multiple operations within a single request. This is a direct feature of the library.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Limit Batch Size:** Configure `ExecutionOptions.MaxParallelExecutionCount` (or a similar future setting) to restrict operations per batch.
    *   **Rate Limiting (Per Request/IP/User):** Implement rate limiting for batch requests.
    *   **Complexity/Cost Analysis (Per Operation):** Apply complexity/cost analysis to *each* operation within a batch.

## Threat: [Field-Level Authorization Bypass](./threats/field-level_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:**  While authorization *logic* itself isn't solely `graphql-dotnet`'s responsibility, the *location* where it's enforced (within resolvers) is directly tied to how `graphql-dotnet` structures its execution.  An attacker crafts a query to access fields they shouldn't, exploiting missing or incorrect field-level checks *within* `graphql-dotnet` resolvers.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access; data breaches.
*   **Affected Component:** Individual field resolvers (methods within `ObjectGraphType` and other `IGraphType` implementations). The execution flow within `graphql-dotnet` necessitates these checks *within* the resolvers.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on data sensitivity).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Field-Level Authorization:** Implement authorization checks *within each resolver*.
    *   **Consistent Authorization:** Use a consistent authorization strategy across all resolvers.
    *   **Data Loaders (for efficiency):** Use data loaders to avoid redundant checks.
    *   **Testing:** Thoroughly test authorization with different roles and permissions.

## Threat: [Resolver Injection (SQLi, NoSQLi, etc.)](./threats/resolver_injection__sqli__nosqli__etc__.md)

*    **Description:** Although the injection itself is a general vulnerability, the *context* where it occurs (within a `graphql-dotnet` resolver) makes it relevant here. An attacker provides input used unsafely within a resolver to construct database queries or interact with external systems. The vulnerability exists because of how resolvers are implemented *within* the `graphql-dotnet` framework.
*    **Impact:** Data breaches, data modification/deletion, server compromise.
*    **Affected Component:** Individual field resolvers interacting with databases or external systems. The code *within* the `graphql-dotnet` resolver is the vulnerable point.
*    **Risk Severity:** Critical
*    **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *    **Parameterized Queries:** *Always* use parameterized queries or an ORM. *Never* concatenate user input into queries.
    *    **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize *all* user input before using it.
    *    **Least Privilege:** Ensure the database user has only minimum necessary permissions.

## Threat: [Excessive Data Retrieval](./threats/excessive_data_retrieval.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts a query that, while potentially simple in structure, requests an extremely large amount of data. The handling of this data retrieval, and the potential for resource exhaustion, is directly managed by `graphql-dotnet`'s execution engine and resolvers.
* **Impact:** Database overload, slow response times, potential out-of-memory errors and server crashes.
* **Affected Component:** Resolvers that fetch data from the database, `ExecutionStrategy`, and potentially the database itself. `graphql-dotnet`'s execution flow is directly involved.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strict Pagination:** Implement mandatory pagination with reasonable limits on pagination arguments.
    * **Data Loaders:** Use data loaders (e.g., `DataLoaderContext`) to efficiently batch and cache database requests.
    * **Database Query Optimization:** Optimize database queries within resolvers.
    * **Monitoring:** Monitor database performance.
