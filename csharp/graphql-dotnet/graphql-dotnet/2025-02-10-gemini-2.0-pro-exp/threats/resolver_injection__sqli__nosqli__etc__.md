Okay, let's create a deep analysis of the "Resolver Injection" threat within the context of a `graphql-dotnet` application.

## Deep Analysis: Resolver Injection in graphql-dotnet

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Resolver Injection" threat, specifically how it manifests within `graphql-dotnet` applications, its potential impact, and effective mitigation strategies.  We aim to provide actionable guidance for developers to prevent this vulnerability.  This goes beyond a simple definition and dives into the *why* and *how* of the vulnerability.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on injection vulnerabilities that occur *within* the resolver functions of a `graphql-dotnet` application.  This includes, but is not limited to:

*   SQL Injection (SQLi) targeting relational databases (e.g., SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL).
*   NoSQL Injection (NoSQLi) targeting NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, CosmosDB).
*   Other forms of injection where user-supplied data is unsafely used to interact with *any* external system (e.g., command injection, LDAP injection, etc.) accessed from within a resolver.
*   Injection vulnerabilities that are exploitable due to the way `graphql-dotnet` handles resolver execution and input.

We *exclude* general GraphQL vulnerabilities that are not directly related to resolver code (e.g., introspection abuse, denial-of-service attacks on the GraphQL engine itself).  We also exclude vulnerabilities in the underlying database or external systems themselves, focusing only on how the `graphql-dotnet` application interacts with them.

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Definition and Contextualization:**  Clearly define the threat and explain how it specifically applies to `graphql-dotnet` resolvers.
2.  **Code Example Analysis:**  Provide concrete C# code examples demonstrating vulnerable and secure resolver implementations.
3.  **Exploitation Scenarios:**  Describe realistic scenarios where an attacker could exploit this vulnerability.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  Detail the potential consequences of a successful attack.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Deep Dive:**  Provide in-depth explanations of each mitigation strategy, including code examples and best practices.
6.  **Testing and Verification:**  Outline how to test for and verify the absence of this vulnerability.
7.  **Tooling and Resources:**  Recommend tools and resources that can aid in preventing and detecting resolver injection.

### 2. Threat Definition and Contextualization

**Resolver Injection**, in the context of `graphql-dotnet`, refers to a class of vulnerabilities where an attacker can manipulate the data processing logic *within a GraphQL resolver* by injecting malicious input.  Resolvers are the core functions in GraphQL that fetch the data for each field in a query.  They are the bridge between the GraphQL schema and the underlying data sources.

The vulnerability arises when a resolver uses user-provided input (arguments passed to the GraphQL query) directly in database queries, command executions, or interactions with other external systems *without proper sanitization or parameterization*.  This is *not* a vulnerability in the `graphql-dotnet` library itself, but rather a vulnerability in the *application code* written *using* the library.  The library provides the framework, but the developer is responsible for secure data handling within the resolvers.

**Key Difference from General Injection:**  While injection vulnerabilities are common, the `graphql-dotnet` context is crucial.  The attacker's entry point is a GraphQL query, and the vulnerable code resides specifically within the resolver function.  This impacts how we test for and mitigate the vulnerability.

### 3. Code Example Analysis

**Vulnerable Example (SQLi):**

```csharp
public class Query
{
    public async Task<IEnumerable<User>> GetUsersByName(string name, [Service] MyDbContext dbContext)
    {
        // VULNERABLE: Direct string concatenation
        string sql = $"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name = '{name}'";
        return await dbContext.Users.FromSqlRaw(sql).ToListAsync();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `name` argument from the GraphQL query is directly concatenated into the SQL query string.  An attacker could provide a value like `' OR 1=1 --` to bypass the intended `WHERE` clause and retrieve all users.

**Secure Example (SQLi - Parameterized Query):**

```csharp
public class Query
{
    public async Task<IEnumerable<User>> GetUsersByName(string name, [Service] MyDbContext dbContext)
    {
        // SECURE: Parameterized query
        return await dbContext.Users.FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name = @name", new SqlParameter("@name", name)).ToListAsync();
    }
}
```

This example uses a parameterized query.  The `@name` placeholder is replaced with the value of the `name` variable by the database engine, preventing SQL injection.  The database treats `@name` as a *value*, not as part of the SQL command itself.

**Vulnerable Example (NoSQLi - MongoDB):**

```csharp
public class Query
{
    public async Task<IEnumerable<User>> GetUsersByName(string name, [Service] IMongoDatabase database)
    {
        // VULNERABLE:  Directly using user input in a filter
        var filter = Builders<User>.Filter.Eq("name", name);
        return await database.GetCollection<User>("Users").Find(filter).ToListAsync();
    }
}
```
While this looks safer, it is still vulnerable. An attacker can inject MongoDB query operators. For example, if `name` is set to `{ "$ne": null }`, this will return all users, because it's equivalent to saying "find all users where the name is not null".

**Secure Example (NoSQLi - MongoDB):**

```csharp
public class Query
{
    public async Task<IEnumerable<User>> GetUsersByName(string name, [Service] IMongoDatabase database)
    {
        // SECURE:  Validate and sanitize input, then use a strongly-typed filter.
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(name) || name.Length > 50) // Basic validation
        {
            throw new ArgumentException("Invalid name");
        }

        // Use a strongly-typed filter to prevent operator injection.
        var filter = Builders<User>.Filter.Regex(u => u.Name, new BsonRegularExpression($"^{Regex.Escape(name)}$"));
        return await database.GetCollection<User>("Users").Find(filter).ToListAsync();
    }
}
```

This example performs basic input validation and, crucially, uses a `Regex` filter with proper escaping.  This prevents the attacker from injecting arbitrary MongoDB operators.  The `Regex.Escape` ensures that any special characters in `name` are treated as literal characters, not as regex metacharacters.  The `^` and `$` anchors ensure that the entire name must match, preventing partial matches.

### 4. Exploitation Scenarios

*   **SQLi - Data Exfiltration:** An attacker crafts a GraphQL query with a malicious `name` argument to extract sensitive data from the `Users` table (e.g., passwords, email addresses).  They might use techniques like UNION-based SQLi or time-based blind SQLi.
*   **SQLi - Data Modification:** An attacker uses SQLi to modify data in the database, such as changing user roles, deleting records, or inserting malicious data.
*   **NoSQLi - Data Exfiltration (MongoDB):** An attacker injects MongoDB query operators to bypass filters and retrieve all documents from a collection.
*   **Command Injection:** If a resolver interacts with the operating system (e.g., to execute a shell command), an attacker could inject commands to gain control of the server.  This is less common but highly critical.
*   **LDAP Injection:** If a resolver interacts with an LDAP directory, an attacker could inject LDAP filters to gain unauthorized access to directory information.

### 5. Mitigation Strategy Deep Dive

*   **Parameterized Queries (SQLi):**
    *   **Explanation:**  Parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements) separate the SQL command from the data.  The database engine treats the parameters as *data*, not as executable code, preventing SQL injection.
    *   **Code Example (EF Core):**  See the "Secure Example (SQLi)" above.
    *   **Best Practices:**  Use parameterized queries for *all* SQL queries that involve user input.  Avoid any form of string concatenation or interpolation when building SQL queries.  Use an ORM (like Entity Framework Core) whenever possible, as it typically handles parameterization automatically.

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Explanation:**  Validate *all* user input to ensure it conforms to expected types, lengths, and formats.  Sanitize input by removing or escaping potentially dangerous characters.
    *   **Code Example (General):**
        ```csharp
        public string SanitizeInput(string input)
        {
            if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(input))
            {
                return string.Empty;
            }

            // Basic example - replace potentially dangerous characters
            input = input.Replace("'", "''").Replace(";", "").Replace("--", "");
            return input;
        }
        ```
        **Important:** This is a *basic* example and may not be sufficient for all cases.  Consider using a dedicated sanitization library.
    *   **Best Practices:**
        *   **Whitelist, not Blacklist:**  Define a set of *allowed* characters or patterns, rather than trying to block specific *disallowed* characters.  Blacklists are often incomplete.
        *   **Context-Specific Validation:**  The validation rules should be specific to the expected data type and format.  For example, validate email addresses using a regular expression or a dedicated library.
        *   **Layered Validation:**  Perform validation at multiple layers (e.g., client-side, server-side, database constraints).  Server-side validation is *essential*.
        *   **Use Libraries:**  Leverage libraries like `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` for declarative validation or FluentValidation for more complex rules.

*   **Least Privilege:**
    *   **Explanation:**  The database user account used by the application should have only the minimum necessary permissions.  For example, if a resolver only needs to read data, the database user should not have write or delete permissions.
    *   **Best Practices:**
        *   **Separate Accounts:**  Use different database user accounts for different parts of the application, with granular permissions.
        *   **Avoid `dbo` or `root`:**  Never use the database owner or root account for application access.
        *   **Regular Audits:**  Regularly review database user permissions to ensure they are still appropriate.

*   **ORM Usage (Object-Relational Mapper):**
    *   **Explanation:** ORMs like Entity Framework Core provide an abstraction layer over the database, often handling parameterization and query building automatically. This significantly reduces the risk of SQLi.
    *   **Best Practices:**
        *   **Avoid Raw SQL:**  Prefer using the ORM's query building methods (e.g., LINQ in EF Core) over raw SQL queries.
        *   **Understand ORM Limitations:**  Be aware of any potential injection vulnerabilities within the ORM itself (rare, but possible).  Keep the ORM updated.

* **Safe NoSQL Query Construction:**
    * **Explanation:** When working with NoSQL databases, avoid directly embedding user input into query filters or commands. Use the database driver's API to build queries in a structured way, preventing operator injection.
    * **Best Practices:**
        * **Strongly-Typed Filters:** Use strongly-typed filters and builders provided by the database driver (e.g., MongoDB C# driver's `Builders` class).
        * **Avoid Dynamic Filters:** Minimize the use of dynamic filters constructed from user input. If necessary, thoroughly validate and sanitize the input before using it to build the filter.
        * **Regular Expressions with Escaping:** When using regular expressions in filters, ensure that user input is properly escaped to prevent regex injection.

### 6. Testing and Verification

*   **Static Analysis:**
    *   Use static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube, Roslyn analyzers) to automatically detect potential injection vulnerabilities in the code.  These tools can identify patterns of unsafe string concatenation or missing parameterization.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (DAST):**
    *   Use dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) to scan the running application for injection vulnerabilities.  These tools send malicious payloads to the application and analyze the responses.
*   **Manual Code Review:**
    *   Conduct thorough code reviews, focusing specifically on resolver functions and how they handle user input.  Look for any instances of string concatenation or unsafe interaction with external systems.
*   **Penetration Testing:**
    *   Engage security professionals to perform penetration testing, simulating real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities.
*   **Unit and Integration Tests:**
    *   Write unit and integration tests that specifically target resolver functions with various inputs, including malicious payloads, to ensure that the mitigation strategies are effective.
    *   Example (xUnit):
        ```csharp
        [Theory]
        [InlineData("' OR 1=1 --")]
        [InlineData("'; DROP TABLE Users --")]
        public async Task GetUsersByName_ShouldNotBeVulnerableToSqlInjection(string maliciousInput)
        {
            // Arrange
            var dbContext = // ... (setup mock or in-memory database)
            var query = new Query();

            // Act & Assert
            await Assert.ThrowsAsync<Exception>(() => query.GetUsersByName(maliciousInput, dbContext));
            // Or, if you expect a specific exception type:
            // await Assert.ThrowsAsync<SqlException>(() => query.GetUsersByName(maliciousInput, dbContext));
        }
        ```
