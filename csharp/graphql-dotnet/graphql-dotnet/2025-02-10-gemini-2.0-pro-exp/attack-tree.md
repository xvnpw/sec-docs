## Attack Tree Path: [Path 1: Overly Complex Queries (DoS) - High Depth Limit](./attack_tree_paths/path_1_overly_complex_queries__dos__-_high_depth_limit.md)

**Path 1: Attacker's Goal -> 2. Overly Complex Queries (DoS) -> 2.1 High Depth Limit [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker crafts a GraphQL query with excessive nesting, exceeding any configured depth limits (or exploiting the absence of a depth limit). This consumes server resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [Path 2: Overly Complex Queries (DoS) - Lack of Query Cost Analysis](./attack_tree_paths/path_2_overly_complex_queries__dos__-_lack_of_query_cost_analysis.md)

**Path 2: Attacker's Goal -> 2. Overly Complex Queries (DoS) -> 2.2 Lack of Query Cost Analysis [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The server lacks query cost analysis, allowing the attacker to submit queries that are computationally expensive without being rejected upfront.  The server attempts to process the query, leading to resource exhaustion and DoS.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Path 3: Overly Complex Queries (DoS) - Lack of Field-Level Complexity Limits](./attack_tree_paths/path_3_overly_complex_queries__dos__-_lack_of_field-level_complexity_limits.md)

**Path 3: Attacker's Goal -> 2. Overly Complex Queries (DoS) -> 2.3 Lack of Field-Level Complexity Limits [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Even with a depth limit, a query can be expensive if it requests many fields at a shallower depth.  Without field-level complexity limits, the attacker can craft such a query to cause DoS.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Path 4: Batching Attack (DoS/Amplification) - Send Many Small Queries](./attack_tree_paths/path_4_batching_attack__dosamplification__-_send_many_small_queries.md)

**Path 4: Attacker's Goal -> 4. Batching Attack -> 4.1 Send Many Small Queries [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker sends a single GraphQL request containing a large number of small, but valid, queries. This overwhelms the server's processing capacity, leading to DoS.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [Path 5: Batching Attack (DoS/Amplification) - Amplify Resource Consumption](./attack_tree_paths/path_5_batching_attack__dosamplification__-_amplify_resource_consumption.md)

**Path 5: Attacker's Goal -> 4. Batching Attack -> 4.3 Amplify Resource Consumption [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker combines batching with complex queries (e.g., deeply nested or with many fields). This significantly amplifies the resource consumption on the server, making DoS more likely.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Path 6: Insecure Defaults/Misconfiguration - Expose Introspection](./attack_tree_paths/path_6_insecure_defaultsmisconfiguration_-_expose_introspection.md)

**Path 6: Attacker's Goal -> 5. Insecure Defaults/Misconfiguration -> 5.1 Expose Introspection in Production [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** Introspection is left enabled in the production environment. This allows attackers to query the schema and discover all available types, fields, and relationships, providing a complete map of the API for further attacks.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [Path 7: Insecure Defaults/Misconfiguration - Disable Validation Rules](./attack_tree_paths/path_7_insecure_defaultsmisconfiguration_-_disable_validation_rules.md)

**Path 7: Attacker's Goal -> 5. Insecure Defaults/Misconfiguration -> 5.2 Disable Validation Rules [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **Description:**  `graphql-dotnet`'s built-in validation rules (which help prevent various attacks) are disabled. This weakens the overall security posture of the application.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: 6.1 Target Unpatched CVEs](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_6_1_target_unpatched_cves.md)

*   **6.1 Target Unpatched CVEs [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits a known, publicly disclosed vulnerability (CVE) in the `graphql-dotnet` library or its dependencies.  The specific impact depends on the CVE, but it can range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on patching practices)
    *   **Impact:** High-Very High (depends on the CVE)
    *   **Effort:** Low-Medium (depends on the CVE)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate-Advanced (depends on the CVE)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-Hard (requires vulnerability scanning)
