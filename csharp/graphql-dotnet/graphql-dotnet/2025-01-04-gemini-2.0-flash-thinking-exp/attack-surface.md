# Attack Surface Analysis for graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet

## Attack Surface: [Query Complexity Attacks (GraphQL Bomb)](./attack_surfaces/query_complexity_attacks__graphql_bomb_.md)

**Description:** Attackers craft excessively complex or deeply nested queries that consume significant server resources (CPU, memory, database connections), leading to denial-of-service (DoS).

**How graphql-dotnet contributes:** `graphql-dotnet` will attempt to execute any valid GraphQL query, including those with high complexity, without built-in limitations or enforcement of complexity constraints. It's the responsibility of the developer to implement such controls *on top* of `graphql-dotnet`.

**Example:** An attacker sends a query with deeply nested object selections and numerous aliases, forcing the server to perform a large number of database queries and object instantiations, overwhelming resources.

**Impact:** Service disruption, resource exhaustion, and potential server crashes.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement query complexity analysis and limits. This involves calculating a cost for each field and limiting the total cost of a query. Developers need to use `graphql-dotnet`'s features or external libraries to implement this.
*   Set maximum query depth limits (can be enforced within `graphql-dotnet`'s execution pipeline).
*   Implement timeout mechanisms for query execution.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Rate Limiting or Request Throttling](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_rate_limiting_or_request_throttling.md)

**Description:** Without rate limiting, attackers can send a large number of requests to the GraphQL endpoint, potentially leading to DoS.

**How graphql-dotnet contributes:** `graphql-dotnet` itself does not provide built-in rate limiting or request throttling mechanisms. The application using `graphql-dotnet` needs to implement this externally.

**Example:** An attacker floods the GraphQL endpoint with numerous requests, overwhelming the server and making it unavailable to legitimate users.

**Impact:** Service disruption, resource exhaustion.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement rate limiting or request throttling at the web server or application level (middleware) that sits in front of the `graphql-dotnet` endpoint.
*   Consider using API gateways or load balancers with rate limiting capabilities.
