# Threat Model Analysis for graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Queries](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_complex_queries.md)

**Description:**
*   **What the attacker might do:** An attacker sends intentionally complex and resource-intensive GraphQL queries that exploit the `graphql-dotnet` query execution engine.
*   **How:** These queries involve deep nesting of fields or request large amounts of data, causing the `graphql-dotnet` execution engine to consume excessive CPU, memory, or database connections.
**Impact:**
*   The server's resources are exhausted, leading to slow response times or complete unavailability for legitimate users due to the way `graphql-dotnet` processes and executes the complex query.
**Which https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet component is affected:**
*   `GraphQL.Execution` module, specifically the query execution engine.
*   `GraphQL.Validation` module (if complexity analysis features provided by `graphql-dotnet` are not properly configured or bypassed).
**Risk Severity:** High.
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement query complexity analysis using the features provided by `graphql-dotnet` and set appropriate limits.
*   Configure query execution timeouts within `graphql-dotnet`.
*   Implement query depth limiting, potentially using custom validation rules within `graphql-dotnet`.

## Threat: [Excessive Introspection Information Disclosure](./threats/excessive_introspection_information_disclosure.md)

**Description:**
*   **What the attacker might do:** An attacker leverages the built-in GraphQL introspection feature handled by `graphql-dotnet` to query the schema.
*   **How:** They send standard introspection queries (e.g., `__schema`, `__type`) to the GraphQL endpoint, which are processed by `graphql-dotnet`.
**Impact:**
*   Detailed knowledge of the data structure, available types, fields, arguments, and relationships is exposed through `graphql-dotnet`'s introspection capabilities, making it easier to craft targeted attacks.
**Which https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet component is affected:**
*   `GraphQL.Introspection` module, specifically the built-in introspection resolvers provided by `graphql-dotnet`.
**Risk Severity:** High (if sensitive data structures are revealed).
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Disable introspection in production environments by configuring `graphql-dotnet` accordingly.
*   Implement access controls for introspection queries within the `graphql-dotnet` pipeline, allowing only authorized users or services.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities within `graphql-dotnet` Itself (Hypothetical)](./threats/vulnerabilities_within__graphql-dotnet__itself__hypothetical_.md)

**Description:**
*   **What the attacker might do:** An attacker exploits a potential security vulnerability within the `graphql-dotnet` library's code.
*   **How:** This could involve sending specially crafted queries or requests that trigger a bug or flaw in `graphql-dotnet`'s parsing, validation, or execution logic.
**Impact:**
*   The impact is highly dependent on the nature of the vulnerability. It could range from denial of service due to crashes or infinite loops within `graphql-dotnet`, to information disclosure if internal data structures are exposed, or even remote code execution in extreme (though unlikely) scenarios.
**Which https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet component is affected:**
*   Any module within the `graphql-dotnet` library could potentially be affected, depending on the nature of the vulnerability (e.g., `GraphQL.Parsing`, `GraphQL.Validation`, `GraphQL.Execution`, `GraphQL.Types`).
**Risk Severity:** Critical (if remote code execution or significant data breach is possible).
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep `graphql-dotnet` updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
*   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to `graphql-dotnet`.
*   Report any suspected vulnerabilities in `graphql-dotnet` to the maintainers.
