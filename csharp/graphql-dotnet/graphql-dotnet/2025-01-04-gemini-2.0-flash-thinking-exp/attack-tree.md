## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application via graphql-dotnet [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_via_graphql-dotnet__critical_node_.md)

* This is the root goal and represents the overall objective of the attacker. Its criticality lies in the fact that all subsequent attacks aim to achieve this.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Query Parsing/Validation Weaknesses [HIGH-RISK PATH START]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_query_parsingvalidation_weaknesses__high-risk_path_start_.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * Sending maliciously crafted queries to overwhelm the parser or bypass validation.
* **Critical Nodes:**
    * **Send Maliciously Crafted Query:** This action is central to exploiting parsing weaknesses.
    * **Bypass Input Validation Rules:** Success here allows attackers to inject malicious data or bypass intended restrictions.
* **High-Risk Paths:**
    * **Send Deeply Nested Query:** Can lead to Denial of Service through resource exhaustion.
    * **Send Query with Many Aliases/Fragments:** Another method to cause Denial of Service.
    * **Exploit Weaknesses in Input Type Validation:** Enables injection of unexpected or malicious data.
    * **Exploit Lack of Rate Limiting on Complex Queries:** Allows attackers to repeatedly send resource-intensive queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Field Resolution Logic [HIGH-RISK PATH START]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_field_resolution_logic__high-risk_path_start_.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * Targeting expensive or vulnerable field resolvers.
* **Critical Nodes:**
    * **Trigger Expensive Field Resolvers:** The action of invoking resolvers that consume significant resources.
    * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Resolvers:** Directly attacking flaws in resolver code.
* **High-Risk Paths:**
    * **Request Multiple Expensive Fields in a Single Query:**  A direct way to cause resource exhaustion.
    * **Chain Expensive Resolvers in a Query:** Amplifies the resource consumption.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Introspection Features:](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_introspection_features.md)

* **Critical Nodes:**
    * **Use Discovered Information [CRITICAL NODE - ENABLER FOR OTHER ATTACKS]:** While accessing introspection data has low direct impact, the information gained is crucial for crafting more targeted attacks against other vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Lack of Proper Resource Limits [HIGH-RISK PATH START]:](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_lack_of_proper_resource_limits__high-risk_path_start_.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * Sending queries that exceed the application's capacity.
* **Critical Nodes:**
    * **Send Queries Exceeding Allowed Complexity:**  Exploiting the absence of complexity limits.
    * **Send Queries with Excessive Depth:** Exploiting the absence of depth limits.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploit Potential Vulnerabilities in graphql-dotnet Library Itself [HIGH-RISK PATH START]:](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_potential_vulnerabilities_in_graphql-dotnet_library_itself__high-risk_path_start_.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * Targeting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the `graphql-dotnet` library.
* **Critical Nodes:**
    * **Identify and Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in the Library Version:** The core action of leveraging library vulnerabilities.
