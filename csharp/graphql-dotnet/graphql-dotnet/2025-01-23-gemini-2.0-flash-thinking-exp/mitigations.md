# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Introspection in Production](./mitigation_strategies/disable_introspection_in_production.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Production Environment:** Determine if the application is running in a production environment using environment variables or configuration settings within your ASP.NET Core application.
    2.  **Locate GraphQL Configuration:** Find the `GraphQLHttpMiddleware` or `DocumentExecuter` configuration in your `Startup.cs` or GraphQL setup class.
    3.  **Configure `EnableIntrospection`:** Within the `GraphQLHttpMiddleware` options, set `EnableIntrospection = false;` when in production. Use conditional logic (e.g., `Environment.IsDevelopment()`) to enable it in development environments if needed.
    4.  **Deploy Configuration:** Deploy the updated application configuration to your production environment.
    5.  **Verify:** After deployment, attempt an introspection query against your GraphQL endpoint. Confirm that introspection is disabled and returns an error or is blocked, as configured by `graphql-dotnet`.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Schema Exposure - Severity: High
    *   Information Disclosure - Severity: Medium
    *   Attack Surface Mapping - Severity: High

*   **Impact:**
    *   Schema Exposure: High Risk Reduction
    *   Information Disclosure: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Attack Surface Mapping: High Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - `EnableMetrics = true` is configured in `Startup.cs`, but `EnableIntrospection` is not explicitly set, defaulting to `true` in `graphql-dotnet`.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Explicitly set `options.EnableIntrospection = Environment.IsDevelopment();` within the `GraphQLHttpMiddleware` configuration in `Startup.cs`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Query Complexity Analysis and Limiting](./mitigation_strategies/query_complexity_analysis_and_limiting.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure `ComplexityConfiguration`:** In your GraphQL setup (e.g., `Startup.cs`), instantiate a `ComplexityConfiguration` object.
    2.  **Define Complexity Rules:** Set properties within `ComplexityConfiguration`:
        *   `MaxComplexity`: Define the maximum allowed complexity score for a query.
        *   `FieldImpact`: Set the base complexity cost per field selection.
        *   `MultiplierImpact`: Define the cost multiplier for list fields or fields with multipliers.
        *   Optionally, implement custom `ComplexityCalculator` if needed for more advanced complexity calculations.
    3.  **Apply Configuration to Options:** Assign the configured `ComplexityConfiguration` to the `options.ComplexityConfiguration` property of your `GraphQLHttpMiddleware` or `DocumentExecuter` options.
    4.  **Test Limits:** Send GraphQL queries exceeding the configured `MaxComplexity`. Verify that `graphql-dotnet` rejects these queries with a complexity error.
    5.  **Tune Rules:** Monitor API usage and adjust `ComplexityConfiguration` values to balance security and application needs.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Complex Query DoS - Severity: High
    *   Performance Degradation - Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   Complex Query DoS: High Risk Reduction
    *   Performance Degradation: Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** No - `ComplexityConfiguration` is not configured within the `graphql-dotnet` setup.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Instantiate and configure `ComplexityConfiguration` in `Startup.cs` and assign it to `options.ComplexityConfiguration` within the `GraphQLHttpMiddleware` options.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Query Depth Limiting](./mitigation_strategies/query_depth_limiting.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Set `MaxQueryDepth` Option:** In your GraphQL configuration (e.g., `Startup.cs`), set the `options.MaxQueryDepth` property of `GraphQLHttpMiddleware` or `DocumentExecuter` options to a desired integer value (e.g., 5-10).
    2.  **Apply Configuration:** Ensure this configuration is applied when setting up your `GraphQLHttpMiddleware` or `DocumentExecuter`.
    3.  **Test Limits:** Create GraphQL queries with nesting levels exceeding `MaxQueryDepth`. Verify that `graphql-dotnet` rejects these queries with a depth limit error.
    4.  **Adjust Limit (If Necessary):** If legitimate use cases require deeper queries, carefully consider increasing `MaxQueryDepth`, while being aware of potential DoS implications.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Deeply Nested Query DoS - Severity: Medium
    *   Resource Exhaustion - Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   Deeply Nested Query DoS: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Resource Exhaustion: Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** No - `MaxQueryDepth` is not configured in the `graphql-dotnet` setup.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Set `options.MaxQueryDepth = [desired depth limit];` within the `GraphQLHttpMiddleware` options in `Startup.cs`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Timeout Settings using `CancellationToken`](./mitigation_strategies/timeout_settings_using__cancellationtoken_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create `CancellationTokenSource`:** When executing a GraphQL query using `DocumentExecuter.ExecuteAsync`, create a `CancellationTokenSource` with a specified timeout duration (e.g., `TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30)`).
    2.  **Pass `CancellationToken` to `ExecuteAsync`:** Obtain the `CancellationToken` from the `CancellationTokenSource` (`cancellationTokenSource.Token`) and pass it as an argument to the `ExecuteAsync` method of your `DocumentExecuter`.
    3.  **Handle `TaskCanceledException`:** Implement exception handling to catch `TaskCanceledException` (or `OperationCanceledException`) that `graphql-dotnet` will throw if the query execution exceeds the timeout.
    4.  **Return Timeout Error:** In your exception handling, return a GraphQL error indicating a timeout to the client, instead of exposing internal exceptions.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Long-Running Query DoS - Severity: Medium
    *   Resource Holding - Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   Long-Running Query DoS: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Resource Holding: Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** No - Explicit timeout configuration using `CancellationToken` within `graphql-dotnet` query execution is not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Modify the code where `DocumentExecuter.ExecuteAsync` is called to include a `CancellationToken` with a timeout. Implement error handling for `TaskCanceledException` to return a GraphQL timeout error.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Authorization Checks in Resolvers using Context](./mitigation_strategies/implement_authorization_checks_in_resolvers_using_context.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access `context.User`:** Within your GraphQL resolvers, access the `context.User` property (of type `GraphQL.ResolveFieldContext<TSource>`) to retrieve the authenticated user information established by your ASP.NET Core authentication middleware.
    2.  **Implement Authorization Logic:** In each resolver requiring authorization, implement conditional logic to check if the `context.User` (or associated roles/claims) has the necessary permissions to access the requested data or perform the mutation.
    3.  **Use `AuthorizeAttribute` (Optional, for ASP.NET Core):** For ASP.NET Core applications, consider using the `[Authorize]` attribute on controller actions that handle GraphQL requests for a basic level of authorization enforcement *before* reaching resolvers. However, granular field-level authorization still needs to be in resolvers.
    4.  **Return Authorization Error:** If authorization fails in a resolver, return a GraphQL error (e.g., using `context.Errors.Add(new AuthorizationError("Unauthorized"));`) to indicate lack of permissions.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access - Severity: High
    *   Data Manipulation Bypass - Severity: High
    *   Privilege Escalation - Severity: High

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access: High Risk Reduction
    *   Data Manipulation Bypass: High Risk Reduction
    *   Privilege Escalation: High Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - Basic authentication might be in place via ASP.NET Core, but granular authorization checks within `graphql-dotnet` resolvers using `context.User` are likely missing or inconsistent.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement consistent authorization checks within all relevant GraphQL resolvers, leveraging `context.User` to enforce field-level authorization based on your application's authorization policies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate Input Arguments using Input Types and Custom Validation](./mitigation_strategies/validate_input_arguments_using_input_types_and_custom_validation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Input Types:** For mutations and queries accepting input, define `InputObjectGraphType` classes in `graphql-dotnet` to specify the structure and data types of expected input arguments.
    2.  **Use `NonNullGraphType` in Input Types:** Within input type definitions, use `NonNullGraphType` to mark required input fields, ensuring they are always provided in requests.
    3.  **Implement Custom Validation in Resolvers:** In resolvers, access input arguments (e.g., using `context.GetArgument<T>("argumentName")`). Implement custom validation logic within the resolver to check for data integrity, format, range, and business rule compliance.
    4.  **Return Input Errors using `context.Errors.Add`:** If input validation fails in a resolver, use `context.Errors.Add(new ValidationError("..."), "Invalid input for field ..."));` to add specific GraphQL validation errors to the response. `graphql-dotnet` will handle formatting these errors for the client.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Injection Attacks (SQL, NoSQL, Command) - Severity: High
    *   Data Integrity Issues - Severity: Medium
    *   Application Logic Errors - Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   Injection Attacks: High Risk Reduction
    *   Data Integrity Issues: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Application Logic Errors: Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - Input types might be defined, but comprehensive custom validation logic within resolvers using `context.Errors.Add` for GraphQL-specific error reporting is likely missing or inconsistent.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement robust input validation within resolvers for all input arguments, using `context.Errors.Add` to report validation failures as GraphQL errors. Ensure input types are properly defined with `NonNullGraphType` where appropriate.
