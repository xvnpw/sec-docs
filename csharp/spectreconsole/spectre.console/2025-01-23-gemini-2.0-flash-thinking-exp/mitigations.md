## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize and Validate User Inputs in Spectre.Console Context](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_and_validate_user_inputs_in_spectre_console_context.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Sanitize and Validate User Inputs in Spectre.Console Context

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Identify User Input Points:**  Locate all points where user input might be displayed or processed by `spectre.console` (prompts, tables, lists based on user queries).
    *   **Step 2: Implement Input Validation:**  Implement robust input validation for each user input point:
        *   **Data Type Validation:** Ensure input matches expected data type.
        *   **Range Validation:** Verify input is within acceptable ranges.
        *   **Format Validation:** Check input against expected formats (e.g., regex for emails).
    *   **Step 3: Implement Input Sanitization (Encoding):** Sanitize user input before displaying it with `spectre.console`. Encode special characters that could be misinterpreted by the console or underlying systems. Focus on encoding HTML-like characters (`<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`) if there's any chance the output could be rendered in a web context later (though less likely with console output).
    *   **Step 4: Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling for invalid input, providing informative messages and preventing unexpected application behavior.
    *   **Step 5: Security Review:** Conduct code reviews to ensure consistent input validation and sanitization across all user input points related to `spectre.console`.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Command Injection (Low Severity - unlikely with Spectre.Console itself, but consider broader context):**  If user input were used to construct system commands (unlikely in typical `spectre.console` usage), sanitization would mitigate this.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low Severity):** Improper input handling could reveal internal details through validation errors.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - if console output is repurposed for web (Very Low Severity - unlikely):** If console output were repurposed for web display, sanitization would be crucial for XSS prevention.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Command Injection:** Minimally Reduces risk (very low threat in typical `spectre.console` usage).
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Minimally Reduces risk.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Minimally Reduces risk (extremely low threat in typical console application context).
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** Basic input validation exists in some user prompts using standard .NET methods before `spectre.console` display.
    *   **Location:** Input handling logic in command-line argument parsing and interactive prompt sections.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Consistent Sanitization:**  Sanitization is not consistently applied to all user input displayed by `spectre.console`. Review and ensure encoding where appropriate.
    *   **Formalized Validation Library:**  No dedicated input validation library is used. Adopting one could improve consistency and streamline validation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Input Lengths for Prompts](./mitigation_strategies/limit_input_lengths_for_prompts.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Limit Input Lengths for Prompts

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Identify Prompts Accepting User Input:** Review code and identify all `spectre.console` prompts accepting user input.
    *   **Step 2: Define Maximum Input Lengths:** Determine reasonable maximum lengths for each input type based on expected data and application needs, considering DoS potential with long inputs.
    *   **Step 3: Implement Input Length Limits:** Enforce maximum lengths in prompt handling logic:
        *   **Client-Side Validation (within prompt logic):** Check length immediately after user input.
        *   **Server-Side Validation (if input sent to server):** Re-validate length on the server-side.
    *   **Step 4: Provide User Feedback:**  Provide clear feedback if input exceeds limits, guiding users to enter shorter input.
    *   **Step 5: Test with Boundary Cases:** Test limits with inputs at and slightly exceeding maximums to ensure correct enforcement and error handling.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Low to Medium Severity):** Prevents DoS attacks exploiting excessive resource consumption by processing extremely long user inputs.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Moderately Reduces risk by limiting resource consumption from overly long inputs.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** Input length limits exist in some prompts, especially for sensitive inputs, but not consistently across all prompts.
    *   **Location:** Input validation logic in specific prompt handling functions.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Consistent Length Limits:**  Input length limits are not consistently applied to all prompts.
    *   **Centralized Length Limit Configuration:**  Maximum lengths are currently hardcoded. Centralizing configuration would improve maintainability.
