# Attack Surface Analysis for spectreconsole/spectre.console

## Attack Surface: [Markup Injection](./attack_surfaces/markup_injection.md)

**Description:**  Malicious or unexpected behavior caused by injecting specially crafted markup sequences into strings that are rendered by Spectre.Console.

**How Spectre.Console Contributes:** The library's core functionality involves parsing and rendering a custom markup language. If user-controlled input is directly embedded without proper sanitization, vulnerabilities in the parsing engine could be exploited.

**Example:** An application displays user feedback with bold formatting: `console.WriteLine($"[bold]{feedback}[/]");`. If `feedback` is `[/bold][link=file:///etc/passwd]View Sensitive Data[/link][bold]`, it could create a misleading link or potentially trigger terminal-specific vulnerabilities (though less likely for direct code execution, but possible for unexpected behavior).

**Impact:** Unexpected console output, potential for denial-of-service if rendering becomes computationally expensive, or misleading information displayed to the user. In more severe scenarios, vulnerabilities in the parsing logic could theoretically be exploited for more significant impacts depending on the underlying terminal and system.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize all user-provided input before embedding it into Spectre.Console markup. Remove or escape any potentially harmful markup sequences.
* **Content Security Policies (if applicable in context):** While not directly a console concept, if the application interacts with web elements or other systems, consider how content security policies might indirectly mitigate risks.
* **Regularly Update Spectre.Console:** Ensure you are using the latest version of Spectre.Console to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion via Complex Rendering](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_via_complex_rendering.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides input that, when rendered by Spectre.Console, consumes excessive CPU or memory resources, leading to a denial-of-service.

**How Spectre.Console Contributes:** Features like tables, trees, and progress bars can be resource-intensive to render, especially with large or deeply nested data structures that an attacker might be able to influence.

**Example:** An application displays data in a table using Spectre.Console. If an attacker can control the data source and provide an extremely large and complex dataset with numerous nested elements, rendering the table could consume significant resources, potentially leading to application unresponsiveness or crashes.

**Impact:** Denial-of-service, application slowdown, increased resource consumption potentially impacting other services on the same system.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Input Validation and Limits:** Implement strict validation and limits on the size and complexity of data that can be rendered using Spectre.Console components.
* **Pagination and Virtualization:** For displaying large datasets, use pagination or virtualization techniques to render only the necessary portion of the data.
* **Timeouts and Resource Monitoring:** Implement timeouts for rendering operations and monitor resource usage to detect and mitigate potential resource exhaustion attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Input Prompt Vulnerabilities Leading to Application Compromise](./attack_surfaces/input_prompt_vulnerabilities_leading_to_application_compromise.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Spectre.Console's input prompting functionality to inject malicious input that bypasses intended validation and leads to significant application compromise.

**How Spectre.Console Contributes:** The `Prompt` functionality allows for interactive user input with options for validation. If vulnerabilities exist in how this input is handled or if custom validation logic is flawed, attackers could inject harmful data.

**Example:** An application uses `TextPrompt` for a critical configuration setting without proper sanitization after validation. An attacker could inject a specially crafted string that, when processed by the application, leads to arbitrary code execution or unauthorized access.

**Impact:**  Application compromise, potential for arbitrary code execution depending on how the input is used after the prompt, data breaches, or unauthorized access.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Secure Input Handling:** Treat all input received from Spectre.Console prompts as untrusted.
* **Robust Validation and Sanitization:** Implement strong validation and sanitization of input received from prompts *after* the prompt is completed, before using it in any critical application logic.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of potential exploits.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the application's input handling logic, especially around user prompts.
