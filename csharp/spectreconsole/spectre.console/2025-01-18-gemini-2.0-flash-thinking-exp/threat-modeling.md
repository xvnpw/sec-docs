# Threat Model Analysis for spectreconsole/spectre.console

## Threat: [Malicious Markup Injection](./threats/malicious_markup_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides crafted input containing malicious Spectre.Console markup tags. This input is then rendered by the application using Spectre.Console. The attacker aims to manipulate the output or cause unintended behavior *through Spectre.Console's rendering capabilities*. For example, they might inject markup that consumes excessive resources within Spectre.Console, leading to a denial of service, or inject ANSI escape codes that could have unintended terminal effects *when processed by the terminal after being rendered by Spectre.Console*.

**Impact:**
* Unintended or misleading output displayed to users *due to Spectre.Console's rendering*.
* Denial of Service (DoS) by overloading *Spectre.Console's rendering engine* or the terminal.
* In some terminal environments, malicious ANSI escape codes *rendered by Spectre.Console* could potentially alter terminal settings or behavior beyond the application's intended scope.

**Affected Component:** `Markup Rendering Engine` (specifically the parsing and interpretation of markup tags).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize any user-provided input before passing it to Spectre.Console for rendering. This involves removing or escaping potentially dangerous markup tags.
* **Use Spectre.Console's Safe Rendering Features:** Explore if Spectre.Console offers features to automatically escape or neutralize potentially harmful markup.
* **Limit User Control over Markup:** Minimize the amount of user-controlled data that is directly rendered as Spectre.Console markup.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Compromise](./threats/supply_chain_compromise.md)

**Description:** The Spectre.Console library itself or its distribution channels could be compromised, leading to the introduction of malicious code into the library. An attacker could then leverage this compromised library to attack applications using it. The malicious code would be *part of the Spectre.Console library itself*.

**Impact:**
* Remote Code Execution (RCE) on systems running the application *due to the compromised Spectre.Console code*.
* Data theft or manipulation *performed by the malicious code within Spectre.Console*.
* Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system.

**Affected Component:** The entire Spectre.Console library.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Use Trusted Sources:** Obtain Spectre.Console from trusted package managers and repositories.
* **Verify Package Integrity:** Verify the integrity of downloaded packages using checksums or signatures.
* **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use SCA tools to detect unexpected changes or vulnerabilities in dependencies.
* **Consider Code Signing Verification:** If available, verify the code signature of the Spectre.Console library.
