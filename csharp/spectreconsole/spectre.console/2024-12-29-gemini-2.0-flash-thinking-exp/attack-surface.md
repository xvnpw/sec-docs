Here's the updated key attack surface list, focusing only on elements directly involving Spectre.Console and with high or critical severity:

*   **Markup Injection**
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious markup code into data that is subsequently rendered by Spectre.Console. This can lead to unexpected formatting, denial of service, or potentially the execution of unintended terminal commands (depending on terminal emulator vulnerabilities).
    *   **How Spectre.Console Contributes:** Spectre.Console's core functionality involves interpreting and rendering its custom markup language. If the application doesn't sanitize data before passing it to Spectre.Console for rendering, it becomes vulnerable to markup injection.
    *   **Example:** An application displays user comments. A malicious user submits a comment containing excessively nested markup tags or very long strings within markup tags, leading to high CPU usage during rendering.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (application hangs or crashes due to excessive rendering), significant disruption of terminal display.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize any user-provided data or data from untrusted sources before passing it to Spectre.Console for rendering. Remove or escape potentially harmful markup characters or tags.
        *   **Restrict Markup Usage:** If feasible, limit the allowed markup tags or attributes to a safe subset.
        *   **Regularly Update Spectre.Console:** Ensure you are using the latest version of Spectre.Console to benefit from any bug fixes or security patches related to markup parsing.
