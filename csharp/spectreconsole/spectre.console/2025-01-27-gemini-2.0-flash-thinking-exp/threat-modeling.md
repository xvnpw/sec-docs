# Threat Model Analysis for spectreconsole/spectre.console

## Threat: [Input Validation Vulnerabilities in Prompts](./threats/input_validation_vulnerabilities_in_prompts.md)

Description: An attacker provides malicious input to `spectre.console` prompts (e.g., `TextPrompt`, `ConfirmPrompt`). This input could be crafted to exploit missing input validation in the application. For example, injecting shell commands into a prompt expecting a filename, or providing non-numeric data to a prompt expecting an integer.
Impact: Application crashes, unexpected behavior, command injection leading to arbitrary code execution on the server or client machine, data corruption, or privilege escalation if the application runs with elevated permissions.
Affected Spectre.Console Component: `Prompt` module, specifically functions like `Ask`, `Confirm`, `Prompt`.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement robust input validation for all `spectre.console` prompts.
    * Use specific prompt types (e.g., `TextPrompt<int>`, `TextPrompt<DateTime>`) to enforce data types.
    * Utilize built-in validation features of `spectre.console` prompts where available.
    * Sanitize and escape user input before using it in system commands, database queries, or file operations.
    * Employ input length limits to prevent buffer overflows or denial-of-service attacks.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `spectre.console` or its Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__spectre_console__or_its_dependencies.md)

Description: `spectre.console` or its dependencies contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker exploits these known vulnerabilities in outdated versions of the library to compromise the application. This could be achieved by exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities or through supply chain attacks targeting dependencies.
Impact: Application compromise, data breaches, denial of service, arbitrary code execution, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
Affected Spectre.Console Component: Entire `spectre.console` library and its dependencies.
Risk Severity: High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Regularly update `spectre.console` and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
    * Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for `spectre.console` and its dependencies (e.g., GitHub Security Advisories, CVE databases).
    * Implement a dependency scanning process (e.g., using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk) to identify and address known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
    * Follow security best practices for dependency management and supply chain security.
