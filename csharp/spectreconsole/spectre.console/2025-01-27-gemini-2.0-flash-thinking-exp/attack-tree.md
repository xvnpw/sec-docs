## Attack Tree Path: [6. 2.1. Malicious Markup Injection via Application Data (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/6__2_1__malicious_markup_injection_via_application_data__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Attack Vector: Injecting Spectre.Console markup language syntax into application data that is used in Spectre.Console output.
*   Focus: Exploiting the markup rendering engine when application data is incorporated into the output.
    *   **2.1.1. Information Disclosure via Markup Exploitation (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   Attack Vector: Crafting markup within application data to leak sensitive information through the rendered output.
        *   Example: Embedding sensitive data within URLs or text rendered by Spectre.Console, making it visible on the console or in logs.

        *   Attack Vector: Injecting markup into log messages to either disclose sensitive information through logs or to tamper with log readability and integrity.
        *   Example: Injecting markup into user-provided data that is subsequently logged using Spectre.Console, potentially making sensitive data visible in logs or corrupting log analysis.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Misuse of Spectre.Console Features Leading to Security Issues (Application Developer Error) (CRITICAL NODE - Developer Responsibility)](./attack_tree_paths/8__misuse_of_spectre_console_features_leading_to_security_issues__application_developer_error___crit_b63bafbb.md)

*   Focus: Developer mistakes in integrating Spectre.Console that introduce security weaknesses.
    *   **4.1. Neglecting Application-Level Security Measures (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   Attack Vector: Developers incorrectly assuming Spectre.Console provides security features or neglecting to implement necessary security measures at the application level because they are using Spectre.Console for UI.
        *   Example:  Failing to sanitize user input or implement proper authorization checks because they are focused on the UI aspects provided by Spectre.Console.
    *   **4.2. Improper Handling of Sensitive Data in Spectre.Console Output (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   Attack Vector: Developers unintentionally displaying sensitive data in console output rendered by Spectre.Console.

                *   Attack Vector: Specifically, unintentional leakage of sensitive data through console output.
                *   Example:  Accidentally printing database connection strings or user credentials to the console during error handling or debugging, which could be captured in screenshots, screen recordings, or console logs.
