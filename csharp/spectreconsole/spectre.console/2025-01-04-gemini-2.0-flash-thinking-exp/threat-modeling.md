# Threat Model Analysis for spectreconsole/spectre.console

## Threat: [Unsanitized Input Disclosure](./threats/unsanitized_input_disclosure.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides malicious input that is displayed by `spectre.console` without proper sanitization. This could involve embedding sensitive information within the input itself, or using special characters to manipulate the output and reveal hidden data.
**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized users viewing the console output. This could include passwords, API keys, internal system details, or personal data.
**Affected Spectre.Console Component:** Rendering engine, specifically the functions responsible for displaying text and handling styling.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Sanitize all external or user-provided data before displaying it using `spectre.console`.
*   Utilize `spectre.console`'s built-in formatting options to control the output and avoid displaying raw strings.
*   Implement input validation to reject or escape potentially harmful characters.

## Threat: [Output Injection](./threats/output_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects special characters or ANSI escape codes into data that is then rendered by `spectre.console`. This can be used to manipulate the console display, potentially misleading users or hiding critical information. An attacker might clear the screen, overwrite output, or display false information.
**Impact:** Users may be misled by the manipulated console output, potentially leading to incorrect decisions or actions. Critical information could be hidden from view.
**Affected Spectre.Console Component:** Rendering engine, specifically the functions handling ANSI escape codes and text formatting.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Treat all external data as potentially untrusted.
*   Avoid directly embedding raw user input into styled text rendered by `spectre.console`.
*   Use `spectre.console`'s API in a way that minimizes the interpretation of special characters from untrusted sources.
