# Attack Surface Analysis for spectreconsole/spectre.console

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Formatting via User Input](./attack_surfaces/malicious_formatting_via_user_input.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker injects malicious formatting codes or special characters into user-provided strings that are subsequently rendered using Spectre.Console. This can lead to unexpected or harmful output.
    *   **How Spectre.Console Contributes:** Spectre.Console interprets a specific markup language for styling and layout. If user input is directly incorporated into these markup sequences without proper sanitization, the library will render the malicious formatting.
    *   **Example:**  A user provides the input `[bold]Important Message[/][link=javascript:alert('XSS')]Click Here[/]` which, if not sanitized, could be rendered by Spectre.Console in a way that triggers JavaScript execution (depending on the terminal and how the application handles links). Another example is injecting control characters to manipulate the terminal display.
    *   **Impact:**  Can range from cosmetic issues (disrupted output, garbled text) to more serious problems like misleading users, potentially triggering actions based on deceptive output, or in rare cases, exploiting vulnerabilities in the terminal emulator itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High. The injected formatting can be used for social engineering or to trigger actions, leading to significant impact.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize all user-provided input before using it with Spectre.Console's rendering functions. This involves removing or escaping potentially harmful markup characters or sequences.
        *   **Contextual Escaping:**  Escape user input based on where it's being used within the Spectre.Console markup.
        *   **Restrict Markup Usage:** If possible, limit the allowed markup tags or attributes that can be used with user input.
        *   **Content Security Policies (for web-based terminals):** If the console output is displayed in a web terminal, implement CSP to mitigate the risk of injected scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Terminal Escape Sequence Injection](./attack_surfaces/terminal_escape_sequence_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects raw terminal escape sequences into data that is processed and outputted by Spectre.Console. These sequences can manipulate the terminal's behavior.
    *   **How Spectre.Console Contributes:** If Spectre.Console doesn't properly sanitize or escape raw terminal escape sequences present in the data it processes, these sequences will be passed directly to the terminal.
    *   **Example:** Injecting escape sequences to clear the terminal, change the cursor position, or even attempt to execute commands (though this is highly dependent on the terminal emulator and its configuration). An example sequence might be `\x1b[2J` to clear the screen.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to denial-of-service (by flooding the terminal), misleading output, or in some cases, potentially executing commands if the terminal emulator has vulnerabilities or allows such actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High. While direct command execution is less common, disrupting the terminal or misleading the user can have significant impact.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Spectre.Console Updates:** Ensure you are using the latest version of Spectre.Console, as developers may have implemented sanitization for known escape sequences.
        *   **Input Filtering:** Filter out or escape known dangerous terminal escape sequences from any data processed by Spectre.Console.
        *   **Sandboxing/Isolation:** If feasible, run the application in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of malicious terminal manipulations.
