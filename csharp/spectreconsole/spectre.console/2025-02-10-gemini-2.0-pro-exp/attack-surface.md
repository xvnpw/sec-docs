# Attack Surface Analysis for spectreconsole/spectre.console

## Attack Surface: [Prompt Injection/Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/prompt_injectionmanipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious input into Spectre.Console prompts (TextPrompt, SelectionPrompt, etc.) to alter the prompt's behavior, display, or validation, potentially leading to unintended actions or information disclosure.
    *   **Spectre.Console Contribution:** Spectre.Console's rich prompting features provide a direct interface for user input, making it a primary target for injection attacks if not properly secured. The library's flexibility in constructing prompts increases the potential for misuse.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides input containing ANSI escape sequences to a `TextPrompt` that is used to build a confirmation message: `AnsiConsole.Prompt(new TextPrompt<string>($"Are you sure you want to delete {userInput}}?"))`.  The attacker's input might be: `file1\e[2J\e[H\e[31mWARNING: System Compromised!\e[0m`. This would clear the screen, move the cursor to the home position, and display a red warning message, potentially scaring the user.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Information Disclosure (revealing sensitive data through manipulated prompts).
        *   Denial of Service (rendering the console unusable).
        *   Indirect Command Injection (tricking users into executing dangerous commands).
        *   Visual Spoofing (misleading the user about the application's state).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict whitelists for allowed characters and lengths in all prompt inputs.
        *   **Escaping/Encoding:** Use appropriate escaping functions (preferably built-in Spectre.Console methods if available) to neutralize special characters and ANSI escape sequences *before* incorporating user input into prompts.
        *   **Context-Aware Sanitization:** Tailor sanitization to the specific prompt type and context.
        *   **Parameterized Prompts:** Avoid direct string concatenation; use formatted strings or parameterized prompts where possible.

## Attack Surface: [ANSI Escape Sequence Injection](./attack_surfaces/ansi_escape_sequence_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject arbitrary ANSI escape sequences into any Spectre.Console output (not just prompts) to manipulate the terminal's display, potentially leading to various adverse effects.
    *   **Spectre.Console Contribution:** Spectre.Console heavily relies on ANSI escape sequences for styling and control.  Any user-controlled data rendered using Spectre.Console components is a potential vector for this attack.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a username containing escape sequences that, when displayed in a table, overwrite other parts of the table or inject a hidden message.  For instance, a username like `user1\e[1A\e[2KMalicious Content` might move the cursor up one line and erase the entire line, replacing it with "Malicious Content".
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Terminal Manipulation (changing colors, cursor position, etc.).
        *   Denial of Service (rendering the terminal unusable).
        *   Information Disclosure (overwriting or revealing hidden data).
        *   Visual Spoofing (misrepresenting information).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Robust Sanitization:** Implement a comprehensive sanitization mechanism to remove or escape *all* ANSI escape sequences from user-supplied data before rendering it with *any* Spectre.Console component. This is the *most crucial* mitigation.
        *   **Leverage Built-in Sanitization:** Use any built-in Spectre.Console functions designed for safe rendering of potentially unsafe text.
        *   **Whitelist Allowed Sequences (if feasible):** If possible, define a whitelist of permitted escape sequences (e.g., basic color codes) and reject everything else.
        *   **Regular Expressions (with extreme caution):** If using regular expressions, ensure they are thoroughly tested and reviewed to prevent bypasses. Prefer built-in library functions.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Spectre.Console)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__spectre_console_.md)

*   **Description:** Spectre.Console itself, or its dependencies, might contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
    *   **Spectre.Console Contribution:** This is a general dependency issue, but Spectre.Console, as a library, introduces its own code and dependencies, which could have vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A hypothetical vulnerability in Spectre.Console's ANSI escape sequence parsing logic could allow an attacker to bypass sanitization and inject malicious code.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (could range from denial of service to remote code execution, though RCE is less likely directly from a console UI library).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (Potentially Critical, depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Updated:** Regularly update Spectre.Console to the latest version.
        *   **Monitor for Vulnerabilities:** Subscribe to security advisories or follow the project's repository.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to automatically detect vulnerable dependencies.
