## Attack Tree Path: [1. Input Manipulation [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__input_manipulation__high_risk_.md)

*   This is a high-risk path because Spectre.Console, by its nature, processes user input.  Applications using it are inherently exposed to input-based attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Inject Control Characters [HIGH RISK] / [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_inject_control_characters__high_risk____critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject ANSI escape sequences (and other control characters) into input fields. These sequences are interpreted by the terminal emulator, allowing the attacker to manipulate the display, move the cursor, clear the screen, change text colors, and potentially even execute commands (depending on the terminal and its configuration).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2.1 Use ANSI escape sequences to manipulate terminal output, potentially hiding malicious actions or misleading the user. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_1_use_ansi_escape_sequences_to_manipulate_terminal_output__potentially_hiding_malicious_action_71bd810b.md)

*   **Specific Attack:** An attacker might inject an escape sequence to clear the screen before displaying a fake login prompt, tricking the user into entering their credentials.  Or, they might overwrite previously displayed output to hide evidence of their actions.  They could also use escape sequences to make the terminal *appear* to be unresponsive, while malicious commands are executed in the background.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium.  Many terminals are vulnerable, and the technique is well-known.
            *   **Impact:** Medium to High.  Depends on what the attacker can achieve with the control characters.  Could range from minor display disruption to credential theft or arbitrary command execution (in extreme cases).
            *   **Effort:** Low.  Many readily available resources and tools can generate malicious escape sequences.
            *   **Skill Level:** Low.  Basic understanding of ANSI escape sequences is sufficient.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium.  Easy to detect if you're specifically looking for control characters in input, but might be missed by casual observation.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Misconfiguration/Improper Usage [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__misconfigurationimproper_usage__high_risk_.md)

*   This branch represents vulnerabilities introduced by how the developer uses Spectre.Console, rather than inherent flaws in the library itself. These are often easier to exploit than finding bugs in well-vetted code.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2 Lack of Input Sanitization [HIGH RISK] / [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_lack_of_input_sanitization__high_risk____critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most critical vulnerability.  If the application doesn't properly sanitize user input *before* passing it to Spectre.Console, it's vulnerable to a wide range of injection attacks.  This includes not only control character injection (1.1.2) but also other potential issues depending on how the input is used.
        *

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1 Fail to properly sanitize user input before passing it to Spectre.Console components, leading to injection vulnerabilities. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_1_fail_to_properly_sanitize_user_input_before_passing_it_to_spectre_console_components__leading__7f06ba54.md)

*   **Specific Attack:**  Any of the input manipulation attacks (1.x) become much more likely and impactful if input sanitization is missing.  For example, if the application displays user-provided input in a table without sanitization, an attacker could inject control characters to disrupt the table's layout or even overwrite other parts of the display.
            *   **Likelihood:** High.  This is a very common programming error.
            *   **Impact:** High.  Opens the door to a wide range of attacks, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or data breaches.
            *   **Effort:** Very Low.  Attackers can simply try various injection payloads.
            *   **Skill Level:** Low.  Basic understanding of injection attacks is sufficient.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low.  Easy to detect with proper testing and code review.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.3 Overly Broad Permissions [HIGH RISK] / [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_3_overly_broad_permissions__high_risk____critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Running the application with higher privileges than necessary (e.g., as root or administrator) dramatically increases the impact of *any* successful exploit.  An attacker who gains control of a highly privileged application can do much more damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.3.1 Run the application with higher privileges than necessary, increasing the impact of any successful exploit. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_3_1_run_the_application_with_higher_privileges_than_necessary__increasing_the_impact_of_any_succes_d2dff961.md)

*   **Specific Attack:**  If an attacker manages to inject and execute code (e.g., through a combination of 3.2.1 and 1.1.2.1), and the application is running as root, the attacker gains full control of the system.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium.  It's a common mistake to run applications with unnecessary privileges.
            *   **Impact:** Very High.  Can lead to complete system compromise.
            *   **Effort:** Very Low.  The attacker doesn't need to *do* anything extra; the vulnerability is already present.
            *   **Skill Level:** Very Low.  The attacker benefits from the existing misconfiguration.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.  Requires reviewing the application's execution environment and permissions.
