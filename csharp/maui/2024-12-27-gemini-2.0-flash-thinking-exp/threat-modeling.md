## High and Critical MAUI Application Threats

This table lists high and critical threats that directly involve the .NET MAUI framework.

| Threat | Description | Impact | Affected MAUI Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Platform-Specific API Misuse** | An attacker exploits vulnerabilities arising from the incorrect or insecure use of platform-specific APIs accessed through MAUI's interoperability features. This could involve calling native functions with unexpected parameters or without proper validation. |  Unauthorized access to device resources (camera, location, contacts), data leakage, application crash, or even privilege escalation on the device. | `DependencyService`, `Platform.Current`, platform-specific implementations of interfaces. | High |  Thoroughly understand the security implications of each platform-specific API used. Implement robust input validation and sanitization before passing data to native APIs. Follow platform-specific security best practices. Minimize the surface area of native API interactions. |
| **Insecure Native Interop** | Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in custom native code integrated with the MAUI application (e.g., through native libraries or platform-specific code). This could involve memory corruption, buffer overflows, or other common native code vulnerabilities. |  Arbitrary code execution, application crash, data corruption, or complete compromise of the application and potentially the device. | Platform-specific projects (e.g., Android `.csproj`, iOS `.csproj`), native libraries linked to the application. | Critical |  Adhere to secure coding practices for native code (e.g., avoid buffer overflows, use memory-safe functions). Perform thorough code reviews and security testing of native code. Keep native libraries updated with security patches. Consider using memory-safe languages where possible. |
| **WebView Exploits (if used)** | If the MAUI application embeds web content using the `WebView` control, attackers can leverage standard web vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), or clickjacking within the WebView context. |  Data theft, session hijacking, execution of malicious JavaScript within the WebView, potentially gaining access to the application's context and local resources. | `Microsoft.Maui.Controls.WebView`. | High |  Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for content displayed in the WebView. Enforce a strong Content Security Policy (CSP). Isolate WebView content as much as possible. Avoid storing sensitive information in WebView local storage or cookies. Secure communication between the native app and the WebView (if any). |
| **JavaScript Bridge Vulnerabilities (if using WebView)** | If the application uses a JavaScript bridge to communicate between the native MAUI code and JavaScript running in the `WebView`, vulnerabilities in the bridge implementation can be exploited. Attackers might inject malicious JavaScript to execute native functions or access sensitive data. |  Arbitrary code execution in the native application context, data manipulation, bypassing security controls. | Custom JavaScript bridge implementations, event handlers in MAUI code interacting with the WebView. | Critical |  Minimize the functionality exposed through the JavaScript bridge. Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data exchanged between the native app and the WebView. Use secure communication mechanisms for the bridge. Avoid exposing sensitive native functionalities directly to JavaScript. |
| **Insecure Local Data Storage** | Sensitive data (API keys, user credentials, etc.) is stored insecurely in local storage (e.g., in plain text or with weak encryption) on the device. | Data breach if the device is lost, stolen, or compromised. Attackers can gain access to sensitive information and potentially impersonate the user or access backend services. | Platform-specific file systems, `Preferences` API (if used insecurely), SQLite databases (if not properly secured). | High |  Avoid storing sensitive data locally if possible. Utilize platform-specific secure storage mechanisms (e.g., Keychain on iOS, KeyStore on Android). Implement strong encryption at rest for sensitive data. Ensure proper file permissions are set. |
| **Dependency Confusion/Typosquatting (NuGet)** | An attacker publishes a malicious NuGet package with a name similar to a legitimate dependency, hoping developers will accidentally include it in their project. |  Supply chain attack, introduction of malware or backdoors into the application, potentially leading to data theft or remote control. | NuGet package management within the MAUI project. | High |  Carefully verify the source and maintainer of NuGet packages before adding them to the project. Use package signing and verification features. Implement dependency scanning tools to detect potential issues. Regularly review project dependencies. |
| **Vulnerable NuGet Packages** | The application uses NuGet packages with known security vulnerabilities. |  Various impacts depending on the vulnerability, ranging from data breaches and application crashes to remote code execution. | NuGet package management within the MAUI project. | High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability) |  Regularly scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk. Keep NuGet packages updated to the latest secure versions. Follow security advisories for used packages. |
| **Compromised Build Pipeline** | An attacker gains access to the build environment and injects malicious code into the application during the build process. |  Distribution of compromised applications to users, potentially leading to widespread data breaches or malware infections. | Build servers, CI/CD pipelines, developer machines. | Critical |  Secure the build environment with strong access controls and multi-factor authentication. Implement code signing and verification processes. Regularly audit the build pipeline for security vulnerabilities. Use secure build agents and infrastructure. |
| **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks during Updates** | If the application update mechanism is not secure, attackers could intercept and replace legitimate updates with malicious ones. |  Installation of compromised application versions on user devices, potentially leading to data theft or malware infections. | Application update mechanisms (e.g., custom update checks, platform-provided update mechanisms if not properly configured). | High |  Use secure communication channels (HTTPS) for update downloads. Implement code signing and verification for updates. Utilize platform-provided update mechanisms where possible and ensure they are configured securely. |
| **Insecure Network Communication** | Sensitive data is transmitted over unencrypted channels (HTTP instead of HTTPS) when communicating with backend services. |  Data interception and eavesdropping by attackers, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information. | `HttpClient` or other networking libraries used within the MAUI application. | High |  Enforce HTTPS for all network communication. Implement certificate pinning for enhanced security. Avoid storing sensitive data in URLs. Use secure protocols for data transmission. |
