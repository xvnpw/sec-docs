# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for nuke-build/nuke

## Mitigation Strategy: [Package Source Verification and Dependency Pinning (NUKE and its Dependencies)](./mitigation_strategies/package_source_verification_and_dependency_pinning__nuke_and_its_dependencies_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Trusted NuGet Sources:** In `NuGet.Config`, explicitly define trusted NuGet package sources. Prioritize private, secured feeds. For public feeds (nuget.org), use HTTPS.
2.  **Pin NUKE Version:** In the project file (`.csproj`) or `Directory.Build.props`, specify the *exact* version of the `Nuke.Common` (and any other NUKE-related) packages.  Do *not* use version ranges or wildcards.  This is crucial for preventing automatic upgrades to potentially compromised NUKE versions. Example:
    ```xml
    <PackageReference Include="Nuke.Common" Version="7.0.1" />
    ```
3.  **Pin Transitive Dependencies (Ideally):** While harder, strive to pin *all* transitive dependencies, including those brought in by NUKE. This provides the strongest protection against supply chain attacks. Tools like Paket can help manage this.
4. **global.json:** Pin .NET SDK version.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Compromised NUKE Packages (Severity: High):** Directly mitigates the risk of using a malicious version of NUKE.
*   **Compromised NUKE Dependencies (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of NUKE itself pulling in compromised dependencies.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks (targeting NUKE) (Severity: High):** A key defense against supply chain attacks specifically targeting the NUKE build system.

**Impact:**
*   **Compromised NUKE Packages:** Significantly reduces the risk.
*   **Compromised NUKE Dependencies:** Significantly reduces the risk.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks (targeting NUKE):** Significantly reduces the risk.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `NuGet.Config` with trusted sources.
*   `Nuke.Common` version is pinned in `.csproj`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Transitive dependencies (including those of NUKE) are not fully pinned.
*   global.json is not used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Mandatory Code Reviews for NUKE Build Definitions](./mitigation_strategies/mandatory_code_reviews_for_nuke_build_definitions.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Policy Enforcement:** Enforce a strict policy requiring code reviews for *all* changes to NUKE build definition files (e.g., `Build.cs`, any `.cs` files defining targets or parameters).
2.  **Pull Request Workflow:** Use a pull request (PR) or merge request (MR) system. No changes to build scripts are merged without review.
3.  **Security-Focused Review (NUKE-Specific):** Reviewers must specifically check for:
    *   **Safe use of NUKE's features:**  Correct usage of `[Parameter]` attributes, proper handling of secrets passed to NUKE, safe execution of external tools via NUKE's helpers (e.g., `DotNet`, `Npm`, etc.).
    *   **Avoidance of risky patterns:**  Look for any code that might be constructing commands dynamically from user input or external data, which could lead to injection vulnerabilities *within* the NUKE script.
    *   **Proper secret handling:** Ensure secrets are *not* hardcoded and are retrieved securely (see the next mitigation strategy).
4.  **Multiple Reviewers (Recommended):** For critical build definitions, require multiple reviewers, including someone with security expertise.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Malicious NUKE Build Scripts (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of intentionally malicious code within the NUKE definition.
*   **Inadvertent Security Flaws in NUKE Scripts (Severity: Medium-High):** Helps catch unintentional vulnerabilities introduced through misuse of NUKE's features.
*   **Insider Threats (affecting NUKE scripts) (Severity: High):** Mitigates the risk of a malicious insider modifying the NUKE build.

**Impact:**
*   **Malicious NUKE Build Scripts:** Significantly reduces the risk.
*   **Inadvertent Security Flaws in NUKE Scripts:** Moderately reduces the risk.
*   **Insider Threats (affecting NUKE scripts):** Significantly reduces the risk.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Pull requests are required for all code changes.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   The code review policy doesn't explicitly highlight NUKE-specific security concerns.
*   Multiple reviewers are not required for NUKE build script changes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Secret Handling *within* NUKE](./mitigation_strategies/secure_secret_handling_within_nuke.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Avoid Hardcoding:** *Never* hardcode secrets directly in the NUKE build definition files.
2.  **Use External Secret Store:** Use a secure secret management solution (Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or the CI/CD system's built-in secrets).
3.  **Secure Retrieval:** Within the NUKE script, use the appropriate client library or mechanism to retrieve secrets from the secret store *at runtime*.  Do *not* store secrets in environment variables unless those variables are securely managed by the CI/CD system and are *not* logged.
4.  **NUKE Parameter Injection (with extreme caution):** NUKE's `[Parameter]` attribute can be used to inject secrets, but *only* if the CI/CD system securely provides these parameters and they are *never* logged or persisted.  This is generally *less* secure than using a dedicated secret store. Example (use with caution):
    ```csharp
    [Parameter("API key for service X")]
    readonly string MyApiKey;
    ```
5. **Least Privilege (within NUKE):** Ensure the NUKE build process only has access to the secrets it *absolutely* needs.
6. **Avoid logging secrets:** Ensure that secrets are never printed to the console or build logs.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Secrets Exposure in NUKE Scripts (Severity: High):** Prevents secrets from being exposed in the build definition.
*   **Credential Theft (from NUKE context) (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of attackers stealing credentials used by the NUKE build.
*   **Unauthorized Access (via NUKE) (Severity: High):** Prevents unauthorized access to resources if NUKE's secrets are compromised.

**Impact:**
*   **Secrets Exposure in NUKE Scripts:** Significantly reduces the risk.
*   **Credential Theft (from NUKE context):** Significantly reduces the risk.
*   **Unauthorized Access (via NUKE):** Significantly reduces the risk.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   The project uses Azure Key Vault.
*   NUKE retrieves secrets from Azure Key Vault at runtime.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   The principle of least privilege is not fully enforced *within* the NUKE script's access to secrets.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe External Command Execution *via* NUKE](./mitigation_strategies/safe_external_command_execution_via_nuke.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Prefer NUKE's Tool Helpers:** Use NUKE's built-in helpers for common tools (e.g., `DotNet`, `Npm`, `Git`, etc.) whenever possible. These helpers often provide safer ways to execute commands. Example:
    ```csharp
    DotNetBuild(s => s
        .SetProjectFile(Solution)
        .SetConfiguration(Configuration)
    );
    ```
2.  **Parameterized Commands (Always):** If you *must* use `Process.Start` directly within the NUKE script, *always* use parameterized commands (with `ProcessStartInfo`) to prevent command injection.  *Never* build commands by concatenating strings with untrusted input.
3.  **Input Validation/Sanitization (for NUKE inputs):** If command arguments are derived from NUKE parameters (e.g., `[Parameter]`) or other potentially untrusted sources, rigorously validate and sanitize the input *before* using it in any command.
4. **Whitelisting (if possible):** If you have a limited set of external commands that NUKE needs to execute, consider maintaining a whitelist.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*  **Command Injection (via NUKE) (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious code into commands executed *by* NUKE.
*   **Unintended Code Execution (within NUKE) (Severity: Medium-High):** Reduces the risk of NUKE unintentionally executing harmful commands.

**Impact:**
*   **Command Injection (via NUKE):** Significantly reduces the risk (with proper parameterization).
*   **Unintended Code Execution (within NUKE):** Moderately reduces the risk.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   The NUKE script primarily uses NUKE's built-in tool helpers.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   There are still a few places where `Process.Start` is used directly, and not all of them are fully parameterized.
*   Input validation for NUKE parameters used in commands is not consistently applied.
