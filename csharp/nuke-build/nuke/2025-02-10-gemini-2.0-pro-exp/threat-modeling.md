# Threat Model Analysis for nuke-build/nuke

## Threat: [Malicious Build Script Injection](./threats/malicious_build_script_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Build Script Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker modifies the `build.csproj`, `Build.cs`, or other related C# files that define the NUKE build process. They inject malicious C# code that will be executed *directly by NUKE* during the build. This could involve adding new targets, modifying existing ones, or inserting code into existing target logic. The attacker might leverage social engineering, compromised developer credentials, or vulnerabilities in the source control system.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete compromise of the build server and potentially the deployment environment.
        *   Exfiltration of sensitive data (source code, secrets, credentials).
        *   Deployment of malicious software.
        *   Destruction of data or infrastructure.

    *   **Affected NUKE Component:** Core build definition files (`build.csproj`, `Build.cs`, and any other C# files defining build targets and logic). The `NukeBuild` class and its methods are the primary execution points *within NUKE*.

    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Access Control:** Implement rigorous access controls on the source code repository.
        *   **Mandatory Code Reviews:** Enforce mandatory code reviews for *all* build script changes.
        *   **Version Control Best Practices:** Utilize a robust version control system (e.g., Git) with branch protection.
        *   **Code Signing (Advanced):** Consider digitally signing build scripts.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits.

## Threat: [Compromised NuGet Package Dependency (of NUKE or the Build Script)](./threats/compromised_nuget_package_dependency__of_nuke_or_the_build_script_.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised NuGet Package Dependency (of NUKE or the Build Script)

    *   **Description:** The NUKE build script, *or NUKE itself*, depends on a compromised NuGet package. An attacker publishes a malicious package or compromises an existing one. When NUKE restores packages, it downloads and *its code* executes the malicious code *as part of the NUKE process*. This is distinct from a compromised tool *called by* NUKE.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromise of the build server, data exfiltration, deployment of malicious software.
        *   The attack is subtle, originating from a seemingly legitimate dependency *of NUKE or its build script*.

    *   **Affected NUKE Component:** NuGet package restore process (`Restore` target, implicitly or explicitly invoked *by NUKE*). The `NuGetTool` and related functionalities *within NUKE* are involved. This includes packages that NUKE itself depends on.

    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Trusted Package Sources:** Use only trusted package sources (e.g., nuget.org).
        *   **Package Integrity Verification:** Enable NuGet package signature verification.
        *   **Private NuGet Feed (Recommended):** Use a private NuGet feed with strict controls.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Integrate dependency scanning tools into the build process.
        *   **Regular Package Updates:** Keep NuGet packages (both for NUKE and the build script) up-to-date.
        *   **Lock Files:** Use package lock files (e.g., `packages.lock.json`).

## Threat: [Secret Exposure via Logging or Output (within NUKE's Execution)](./threats/secret_exposure_via_logging_or_output__within_nuke's_execution_.md)

*   **Threat:** Secret Exposure via Logging or Output (within NUKE's Execution)

    *   **Description:** The NUKE build script inadvertently logs sensitive information (API keys, passwords) to the console, log files, or build artifacts *due to actions within the NUKE build script itself*. This is distinct from a compromised external tool leaking secrets. The exposure happens because of how the C# code *within the NUKE build definition* handles the secrets.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data.
        *   Compromise of cloud resources, databases, or other services.

    *   **Affected NUKE Component:** Any part of the *NUKE build script* that handles secrets, particularly logging statements (`Log.Information`, `Log.Warning`, etc.) and any custom C# code *within the build definition* that outputs data. Incorrect usage of the `[Secret]` attribute *within the NUKE script* can contribute.

    *   **Risk Severity:** High

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never Hardcode Secrets:** Never store secrets directly in the build script.
        *   **Secure Secret Management:** Use a dedicated secret management solution.
        *   **NUKE Secret Attribute (Use Carefully):** Use NUKE's `[Secret]` attribute *correctly*, understanding its limitations.
        *   **Environment Variables (Preferred):** Prefer using environment variables (managed securely).
        *   **Log Sanitization:** Implement log sanitization procedures *within the build script*.
        *   **Code Review (Focus on Secrets):** Review how secrets are handled in the *NUKE C# code*.
        *   **Restricted Log Access:** Limit access to build logs.

## Threat: [Malicious Parameter Injection (into NUKE's Parameters)](./threats/malicious_parameter_injection__into_nuke's_parameters_.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Parameter Injection (into NUKE's Parameters)

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides malicious input as a build parameter *to NUKE* (e.g., via the command line or CI/CD system). The *NUKE build script* uses this parameter unsafely, leading to unintended consequences *within the context of the NUKE build execution*. This is about how the C# code *within NUKE* handles the parameter.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Arbitrary file read or write (if the parameter controls file paths *within the NUKE script*).
        *   Execution of arbitrary commands (if the parameter is used unsafely in a shell command *within the NUKE script*).
        *   Denial of service.
        *   Data corruption.

    *   **Affected NUKE Component:** Any part of the *NUKE build script* that accepts and uses parameters. The `[Parameter]` attribute in NUKE defines the parameters, but the *usage* of these parameters *within the NUKE C# code* is the vulnerability point.

    *   **Risk Severity:** High

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Parameter Validation:** Rigorously validate and sanitize *all* build parameters *within the NUKE script*.
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize string parameters appropriately *within the NUKE script*.
        *   **Avoid Shell Commands (If Possible):** Avoid shell commands *within the NUKE script*. If necessary, use parameterized commands.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the NUKE build process with minimal privileges.
        *   **Whitelisting:** Use whitelisting for parameter values where possible.
