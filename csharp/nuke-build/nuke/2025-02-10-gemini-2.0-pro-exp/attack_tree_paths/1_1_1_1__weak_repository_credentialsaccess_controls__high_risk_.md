Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on the NUKE build system context.

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.1.1. Weak Repository Credentials/Access Controls

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with weak repository credentials and access controls in the context of a NUKE-based build system, identify specific vulnerabilities, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level mitigations already listed.  We aim to provide the development team with practical guidance to significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of this attack vector.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on attack path 1.1.1.1 ("Weak Repository Credentials/Access Controls") and its implications for a project utilizing the NUKE build system (https://github.com/nuke-build/nuke).  The scope includes:

*   **Source Code Repository:**  The primary target is the repository hosting the NUKE build definition (`build.csproj`, `*.cs` files defining build targets, etc.) and potentially the application source code itself (if co-located).  We'll assume the repository is hosted on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Azure DevOps.
*   **NUKE Build System Interaction:** How an attacker with repository access could leverage NUKE's features (e.g., secrets management, parameter injection, custom build logic) to compromise the build process or downstream artifacts.
*   **Credential Types:**  We'll consider various credential types, including:
    *   **Personal Access Tokens (PATs):**  Used for programmatic access to the repository.
    *   **SSH Keys:**  Used for secure shell access to the repository.
    *   **Service Account Credentials:**  Used by CI/CD pipelines to access the repository.
    *   **Usernames and Passwords:**  Used for interactive access to the repository platform.
*   **Access Control Mechanisms:**  We'll examine repository permissions, branch protection rules, and other access control features offered by the repository hosting platform.
* **Exclusion:** This analysis will *not* cover attacks targeting the build server infrastructure itself (e.g., compromising the build agent's operating system).  It focuses on the repository and NUKE's interaction with it.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identify specific threat actors and their motivations for targeting this attack path.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Examine potential weaknesses in the NUKE build system and repository configuration that could be exploited.
3.  **Exploitation Scenarios:**  Describe realistic scenarios where an attacker could leverage weak credentials to compromise the build process.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluate the potential consequences of successful exploitation.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  Provide detailed, actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities, going beyond the initial high-level mitigations.
6.  **Verification Strategies:** Suggest methods to verify the effectiveness of the implemented mitigations.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.1.1

#### 2.1 Threat Modeling

*   **Threat Actors:**
    *   **Malicious Insider:** A disgruntled employee or contractor with legitimate (but perhaps overly permissive) access to the repository.
    *   **External Attacker (Opportunistic):**  An attacker who discovers weak credentials through credential stuffing, phishing, or public leaks.
    *   **External Attacker (Targeted):**  An attacker specifically targeting the organization or project, potentially using social engineering or sophisticated reconnaissance.
    *   **Compromised Third-Party:** An attacker who gains access to the repository through a compromised dependency or third-party service with repository access.

*   **Motivations:**
    *   **Code Modification:** Inject malicious code into the application or build process.
    *   **Data Theft:** Steal sensitive data stored in the repository (e.g., API keys, configuration files).
    *   **Supply Chain Attack:**  Compromise the build process to distribute malicious software to downstream users.
    *   **Reputation Damage:**  Deface the repository or disrupt the development process.
    *   **Financial Gain:**  Ransomware attack targeting the repository or its contents.

#### 2.2 Vulnerability Analysis (NUKE Specific)

*   **Overly Permissive PATs/SSH Keys:**  A common vulnerability is using a single PAT or SSH key with broad repository permissions (e.g., write access to all branches) for all build-related tasks.  If this credential is leaked, the attacker gains full control.
*   **Hardcoded Secrets in Build Definition:**  Storing secrets (API keys, passwords) directly within the NUKE build scripts (`*.cs` files) is a major vulnerability.  Even if the repository is private, a compromised credential grants access to these secrets.
*   **Insecure Secret Management:**  NUKE provides mechanisms for managing secrets (e.g., environment variables, parameter injection).  However, misusing these mechanisms (e.g., logging secrets to the build output, storing secrets in unencrypted configuration files) can expose them.
*   **Lack of Branch Protection:**  Failing to configure branch protection rules (e.g., requiring pull requests, code reviews, status checks) allows an attacker with write access to directly push malicious code to critical branches (e.g., `main`, `release`).
*   **Weak or Default Passwords for User Accounts:** If developers use weak or default passwords for their repository accounts, attackers can easily gain access through brute-force or credential stuffing attacks.
* **Lack of MFA:** The absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA) on repository accounts significantly increases the risk of credential compromise.
* **Unrestricted Network Access:** If the repository is accessible from the public internet without any IP restrictions, it is more vulnerable to brute-force and credential stuffing attacks.
* **Inadequate Auditing:** Lack of proper auditing of repository access and activity makes it difficult to detect and respond to unauthorized access.

#### 2.3 Exploitation Scenarios

*   **Scenario 1: Supply Chain Attack via Compromised PAT:**
    1.  An attacker obtains a leaked PAT with write access to the repository.
    2.  The attacker modifies the NUKE build script (`build.csproj` or `*.cs`) to inject malicious code into a build target that compiles the application.  This could be as simple as adding a line to download and execute a malicious payload during the build process.
    3.  The next time the build runs (either manually or triggered by a CI/CD pipeline), the malicious code is executed, and the compromised application is built.
    4.  The compromised application is deployed, infecting users.

*   **Scenario 2: Data Exfiltration via Stolen SSH Key:**
    1.  An attacker steals an SSH key used by a developer with read access to the repository.
    2.  The attacker clones the repository.
    3.  The attacker discovers that sensitive configuration files (containing API keys, database credentials) are stored in the repository (a violation of best practices, but a common mistake).
    4.  The attacker uses the stolen credentials to access other systems and steal data.

*   **Scenario 3: Build Sabotage via Credential Stuffing:**
    1.  An attacker uses a list of common usernames and passwords in a credential stuffing attack against the repository hosting platform.
    2.  The attacker successfully gains access to a developer's account with write access.
    3.  The attacker modifies the NUKE build script to introduce subtle errors or vulnerabilities into the application, causing it to malfunction or become insecure.
    4.  The compromised application is deployed, leading to operational issues or security breaches.

#### 2.4 Impact Assessment

The impact of successful exploitation of weak repository credentials can be severe:

*   **High:**  Complete compromise of the application, leading to data breaches, financial losses, reputational damage, and legal liabilities.
*   **High:**  Supply chain attacks can impact a large number of users, amplifying the damage.
*   **Medium:**  Data exfiltration can lead to the exposure of sensitive information, potentially impacting other systems and users.
*   **Medium:**  Build sabotage can disrupt development and deployment processes, causing delays and financial losses.

#### 2.5 Mitigation Recommendations (Beyond High-Level)

*   **Implement Granular Permissions:**
    *   Use **least privilege** principles.  Create separate PATs or SSH keys for different build tasks (e.g., one for cloning, one for pushing to specific branches).  Restrict permissions to the minimum required.
    *   Leverage repository platform features (e.g., GitHub's fine-grained PATs) to control access at the repository, organization, and even individual file level.
    *   Regularly review and audit permissions to ensure they remain appropriate.

*   **Secure Secret Management:**
    *   **Never** hardcode secrets in the build definition or any other files in the repository.
    *   Use NUKE's built-in secret management features correctly:
        *   **Environment Variables:**  Store secrets in environment variables on the build server, and access them within the NUKE build script using `Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable`.
        *   **Parameter Injection:**  Use NUKE's parameter injection mechanism to pass secrets as parameters to the build script.  These parameters can be sourced from environment variables or secure configuration files.
        *   **Secret Stores:** Integrate with secure secret stores like Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or HashiCorp Vault.  NUKE can be extended to retrieve secrets from these stores during the build process.
    *   **Encrypt Secrets at Rest:**  If secrets must be stored in configuration files, ensure they are encrypted using strong encryption algorithms.

*   **Enforce Branch Protection Rules:**
    *   **Require Pull Requests:**  Mandate that all changes to critical branches (e.g., `main`, `release`) be made through pull requests.
    *   **Require Code Reviews:**  Require at least one (preferably two or more) code reviews before a pull request can be merged.
    *   **Require Status Checks:**  Configure status checks (e.g., successful build, passing tests) that must pass before a pull request can be merged.
    *   **Restrict Direct Pushes:**  Prevent developers from directly pushing to critical branches.

*   **Mandatory MFA and Strong Password Policies:**
    *   Enforce **mandatory MFA** for all repository accounts.
    *   Implement strong password policies (e.g., minimum length, complexity requirements, regular password changes).
    *   Use a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords.

*   **Regular Security Audits:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits of the repository configuration, access controls, and build process.
    *   Use automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities (e.g., static code analysis, dependency analysis).
    *   Perform penetration testing to identify and exploit potential weaknesses.

*   **Network Security:**
    *   Restrict access to the repository to specific IP addresses or networks using firewall rules or VPNs.
    *   Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.

* **Logging and Monitoring:**
    * Enable detailed logging of all repository access and activity.
    * Implement monitoring and alerting systems to detect and respond to unauthorized access or suspicious behavior.
    * Regularly review logs to identify potential security incidents.

* **NUKE Specific Best Practices:**
    * Use `[Secret]` attribute for parameters that should be treated as secrets.
    * Leverage NUKE.GlobalTool to ensure consistent tooling across the team.
    * Keep NUKE and its dependencies up-to-date to benefit from security patches.

#### 2.6 Verification Strategies

*   **Automated Scans:**  Use static code analysis tools to scan the NUKE build scripts and application code for hardcoded secrets and other vulnerabilities.
*   **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular penetration testing to simulate attacks and identify weaknesses in the repository configuration and access controls.
*   **Code Reviews:**  Ensure that all changes to the build scripts and repository configuration are reviewed by multiple developers.
*   **Access Control Reviews:**  Regularly review and audit repository permissions to ensure they are appropriate and follow the principle of least privilege.
*   **Log Analysis:**  Monitor repository access logs for suspicious activity, such as failed login attempts, unauthorized access, and unusual data transfers.
* **Secret Scanning:** Utilize secret scanning tools provided by the repository hosting platform (e.g., GitHub Secret Scanning) or third-party tools to detect accidental commits of secrets.
* **Dry Runs:** Before deploying changes to the build process, perform dry runs to ensure that secrets are being handled correctly and are not being exposed.

This deep analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the risks associated with weak repository credentials and access controls in a NUKE-based build system. By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of this attack vector, improving the overall security of their application and build process. Remember that security is an ongoing process, and continuous monitoring, auditing, and improvement are essential.
