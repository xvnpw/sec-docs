Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on NUKE's parameter injection vulnerabilities.  I'll follow the structure you requested: Objective, Scope, Methodology, and then the detailed analysis.

## Deep Analysis of NUKE Parameter Injection Attack

### 1. Define Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with parameter injection vulnerabilities within a NUKE-based build process.  This includes identifying:

*   **Specific attack vectors:** How an attacker could realistically manipulate parameters to inject malicious code.
*   **Potential impact:**  The consequences of successful exploitation, ranging from build disruption to complete system compromise.
*   **Mitigation strategies:**  Practical and effective measures to prevent or significantly reduce the risk of parameter injection attacks.
*   **Detection methods:** How to identify if an attempted or successful parameter injection has occurred.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack path: **"Exploit NUKE's Parameter Injection Mechanism" -> "Manipulating inputs to the build process to inject malicious code."**  The scope includes:

*   **NUKE Build Definition Files:**  Analyzing how parameters are defined, validated (or not validated), and used within `build.cs` (or equivalent) files and any associated scripts.
*   **Parameter Sources:**  Examining all potential sources of parameter input, including:
    *   Command-line arguments.
    *   Environment variables.
    *   Configuration files (e.g., `nuke-build.json`, `.nuke` directory contents).
    *   User interfaces (if any, such as a web-based build trigger).
    *   Version control system hooks (e.g., pre-commit, post-commit).
    *   CI/CD pipeline integrations (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Jenkins).
*   **Code Execution Contexts:**  Understanding where and how injected code could be executed, including:
    *   Within the NUKE build process itself (e.g., through `Exec()` calls, custom tasks).
    *   On the build agent/server.
    *   On developer machines.
    *   Within deployed applications (if build artifacts are compromised).
*   **NUKE Version:** While the analysis aims for general applicability, it will consider potential differences in behavior across different NUKE versions.  We'll assume a relatively recent version (e.g., 6.x or 7.x) unless otherwise specified.
* **.NET version:** The version of .NET used can affect the available attack surface.

This analysis *excludes* vulnerabilities that are not directly related to parameter injection within NUKE.  For example, we won't deeply analyze general vulnerabilities in the .NET runtime or operating system, unless they are specifically exploitable *through* NUKE parameter injection.

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

*   **Code Review:**  Manual inspection of NUKE's source code (available on GitHub) and example build definitions to identify potential injection points and weaknesses in parameter handling.
*   **Static Analysis:**  Using static analysis tools (e.g., Roslyn analyzers, security-focused linters) to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities in build definitions.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing):**  Constructing a test NUKE build and using fuzzing techniques to provide a wide range of unexpected and potentially malicious inputs to parameters.  This will help identify edge cases and unexpected behavior.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Applying threat modeling principles to systematically identify potential attack scenarios and their impact.
*   **Documentation Review:**  Carefully reviewing NUKE's official documentation and community resources for best practices and known security considerations.
*   **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Development:**  Creating simple PoC exploits to demonstrate the feasibility of identified vulnerabilities (in a controlled environment).

### 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

**4.1.  Understanding NUKE's Parameter System**

NUKE uses a strongly-typed parameter system. Parameters are typically defined as properties within the build class (e.g., `build.cs`) using attributes like `[Parameter]`.  These attributes can specify:

*   **Name:**  The name of the parameter (used on the command line).
*   **Description:**  Help text for the parameter.
*   **Default Value:**  A value used if the parameter is not explicitly provided.
*   **Value Provider:**  A function to dynamically calculate the parameter value.
*   **Separator:**  For parameters that accept multiple values.
*   **Converter:** To convert the string input to the parameter type.

**4.2. Potential Attack Vectors**

Several attack vectors exist for exploiting NUKE's parameter injection:

*   **4.2.1.  Unvalidated String Parameters Used in Shell Commands:** This is the most critical and common vulnerability.  If a string parameter is directly used within a shell command (e.g., using `Exec()`, `Start-Process`, or similar functions) without proper sanitization or escaping, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands.

    *   **Example (Vulnerable):**

        ```csharp
        [Parameter("Filename to process")]
        readonly string InputFile;

        Target ProcessFile => _ => _
            .Executes(() =>
            {
                Exec($"process.exe {InputFile}"); // Vulnerable!
            });
        ```

        An attacker could provide `InputFile` as `; rm -rf /;` (on Linux) or `; del /f /s /q C:\*;` (on Windows) to execute malicious commands.

    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Use Parameterized Commands:**  If possible, use APIs that accept command arguments as separate parameters, avoiding string concatenation.  For example, use the `Process` class directly and its `ArgumentList` property.
        *   **Escape/Sanitize Input:**  If string concatenation is unavoidable, rigorously escape or sanitize the input to prevent shell metacharacters from being interpreted.  Use functions like `System.Security.SecurityElement.Escape()` or a dedicated shell escaping library.  *Never* trust user-provided input directly in shell commands.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Implement strict validation of the parameter's format and content.  For example, if `InputFile` should be a filename, validate that it conforms to expected filename patterns and doesn't contain dangerous characters.  Use regular expressions or custom validation logic.
        * **Avoid Shell Execution if Possible:** If the task can be accomplished without invoking a shell, do so.  Use .NET APIs directly whenever feasible.

*   **4.2.2.  Injection into Custom Tasks:**  If custom tasks (defined within the build definition) accept parameters and use them in potentially dangerous ways (e.g., writing to files, making network requests, interacting with external systems), injection vulnerabilities can arise.

    *   **Example (Vulnerable):**

        ```csharp
        [Parameter("URL to fetch")]
        readonly string FetchUrl;

        Target FetchData => _ => _
            .Executes(async () =>
            {
                using var client = new HttpClient();
                var response = await client.GetStringAsync(FetchUrl); // Vulnerable!
                // ... process response ...
            });
        ```
        An attacker could provide a malicious URL, potentially leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or other attacks.

    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Input Validation:**  Validate the URL to ensure it conforms to expected patterns (e.g., only allows specific domains, schemes).
        *   **Use a Safe HTTP Client Configuration:** Configure the `HttpClient` to prevent common SSRF vulnerabilities (e.g., disable following redirects, set timeouts, restrict allowed schemes).
        *   **Consider a Whitelist:**  If possible, maintain a whitelist of allowed URLs.

*   **4.2.3.  Environment Variable Manipulation:**  If NUKE parameters are sourced from environment variables, an attacker who can control the environment (e.g., on a compromised build agent) can inject malicious values.

    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Restrict Environment Variable Access:**  Limit the build process's access to only necessary environment variables.
        *   **Validate Environment Variables:**  Even if sourced from environment variables, validate the parameter values as if they were provided directly by a user.
        *   **Use Secrets Management:**  For sensitive parameters (e.g., API keys, passwords), use a secure secrets management solution (e.g., Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) instead of relying on environment variables.

*   **4.2.4.  Configuration File Tampering:**  If parameters are loaded from configuration files (e.g., `nuke-build.json`), an attacker who can modify these files can inject malicious values.

    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Protect Configuration Files:**  Ensure that configuration files are stored securely and have appropriate access controls (e.g., read-only for the build process).
        *   **Digitally Sign Configuration Files:**  Consider digitally signing configuration files to detect tampering.
        *   **Validate Configuration Values:**  Validate the values loaded from configuration files, just as you would with command-line arguments.

*   **4.2.5.  Exploiting Value Providers:** If a `ValueProvider` is used to dynamically calculate a parameter value, and that provider is vulnerable to injection, this can be exploited.

    *   **Example (Vulnerable):**
        ```csharp
        [Parameter]
        string MyParam => GetMyParam();

        string GetMyParam()
        {
            // Vulnerable if ExternalInput is not sanitized
            return $"prefix_{ExternalInput}_suffix";
        }
        ```

    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Sanitize External Input:** Ensure that any external input used within the `ValueProvider` is properly sanitized and validated.

* **4.2.6. Exploiting Converters:** If a custom `Converter` is used, and it has vulnerabilities, it can be exploited.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Secure Converter Logic:** Ensure that the converter logic is secure and does not introduce any vulnerabilities.

**4.3. Impact of Successful Exploitation**

The impact of a successful parameter injection attack can range from minor to catastrophic:

*   **Build Disruption:**  The attacker could cause the build to fail, preventing the creation of valid artifacts.
*   **Code Execution on Build Agent:**  The attacker could execute arbitrary code on the build agent/server, potentially gaining access to sensitive data, source code, or other systems.
*   **Compromised Build Artifacts:**  The attacker could inject malicious code into the build artifacts (e.g., executables, libraries, packages), leading to the compromise of systems where these artifacts are deployed.
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  The attacker could use the injected code to steal sensitive data from the build environment or connected systems.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  The attacker could use the compromised build agent as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the network.
*   **Reputation Damage:**  A successful attack could damage the reputation of the organization and erode trust in its software.

**4.4. Detection Methods**

Detecting parameter injection attempts can be challenging, but several methods can be employed:

*   **4.4.1.  Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools to scan build definitions for potential injection vulnerabilities.  Look for:
    *   Unvalidated string parameters used in shell commands.
    *   Custom tasks that use parameters in potentially dangerous ways.
    *   Suspicious use of environment variables or configuration files.

*   **4.4.2.  Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing):**  Use fuzzing to test the build process with a wide range of inputs, looking for unexpected behavior or crashes.

*   **4.4.3.  Log Monitoring:**  Monitor build logs for suspicious commands or error messages that might indicate an injection attempt.

*   **4.4.4.  Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):**  Use an IDS to monitor network traffic and system activity for signs of malicious behavior.

*   **4.4.5.  Runtime Monitoring:**  Use runtime monitoring tools to detect unexpected process execution or system calls.

*   **4.4.6.  Code Audits:**  Regularly conduct code audits of build definitions, focusing on parameter handling.

*   **4.4.7.  Dependency Scanning:** Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities that could be exploited through parameter injection.

**4.5.  Example Proof-of-Concept (PoC)**

Let's revisit the vulnerable example from 4.2.1 and create a simple PoC:

```csharp
// build.cs (Vulnerable)
using Nuke.Common;
using Nuke.Common.Tooling;
using static Nuke.Common.Tools.ProcessTasks;

class Build : NukeBuild
{
    [Parameter("Filename to process")]
    readonly string InputFile;

    Target ProcessFile => _ => _
        .Executes(() =>
        {
            // Simulate a command that processes a file
            // VULNERABLE: Direct use of InputFile in a shell command
            StartProcess("echo", $"Processing file: {InputFile}").AssertZeroExitCode();
        });

    public static int Main() => Execute<Build>(x => x.ProcessFile);
}
```

To exploit this, you would run the build with a malicious `InputFile` parameter:

```bash
./build.sh ProcessFile --InputFile "; echo 'INJECTED COMMAND'; #"
```

The output would show:

```
Processing file: ; echo 'INJECTED COMMAND'; #
INJECTED COMMAND
```

This demonstrates that the injected command `echo 'INJECTED COMMAND'` was executed.  A real attacker would replace this with a more harmful command.

**4.6.  Recommendations**

*   **Prioritize Secure Parameter Handling:**  Make secure parameter handling a top priority in all NUKE build definitions.
*   **Follow the Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant the build process only the minimum necessary permissions.
*   **Regularly Review and Update Build Definitions:**  Keep build definitions up-to-date and review them for potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Use a Secure Build Environment:**  Run builds on secure, isolated build agents.
*   **Implement Comprehensive Monitoring:**  Monitor build processes and logs for suspicious activity.
*   **Educate Developers:**  Train developers on secure coding practices and the risks of parameter injection.
*   **Use a CI/CD Pipeline with Security Checks:** Integrate security checks (e.g., static analysis, dependency scanning) into your CI/CD pipeline.
* **Consider using strongly typed parameters where possible:** This can help prevent simple injection attacks by enforcing type safety.

By following these recommendations and thoroughly understanding the potential attack vectors, you can significantly reduce the risk of parameter injection vulnerabilities in your NUKE-based build processes. This proactive approach is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of your software development lifecycle.
