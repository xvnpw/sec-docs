# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.1.1. Compromise CI/CD System

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the attack path "2.1.1. Compromise CI/CD System" within the context of a NUKE Build-based project.  We aim to identify specific vulnerabilities, potential attack vectors, and effective mitigation strategies to prevent attackers from gaining control of the CI/CD system and, consequently, compromising the build process and the resulting software artifacts.  This analysis will inform security recommendations for the development team.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the CI/CD system used by a project utilizing the NUKE Build framework (https://github.com/nuke-build/nuke).  The scope includes:

*   **CI/CD Platform:**  The specific CI/CD platform used (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, GitLab CI, Jenkins, TeamCity, etc.).  We will assume a generic CI/CD platform for the initial analysis, but specific platform vulnerabilities will be considered where relevant.  *The development team must specify the actual platform used for a fully tailored analysis.*
*   **NUKE Build Configuration:**  How NUKE Build is configured and integrated within the CI/CD pipeline, including the `build.csproj` file, build scripts, and any custom targets or tasks.
*   **Environment Variables:**  The environment variables used by the build process, particularly those containing sensitive information (API keys, signing certificates, deployment credentials).
*   **Dependency Management:**  How dependencies are managed (NuGet, npm, etc.) and the potential for supply chain attacks through compromised dependencies.
*   **Access Control:**  The access control mechanisms in place for the CI/CD system, including user roles, permissions, and authentication methods.
*   **Secrets Management:** How secrets are stored and accessed within the CI/CD pipeline.
* **Artifact Storage:** Where build artifacts are stored and the security of that storage.

This analysis *excludes* the following:

*   Attacks targeting the application code itself (e.g., SQL injection, XSS), except where the CI/CD system compromise directly facilitates such attacks.
*   Physical security of the CI/CD infrastructure (if self-hosted).
*   Social engineering attacks targeting developers directly (unless they lead to CI/CD compromise).

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identify potential threat actors and their motivations for compromising the CI/CD system.
2.  **Vulnerability Identification:**  Analyze the CI/CD system and NUKE Build configuration for known vulnerabilities and potential weaknesses.  This includes reviewing documentation, best practices, and known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related to the CI/CD platform and its components.
3.  **Attack Vector Analysis:**  Describe specific attack vectors that could be used to exploit the identified vulnerabilities.  This will include step-by-step scenarios.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluate the potential impact of a successful CI/CD system compromise, including the consequences for the application, its users, and the organization.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  Propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies to address the identified vulnerabilities and reduce the risk of compromise.  These recommendations will be prioritized based on their effectiveness and feasibility.
6. **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement:** Describe how to continuously monitor the security of the CI/CD pipeline and adapt to new threats.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.1.1. Compromise CI/CD System

### 4.1. Threat Modeling

Potential threat actors include:

*   **External Attackers:**  Individuals or groups seeking to steal data, inject malicious code, disrupt services, or cause reputational damage.
*   **Malicious Insiders:**  Disgruntled employees or contractors with authorized access to the CI/CD system who intend to sabotage the project or steal sensitive information.
*   **Compromised Third-Party Services:**  Attackers who have compromised a service or dependency used by the CI/CD system (e.g., a compromised NuGet package repository).

Motivations:

*   **Financial Gain:**  Stealing credentials, injecting ransomware, or deploying cryptominers.
*   **Espionage:**  Stealing intellectual property or sensitive data.
*   **Sabotage:**  Disrupting the software development process or deploying malicious code.
*   **Hacktivism:**  Causing damage or disruption for political or ideological reasons.

### 4.2. Vulnerability Identification

Potential vulnerabilities in the CI/CD system and NUKE Build configuration:

*   **Weak or Default Credentials:**  Using weak, default, or easily guessable passwords for CI/CD platform accounts, service accounts, or API keys.
*   **Inadequate Access Control:**  Overly permissive access rights granted to users or service accounts, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive resources or configuration settings.
*   **Exposed Secrets:**  Storing secrets (API keys, passwords, certificates) directly in the build scripts, environment variables, or repository, making them accessible to attackers who gain access to the repository or CI/CD system.
*   **Vulnerable CI/CD Platform:**  Unpatched vulnerabilities in the CI/CD platform itself (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps) or its plugins/extensions.
*   **Compromised Dependencies:**  Using outdated or vulnerable third-party libraries or tools (NuGet packages, npm packages) that contain known vulnerabilities.  This is a *supply chain attack* vector.
*   **Insecure Build Scripts:**  NUKE Build scripts (`build.cs` or other related files) that contain vulnerabilities, such as command injection flaws or insecure handling of secrets.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:**  Insufficient validation of inputs to the build process, such as parameters passed to build scripts, allowing attackers to inject malicious code or commands.
*   **Insufficient Logging and Monitoring:**  Lack of adequate logging and monitoring of CI/CD system activity, making it difficult to detect and respond to attacks.
*   **Insecure Artifact Storage:** Storing build artifacts in an insecure location with inadequate access controls, allowing attackers to tamper with or steal the artifacts.
* **Lack of Network Segmentation:** The CI/CD system is not properly isolated from other systems, allowing attackers to pivot from a compromised system to the CI/CD system.
* **Unprotected Branches:**  Lack of branch protection rules (e.g., requiring code reviews, status checks) on critical branches (e.g., `main`, `release`), allowing attackers to push malicious code directly to these branches.
* **Self-Hosted Runner Vulnerabilities:** If using self-hosted runners, vulnerabilities in the runner's operating system, installed software, or network configuration.

### 4.3. Attack Vector Analysis

Here are some example attack vectors:

*   **Scenario 1: Credential Stuffing:**  An attacker uses a list of leaked credentials to attempt to log in to the CI/CD platform.  If successful, they gain full control over the build process.
*   **Scenario 2: Exploiting a CI/CD Platform Vulnerability:**  An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in the CI/CD platform (e.g., a remote code execution vulnerability in a plugin) to gain shell access to the build server.
*   **Scenario 3: Supply Chain Attack via NuGet:**  An attacker publishes a malicious NuGet package with the same name as a legitimate package but with a higher version number.  The NUKE Build process automatically downloads and uses the malicious package, injecting malicious code into the build.
*   **Scenario 4: Insider Threat - Environment Variable Modification:**  A disgruntled employee with access to the CI/CD system modifies an environment variable containing a signing key, replacing it with their own key.  This allows them to sign malicious code with a trusted certificate.
*   **Scenario 5: Pull Request Poisoning:** An attacker submits a pull request that appears legitimate but contains a subtle modification to the `build.cs` file, introducing a command injection vulnerability.  If the pull request is merged without careful review, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the build server during the next build.
*   **Scenario 6: Compromised Self-Hosted Runner:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the operating system of a self-hosted runner to gain access.  They then modify the runner's configuration to execute malicious code during builds.

### 4.4. Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful CI/CD system compromise can be severe:

*   **Code Integrity Compromise:**  Attackers can inject malicious code into the application, creating backdoors, stealing data, or causing other harm.
*   **Data Breach:**  Sensitive data stored in the CI/CD system (e.g., API keys, credentials) can be stolen.
*   **Service Disruption:**  The build process can be disrupted, preventing the release of new software updates.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
*   **Financial Loss:**  The attack can lead to financial losses due to data breaches, service disruptions, and recovery costs.
*   **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:**  Data breaches can result in legal and regulatory penalties.

### 4.5. Mitigation Recommendations

These recommendations are prioritized based on their impact and feasibility:

**High Priority:**

1.  **Strong Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   Enforce strong, unique passwords for all CI/CD platform accounts and service accounts.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users with access to the CI/CD system.
    *   Use role-based access control (RBAC) to grant the minimum necessary permissions to users and service accounts.
    *   Regularly review and audit user access rights.
2.  **Secrets Management:**
    *   **Never** store secrets directly in the repository or build scripts.
    *   Use a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, GitHub Secrets, GitLab CI/CD Variables) to store and manage secrets.
    *   Access secrets securely within the NUKE Build scripts using the secrets management solution's API or integration.  NUKE provides mechanisms for accessing environment variables and secrets.
3.  **Dependency Management and Supply Chain Security:**
