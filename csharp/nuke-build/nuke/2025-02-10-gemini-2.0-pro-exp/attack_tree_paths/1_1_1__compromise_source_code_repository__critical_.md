Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on the "Compromise Source Code Repository" node, tailored for a development team using NUKE Build.

## Deep Analysis: Compromise Source Code Repository (Attack Tree Path 1.1.1)

### 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the attack vector "Compromise Source Code Repository" within the context of a NUKE Build-based application, identify specific vulnerabilities and attack methods, and propose concrete mitigation strategies to reduce the risk of this critical threat.  The ultimate goal is to prevent an attacker from gaining unauthorized control of the source code repository, which would allow them to inject malicious code into the build process.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Target:** The primary source code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps) hosting the NUKE Build project and its associated build definition (typically `build.csproj` or similar).
*   **Threat Actors:**  We will consider various threat actors, including:
    *   **External Attackers:**  Individuals or groups with no legitimate access to the repository.
    *   **Malicious Insiders:**  Individuals with legitimate access (e.g., developers, contractors) who intentionally misuse their privileges.
    *   **Compromised Insiders:** Individuals with legitimate access whose accounts or credentials have been compromised by an external attacker.
*   **Assets at Risk:**
    *   **Source Code:**  The application's source code, including the NUKE Build definition.
    *   **Build Artifacts:**  The output of the build process (e.g., executables, libraries, packages).
    *   **Secrets:**  Sensitive information potentially stored in or accessible from the repository (e.g., API keys, database credentials, signing certificates).  *Note:  Storing secrets directly in the repository is a major vulnerability and will be addressed specifically.*
    *   **Reputation:**  Damage to the organization's reputation due to a successful compromise.
    *   **Downstream Users:** Users of the application who could be affected by malicious code injected into the build.
*   **Exclusions:** This analysis will *not* cover:
    *   Attacks targeting individual developer workstations *unless* those attacks directly lead to repository compromise.
    *   Attacks targeting the build server infrastructure *unless* those attacks directly lead to repository compromise.  (These are separate attack tree branches.)
    *   Vulnerabilities within the application's code itself *except* for vulnerabilities that could be exploited to compromise the repository.

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identify specific attack methods that could be used to compromise the source code repository.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Assess the likelihood and impact of each identified attack method, considering existing security controls.
3.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  Propose specific, actionable steps to reduce the risk of repository compromise.  These recommendations will be prioritized based on their effectiveness and feasibility.
4.  **NUKE Build Specific Considerations:**  Identify how NUKE Build's features and best practices can be leveraged to enhance security.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.1: Compromise Source Code Repository

**4.1 Threat Modeling (Attack Methods)**

Here are several attack methods that could lead to repository compromise:

*   **4.1.1 Credential Theft/Compromise:**
    *   **Phishing:**  Attackers trick developers into revealing their repository credentials (username/password, SSH keys, personal access tokens (PATs)).
    *   **Credential Stuffing:**  Attackers use credentials obtained from data breaches of other services to try and gain access to the repository.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:**  Attackers systematically try different passwords until they find the correct one (less likely with strong password policies and rate limiting).
    *   **Keylogging Malware:**  Malware on a developer's machine captures keystrokes, including repository credentials.
    *   **Compromised SSH Keys:**  Attackers steal or otherwise gain access to a developer's private SSH key.
    *   **Compromised Personal Access Tokens (PATs):** Attackers steal or otherwise gain access to a developer's PAT.  PATs often have broad permissions, making them a high-value target.
    *  **Session Hijacking:** Attacker can still valid session of authenticated user.

*   **4.1.2 Exploiting Repository Platform Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits:**  Attackers exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities in the repository platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Misconfigured Permissions:**  The repository is configured with overly permissive access controls, allowing unauthorized users to modify the code.
    *   **Vulnerable Third-Party Integrations:**  A compromised third-party application or service integrated with the repository (e.g., a CI/CD tool, a code analysis tool) is used as a stepping stone to gain access.

*   **4.1.3 Social Engineering:**
    *   **Impersonation:**  Attackers impersonate trusted individuals (e.g., project maintainers, security personnel) to trick developers into granting them access or revealing sensitive information.
    *   **Pretexting:**  Attackers create a false scenario to convince developers to take actions that compromise the repository.

*   **4.1.4 Insider Threats:**
    *   **Malicious Insider:**  A disgruntled or compromised employee intentionally modifies the build definition or source code to introduce malicious code.
    *   **Accidental Insider:**  A developer unintentionally makes a mistake that compromises the repository (e.g., accidentally committing secrets, misconfiguring permissions).

**4.3 Mitigation Recommendations**

These recommendations are prioritized based on their effectiveness and feasibility:

*   **4.3.1  Strong Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   **Mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Enforce MFA for *all* users accessing the repository.  This is the single most effective control against credential theft.  Use hardware tokens or authenticator apps, not SMS-based MFA (which is vulnerable to SIM swapping).
    *   **Strong Password Policies:**  Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity, regular changes).
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions.  Avoid granting broad "admin" or "owner" access unless absolutely required.  Use role-based access control (RBAC) features provided by the repository platform.
    *   **Regular Access Reviews:**  Periodically review user access rights and revoke unnecessary permissions.
    *   **SSH Key Management:**  Encourage (or require) the use of SSH keys for authentication.  Provide guidance on securely storing and managing private keys.  Rotate SSH keys regularly.
    *   **Personal Access Token (PAT) Management:**  If PATs are used, enforce the use of scoped PATs with limited permissions and short expiration times.  Monitor PAT usage and revoke any suspicious tokens.
    *   **Session Management:** Enforce short session timeouts and implement robust session invalidation mechanisms.

*   **4.3.2  Repository Platform Security:**
    *   **Stay Updated:**  Ensure the repository platform itself is up-to-date with the latest security patches.  Most major platforms handle this automatically, but it's important to verify.
    *   **Leverage Platform Security Features:**  Utilize built-in security features offered by the repository platform (e.g., GitHub's security alerts, GitLab's security dashboard).
    *   **Carefully Review Third-Party Integrations:**  Thoroughly vet any third-party applications or services integrated with the repository.  Limit their permissions to the absolute minimum.  Monitor their activity.

*   **4.3.3  Security Awareness Training:**
    *   **Regular Training:**  Provide regular security awareness training to all developers, covering topics such as phishing, social engineering, password security, and secure coding practices.
    *   **Simulated Phishing Attacks:**  Conduct simulated phishing attacks to test developers' awareness and identify areas for improvement.
    *   **Reporting Procedures:**  Establish clear procedures for reporting suspected security incidents.

*   **4.3.4  Code Review and Branch Protection:**
    *   **Mandatory Code Reviews:**  Require code reviews for *all* changes to the build definition and critical parts of the application code.  This helps prevent malicious code from being introduced by a compromised or malicious insider.
    *   **Branch Protection Rules:**  Implement branch protection rules (e.g., on the `main` or `master` branch) to prevent direct pushes and require pull requests with approvals.  This adds an extra layer of scrutiny.
    *   **Require Signed Commits:** Enforce commit signing to verify the authenticity of commits and prevent impersonation.

*   **4.3.5  Secrets Management:**
    *   **Never Store Secrets in the Repository:**  This is a critical rule.  Secrets (API keys, database credentials, etc.) should *never* be committed to the repository, even in encrypted form.
    *   **Use a Secrets Management Solution:**  Utilize a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Google Cloud Secret Manager) to securely store and manage secrets.
    *   **NUKE Build Integration:**  NUKE Build provides mechanisms for accessing secrets from environment variables or external sources.  Use these mechanisms to inject secrets into the build process without storing them in the repository.  For example, use `[Parameter]` attributes with environment variables.

*   **4.3.6  Monitoring and Auditing:**
    *   **Repository Activity Logs:**  Regularly monitor repository activity logs for suspicious behavior (e.g., unusual login attempts, unauthorized access, large code changes).
    *   **Automated Alerts:**  Configure automated alerts for critical security events (e.g., failed login attempts, changes to branch protection rules).
    *   **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Consider using an IDS to monitor network traffic and detect malicious activity.

**4.4 NUKE Build Specific Considerations**

*   **Parameterization:**  NUKE Build's parameterization features are crucial for secrets management.  Use `[Parameter]` attributes to inject secrets from environment variables or external sources, *never* hardcoding them in the build definition.
*   **Global Tooling:**  If using global tools, ensure they are installed from trusted sources and their versions are pinned to prevent supply chain attacks.
*   **Build Triggers:**  Carefully configure build triggers to avoid unintended builds or builds triggered by unauthorized changes.
*   **Dependency Management:** Use signed packages and verify their integrity. NUKE supports package signing and verification.
*   **`nuke :update`:** Regularly run `nuke :update` to keep NUKE itself and its dependencies up-to-date, ensuring you have the latest security fixes.
*   **Custom Build Steps:** If you have custom build steps (e.g., PowerShell scripts), ensure they are thoroughly reviewed for security vulnerabilities.

### 5. Conclusion

Compromising the source code repository is a critical threat with potentially devastating consequences. By implementing the mitigation strategies outlined above, development teams using NUKE Build can significantly reduce the risk of this attack vector.  A layered approach, combining strong authentication, access controls, security awareness training, code review, secrets management, and monitoring, is essential for protecting the integrity of the build process and the security of the application. Continuous vigilance and regular security assessments are crucial for maintaining a strong security posture.
