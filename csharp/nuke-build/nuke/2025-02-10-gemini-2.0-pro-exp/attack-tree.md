## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise NUKE Build Definition [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_nuke_build_definition__critical_.md)

*   This is the core of the attack, directly modifying the build logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Compromise Source Code Repository [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__compromise_source_code_repository__critical_.md)

*   Gaining control of the repository allows complete control over the build definition.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1. Weak Repository Credentials/Access Controls [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1__weak_repository_credentialsaccess_controls__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker gains access to the repository using weak, default, or easily guessable credentials, or through brute-force/credential stuffing attacks.  Lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) significantly increases the risk.
*   **Mitigation:** Strong, unique passwords; mandatory MFA; regular password audits; principle of least privilege.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.2. Compromised Developer Account (Phishing, Credential Stuffing) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_2__compromised_developer_account__phishing__credential_stuffing___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker obtains a developer's credentials through phishing emails, social engineering, or by using credentials stolen from other breaches (credential stuffing).
*   **Mitigation:** Security awareness training (phishing, social engineering); MFA; password managers; monitoring for suspicious login activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Indirect Modification via Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__indirect_modification_via_dependencies.md)

*   Altering the build definition through its dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.1. Supply Chain Attack on NuGet Package for the Tool [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_1__supply_chain_attack_on_nuget_package_for_the_tool__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker compromises a NuGet package used by a NUKE global tool.  When the tool is updated, the malicious package is pulled in, executing arbitrary code.
*   **Mitigation:**  Careful vetting of global tools; dependency vulnerability scanning; pinning tool versions; using private feeds for internal tools.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2. Compromise a NuGet Package Used by the Build Definition [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2__compromise_a_nuget_package_used_by_the_build_definition__critical_.md)

*   Directly compromising a package used in the build.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.1. Supply Chain Attack on the NuGet Package [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_1__supply_chain_attack_on_the_nuget_package__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to 1.2.1.1, but targeting a package directly used in `Build.cs` or related files.
*   **Mitigation:**  Dependency vulnerability scanning; pinning dependency versions; using private feeds; careful vetting of all dependencies; code reviews focusing on dependency changes.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.2. Typosquatting [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_2__typosquatting__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker publishes a malicious package with a name very similar to a legitimate package, hoping developers will accidentally install the wrong one.
*   **Mitigation:**  Careful review of package names before installation; using tools that warn about similar package names; dependency analysis.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit NUKE's Parameter Injection Mechanism](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_nuke's_parameter_injection_mechanism.md)

*   Manipulating inputs to the build process to inject malicious code.

*   Gaining control of the CI/CD system allows modification of environment variables and other build parameters.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1.1. Weak CI/CD System Credentials/Access Controls [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_1__weak_cicd_system_credentialsaccess_controls__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to 1.1.1.1, but targeting the CI/CD system.
*   **Mitigation:** Strong, unique passwords; mandatory MFA; regular password audits; principle of least privilege.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1.3. Compromised CI/CD Administrator Account [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_3__compromised_cicd_administrator_account__high_risk_.md)

*   **Mitigation:** Security awareness training; clear guidelines on running commands; code reviews.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.2. Social Engineering (trick developer into using malicious configuration) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_2__social_engineering__trick_developer_into_using_malicious_configuration___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker convinces a developer to use a malicious `nuke.config` or `.nuke` file.

*   **Mitigation:** Strong, unique passwords; mandatory MFA; regular password audits; principle of least privilege.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.2. Compromised CI/CD Administrator Account [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_2__compromised_cicd_administrator_account__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to 1.1.1.2 and 2.1.1.3, but targeting an account with pipeline modification privileges.
