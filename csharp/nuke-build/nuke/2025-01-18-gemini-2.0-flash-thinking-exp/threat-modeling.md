# Threat Model Analysis for nuke-build/nuke

## Threat: [Malicious Build Script Injection](./threats/malicious_build_script_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains the ability to modify the `build.cake` script or other included build scripts. They could inject malicious code that executes during the build process *via Nuke's script execution engine*. This could involve downloading and running arbitrary executables, modifying source code before compilation, or exfiltrating sensitive information.

**Impact:** Compromise of the build environment, potential backdoors injected into the application, exfiltration of secrets or source code, supply chain compromise affecting all builds.

**Affected Nuke Component:** Core Nuke framework, specifically the script execution engine that interprets `build.cake` and related files.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict access controls on the repository containing build scripts.
* Enforce code reviews for all changes to build scripts.
* Utilize version control and track changes to build scripts meticulously.
* Consider using signed commits for build script changes.
* Implement CI/CD pipeline security best practices to prevent unauthorized modifications.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Nuke Addons/Extensions](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_nuke_addonsextensions.md)

**Description:** If the build process utilizes community-developed or third-party Nuke addons or extensions, vulnerabilities within these components could be exploited. An attacker could leverage these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code during the build, potentially gaining control of the build environment *through the Nuke addon execution mechanism*.

**Impact:** Similar to malicious build script injection, including compromise of the build environment and potential injection of malicious code into the application.

**Affected Nuke Component:** The addon loading and execution mechanism within the Nuke framework. Specific addon modules or tasks could be vulnerable.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly vet and audit any third-party Nuke addons before using them.
* Keep all Nuke addons updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Subscribe to security advisories for the addons being used.
* Consider using only well-maintained and reputable addons.
* Implement sandboxing or isolation for addon execution if possible.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Build Parameters](./threats/command_injection_via_build_parameters.md)

**Description:** If build parameters or environment variables are not properly sanitized and are used within Nuke tasks that execute shell commands, an attacker could inject malicious commands. This could occur if user-provided input or external data sources are directly passed to command-line tools *via Nuke's task execution*.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build server, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service.

**Affected Nuke Component:** Nuke's task execution mechanism, particularly when using tasks that interact with the operating system shell (e.g., `ProcessTasks`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always sanitize and validate any external input used in build parameters or environment variables before using them in shell commands.
* Avoid constructing shell commands dynamically using string concatenation with external input.
* Utilize Nuke's built-in features for parameter handling and task execution that provide safer alternatives to direct shell execution where possible.
* Employ parameterized commands or use libraries that handle command execution securely.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attack](./threats/dependency_confusionsubstitution_attack.md)

**Description:** An attacker could attempt to introduce a malicious package with the same name as an internal or private dependency used by the Nuke build process. If the build system is not configured to prioritize internal repositories or use proper authentication, *Nuke's dependency resolution mechanism* might inadvertently download and use the malicious package from a public repository.

**Impact:** Introduction of malicious code into the build process, potentially leading to backdoors, data theft, or compromised build artifacts.

**Affected Nuke Component:** Nuke's dependency management features, specifically when resolving NuGet packages or other dependencies defined in the `build.cake` script.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure Nuke to prioritize internal or private package repositories.
* Use authenticated feeds for package management.
* Implement checksum verification or signing for dependencies.
* Utilize dependency scanning tools to detect unexpected or malicious dependencies.
* Consider using a dependency firewall to control access to external package repositories.

## Threat: [Compromised Dependency Source](./threats/compromised_dependency_source.md)

**Description:** If the NuGet feeds or other package sources configured for Nuke are compromised by an attacker, malicious packages could be injected into the legitimate feed. The build process *using Nuke's dependency management* would then download and use these compromised packages.

**Impact:** Similar to dependency confusion, leading to the introduction of malicious code into the build process and potentially the final application.

**Affected Nuke Component:** Nuke's dependency management features and the configured package sources.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use only trusted and reputable package sources.
* Implement checksum verification or signing for dependencies.
* Regularly audit the configured package sources.
* Monitor for any unusual activity or changes in the configured package sources.

## Threat: [Exposure of Secrets in Build Scripts or Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_secrets_in_build_scripts_or_configuration.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, or signing certificates might be accidentally or intentionally included directly within the `build.cake` script, configuration files, or environment variables *used by the Nuke build process*.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources, potential data breaches, and compromise of security credentials.

**Affected Nuke Component:** The `build.cake` script, any configuration files used by Nuke.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Never hardcode secrets directly in build scripts or configuration files.
* Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault) to store and retrieve secrets.
* Use environment variables or dedicated secret management features provided by the CI/CD platform.
* Implement mechanisms to prevent secrets from being logged or exposed in build outputs.
* Regularly scan build scripts and configuration for accidentally committed secrets.
