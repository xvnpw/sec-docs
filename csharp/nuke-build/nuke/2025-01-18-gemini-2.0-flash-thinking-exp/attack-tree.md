## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Nuke](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_nuke.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the highest level of risk. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved their objective.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Nuke Core](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_nuke_core.md)

This node represents attacks that directly target weaknesses within the Nuke build system itself. Successful exploitation can lead to significant compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Nuke Process](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__rce__in_nuke_process.md)

This is a critical point of compromise. If an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the Nuke process, they gain significant control over the build environment and potentially the underlying system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Build Process Through Malicious Build Script](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_build_process_through_malicious_build_script.md)

This node represents a broad category of attacks where the build scripts executed by Nuke are manipulated to introduce malicious behavior. This can have a wide-ranging impact on the application being built.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigurations in Nuke Usage](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurations_in_nuke_usage.md)

This node highlights the risks associated with improper setup and maintenance of the Nuke build system. Simple misconfigurations can create significant security vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Plugin Management](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_plugin_management.md)

This is a specific type of misconfiguration where the management of Nuke plugins is not handled securely, leading to potential exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Nuke Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attacks_targeting_nuke_dependencies.md)

This node represents attacks that target the external components that Nuke relies on, either its direct dependencies or the distribution mechanism itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Nuke Core -> Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Nuke Process -> Exploit Vulnerability in Nuke's Plugin System -> Install Malicious Plugin that Executes Code](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_nuke_core_-_achieve_remote_code_execution__rce__in_nuke_process_-_exploit_162015f6.md)

An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Nuke's plugin system, potentially due to insufficient sandboxing or lack of code signing. They then install a malicious plugin that executes arbitrary code within the Nuke process, leading to remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Build Process Through Malicious Build Script -> Inject Malicious Code into Existing Build Script](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_build_process_through_malicious_build_script_-_inject_malicious_code_into_existing_build__c450a740.md)

An attacker gains unauthorized access to the build scripts (e.g., by exploiting vulnerabilities in the version control system or the build server) and injects malicious code. This code is then executed during the build process, potentially compromising the application or the build environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Build Process Through Malicious Build Script -> Gain Unauthorized Access to Build Server and Modify Script Directly](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_build_process_through_malicious_build_script_-_gain_unauthorized_access_to_build_server_a_f8b589a5.md)

An attacker compromises the build server itself (e.g., through weak credentials or server vulnerabilities) and directly modifies the build scripts to introduce malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Build Process Through Malicious Build Script -> Introduce Malicious Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_build_process_through_malicious_build_script_-_introduce_malicious_dependencies.md)

An attacker manipulates the dependencies used by the build process. This can be done by either poisoning the dependency cache or repository (replacing legitimate dependencies with malicious ones) or by directly specifying malicious or vulnerable dependencies in the build script.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigurations in Nuke Usage -> Insecure Plugin Management -> Install Untrusted or Unverified Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurations_in_nuke_usage_-_insecure_plugin_management_-_install_untrusted_or_unverifi_d3db4160.md)

The application development team or administrators fail to properly vet and control the plugins installed in Nuke. An attacker can then introduce malicious functionality by installing untrusted or unverified plugins.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigurations in Nuke Usage -> Insecure Plugin Management -> Fail to Regularly Update Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurations_in_nuke_usage_-_insecure_plugin_management_-_fail_to_regularly_update_plug_d09ef906.md)

The application development team or administrators fail to keep Nuke plugins updated. Attackers can then exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated plugins to compromise the build process or the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Nuke Dependencies -> Compromise Upstream Nuke Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attacks_targeting_nuke_dependencies_-_compromise_upstream_nuke_dependencies.md)

Attackers compromise libraries or packages that Nuke itself depends on. This can be done by exploiting vulnerabilities in these upstream dependencies, leading to malicious code being incorporated into Nuke's functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Nuke Dependencies -> Introduce Malicious Code into Nuke's Distribution Packages](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attacks_targeting_nuke_dependencies_-_introduce_malicious_code_into_nuke's_distribution_e577fdbb.md)

Attackers compromise the distribution mechanism of Nuke itself and inject malicious code into the installation packages. This is a highly sophisticated attack but can have a wide-reaching impact if successful.
