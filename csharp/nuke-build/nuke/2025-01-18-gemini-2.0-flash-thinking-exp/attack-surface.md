# Attack Surface Analysis for nuke-build/nuke

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Code Injection in Build Scripts](./attack_surfaces/malicious_code_injection_in_build_scripts.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Malicious Code Injection in Build Scripts**
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into the C# or F# build scripts executed by Nuke.
    *   **How Nuke Contributes:** Nuke directly executes these scripts, providing a pathway for the injected code to run with the privileges of the build process.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies a build script to download and execute a reverse shell on the build server.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build server, potential compromise of the build environment, data exfiltration, or supply chain attacks by injecting malicious code into build artifacts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rigorous code reviews for all build script changes.
        *   Enforce strict access controls on who can modify build scripts.
        *   Utilize static analysis tools to scan build scripts for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Treat build scripts as critical infrastructure and apply security best practices.
        *   Implement version control and track changes to build scripts meticulously.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised NuGet Package Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/compromised_nuget_package_dependencies.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Compromised NuGet Package Dependencies**
    *   **Description:** Attackers compromise NuGet packages that are dependencies of the Nuke build process or the application being built.
    *   **How Nuke Contributes:** Nuke relies on NuGet for managing build tools and dependencies. If a compromised package is included, Nuke will download and potentially execute malicious code during the build.
    *   **Example:** A malicious actor uploads a compromised version of a popular build utility package to NuGet, which is then pulled in by the Nuke build.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of malware into the build process, potential compromise of build artifacts, and supply chain attacks affecting downstream users of the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in NuGet packages.
        *   Implement a process for verifying the integrity and authenticity of NuGet packages.
        *   Consider using a private NuGet feed with curated and vetted packages.
        *   Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor for unexpected changes in dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom or Third-Party Nuke Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_or_third-party_nuke_plugins.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Vulnerabilities in Custom or Third-Party Nuke Plugins**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities within custom-developed Nuke plugins or third-party plugins used to extend Nuke's functionality.
    *   **How Nuke Contributes:** Nuke's plugin architecture allows for extending its capabilities. Vulnerable plugins can introduce security flaws into the build process.
    *   **Example:** A custom Nuke plugin has an unpatched security flaw that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the build server.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build server, potential compromise of the build environment, or manipulation of the build process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Conduct thorough security reviews and penetration testing of custom Nuke plugins.
        *   Only use reputable and well-maintained third-party plugins.
        *   Keep Nuke and its plugins updated to the latest versions with security patches.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization within plugin code.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege to plugin permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Tool Invocation](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_tool_invocation.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Command Injection via Tool Invocation**
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious commands into arguments passed to external tools invoked by Nuke build scripts.
    *   **How Nuke Contributes:** Nuke build scripts often execute external tools (compilers, linters, etc.). If input to these tools is not properly sanitized, command injection is possible.
    *   **Example:** A build script uses user-provided input to construct a command for a code analysis tool without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid constructing command-line arguments dynamically based on untrusted input.
        *   Use parameterized commands or APIs provided by the tools instead of raw command-line invocation.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any user-provided data used in build scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised CI/CD Pipeline Integrating Nuke](./attack_surfaces/compromised_cicd_pipeline_integrating_nuke.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Compromised CI/CD Pipeline Integrating Nuke**
    *   **Description:** The CI/CD pipeline that executes the Nuke build is compromised, allowing attackers to manipulate the build process.
    *   **How Nuke Contributes:** Nuke is often integrated into CI/CD pipelines. A compromised pipeline can be used to inject malicious code into the build process orchestrated by Nuke.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the CI/CD system and modifies the pipeline configuration to execute malicious scripts before or after the Nuke build.
    *   **Impact:** Supply chain attacks, introduction of malware into build artifacts, data exfiltration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the CI/CD pipeline infrastructure with strong authentication and authorization.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication for access to the CI/CD system.
        *   Regularly audit CI/CD pipeline configurations and access logs.
        *   Scan CI/CD pipeline configurations for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Segregate build environments and limit access.
