    * **Attack Vector:**  Compromised developer accounts, insecure repository access, insider threats, or even accidental exposure of configuration files.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Never store secrets directly in configuration files.** Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) and retrieve secrets at runtime.
        * **Employ environment variables** for sensitive configuration, ensuring they are managed securely within the deployment environment.
        * **Implement proper access controls** on configuration files to restrict who can view and modify them.
        * **Regularly audit configuration files** for sensitive information.

* **Misconfiguration:**  Incorrectly configured build tasks that execute arbitrary commands without proper sanitization or validation.
    * **Impact:**  An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands into build parameters or dependencies, leading to remote code execution on the build server or deployment environment.
    * **Attack Vector:**  Compromised dependencies, manipulation of build parameters through CI/CD pipelines, or exploiting vulnerabilities in custom build tasks.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Sanitize and validate all inputs** to build tasks.
        * **Follow the principle of least privilege** when defining build task permissions.
        * **Regularly review and audit custom build tasks** for potential security vulnerabilities.
        * **Utilize secure coding practices** when developing custom Nuke tasks.

* **Misconfiguration:**  Leaving debugging or verbose logging enabled in production builds, potentially exposing sensitive information in build logs.
    * **Impact:**  Attackers could gain insights into the application's internal workings, configuration details, or even potential vulnerabilities by analyzing verbose build logs.
    * **Attack Vector:**  Access to build logs through compromised CI/CD systems, insecure storage, or accidental exposure.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Disable debugging and verbose logging for production builds.**
        * **Securely store and manage build logs**, restricting access to authorized personnel.
        * **Implement log sanitization** to remove sensitive information before storage.

**4.2. Weak Credentials and Secrets Management:**

* **Misconfiguration:**  Using default or weak credentials for accessing external resources or services within the build process.
    * **Impact:**  Attackers could easily guess or brute-force these credentials, gaining unauthorized access to connected systems.
    * **Attack Vector:**  Publicly known default credentials, dictionary attacks, or brute-force attempts.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Never use default credentials.**
        * **Enforce strong password policies** for all accounts used in the build process.
        * **Utilize multi-factor authentication (MFA)** where possible.
        * **Regularly rotate credentials.**

* **Misconfiguration:**  Storing secrets in version control systems (even encrypted) without proper key management.
    * **Impact:**  If the encryption key is compromised, all stored secrets become accessible to the attacker.
    * **Attack Vector:**  Compromised developer machines, insecure key storage, or vulnerabilities in encryption algorithms.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Avoid storing secrets directly in version control.**
        * **Utilize dedicated secret management solutions.**

**4.3. Lax Permissions and Access Control:**

* **Misconfiguration:**  Granting excessive permissions to the build process or build agents.
    * **Impact:**  If a build agent or process is compromised, the attacker gains access to a wider range of resources and capabilities.
