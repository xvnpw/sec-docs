**Attack Path:** Compromise Build Process Through Malicious Build Script -> Gain Unauthorized Access to Build Server and Modify Script Directly

**Description:** An attacker compromises the build server itself (e.g., through weak credentials or server vulnerabilities) and directly modifies the build scripts to introduce malicious actions.

**Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

**Step 1: Gain Unauthorized Access to Build Server**

* **Attacker Goal:** Obtain access to the build server with sufficient privileges to modify files.
* **Potential Attack Vectors:**
    * **Exploiting Weak Credentials:**
        * **Default Credentials:** The build server or its services might be using default or easily guessable passwords.
        * **Brute-Force Attacks:** Attempting to guess usernames and passwords through automated tools.
        * **Credential Stuffing:** Using compromised credentials from other breaches.
    * **Exploiting Server Vulnerabilities:**
        * **Unpatched Operating System or Software:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the OS, web server, SSH service, or other installed software.
        * **Misconfigurations:** Exploiting insecure configurations like open ports, weak security settings, or unnecessary services.
    * **Social Engineering:** Tricking authorized personnel into revealing credentials or granting access (less likely for direct server access but possible).
    * **Insider Threat:** A malicious insider with legitimate access could abuse their privileges.
* **Prerequisites for Attacker:**
    * Identification of the build server's network address and open ports.
    * Knowledge of potential vulnerabilities in the server's software or configuration.
    * Tools for exploiting vulnerabilities or performing brute-force attacks.

**Step 2: Modify Script Directly**

* **Attacker Goal:** Inject malicious code into the build scripts to compromise the build process.
* **Potential Actions:**
    * **Direct Code Injection:** Adding malicious commands or scripts directly into the existing build scripts (e.g., `build.sh`, `build.ps1`, Nuke build files).
    * **Replacing Existing Scripts:** Overwriting legitimate build scripts with malicious versions.
    * **Modifying Configuration Files:** Altering configuration files used by the build process to execute malicious code.
    * **Introducing New Malicious Scripts:** Adding new scripts that are called by the existing build process.
* **Types of Malicious Actions:**
    * **Backdoor Installation:** Installing a persistent backdoor on the build server or within the built application.
    * **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive information from the build server or the build artifacts.
    * **Supply Chain Poisoning:** Injecting malicious code into the final application binaries or packages, affecting downstream users.
    * **Resource Consumption:**  Causing the build server to consume excessive resources, leading to denial of service.
    * **Sabotage:**  Intentionally breaking the build process or introducing flaws into the built application.
* **Prerequisites for Attacker:**
    * Successful unauthorized access to the build server with write permissions to the build scripts.
    * Understanding of the build process and the location of relevant build scripts.
    * Ability to modify files on the server.

**Impact Assessment:**

* **Compromised Builds:** The most immediate impact is the creation of compromised application builds containing malicious code.
* **Supply Chain Compromise:** If the compromised builds are distributed to users, it can lead to widespread compromise and significant reputational damage.
* **Loss of Trust:**  Users and customers may lose trust in the application and the development organization.
* **Financial Loss:** Costs associated with incident response, remediation, legal repercussions, and loss of business.
* **Reputational Damage:**  Significant harm to the organization's reputation and brand.
* **Legal and Compliance Issues:**  Depending on the nature of the compromise and the industry, there could be legal and regulatory consequences.
* **Exposure of Sensitive Information:**  Build scripts might contain sensitive information like API keys or credentials, which could be exposed.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Strengthen Access Controls:**
    * **Strong Passwords:** Enforce strong, unique passwords for all accounts on the build server.
    * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA for all access to the build server, especially for administrative accounts.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to users and processes.
    * **Regular Password Rotation:** Enforce regular password changes.
* **Harden the Build Server:**
    * **Keep Software Up-to-Date:** Regularly patch the operating system and all installed software to address known vulnerabilities.
    * **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Reduce the attack surface by disabling unnecessary services and ports.
    * **Secure Configuration:** Implement secure configurations for all services running on the build server.
    * **Firewall Configuration:** Implement a firewall to restrict network access to the build server.
* **Secure Build Scripts:**
    * **Version Control:** Store build scripts in a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes and facilitate rollback.
    * **Code Review:** Implement code review processes for changes to build scripts.
    * **Integrity Checks:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of build scripts before execution (e.g., checksums, digital signatures).
    * **Immutable Infrastructure:** Consider using immutable infrastructure principles where the build server configuration is managed as code and changes are deployed as new instances.
* **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    * **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Implement a SIEM system to collect and analyze security logs from the build server.
    * **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Deploy IDS/IPS to detect and potentially block malicious activity.
    * **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Monitor critical build scripts and system files for unauthorized changes.
    * **Alerting on Suspicious Activity:** Configure alerts for suspicious login attempts, file modifications, or unusual network traffic.
* **Build Server Isolation:**
    * **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the build server on a separate network segment with restricted access.
    * **Limited External Access:** Minimize the build server's exposure to the internet.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
* **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and maintain an incident response plan to effectively handle security breaches.

**Nuke Contextualization:**

* **Nuke Build Files:**  The attack could target the Nuke build files themselves (e.g., `build.nuke`). Understanding how Nuke executes these files is crucial for identifying potential injection points.
* **Nuke Plugins and Extensions:** If Nuke utilizes plugins or extensions, these could also be targets for malicious modification.
* **Nuke Configuration:**  The configuration of the Nuke build system itself might offer opportunities for exploitation if not properly secured.
* **Nuke Execution Environment:** Understanding the environment in which Nuke runs (e.g., operating system, installed tools) is important for identifying potential vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion:**

The attack path involving gaining unauthorized access to the build server and directly modifying build scripts poses a significant threat to the integrity of the build process and the security of the resulting application. A successful attack can have severe consequences, including supply chain compromise and significant reputational damage. Implementing robust security measures across access controls, server hardening, build script security, and monitoring is crucial to mitigate this risk. Specifically, focusing on strong authentication, regular patching, and integrity checks for build scripts are key preventative measures. Understanding the specifics of the Nuke build system and its configuration is also essential for tailoring security measures effectively.
