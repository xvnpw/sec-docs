# Attack Surface Analysis for nuke-build/nuke

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Build Script Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_build_script_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious code directly into Nuke build scripts (`_build.cs` or included files).

**Nuke Contribution:** Nuke executes C# build scripts. Compromised scripts directly translate to arbitrary code execution within the build process managed by Nuke. Nuke's extensibility and script-based nature make it a direct vector if scripts are compromised.

**Example:** A compromised Git repository contains a modified `_build.cs` that, when executed by Nuke, downloads and runs a malicious payload, granting the attacker control over the build server.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the build server or developer machine executing the build, potential for supply chain poisoning by injecting malware into build artifacts, data exfiltration.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure Source Code Repository:** Implement robust access controls, code reviews, and commit signing to prevent unauthorized modifications to build scripts.
*   **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate any external input used within build scripts to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the build process with the minimum necessary permissions to limit the impact of a compromised script.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security reviews of build scripts to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Integrity:** Verify the integrity of any external scripts or configurations fetched and used by the build process.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection in Build Scripts](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_in_build_scripts.md)

**Description:** Build scripts dynamically construct and execute shell commands based on untrusted input, leading to command injection vulnerabilities.

**Nuke Contribution:** While Nuke provides abstractions, developers can still execute arbitrary commands within Nuke build scripts using process execution APIs or by directly invoking command-line tools. If these commands are constructed unsafely with external input, it creates a direct command injection risk within the Nuke build process.

**Example:** A Nuke build script takes a user-provided version number from an environment variable and uses it in a command like `git tag $VERSION`. If the environment variable is maliciously crafted (e.g., `v1.0.0; rm -rf /`), it could execute arbitrary commands on the build server via Nuke.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build server, potentially leading to data loss, system compromise, or supply chain attacks through manipulated build outputs.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid Dynamic Command Construction:**  Prefer using Nuke's built-in actions and helpers which are designed to be safer and less prone to injection.
*   **Input Sanitization:** If dynamic commands are absolutely necessary, rigorously sanitize and validate all external input used in command construction.
*   **Parameterization:** Utilize parameterized commands or functions to avoid direct string concatenation of user input into commands, reducing injection risks.
*   **Code Review:** Implement thorough code reviews specifically focused on identifying potential command injection vulnerabilities in build scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Secrets Exposure in Build Scripts and Logs](./attack_surfaces/secrets_exposure_in_build_scripts_and_logs.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information (API keys, passwords, tokens, etc.) is inadvertently hardcoded directly into Nuke build scripts or unintentionally exposed in build logs generated by Nuke.

**Nuke Contribution:** Nuke build scripts are code, making it tempting for developers to embed secrets directly for convenience. Nuke's logging mechanisms can also inadvertently capture and expose secrets if not configured and used carefully within build scripts.

**Example:** An API key for a deployment service is hardcoded within a Nuke build script for automated deployment. This key is then exposed if the build script is committed to a public repository or if the build logs containing the key are not properly secured.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to external services, data breaches if exposed secrets grant access to sensitive data, account compromise and potential for further attacks.

**Risk Severity:** **High** (if critical secrets are exposed)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secrets Management Solutions:** Implement dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault) to securely store and manage secrets, and access them programmatically within Nuke scripts.
*   **Environment Variables:** Pass secrets to the build process as environment variables instead of hardcoding them in scripts. Ensure environment variable sources are secure.
*   **Secret Masking in Logs:** Configure logging systems and potentially Nuke's logging output to automatically mask or redact sensitive information in build logs.
*   **Code Reviews:** Conduct code reviews to specifically check for hardcoded secrets in build scripts before committing code.
*   **`.gitignore` and `.nukeignore`:** Ensure that any configuration files containing secrets or sensitive information are properly excluded from version control using `.gitignore` and `.nukeignore`.
