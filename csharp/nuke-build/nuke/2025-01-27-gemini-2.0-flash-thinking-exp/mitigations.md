# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for nuke-build/nuke

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Vulnerability Management for Nuke and its Plugins](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_vulnerability_management_for_nuke_and_its_plugins.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly audit and update Nuke and its plugins.
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Establish a schedule:** Define a recurring schedule (e.g., monthly, quarterly) to review and update Nuke and its plugins.
        2.  **Monitor for updates:** Subscribe to Nuke's release notes, community forums, and security mailing lists to stay informed about new versions and security advisories. Check plugin repositories for updates as well.
        3.  **Test updates in a staging environment:** Before applying updates to the production build environment, test them thoroughly in a staging or development environment to ensure compatibility and avoid build breakages.
        4.  **Apply updates promptly:** Once updates are tested and validated, apply them to the production build environment in a timely manner.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Vulnerable Dependencies (High Severity):** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated Nuke versions or plugins can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), data breaches, or Denial of Service (DoS).
    *   **Impact:** High reduction in risk for vulnerable dependencies. Regularly updating significantly reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have a process to update Nuke version annually, but plugin updates are less frequent and ad-hoc. Implemented in our DevOps procedures documentation.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to establish a more frequent schedule for plugin updates and integrate automated notifications for new Nuke and plugin releases.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize dependency scanning tools (for Nuke dependencies)](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_dependency_scanning_tools__for_nuke_dependencies_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize dependency scanning tools (for Nuke dependencies).
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Choose a suitable tool:** Select a dependency scanning tool that supports .NET and Nuke's dependency management (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, WhiteSource).
        2.  **Integrate into CI/CD pipeline:** Integrate the chosen tool into your CI/CD pipeline as a build step within your Nuke build process. Configure it to scan your `build.nuke` project and report vulnerabilities in Nuke's dependencies and plugins.
        3.  **Configure vulnerability thresholds:** Set thresholds for vulnerability severity (e.g., only fail builds on high and critical vulnerabilities).
        4.  **Establish remediation process:** Define a process for reviewing and addressing reported vulnerabilities. This includes updating dependencies, applying patches, or finding alternative solutions within the Nuke build context.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Vulnerable Dependencies (High Severity):** Proactively identifies known vulnerabilities in Nuke and its dependencies before they are exploited.
    *   **Impact:** High reduction in risk for vulnerable dependencies. Automated scanning provides continuous monitoring and early detection of vulnerabilities within the Nuke build environment.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. We are currently relying on manual reviews and infrequent updates.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Need to select and integrate a dependency scanning tool into our GitLab CI pipeline and establish a clear vulnerability remediation workflow specifically for Nuke dependencies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Pin Nuke and plugin versions](./mitigation_strategies/pin_nuke_and_plugin_versions.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Pin Nuke and plugin versions.
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify current versions:** Determine the current versions of Nuke and all plugins used in your project.
        2.  **Specify exact versions:** In your `global.json` (for .NET SDK version) and potentially within your `build.nuke` script or a dedicated configuration file for plugins, specify the exact versions of Nuke and plugins instead of using version ranges or wildcards.
        3.  **Document pinned versions:** Clearly document the pinned versions and the rationale behind them within the Nuke build documentation.
        4.  **Update versions deliberately:** When updates are necessary (after testing and validation), explicitly update the pinned versions in your configuration files within the Nuke build project.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unexpected Dependency Updates (Medium Severity):** Prevents unintended updates of Nuke or plugins that could introduce vulnerabilities, break build compatibility, or cause unexpected behavior in the build process.
