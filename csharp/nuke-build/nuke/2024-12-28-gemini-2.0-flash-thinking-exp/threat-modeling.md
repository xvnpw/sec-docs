*   **Threat:** Build Script Code Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code into Nuke build scripts (e.g., `build.cs`). This might happen by compromising a developer's machine and modifying the script, exploiting vulnerabilities in version control systems, or through a supply chain attack targeting custom build tasks. The attacker's goal is to have their code executed *by Nuke* during the build process.
    *   **Impact:**  Successful injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the build server or developer machines *via Nuke*. This could lead to data exfiltration (stealing source code, secrets, or other sensitive information), system compromise (installing backdoors, disrupting the build process), or supply chain poisoning (injecting malicious code into the final application).
    *   **Affected Component:** Nuke Build Scripts (.nuke files), Nuke Task Execution
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict code review processes for all changes to build scripts.
        *   Enforce secure version control practices, including access controls and branch protection.
        *   Regularly scan build scripts for suspicious code patterns.
        *   Harden developer workstations to prevent compromise.
        *   Implement integrity checks for build scripts to detect unauthorized modifications.

*   **Threat:** Command Injection via Nuke Tasks
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in custom or built-in Nuke tasks that improperly handle user-supplied input or environment variables. By manipulating these inputs, the attacker can inject and execute arbitrary commands on the system where the Nuke build is running *through the execution of the Nuke task*. This could occur if tasks directly construct shell commands from untrusted data.
    *   **Impact:**  Successful command injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the Nuke build process. This can lead to system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service by disrupting the build process or the underlying infrastructure.
    *   **Affected Component:** Nuke Task Execution, Specific Nuke Tasks (both built-in and custom)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and sanitize any external input used within Nuke tasks.
        *   Avoid constructing shell commands directly from user-provided data.
        *   Utilize Nuke's built-in features for secure command execution where possible (e.g., using parameters instead of string interpolation).
        *   Implement input validation and escaping mechanisms within custom tasks.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring the build environment.

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal in Build Scripts or Tasks
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in build scripts or custom tasks that construct file paths based on external input without proper validation. By providing malicious input *to Nuke*, they can cause the build process to access or modify files outside the intended build directory.
    *   **Impact:**  Successful path traversal can lead to the exposure of sensitive files on the build server, modification of critical build artifacts, or even the execution of arbitrary code if combined with other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** Nuke Build Scripts (.nuke files), Nuke Task Execution, File System Operations within Nuke
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always validate and sanitize file paths used within build scripts and custom tasks.
        *   Utilize Nuke's path manipulation utilities (if available) to ensure safe file access.
        *   Avoid constructing file paths directly from user-provided data.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Secrets in Build Output
    *   **Description:**  Nuke build scripts might inadvertently include sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or database credentials in the generated build artifacts (e.g., configuration files, deployment packages). This could happen through hardcoding secrets or improper handling of environment variables *within the Nuke build process*.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of secrets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive resources, account compromise, and data breaches. Attackers can extract these secrets from the build artifacts if they are not properly secured.
    *   **Affected Component:** Nuke Build Scripts (.nuke files), Nuke Output Generation
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid hardcoding secrets in build scripts.
        *   Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault) and inject secrets into the build process at runtime.
        *   Ensure that secrets are not logged or included in build outputs.
        *   Scan build outputs for potential secrets before deployment.

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities and Supply Chain Attacks
    *   **Description:** Nuke relies on NuGet packages and other dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited *during the Nuke build process* or within the final application. Attackers could also compromise dependencies to inject malicious code into the build process *managed by Nuke*.
    *   **Impact:**  Introduction of vulnerable code into the application, potentially leading to various security flaws (e.g., remote code execution, data breaches). Supply chain attacks can compromise the entire build process and the resulting application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Nuke Dependency Management, NuGet Integration
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Nuke and its dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
        *   Implement controls to verify the integrity of downloaded packages (e.g., using checksums or package signing).
        *   Be cautious about adding new dependencies and evaluate their trustworthiness.

*   **Threat:** Lack of Input Validation in Custom Tasks
    *   **Description:** Developers creating custom Nuke tasks might not properly validate user-provided input, leading to vulnerabilities like command injection, path traversal, or other injection flaws within the task's logic *executed by Nuke*.
    *   **Impact:**  Similar to command injection and path traversal in build scripts, this can lead to system compromise, data breaches, or disruption of the build process.
    *   **Affected Component:** Custom Nuke Tasks
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Educate developers on secure coding practices for Nuke tasks.
        *   Enforce input validation and sanitization within custom task implementations.
        *   Provide secure coding guidelines and code review processes for custom tasks.
