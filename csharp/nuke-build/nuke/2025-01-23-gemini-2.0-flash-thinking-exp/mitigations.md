# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for nuke-build/nuke

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Nuke and .NET SDK](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_nuke_and__net_sdk.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Establish a monitoring process:** Subscribe to Nuke release notifications (e.g., GitHub releases, mailing lists) and .NET SDK security announcements (Microsoft Security Response Center).
2.  **Regularly check for updates:** Periodically (e.g., monthly or quarterly) check for new Nuke versions and .NET SDK updates relevant to your Nuke build environment.
3.  **Test updates in a non-production environment:** Before updating your main build environment, test Nuke and .NET SDK updates in a staging or development environment to ensure compatibility with your `build.nuke` scripts and avoid build breakages.
4.  **Apply updates promptly:** Once tested and verified, apply the updates to your production build environment as soon as possible, prioritizing security updates for both Nuke and the .NET SDK it relies on.
5.  **Document update process:** Maintain documentation of the update process, including Nuke and .NET SDK version numbers and dates of updates, for auditability and consistency in your Nuke build toolchain.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Vulnerable Nuke Build Tool - Severity: High (If vulnerabilities in Nuke itself are exploited during the build process)
    *   Vulnerable .NET SDK - Severity: High (If vulnerabilities in the .NET SDK used by Nuke are exploited during build)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Vulnerable Nuke Build Tool: Significantly reduces risk of exploits targeting Nuke.
    *   Vulnerable .NET SDK: Significantly reduces risk of exploits targeting the underlying platform used by Nuke.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - We have a process for updating .NET SDK, but Nuke updates are less frequent and ad-hoc.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Formalized process for regularly checking and applying Nuke updates. Automated notifications for both Nuke and .NET SDK updates relevant to Nuke usage would improve proactiveness.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Scanning for NuGet Packages (Used by Nuke Build Scripts)](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_scanning_for_nuget_packages__used_by_nuke_build_scripts_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Choose a dependency scanning tool:** Select a suitable tool like OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, or GitHub Dependency Scanning that can scan NuGet dependencies used by your .NET projects, including your Nuke build scripts project.
2.  **Integrate the tool into CI/CD pipeline:** Add a step in your CI/CD pipeline to run the chosen dependency scanning tool specifically targeting the NuGet packages used by your `build.nuke` project and any custom Nuke tasks or modules.
3.  **Configure the tool:** Configure the tool to scan your project's NuGet dependencies, focusing on those defined in your `build.nuke` project file, `Directory.Packages.props` (if used for build scripts), and any related project files for custom Nuke tasks.
4.  **Set up vulnerability thresholds:** Define acceptable vulnerability thresholds (e.g., fail the build on high severity vulnerabilities) for dependencies used by your Nuke build scripts.
5.  **Review and remediate vulnerabilities:** When vulnerabilities are reported in NuGet packages used by your Nuke build scripts, review them, assess their relevance to your build process, and remediate them by updating vulnerable packages or implementing workarounds if updates are not immediately available.
6.  **Automate reporting:** Configure the tool to generate reports and notifications about detected vulnerabilities in Nuke build script dependencies for the development and security teams.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Vulnerable NuGet Dependencies in Nuke Scripts - Severity: High (If exploited, can compromise the build process itself, potentially leading to supply chain attacks or build server compromise)
    *   Supply Chain Attacks via Compromised Packages in Nuke Scripts - Severity: Medium (Compromised packages used by Nuke scripts can be introduced through vulnerable dependencies)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Vulnerable NuGet Dependencies in Nuke Scripts: Significantly reduces risk of vulnerabilities in Nuke build process dependencies.
    *   Supply Chain Attacks via Compromised Packages in Nuke Scripts: Moderately reduces risk (detection focused, not prevention of initial compromise).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - GitHub Dependency Scanning is enabled for the main application repository, but not explicitly configured to scan the dependencies of the `build.nuke` project itself.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Explicitly configure dependency scanning to include the `build.nuke` project and its NuGet dependencies. Formalize the vulnerability remediation process for Nuke build script dependencies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Pin or Lock NuGet Package Versions (in Nuke Build Scripts)](./mitigation_strategies/pin_or_lock_nuget_package_versions__in_nuke_build_scripts_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify package version specifications in Nuke scripts:** Review your `build.nuke` project file, `Directory.Packages.props` (if used for build scripts), and any related project files for custom Nuke tasks to identify NuGet package version specifications used by your Nuke build scripts.
2.  **Replace version ranges and wildcards:** Replace any version ranges (e.g., `[1.0.0, 2.0.0)`) or wildcard versions (`*`) with specific, fixed versions (e.g., `1.2.3`) for NuGet packages used by your Nuke build scripts.
3.  **Use `PackageReference` with explicit versions:** Ensure that `PackageReference` items in your Nuke project files specify exact versions for build script dependencies.
4.  **Commit version changes:** Commit the changes to your version control system to ensure consistent builds across environments and over time for your Nuke build process.
5.  **Regularly review and update pinned versions (with testing):** While pinning versions is important, periodically review and update pinned versions of NuGet packages used by your Nuke scripts to incorporate security patches and bug fixes. Always test updates thoroughly in a non-production build environment before applying them to production.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unexpected Dependency Updates in Nuke Scripts - Severity: Medium (Can introduce breaking changes or vulnerabilities into your Nuke build process unintentionally)
    *   Dependency Confusion Attacks (in some scenarios related to Nuke script dependencies) - Severity: Low (Pinning reduces the chance of accidentally pulling in a malicious package with the same name but higher version in the context of Nuke script dependencies)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unexpected Dependency Updates in Nuke Scripts: Significantly reduces risk of unexpected issues in the Nuke build process due to dependency updates.
    *   Dependency Confusion Attacks: Minimally reduces risk (not the primary mitigation for this attack, but adds a layer of control).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - We generally use specific versions for core dependencies in application projects, but build scripts might still use some version ranges for less critical tools used in the Nuke build process.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Enforce strict version pinning for all NuGet packages used by the `build.nuke` project and related custom Nuke tasks. Establish a process for controlled updates of pinned versions for Nuke build script dependencies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Coding Practices in Nuke Build Scripts (`build.nuke`)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_coding_practices_in_nuke_build_scripts___build_nuke__.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Input Validation in Nuke Tasks:** If your Nuke tasks accept external input (parameters, environment variables), validate and sanitize this input within your Nuke task code to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection, path traversal) that could be executed by Nuke during the build.
2.  **Avoid Hardcoded Secrets in Nuke Scripts:** Never hardcode secrets (API keys, passwords) directly in your `build.nuke` scripts or custom Nuke tasks. Utilize secure secrets management solutions (see dedicated section) when accessing secrets from within Nuke scripts.
3.  **Principle of Least Privilege in Nuke Tasks:** Ensure Nuke tasks only perform necessary actions. Avoid granting excessive permissions or capabilities to the Nuke build process that are not strictly needed for the build.
4.  **Error Handling and Logging in Nuke Scripts:** Implement proper error handling and logging within your Nuke scripts and custom tasks to aid in debugging and security monitoring of the Nuke build process. Avoid logging sensitive information in Nuke build logs.
5.  **Code Clarity and Maintainability of Nuke Scripts:** Write clean, well-documented, and maintainable `build.nuke` scripts and custom Nuke tasks to reduce the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities through complexity or errors in your Nuke build logic.
6.  **Static Code Analysis for Nuke Scripts (C#):** Utilize static code analysis tools for C# to analyze your `build.nuke` scripts and custom Nuke tasks to identify potential security flaws and coding vulnerabilities within your Nuke build logic.

    *   Exposure of Secrets in Nuke Scripts - Severity: High (If secrets are hardcoded or logged insecurely within Nuke scripts, making them easily discoverable)
    *   Unintended Build Actions via Nuke Scripts - Severity: Medium (Due to errors or logic flaws in Nuke scripts, leading to unexpected or insecure build outcomes)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Command Injection in Nuke Build Process: Significantly reduces risk of command injection vulnerabilities within the Nuke build process.
    *   Path Traversal in Nuke Build Process: Moderately reduces risk of path traversal vulnerabilities within the Nuke build process.
    *   Exposure of Secrets in Nuke Scripts: Significantly reduces risk of secrets exposure within Nuke build scripts.
    *   Unintended Build Actions via Nuke Scripts: Moderately reduces risk of errors and unintended actions in the Nuke build process.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - We generally avoid hardcoding secrets in Nuke scripts, but input validation in Nuke tasks is not consistently applied. Code reviews are performed, but not specifically focused on Nuke build script security.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Formalize secure coding guidelines specifically for Nuke build scripts and custom tasks. Implement input validation in Nuke tasks that accept external input. Integrate static code analysis for `build.nuke` scripts and custom Nuke tasks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Review for Nuke Build Scripts (`build.nuke`)](./mitigation_strategies/code_review_for_nuke_build_scripts___build_nuke__.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Include `build.nuke` scripts in code review process:** Treat your `build.nuke` scripts and any custom Nuke tasks as critical code that requires thorough review, just like application code.
2.  **Establish a review process for Nuke scripts:** Define a code review process specifically for `build.nuke` scripts and custom Nuke tasks, similar to application code reviews. This could involve peer reviews or dedicated security reviews focusing on the Nuke build logic.
3.  **Focus on security aspects during Nuke script reviews:** Train reviewers to specifically look for security vulnerabilities in `build.nuke` scripts, such as input validation issues in Nuke tasks, secret handling within Nuke scripts, and potential for unintended or insecure actions within the Nuke build process.
4.  **Use version control for `build.nuke` scripts:** Ensure `build.nuke` scripts and custom Nuke tasks are under version control to track changes and facilitate code reviews of the Nuke build logic.
5.  **Document review findings and resolutions for Nuke scripts:** Document the findings of code reviews for `build.nuke` scripts and the resolutions implemented to address identified security or logic issues in the Nuke build process.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Security Vulnerabilities in Nuke Build Scripts - Severity: Medium to High (Depending on the nature of the vulnerability introduced in the Nuke build logic)
    *   Logic Errors in Nuke Build Scripts - Severity: Medium (Can lead to build failures, insecure build configurations, or unintended consequences in the Nuke build process)
    *   Unintended Actions in Nuke Build Process - Severity: Medium (Due to script errors or malicious modifications in `build.nuke`, potentially compromising the build output or build environment)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Security Vulnerabilities in Nuke Build Scripts: Moderately reduces risk of security flaws in the Nuke build process.
    *   Logic Errors in Nuke Build Scripts: Significantly reduces risk of errors and misconfigurations in the Nuke build process.
    *   Unintended Actions in Nuke Build Process: Moderately reduces risk of unexpected or malicious actions during the Nuke build.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - Code reviews are performed for major changes to build scripts, but not as a standard practice for every modification. Security aspects are not always explicitly considered during Nuke script reviews.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Make code reviews mandatory for all changes to `build.nuke` scripts and custom Nuke tasks. Incorporate security-focused checklists or guidelines into the Nuke script review process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation in Nuke Build Scripts (Specifically in Nuke Tasks)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_in_nuke_build_scripts__specifically_in_nuke_tasks_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify external inputs to Nuke tasks:** Determine all sources of external input to your Nuke tasks (e.g., command-line arguments passed to Nuke, environment variables accessed by Nuke scripts, CI/CD pipeline parameters used in Nuke builds).
2.  **Define validation rules for Nuke task inputs:** For each input to your Nuke tasks, define validation rules based on expected data types, formats, and allowed values. Ensure these rules are appropriate for the context of how the input is used within the Nuke build process.
3.  **Implement validation logic within Nuke tasks:** In your Nuke task code (C#), implement validation logic to check inputs against the defined rules. Use appropriate validation methods and techniques within your Nuke task implementations.
4.  **Handle invalid input gracefully in Nuke tasks:** If input validation fails within a Nuke task, handle the error gracefully. Log the error within the Nuke build log, provide informative error messages to the build process, and prevent the Nuke build from proceeding with invalid input.
5.  **Sanitize input in Nuke tasks (if necessary):** In some cases, sanitization might be needed within Nuke tasks to remove or escape potentially harmful characters from input before using it in commands, file paths, or other operations performed by the Nuke build process.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Command Injection via Nuke Tasks - Severity: High (Prevents execution of arbitrary commands through malicious input passed to Nuke tasks)
    *   Path Traversal via Nuke Tasks - Severity: Medium (Prevents access to unauthorized files or directories through malicious path input provided to Nuke tasks)

*   **Missing Implementation:** Systematic implementation of input validation for all external inputs to Nuke tasks. Documentation of input validation rules and processes for Nuke build scripts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Nuke Build Script Actions](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_nuke_build_script_actions.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify required permissions for Nuke build process:** Analyze the actions performed by your `build.nuke` scripts and custom Nuke tasks and identify the minimum permissions required for each action within the Nuke build process (e.g., file system access, network access, access to cloud resources needed by Nuke tasks).
2.  **Configure build environment with least privilege for Nuke builds:** Configure the build environment (build server, CI/CD agent) to operate with the least privileges necessary for the Nuke build process. Avoid running build agents as highly privileged users (e.g., root or administrator) when executing Nuke builds.
3.  **Restrict access to sensitive resources for Nuke builds:** Limit the Nuke build environment's access to sensitive resources (e.g., databases, secret stores, production environments) to only what is absolutely required for the Nuke build and deployment process.
4.  **Use dedicated service accounts for Nuke build tasks (if applicable):** If Nuke tasks need to interact with external services or resources, use dedicated service accounts with limited permissions instead of using personal accounts or overly permissive credentials within your Nuke build process.
5.  **Regularly review and audit permissions for Nuke build environment:** Periodically review and audit the permissions granted to the Nuke build environment and the actions performed by Nuke scripts to ensure they still adhere to the principle of least privilege and remove any unnecessary permissions granted to the Nuke build process.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Lateral Movement in Case of Nuke Build Environment Compromise - Severity: Medium (Limits the potential impact if the build server or a Nuke script is compromised, restricting access to other systems)
    *   Unauthorized Access to Resources by Nuke Build Process - Severity: Medium (Reduces the risk of Nuke scripts or the build process accessing sensitive resources they shouldn't, even if unintentionally)
    *   Accidental Damage to System by Nuke Build Process - Severity: Low (Reduces the potential for accidental damage due to overly permissive Nuke scripts or build environment configurations)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Lateral Movement in Case of Nuke Build Environment Compromise: Moderately reduces risk of wider compromise if the Nuke build environment is breached.
    *   Unauthorized Access to Resources by Nuke Build Process: Moderately reduces risk of unintended access to sensitive resources during Nuke builds.
    *   Accidental Damage to System by Nuke Build Process: Minimally reduces risk of accidental system damage caused by Nuke build actions.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - Build agents are generally run with service accounts, but the principle of least privilege might not be strictly enforced for all Nuke build script actions and resource access.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Detailed permission analysis for Nuke build scripts and the Nuke build environment. Hardening build environment configurations to strictly enforce least privilege for Nuke builds. Regular audits of Nuke build environment permissions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Externalize Secrets Management (for Nuke Build Scripts)](./mitigation_strategies/externalize_secrets_management__for_nuke_build_scripts_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify secrets used in Nuke build process:** Identify all secrets used within your Nuke build process, specifically those accessed or used by your `build.nuke` scripts and custom Nuke tasks (API keys, passwords, certificates, connection strings, etc.).
2.  **Choose a secrets management solution for Nuke builds:** Select a suitable secrets management solution that can be securely integrated with your Nuke build process (environment variables passed to Nuke, dedicated secret manager accessible from Nuke scripts, CI/CD platform secrets injected into the Nuke build environment).
3.  **Migrate secrets from Nuke scripts to the chosen solution:** Move all hardcoded secrets from your `build.nuke` scripts and custom Nuke tasks to the chosen secrets management solution. Ensure no secrets remain directly embedded in your Nuke build code.
4.  **Access secrets in Nuke scripts securely:** Modify your `build.nuke` scripts and custom Nuke tasks to retrieve secrets from the chosen secrets management solution at runtime instead of hardcoding them. Use secure methods provided by the solution to access secrets from within your Nuke build logic.
5.  **Configure access controls for secrets used by Nuke builds:** Implement access controls in the secrets management solution to restrict access to secrets used in the Nuke build process to only authorized users and systems (e.g., build agents executing Nuke builds, deployment processes triggered by Nuke).

*   **Missing Implementation:** Comprehensive inventory of all secrets used in the Nuke build process. Full migration of all secrets accessed by Nuke scripts to a robust secrets management solution. Strict enforcement against hardcoding secrets in `build.nuke` scripts and custom Nuke tasks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Storing Secrets in Version Control (Related to Nuke Scripts)](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_storing_secrets_in_version_control__related_to_nuke_scripts_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify potential secret files related to Nuke builds:** Identify files that might contain secrets used by or related to your Nuke build process (configuration files for Nuke tasks, scripts used by Nuke, etc.).
2.  **Use `.gitignore` (or equivalent) for Nuke related secret files:** Add these files to your `.gitignore` file (or equivalent mechanism in your version control system) to prevent them from being committed along with your `build.nuke` scripts and project files.
3.  **Verify `.gitignore` effectiveness for Nuke related files:** Regularly verify that sensitive files related to your Nuke build process are indeed excluded from version control and are not accidentally committed alongside your `build.nuke` scripts.
4.  **Educate developers on Nuke script secret handling:** Train developers on the importance of not committing secrets to version control, especially in the context of `build.nuke` scripts and related files, and how to use `.gitignore` effectively for Nuke build related files.
5.  **Use Git hooks (Optional) for Nuke script commits:** Consider using Git hooks (e.g., `pre-commit` hook) to automatically check for potential secrets in commits related to `build.nuke` scripts and prevent commits containing secrets used in the Nuke build process.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exposure of Secrets in Version Control History (Nuke Scripts) - Severity: High (Secrets committed to version control along with `build.nuke` scripts are permanently exposed in history, even if removed later)
    *   Accidental Secret Exposure in Nuke Script Repository - Severity: Medium (Accidental commits of secret files related to the Nuke build process can happen)
*   **Impact:**

    *   Accidental Secret Exposure in Nuke Script Repository: Moderately reduces risk of accidental secret commits within the Nuke build script repository.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - We use `.gitignore` and educate developers on not committing secrets, including in the context of build scripts.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Git hooks for automated secret detection in commits related to `build.nuke` scripts could be implemented for an extra layer of protection. Regular audits to ensure `.gitignore` is comprehensive and effective for Nuke build related files.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Transmission of Secrets to Nuke Build Environment](./mitigation_strategies/secure_transmission_of_secrets_to_nuke_build_environment.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Use secure channels for secret transmission to Nuke builds:** When passing secrets to the Nuke build environment (e.g., from CI/CD system to build agent executing Nuke builds), use secure channels like HTTPS or encrypted connections.
2.  **Avoid logging secrets in Nuke build logs:** Ensure that secrets are not logged in Nuke build logs, console output generated by Nuke, or other insecure locations during transmission or usage within the Nuke build process. Configure logging levels and sanitization in Nuke scripts to prevent accidental secret logging.
3.  **Use secure secret injection mechanisms for Nuke builds:** Utilize secure secret injection mechanisms provided by your CI/CD platform or secrets management solution to securely pass secrets to the Nuke build environment. Avoid insecure methods like passing secrets as plain text command-line arguments to Nuke.
4.  **Minimize secret exposure time in Nuke build environment:** Minimize the time secrets are exposed in the Nuke build environment. Retrieve secrets within Nuke scripts just before they are needed and dispose of them securely after use if possible within the Nuke build process.
5.  **Secure build agent communication for Nuke builds:** Ensure communication between the CI/CD control plane and build agents executing Nuke builds is secured (e.g., using TLS encryption) to protect secrets transmitted to the Nuke build environment.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exposure of Secrets in Transit to Nuke Build Environment - Severity: Medium (Secrets transmitted over insecure channels to Nuke builds can be intercepted)
    *   Exposure of Secrets in Nuke Build Logs - Severity: High (Secrets logged in Nuke build logs are easily accessible to anyone with access to build logs)
    *   Unauthorized Access to Secrets in Nuke Build Environment - Severity: Medium (If secrets are not handled securely within the Nuke build environment during Nuke builds)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of Secrets in Transit to Nuke Build Environment: Moderately reduces risk of secrets being intercepted during transmission to Nuke builds.
    *   Exposure of Secrets in Nuke Build Logs: Significantly reduces risk of secrets being exposed in Nuke build logs.
    *   Unauthorized Access to Secrets in Nuke Build Environment: Moderately reduces risk of unauthorized access to secrets within the Nuke build environment.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - We use HTTPS for CI/CD communication and avoid logging secrets in application logs, but Nuke build script logs might need review for potential secret exposure. Secret injection mechanisms are used for Nuke builds, but could be further hardened.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Review and harden Nuke build script logging to ensure no secrets are logged. Implement more robust secret injection mechanisms for Nuke builds and minimize secret exposure time in the Nuke build environment. Regular audits of secret transmission and handling processes related to Nuke builds.
