# Attack Surface Analysis for nuke-build/nuke

## Attack Surface: [Build Script Vulnerabilities (`build.nuke`)](./attack_surfaces/build_script_vulnerabilities___build_nuke__.md)

**Description:** The `build.nuke` file defines the build process and can be manipulated to execute arbitrary code.

**How Nuke Contributes:** Nuke relies on the `build.nuke` file as its central configuration and execution point. Its C# or F# nature allows for powerful but potentially dangerous operations.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the repository and modifies `build.nuke` to download and execute a malicious script before the actual build steps.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the build environment, deployment of backdoors, data exfiltration, supply chain attacks.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict access controls to the repository containing `build.nuke`.
* Enforce code review for all changes to `build.nuke`.
* Store `build.nuke` securely and monitor for unauthorized modifications.
* Avoid dynamically generating build logic based on external or untrusted input within `build.nuke`.
* Use parameterized commands instead of string concatenation when executing external tools.

## Attack Surface: [Command Execution via Targets](./attack_surfaces/command_execution_via_targets.md)

**Description:** Nuke targets often execute shell commands or external tools, which can be vulnerable to command injection.

**How Nuke Contributes:** Nuke's core functionality involves defining and executing targets that often involve running external processes. If input to these commands isn't sanitized, it's a risk.

**Example:** A Nuke target takes user input (e.g., a version number) and uses it directly in a shell command without sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject additional commands.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build server, potentially leading to system compromise or data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always sanitize and validate any input used in commands executed by Nuke targets.
* Prefer parameterized commands or dedicated libraries for interacting with external tools instead of directly constructing shell commands.
* Apply the principle of least privilege to the user running the build process.
* Regularly review and audit the commands executed within Nuke targets.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information or insecure settings within Nuke's configuration or related files can be exposed.

**How Nuke Contributes:** While Nuke itself might not have extensive configuration files, the `build.nuke` file and any environment variables it uses can contain sensitive data.

**Example:** API keys or database credentials are hardcoded within the `build.nuke` file or passed as insecure environment variables accessible during the build.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, allowing attackers to access protected resources or systems.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid storing secrets directly in `build.nuke` or environment variables.
* Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault) and retrieve secrets at runtime.
* Implement proper access controls for any configuration files used by Nuke.
* Regularly review and audit the configuration of the build environment.

## Attack Surface: [Build Artifact Poisoning (Indirectly Related, but enabled by Nuke compromise)](./attack_surfaces/build_artifact_poisoning__indirectly_related__but_enabled_by_nuke_compromise_.md)

**Description:** Although not directly a vulnerability *in* Nuke, if Nuke is compromised, it can be used to inject malicious code into build outputs.

**How Nuke Contributes:** If an attacker gains control of the Nuke build process, they can manipulate the steps to include malicious code in the final application artifacts.

**Example:** An attacker modifies the build process to inject a backdoor into the compiled application binary.

**Impact:** Distribution of compromised software to end-users, leading to widespread security breaches.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (due to the potential for widespread impact)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Focus on securing the `build.nuke` file and the overall build environment as described in previous points.
* Implement checksum verification or signing of build artifacts.
* Regularly scan build artifacts for malware or vulnerabilities.
