## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code into Build Artifacts](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_build_artifacts.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker aims to embed malicious code directly into the final application or its components during the build process. This can be achieved through various means, ultimately leading to the deployment of a compromised application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Build Scripts](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_build_scripts.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers target the scripts that define the build process itself. By injecting malicious commands or introducing entirely new malicious scripts, they can execute arbitrary code during the build, potentially compromising the build environment and the final application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Dependency Management Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_dependency_management_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit the mechanisms used to manage external libraries and components. By introducing malicious dependencies or manipulating the dependency resolution process, they can inject malicious code into the build.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate the Build Process for Malicious Purposes](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_the_build_process_for_malicious_purposes.md)

**Attack Vector:** Instead of directly injecting code, attackers aim to alter the build process itself to achieve malicious goals. This involves tampering with configuration, task execution, or the final output generation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code into Build Artifacts](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_build_artifacts.md)

**Attack Vector:** This represents the overarching goal of injecting malicious code. Success at this node means the final application is compromised, leading to potential data breaches, unauthorized access, or other malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Build Scripts](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_build_scripts.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers gain control over the build process by exploiting weaknesses in the build scripts. This allows them to execute arbitrary commands, modify build steps, and ultimately compromise the build output.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Commands into Existing Scripts](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_commands_into_existing_scripts.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers modify existing build scripts to include malicious commands. When these scripts are executed during the build, the malicious commands are also executed, leading to potential compromise of the build environment or the application being built.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce New Malicious Build Scripts](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_new_malicious_build_scripts.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers add new, entirely malicious scripts to the build process. These scripts are designed to perform malicious actions when executed as part of the build, such as downloading malware, exfiltrating data, or modifying build artifacts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Dependency Management Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_dependency_management_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in how the build system manages its dependencies. This can involve tricking the system into downloading malicious packages or using compromised versions of legitimate packages.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Confusion Attack](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_confusion_attack.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers upload a malicious package with the same name as an internal dependency to a public repository. The build system, if not configured correctly, might prioritize the public, malicious package over the intended internal one.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Internal Package Repository](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_internal_package_repository.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the organization's internal repository for storing dependencies. This allows them to upload malicious packages that will be trusted and used by the build system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Files into the Build Context](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_files_into_the_build_context.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers introduce malicious files into the directories that are used as input for the build process. These files can then be included in the final build artifacts, leading to a compromised application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate the Build Process for Malicious Purposes](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_the_build_process_for_malicious_purposes.md)

**Attack Vector:** This node represents the broad goal of subverting the intended build process. Success here means the attacker has altered the build in a way that benefits them, such as injecting backdoors or disabling security features.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify `build.nuke` or related configuration files](./attack_tree_paths/modify__build_nuke__or_related_configuration_files.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers directly modify the configuration files that define how the Nuke build system operates. This can allow them to change build steps, introduce new tasks, or alter the build output.

## Attack Tree Path: [Hijack or Reorder Build Tasks](./attack_tree_paths/hijack_or_reorder_build_tasks.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate the order or dependencies of build tasks. This can be used to insert malicious tasks into the build process or to prevent critical security checks from being executed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce malicious tasks](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_tasks.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers add new tasks to the build process that are designed to perform malicious actions. These tasks could execute arbitrary code, modify files, or exfiltrate data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Build Outputs or Artifacts](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_build_outputs_or_artifacts.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers directly alter the final output of the build process. This can involve replacing legitimate files with malicious ones or injecting malicious code into existing files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Replace legitimate build outputs](./attack_tree_paths/replace_legitimate_build_outputs.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers completely replace the legitimate output files of the build process with their own malicious versions. This ensures that the deployed application is entirely under their control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject malicious content into outputs](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_content_into_outputs.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers modify existing output files by adding malicious code or content. This can be done to introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors into the deployed application.
