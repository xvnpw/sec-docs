# Threat Model Analysis for nuke-build/nuke

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Build Script](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via_malicious_build_script.md)

*   **Threat:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Build Script
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code into a Nuke build script. When the build process is executed by Nuke, this malicious code will run with the privileges of the build agent or developer machine, potentially allowing the attacker to install malware, exfiltrate data, or compromise the build environment. This directly leverages Nuke's script execution capabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the build server or developer machine, leading to data breaches, supply chain attacks (injecting malicious code into the application build), or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Nuke Component:** Nuke Build Scripts (`build.ps1`, `build.sh`, `.nuke` directory), Nuke Task Execution Engine (when executing targets defined in the scripts).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access control and code review processes for all changes to Nuke build scripts.
        *   Use a version control system for Nuke build scripts and track all modifications.
        *   Employ static analysis tools to scan Nuke build scripts for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for the build agent account running Nuke.
        *   Regularly audit Nuke build scripts for suspicious or unexpected commands.
        *   Consider signing Nuke build scripts to ensure their integrity.

## Threat: [Exposure of Secrets in Nuke Build Scripts or Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_secrets_in_nuke_build_scripts_or_configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Secrets in Nuke Build Scripts or Configuration
    *   **Description:** Attackers could find sensitive information, such as API keys, database credentials, or signing certificates, hardcoded within Nuke build scripts, configuration files managed by Nuke, or inadvertently exposed in Nuke build logs. This information could be used to gain unauthorized access to systems or resources. This threat directly relates to how Nuke scripts and configurations are managed.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to critical infrastructure, data breaches, compromised application security, financial loss.
    *   **Affected Nuke Component:** Nuke Build Scripts, Nuke Parameter system (if used to manage secrets insecurely), Nuke Logging.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never hardcode secrets directly in Nuke build scripts or configuration files.
        *   Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault) and access secrets dynamically during the Nuke build process.
        *   Avoid logging sensitive information in Nuke build logs. Configure Nuke's logging to exclude sensitive data.
        *   Use environment variables or dedicated secret management features within Nuke or related tools.
        *   Regularly scan Nuke build scripts and configuration for potential secret leaks using tools designed for this purpose.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion Attack via Malicious NuGet Packages (Directly Affecting Nuke's NuGet Integration)](./threats/dependency_confusion_attack_via_malicious_nuget_packages__directly_affecting_nuke's_nuget_integratio_a199ceed.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Confusion Attack via Malicious NuGet Packages (Directly Affecting Nuke's NuGet Integration)
    *   **Description:** An attacker could create a malicious NuGet package with the same name as an internal or private package used by the Nuke build process. If Nuke's NuGet integration is not configured correctly, it might download and use the malicious package from a public repository instead of the intended internal one. This allows the attacker to inject malicious code into the build process orchestrated by Nuke.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of malicious code into the application build managed by Nuke, potentially leading to compromised releases or backdoors.
    *   **Affected Nuke Component:** Nuke's dependency management through NuGet (using `NuGetTasks`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure Nuke and NuGet to prioritize internal or private NuGet feeds.
        *   Implement package pinning or checksum verification within Nuke's NuGet configuration to ensure the integrity of downloaded packages.
        *   Use a NuGet repository manager that supports mirroring and proxying of external packages used by Nuke.
        *   Regularly audit and manage project dependencies used by Nuke builds.
        *   Consider using signed NuGet packages.

## Threat: [Build Environment Compromise Exploiting Nuke Capabilities](./threats/build_environment_compromise_exploiting_nuke_capabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Build Environment Compromise Exploiting Nuke Capabilities
    *   **Description:** If the build server running Nuke is compromised through other means, an attacker can leverage Nuke's capabilities to further their access or deploy malicious code. Nuke's ability to execute arbitrary commands defined in build scripts and manipulate files can be used to escalate privileges or spread the compromise within the build environment managed by Nuke.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over the build pipeline managed by Nuke, ability to inject malicious code into all future releases, data exfiltration from the build environment.
    *   **Affected Nuke Component:** Nuke Task Execution Engine, Nuke File System Operations (e.g., file copying, deletion) as used within build scripts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Harden the build server operating system and all installed software that Nuke relies on.
        *   Implement strong access controls and authentication for the build server where Nuke is running.
        *   Regularly monitor build server activity for suspicious behavior, especially related to Nuke processes.
        *   Isolate the build environment where Nuke operates from other sensitive networks.
        *   Keep Nuke and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
