## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Modify `build.nuke` or related configuration files

**Context:** This analysis focuses on a specific attack path within an attack tree for an application utilizing the Nuke build system (https://github.com/nuke-build/nuke). The targeted vulnerability is the ability for an attacker to modify the core configuration files that govern the build process.

**Attack Tree Path:** Modify `build.nuke` or related configuration files

**Attack Vector:** Attackers directly modify the configuration files that define how the Nuke build system operates. This can allow them to change build steps, introduce new tasks, or alter the build output.

**Detailed Analysis:**

This attack vector targets the fundamental control mechanism of the build process. The `build.nuke` file (or similar configuration files) acts as the blueprint for how the application is compiled, tested, packaged, and deployed. Gaining control over this file grants the attacker significant leverage over the entire software development lifecycle.

**Breakdown of the Attack Vector:**

* **Target Files:**
    * **`build.nuke`:** This is the primary entry point for the Nuke build system. It's typically a C# script that defines targets, dependencies, and build logic. Modifying this file allows for the most direct and impactful changes to the build process.
    * **Related Configuration Files:** Nuke projects can utilize other configuration files for various purposes, including:
        * **`.csproj` files (for C# projects):** These files define project dependencies, compilation settings, and NuGet package references. Modifying them can introduce malicious dependencies or alter compilation behavior.
        * **`global.json`:** This file can specify the .NET SDK version to use. Forcing a downgrade could introduce vulnerabilities.
        * **`nuget.config`:** This file defines NuGet package sources. An attacker could add a malicious feed to inject compromised packages.
        * **Environment variable configuration files:**  Nuke builds can rely on environment variables. Modifying these can alter build behavior or introduce vulnerabilities.
        * **Custom configuration files:**  Projects might have custom configuration files used by Nuke scripts for specific tasks.

* **Methods of Modification:**
    * **Direct File System Access:**
        * **Compromised Developer Machine:** If an attacker gains access to a developer's machine with write access to the repository, they can directly modify the files.
        * **Compromised Build Server:** If the build server itself is compromised, attackers can modify the files directly on the server's file system.
        * **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Version Control Systems (VCS):** Weaknesses in the VCS (e.g., Git) could be exploited to push malicious changes.
        * **Insider Threat:** A malicious insider with legitimate access can intentionally modify the files.
    * **Indirect Modification through Vulnerabilities:**
        * **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in CI/CD Pipelines:** Attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in the CI/CD pipeline to inject malicious changes into the repository.
        * **Compromising Dependencies:**  While not directly modifying the `build.nuke`, compromising a dependency that is then pulled in by the build process can have similar effects.
        * **Social Engineering:** Tricking a developer into committing malicious changes.

**Potential Impacts:**

Modifying these configuration files can lead to a wide range of severe consequences:

* **Introduction of Malicious Code:**
    * **Backdoors:** Injecting code that allows for unauthorized remote access.
    * **Malware:** Introducing code that performs malicious actions on the build server, deployed application, or end-user systems.
    * **Data Exfiltration:** Adding tasks to the build process that steal sensitive data.
* **Subversion of the Build Process:**
    * **Skipping Security Checks:** Removing or disabling security-related build steps like static analysis, vulnerability scanning, or unit tests.
    * **Altering Build Output:** Modifying the compiled application to include vulnerabilities or malicious functionality without triggering standard checks.
    * **Introducing Vulnerabilities:**  Changing compilation settings or dependencies to introduce known vulnerabilities.
* **Supply Chain Attack:**
    * **Compromising Artifacts:**  Injecting malicious code into the final build artifacts (executables, libraries, containers) that are then distributed to users.
    * **Distributing Compromised Updates:**  If the build process is responsible for creating and distributing updates, attackers can push malicious updates to users.
* **Denial of Service:**
    * **Infinite Loops or Resource Exhaustion:** Introducing build steps that consume excessive resources or run indefinitely, hindering development and deployment.
    * **Failing Builds:**  Intentionally breaking the build process to disrupt development.
* **Information Disclosure:**
    * **Leaking Secrets:**  Modifying the build process to expose sensitive information like API keys, credentials, or internal configurations.
    * **Exposing Internal Infrastructure:**  Revealing details about the build environment or deployment infrastructure.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

Preventing unauthorized modification of these critical files is paramount. Here are key mitigation strategies:

* **Access Control and Authorization:**
    * **Restrict Write Access:** Implement strict access controls on the repository and build server, limiting write access to only authorized personnel.
    * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Grant permissions based on roles and responsibilities.
    * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for all users with write access to the repository and build server.
* **Version Control System Security:**
    * **Branch Protection:** Implement branch protection rules to require code reviews and prevent direct pushes to critical branches (e.g., `main`, `release`).
    * **Signed Commits:** Encourage or enforce the use of signed commits to verify the identity of the committer.
    * **Regular Audits:** Periodically review repository access logs and permissions.
* **Build Server Security:**
    * **Secure Configuration:** Harden the build server operating system and applications.
    * **Regular Updates and Patching:** Keep the build server software and dependencies up-to-date.
    * **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the build server from other sensitive networks.
    * **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):** Implement IDPS to detect and prevent unauthorized access or malicious activity on the build server.
* **Code Review Process:**
    * **Mandatory Code Reviews:** Require thorough code reviews for all changes to `build.nuke` and related configuration files.
