### Key Attack Surface List: Entity Framework Core (High & Critical)

Here are the key attack surfaces directly involving Entity Framework Core with High or Critical risk severity:

**Attack Surface: SQL Injection via Raw SQL Queries**

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into raw SQL queries executed by the application, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
*   **How EntityFrameworkCore Contributes:**  The use of methods like `context.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw()` and `context.Database.ExecuteSqlInterpolated()` allows developers to execute raw SQL queries. If user-provided input is directly concatenated or interpolated into these strings without proper sanitization or parameterization, it creates an entry point for SQL injection.
*   **Example:**
    ```csharp
    string userInput = GetUserInput(); // Potentially malicious input
    var query = $"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '{userInput}'";
    context.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw(query);
    ```
*   **Impact:** Critical. Successful exploitation can lead to complete database compromise, including data breaches, data manipulation, and denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always use parameterized queries:** Utilize `context.Database.ExecuteSqlInterpolated()` with interpolated strings or `context.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw()` with parameters to ensure user input is treated as data, not executable code.
    *   **Avoid direct string concatenation:** Never directly concatenate user input into SQL query strings.

**Attack Surface: SQL Injection via LINQ Queries with String Interpolation**

*   **Description:** Similar to raw SQL injection, but occurs when string interpolation is used directly within LINQ queries that are then translated to SQL. This bypasses the usual parameterization benefits of LINQ.
*   **How EntityFrameworkCore Contributes:**  EF Core allows the use of string interpolation within methods like `FromSqlInterpolated`, which, if used with unsanitized user input, can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities during query translation.
*   **Example:**
    ```csharp
    string userInput = GetUserInput(); // Potentially malicious input
    var users = context.Users.FromSqlInterpolated($"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '{userInput}'").ToList();
    ```
*   **Impact:** Critical. Similar to raw SQL injection, this can lead to complete database compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use parameterized `FromSql`:**  Utilize the overload of `FromSql` that accepts parameters explicitly, ensuring user input is treated as data.
    *   **Avoid string interpolation in `FromSql`:**  Refrain from using string interpolation directly within `FromSql` calls.

**Attack Surface: Over-eager Loading of Sensitive Data**

*   **Description:**  The application retrieves more data than necessary due to excessive use of eager loading (`.Include()`), potentially exposing sensitive information to unauthorized users.
*   **How EntityFrameworkCore Contributes:**  EF Core's `.Include()` feature allows developers to load related entities along with the primary entity. Overusing this feature without careful consideration of data access controls can lead to the retrieval of sensitive data that the current user is not authorized to view.
*   **Example:**
    ```csharp
    var orders = context.Orders
        .Include(o => o.Customer)
        .Include(o => o.Customer.SensitiveFinancialDetails) // Unnecessary and potentially insecure
        .ToList();
    ```
*   **Impact:** High. Information disclosure of sensitive data can lead to privacy violations, financial loss, and reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use explicit loading or lazy loading:**  Load related data only when needed, either explicitly using `context.Entry(entity).Reference(navigationProperty).Load()` or by enabling lazy loading (with caution regarding performance).
    *   **Project only necessary data:** Utilize `.Select()` to retrieve only the required properties, avoiding the loading of entire related entities with sensitive information.

**Attack Surface: Malicious Database Migrations**

*   **Description:** Attackers with access to the development or deployment pipeline inject malicious database migrations that can alter the database schema in harmful ways.
*   **How EntityFrameworkCore Contributes:**  EF Core's Migrations feature allows developers to evolve the database schema over time. If the migration process is not secured, attackers can introduce migrations that add backdoors, modify data, or disrupt the application's functionality.
*   **Example:** A malicious migration could add a new user with administrative privileges or modify existing data to grant unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** High. Can lead to significant data breaches, data corruption, and complete application compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Code review migrations:**  Thoroughly review all database migrations before applying them to production environments.
    *   **Automated testing of migrations:** Implement automated tests to verify the intended behavior of migrations and detect any unexpected changes.

**Attack Surface: Insecure Connection String Management**

*   **Description:** Database connection strings, which contain sensitive credentials, are stored insecurely, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access.
*   **How EntityFrameworkCore Contributes:** EF Core requires a connection string to connect to the database. If this connection string is stored in plain text in configuration files or code, it becomes a prime target for attackers.
*   **Example:** Storing the connection string directly in `appsettings.json` without encryption.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Compromised connection strings grant attackers direct access to the database.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid storing connection strings directly in code or configuration files:** Utilize secure configuration providers like Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, or environment variables.
    *   **Encrypt connection strings:** If storing connection strings in configuration files is unavoidable, encrypt them using appropriate encryption mechanisms.
