## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE - SQL Injection Vulnerability]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities__critical_node_-_sql_injection_vulnerability_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Description:** This path represents the exploitation of SQL Injection vulnerabilities, which are introduced when user-controlled input is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. Dapper, while a helpful library, does not inherently prevent SQL injection; it depends entirely on how developers use it. If developers construct queries using string concatenation with user input, they create this vulnerability.

*   **Critical Nodes within this Path:**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE - Unparameterized Queries]:** The root cause of direct SQL injection. Occurs when developers fail to use parameterized queries with Dapper and instead build queries by concatenating strings.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE - Malicious SQL Payloads]:** The attacker's weapon. These are crafted SQL code snippets injected into user input fields, designed to manipulate the intended SQL query execution.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE - Basic SQLi Payloads]:** Simple payloads like `' OR '1'='1'` used to bypass authentication or retrieve all data. Easy to implement and often effective against poorly secured applications.
        *   **Advanced SQL Injection Payloads (e.g., UNION, Stored Procedures):** More complex payloads used for data exfiltration across tables (`UNION`), or executing arbitrary database commands (`Stored Procedures`), requiring more database knowledge but offering greater control.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE - Malicious Query Execution]:** The consequence of successful injection. Dapper executes the attacker-modified query against the database.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE - Data Exfiltration]:**  The attacker retrieves sensitive data from the database using `SELECT` statements injected into the query.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE - Data Modification]:** The attacker alters or deletes data in the database using `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statements injected into the query.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Logic Flaws in Query Construction with Dapper [CRITICAL NODE - Logic Flaws in Queries]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_logic_flaws_in_query_construction_with_dapper__critical_node_-_logic_flaws__a3ec0c6a.md)

*   **Attack Vector Description:** This path focuses on exploiting logical weaknesses in the design of SQL queries, even when parameterized queries are used.  These flaws arise from incorrect assumptions in query logic, missing authorization checks within queries, or insufficient filtering.  Attackers can craft valid input that, when processed by the flawed query, leads to unintended data access or modification.

*   **Critical Nodes within this Path:**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE - Parameterization Bypass]:**  Occurs when developers *intend* to use parameterization but make mistakes in implementation, effectively negating its security benefits. This can happen through string concatenation around parameters or incorrect parameter handling.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE - String Concatenation with Params]:** A specific instance of parameterization bypass where developers mistakenly concatenate strings with parameters, re-introducing SQL injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE - Bypass Parameterization Input]:**  The attacker crafts input specifically designed to exploit the parameterization bypass, injecting characters or sequences that break the intended parameter context.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE - Malicious Query Execution (Bypass)]:** Similar to the previous "Malicious Query Execution", but in this case, the malicious query is executed due to the successful parameterization bypass.  The consequences (Data Exfiltration, Data Modification) are the same.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE - Flawed Query Logic]:** The core vulnerability in this path.  The SQL query itself is logically flawed, regardless of parameterization.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE - Logical Vulnerabilities in Queries]:** Specific examples include missing authorization checks within the query (e.g., not checking user permissions before retrieving data) or insufficient filtering (e.g., retrieving more data than intended due to a missing `WHERE` clause condition).
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE - Input to Exploit Logic Flaws]:** The attacker crafts input that is *valid* from a SQL syntax perspective and *parameterized*, but is designed to trigger the logical flaw in the query.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE - Unauthorized Access/Modification (Logic)]:** The result of exploiting the flawed query logic.
            *   **[CRITICAL NODE - Access Unintended Data (Logic)]:** The attacker gains access to data they should not be authorized to see due to the logical flaw in the query.
            *   **[CRITICAL NODE - Modify Unintended Data (Logic)]:** The attacker modifies data they should not be authorized to change due to the logical flaw in the query.
            *   **[CRITICAL NODE - Data Breach (Logic)]:** A data breach occurs due to unauthorized access to sensitive data through logical query exploitation.
            *   **[CRITICAL NODE - Data Modification (Logic)]:** Data integrity is compromised due to unauthorized data modification through logical query exploitation.
