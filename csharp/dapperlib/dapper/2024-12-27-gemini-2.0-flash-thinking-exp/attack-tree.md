## High-Risk Sub-Tree: Compromising Application via Dapper Exploitation

**Attacker's Goal:** To execute arbitrary code or gain unauthorized access to data within the application by exploiting vulnerabilities related to the Dapper library, focusing on the most likely and impactful attack vectors.

**Sub-Tree:**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities via Dapper (Critical Node & High-Risk Path Start):**

* **Attack Vector:** This represents the overarching goal of exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities through the Dapper library. The attacker aims to manipulate SQL queries executed by the application to perform unauthorized actions on the database.
* **Mechanism:** By injecting malicious SQL code into input fields or other data sources that are used to construct database queries executed by Dapper, the attacker can bypass intended logic and execute arbitrary SQL commands.
* **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
    * **Data Breach:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data stored in the database.
    * **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting data, potentially causing significant damage to the application's integrity.
    * **Authentication Bypass:** Circumventing login mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to the application.
    * **Remote Code Execution (in some database configurations):**  Executing arbitrary commands on the database server, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**2. Lack of Parameterization (Critical Node):**

* **Attack Vector:** This is the most fundamental and common SQL injection vulnerability. It occurs when the application directly embeds user-provided data into SQL query strings without proper sanitization or the use of parameterized queries.
* **Mechanism:** The attacker crafts input that contains malicious SQL code. When this input is directly concatenated into the SQL query, the database interprets the malicious code as part of the intended query.
* **Example:**  Consider the following vulnerable code:
   ```csharp
   string query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '" + userInput + "'";
   connection.Query(query); // Using Dapper to execute the vulnerable query
   ```
   An attacker could provide `userInput` as `' OR '1'='1` which would result in the query `SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '' OR '1'='1'`, effectively bypassing the username check and returning all users.
* **Impact:**  Directly leads to SQL injection, with the potential for all the impacts listed under "Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities via Dapper."

**3. Improper Parameter Handling (High-Risk Path Continues):**

* **Attack Vector:** Even when using parameterized queries, vulnerabilities can arise from incorrect implementation or insufficient handling of parameter values.
* **Mechanisms:**
    * **Incorrect Data Type Mapping:** If the application maps user input to an incorrect data type in the database query, it might bypass sanitization or validation checks. For example, passing a string to an integer parameter might not trigger expected validation.
    * **Insufficient Escaping or Sanitization:** While Dapper handles basic parameterization, if the application attempts to perform additional escaping or sanitization incorrectly, it can introduce vulnerabilities or fail to prevent certain types of SQL injection.
    * **Dynamic SQL Construction with Insufficient Safeguards:**  If the application constructs parts of the SQL query dynamically (e.g., table names, column names) and uses user input without proper whitelisting or escaping, it can still be vulnerable to SQL injection, even when parameterizing the data values.
* **Impact:**  Leads to SQL injection, with the potential for all the impacts listed under "Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities via Dapper."

**4. Exploiting Stored Procedures with Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path Continues):**

* **Attack Vector:**  The application uses Dapper to execute stored procedures that themselves contain SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* **Mechanism:** The attacker provides malicious input that is passed as parameters to a vulnerable stored procedure. The stored procedure, if not properly secured, will execute the injected SQL code within its context.
* **Example:** A stored procedure might concatenate input parameters directly into a dynamic SQL query within its body.
* **Impact:**  Depends on the privileges and actions performed by the vulnerable stored procedure. It can lead to:
    * **Data breaches limited to the data accessible by the stored procedure.**
    * **Data manipulation within the scope of the stored procedure.**
    * **Potential for privilege escalation if the stored procedure runs with elevated permissions.**

This focused sub-tree and detailed breakdown highlight the most critical areas of concern when using Dapper. Addressing these vulnerabilities should be the top priority for the development team to secure the application.
