## High and Critical Dapper Threats

This table lists threats with high and critical severity that directly involve the Dapper library.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & How) | Impact | Affected Dapper Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SQL Injection via Dynamic Query Construction** | An attacker manipulates user input that is directly concatenated into SQL queries passed to Dapper methods like `Query` or `Execute`. This allows them to execute arbitrary SQL commands through Dapper. | Data breach (access to sensitive data), data modification or deletion, potential compromise of the underlying database server. | `Query`, `Execute`, `ExecuteScalar`, `ExecuteReader`, and other methods that accept raw SQL strings. | **Critical** | **Always use parameterized queries with Dapper.** Never concatenate user input directly into SQL strings. Utilize Dapper's parameterization features (e.g., `@parameterName`). |
| **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource-Intensive Queries** | An attacker, potentially through SQL injection vulnerabilities facilitated by Dapper's execution of raw SQL, can cause Dapper to execute resource-intensive queries that overload the database, leading to a denial of service for other users. | Service disruption, application unavailability. | `Query`, `Execute`, and the underlying database connection managed by Dapper. | **High** | Prevent SQL injection by always using parameterized queries. Implement query timeouts for database operations executed through Dapper. Monitor database performance and resource usage. |
| **Provider-Specific Vulnerabilities Exposed by Dapper** | Vulnerabilities exist within the specific ADO.NET provider being used by Dapper. Dapper's interaction with the provider to execute queries might expose or amplify these vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to exploit them through Dapper. | Varies depending on the provider vulnerability, potentially leading to data breaches, DoS, or code execution on the database server. | Dapper's interaction layer with the ADO.NET provider (e.g., `IDbConnection`, `IDbCommand`). | **High** | Keep ADO.NET providers updated to the latest versions with security patches. Be aware of known vulnerabilities in the specific provider being used and how Dapper interacts with it. |
