- **Attack Surface:** Direct SQL Injection
    - **Description:**  Occurs when user-provided data is directly embedded into SQL queries executed by Dapper without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    - **How Dapper Contributes:** Dapper provides methods like `ExecuteSql`, `Query`, etc., that directly execute SQL strings. If these strings are constructed by concatenating user input, Dapper facilitates the execution of malicious SQL.
    - **Example:**
        ```csharp
        // Vulnerable code
        var userId = Request.Query["userId"];
        var sql = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Id = " + userId;
        var user = connection.QueryFirstOrDefault<User>(sql);
        ```
    - **Impact:** Complete compromise of the database, including data breaches, data manipulation, and potential execution of arbitrary code on the database server.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Always use parameterized queries with Dapper. Utilize Dapper's support for parameters to pass user input safely.
        - Avoid string concatenation when building SQL queries with user input.
        - Implement input validation and sanitization before using user input in any SQL query, even with parameterization as a defense-in-depth measure.

- **Attack Surface:** Improper Parameterization
    - **Description:**  While using parameters, developers might incorrectly implement them, leading to potential injection vulnerabilities. This can include issues with dynamic parameter names or incorrect handling of parameter values.
    - **How Dapper Contributes:** Dapper relies on the developer to correctly define and pass parameters. Mistakes in this process can negate the security benefits of parameterization.
    - **Example:**
        ```csharp
        // Vulnerable code (incorrect parameter usage)
        var columnName = Request.Query["column"];
        var sql = $"SELECT * FROM Users ORDER BY @column"; // Incorrectly trying to parameterize an identifier
        var users = connection.Query<User>(sql, new { column = columnName });
        ```
    - **Impact:**  Similar to direct SQL injection, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation, or unauthorized access.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Ensure parameter placeholders in the SQL query match the parameter names passed to Dapper.
        - Do not attempt to parameterize SQL keywords, identifiers (table names, column names), or operators. These should be handled through whitelisting or other secure logic.
        - Review and test parameterized queries thoroughly.

- **Attack Surface:** Configuration Issues Leading to Connection String Exposure
    - **Description:**  Dapper relies on the application's configuration to obtain database connection strings. Insecure storage or management of these connection strings can expose them to attackers.
    - **How Dapper Contributes:** Dapper uses the provided `IDbConnection` object, which is typically instantiated using connection strings from configuration. If these strings are compromised, any application using Dapper with that connection is vulnerable.
    - **Example:**
        - Hardcoding connection strings directly in the source code.
        - Storing connection strings in plain text configuration files without proper access controls.
    - **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation, or denial of service.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Store connection strings securely using mechanisms like the Windows Credential Manager, Azure Key Vault, or other secure configuration providers.
        - Encrypt connection strings in configuration files.
        - Restrict access to configuration files containing connection strings.
        - Avoid hardcoding connection strings in the application code.
