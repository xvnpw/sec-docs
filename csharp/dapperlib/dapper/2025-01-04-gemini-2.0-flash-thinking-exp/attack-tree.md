## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromise Application Using Dapper](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_application_using_dapper.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Any successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities outlined below will lead to the compromise of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit SQL Injection via Dapper](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_sql_injection_via_dapper.md)

This node represents the gateway to exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities specifically through the use of the Dapper library. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Insecure Dynamic Query Construction](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_insecure_dynamic_query_construction.md)

This critical node highlights the dangerous practice of building SQL queries dynamically, often by concatenating strings. This practice is the primary enabler of SQL injection vulnerabilities when using Dapper.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit SQL Injection via Dapper -> Insecure Dynamic Query Construction -> String Concatenation of User Input](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_sql_injection_via_dapper_-_insecure_dynamic_query_construction_-_string_conca_c1d0621a.md)

**Attack Vector:** Developers directly embed user-provided input into SQL query strings without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Mechanism:**  An attacker crafts malicious input that, when concatenated into the SQL query, alters the query's intended logic.
*   **Example:** If the code is `connection.Query($"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '{userInput}'")`, an attacker could input `' OR '1'='1` to bypass authentication or `'; DROP TABLE Users; --` to drop the users table.
*   **Impact:**  Complete database compromise, including data exfiltration, data modification, and potential denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit SQL Injection via Dapper -> Insecure Dynamic Query Construction -> Insufficient Sanitization of Input for Dynamic Queries](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_sql_injection_via_dapper_-_insecure_dynamic_query_construction_-_insufficient_f0b359ae.md)

**Attack Vector:** Developers attempt to sanitize user input before embedding it into dynamic SQL queries, but the sanitization is either flawed, incomplete, or can be bypassed.
*   **Mechanism:** Attackers identify weaknesses in the sanitization logic (e.g., filtering specific keywords but not others, incorrect encoding handling) and craft input that bypasses the filters.
*   **Example:**  A filter might block the keyword `DROP`, but an attacker could use `DrOp` or encoded variations to bypass it.
*   **Impact:** Similar to string concatenation, leading to database compromise. The effort might be slightly higher for the attacker to identify and exploit the sanitization flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Improper Handling of Connection Strings](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_improper_handling_of_connection_strings.md)

This critical node signifies vulnerabilities related to how the application manages and protects the database connection strings used by Dapper. If compromised, these strings grant direct access to the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Insecure Configuration or Usage Patterns -> Improper Handling of Connection Strings](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_insecure_configuration_or_usage_patterns_-_improper_handling_of_connection_st_de71deb8.md)

**Attack Vector:** Database connection strings, which contain sensitive information like server address, database name, username, and password, are stored insecurely.
*   **Mechanisms:**
    *   Hardcoding connection strings directly in the application code.
    *   Storing connection strings in easily accessible configuration files without encryption.
    *   Committing connection strings to version control systems.
    *   Storing connection strings in environment variables without proper access controls.
*   **Impact:**  Direct and complete access to the database, bypassing application-level security measures. This allows attackers to perform any database operation, including data exfiltration, modification, and deletion. The effort for the attacker depends on the accessibility of the connection string.
