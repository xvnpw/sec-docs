# Threat Model Analysis for dapperlib/dapper

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Dynamic Query Construction](./threats/sql_injection_via_dynamic_query_construction.md)

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection via Dynamic Query Construction
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate user-supplied input that is directly incorporated into SQL query strings executed by Dapper. This allows the attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially altering the intended query logic. For example, an attacker could add `OR 1=1` to bypass authentication or `DROP TABLE users` to delete data. This threat directly stems from how Dapper can be used to execute raw SQL.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches (accessing unauthorized data), data manipulation (modifying or deleting data), potential for command execution on the database server in severe cases.
    *   **Affected Dapper Component:** `Query` family of methods (e.g., `Query<T>`, `QueryFirstOrDefault<T>`), `Execute` family of methods (e.g., `Execute`, `ExecuteScalar`). Specifically when used with string interpolation or concatenation to build SQL queries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use parameterized queries with Dapper.** This is the primary defense against SQL injection when using Dapper.
        *   **Avoid string concatenation or interpolation of user input directly into SQL query strings passed to Dapper's execution methods.**

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Type Handlers (if used)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_type_handlers__if_used_.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Custom Type Handlers (if used)
    *   **Description:** If developers implement custom type handlers for Dapper to handle specific data types, vulnerabilities in this custom code could be exploited. For example, insecure deserialization within a custom type handler could lead to remote code execution. This threat is directly related to Dapper's extensibility mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the application server, data corruption, denial of service, depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom type handler.
    *   **Affected Dapper Component:** Custom type handlers registered with Dapper.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thoroughly review and test custom type handler code for security vulnerabilities.** Follow secure coding practices, especially regarding deserialization.
        *   Be extremely cautious when deserializing data within custom type handlers. Avoid insecure deserialization patterns.
        *   Keep dependencies used in custom type handlers up-to-date to patch any known vulnerabilities.
