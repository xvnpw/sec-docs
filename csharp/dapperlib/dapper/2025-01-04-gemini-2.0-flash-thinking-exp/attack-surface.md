# Attack Surface Analysis for dapperlib/dapper

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection via Raw SQL Execution](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_via_raw_sql_execution.md)

*   **Description:**  Occurs when the application uses Dapper's `Execute` or `Query` methods to run dynamically constructed SQL queries that include unsanitized user input.
*   **How Dapper Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Dapper provides the functionality to execute raw SQL queries, making it easy for developers to introduce this vulnerability if they don't properly sanitize or parameterize inputs.
*   **Example:**  `connection.Query($"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username = '{userInput}'");` where `userInput` comes directly from a web request.
*   **Impact:**  Attackers can read, modify, or delete sensitive data, bypass authentication, or execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always use parameterized queries:**  Utilize Dapper's parameterization features (e.g., anonymous objects or `DynamicParameters`) to pass user input as parameters, preventing SQL injection.
    *   **Avoid string concatenation for building SQL:**  Do not construct SQL queries by directly concatenating user-provided strings.
    *   **Implement input validation:**  Validate and sanitize user input before using it in database queries, even when using parameterization as a defense-in-depth measure.

## Attack Surface: [Incorrect Parameterization Leading to SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/incorrect_parameterization_leading_to_sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** While using parameterization, developers might make mistakes that still leave the application vulnerable to SQL injection. This could involve parameterizing the wrong parts of the query or using incorrect data types.
*   **How Dapper Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Dapper provides the tools for parameterization, but the responsibility for correct implementation lies with the developer. Incorrect usage negates the security benefits.
*   **Example:** `connection.Query($"SELECT * FROM {tableName} WHERE id = @id", new { id = userId });` where `tableName` is derived from user input and not parameterized.
*   **Impact:** Similar to direct SQL injection, attackers can manipulate queries to access or modify data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thoroughly review database interaction code:** Ensure all user-provided data intended for use in the query is correctly parameterized.
    *   **Use static analysis tools:** Employ tools that can detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities, including cases of incorrect parameterization.
    *   **Prefer ORM features when possible:** If the complexity allows, consider using higher-level ORM features that abstract away more of the SQL construction, reducing the risk of manual parameterization errors.

## Attack Surface: [Potential for Stored Procedure Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/potential_for_stored_procedure_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses Dapper to execute stored procedures with parameters derived from user input, vulnerabilities can arise if these parameters are not properly validated or sanitized before being passed to the stored procedure.
*   **How Dapper Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Dapper provides methods for executing stored procedures and passing parameters.
*   **Example:** `connection.Execute("sp_UpdateUser", new { Name = userName }, commandType: CommandType.StoredProcedure);` where `userName` is directly from user input without validation.
*   **Impact:** Attackers might be able to manipulate the behavior of stored procedures, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions depending on the procedure's logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Validate and sanitize input for stored procedure parameters:** Treat parameters for stored procedures with the same caution as parameters for direct SQL queries.
    *   **Follow the principle of least privilege for stored procedures:** Ensure stored procedures only have the necessary permissions to perform their intended tasks.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities (If Custom Type Handling is Used)](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities__if_custom_type_handling_is_used_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses Dapper's custom type handlers to deserialize data from the database into complex objects, and this deserialization process is not carefully implemented, it could introduce deserialization vulnerabilities.
*   **How Dapper Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Dapper allows for custom type handling, and vulnerabilities can arise in the implementation of these handlers if they process untrusted data unsafely.
*   **Example:** A custom type handler that directly deserializes a string from the database into an object without proper validation, potentially allowing for object injection attacks.
*   **Impact:**  Potentially remote code execution if malicious payloads are deserialized.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Carefully design and review custom type handlers:** Ensure they handle data safely and avoid deserializing untrusted data directly.
    *   **Consider using safer serialization/deserialization methods:** If custom type handling is necessary, explore secure deserialization practices to mitigate risks.
