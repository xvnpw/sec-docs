# Threat Model Analysis for dapperlib/dapper

## Threat: [SQL Injection Vulnerabilities](./threats/sql_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code into queries executed by Dapper if user-provided input is not properly sanitized and parameterized. This could allow the attacker to bypass security measures, access unauthorized data, modify or delete data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server. The attacker might achieve this by manipulating input fields in the application's user interface or by directly crafting malicious requests to the application's endpoints.

**Impact:** Data breach (confidentiality loss), data manipulation (integrity loss), denial of service (availability loss), potential for privilege escalation within the database.

**Affected Dapper Component:** `Query<T>`, `Execute`, `QueryFirstOrDefault<T>`, `ExecuteScalar`, and other methods that execute SQL queries. The vulnerability lies in how the SQL string is constructed *before* being passed to these Dapper methods.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always use parameterized queries: Ensure all user-provided data used in SQL queries is passed as parameters to Dapper methods. This prevents the interpretation of user input as executable SQL code.
*   Avoid string concatenation for building SQL: Do not construct SQL queries by directly concatenating strings with user input.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Dapper relies on other .NET libraries. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities with a high or critical severity, an attacker could potentially exploit them through the application using Dapper. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the ADO.NET provider or other supporting libraries.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. It could range from information disclosure and denial of service to remote code execution.

**Affected Dapper Component:** The entire Dapper library, as it depends on these underlying components.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific dependency vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Dapper and its dependencies up-to-date: Regularly update Dapper and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions to patch known security vulnerabilities.
*   Use dependency scanning tools: Employ tools that scan your project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities and provide alerts for necessary updates.

## Threat: [Potential for ORM Injection (Less Common with Dapper)](./threats/potential_for_orm_injection__less_common_with_dapper_.md)

**Description:** In some more complex ORMs, vulnerabilities can arise from manipulating the ORM's internal query building mechanisms. While Dapper is a micro-ORM with less abstraction, if developers are building highly dynamic queries or using advanced features in unexpected ways, there's a theoretical risk of injecting malicious logic into the query construction process. This is less likely with Dapper's straightforward approach but should still be considered if complex dynamic SQL generation is involved.

**Impact:** Similar to SQL injection, potentially allowing unauthorized data access or manipulation.

**Affected Dapper Component:** Potentially the internal mechanisms Dapper uses to process parameters and construct SQL, especially if custom logic is used to influence this process.

**Risk Severity:** High (in scenarios with complex dynamic query generation)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Stick to Dapper's recommended usage patterns: Primarily rely on parameterized queries and avoid overly complex dynamic query construction within Dapper itself.
*   Carefully review any custom query building logic: If you implement custom logic that interacts with Dapper's query execution, ensure it is thoroughly reviewed for potential injection vulnerabilities.
*   Favor parameterized queries even for dynamic scenarios: Explore ways to use parameterized queries even when dealing with dynamic query requirements.
