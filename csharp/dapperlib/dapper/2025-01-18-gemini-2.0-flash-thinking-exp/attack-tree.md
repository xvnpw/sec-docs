# Attack Tree Analysis for dapperlib/dapper

Objective: Gain unauthorized access to or manipulate application data by exploiting vulnerabilities within the Dapper library.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   Attack Goal: Compromise Application via Dapper Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]
    *   AND Exploit SQL Injection via Dapper [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]
        *   OR Improper Use of String Interpolation [HIGH RISK PATH]
        *   OR Dynamic Query Construction Flaws [HIGH RISK PATH]
    *   AND Exploit Information Disclosure via Dapper Errors [HIGH RISK PATH]
        *   OR Verbose Error Messages [HIGH RISK PATH]
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Attack Goal: Compromise Application via Dapper Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/attack_goal_compromise_application_via_dapper_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate objective of the attacker, representing a successful breach of the application's security through vulnerabilities related to the Dapper library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SQL Injection via Dapper [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sql_injection_via_dapper__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

Even though Dapper is designed to prevent SQL injection through parameterized queries, developers can still introduce vulnerabilities if they don't use it correctly.

## Attack Tree Path: [Improper Use of String Interpolation [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/improper_use_of_string_interpolation__high_risk_path_.md)

The most direct way to bypass Dapper's protection is by constructing SQL queries using string concatenation or interpolation instead of using parameters. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dynamic Query Construction Flaws [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/dynamic_query_construction_flaws__high_risk_path_.md)

If the application builds SQL queries dynamically based on user input (e.g., adding `WHERE` clauses based on search criteria) without proper sanitization, attackers can manipulate the input to inject malicious SQL.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Information Disclosure via Dapper Errors [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_information_disclosure_via_dapper_errors__high_risk_path_.md)

Dapper, like any database interaction library, can throw exceptions when errors occur.

## Attack Tree Path: [Verbose Error Messages [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/verbose_error_messages__high_risk_path_.md)

If the application doesn't handle these exceptions properly and exposes raw error messages to the user, these messages might contain sensitive information about the database schema, data, or internal application logic, which an attacker can use to further their attack.
