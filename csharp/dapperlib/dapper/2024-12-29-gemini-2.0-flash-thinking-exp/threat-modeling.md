### High and Critical Dapper Threats (Directly Involved)

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the Dapper library:

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection via Dynamic Query Construction
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate user-provided input that is directly incorporated into a dynamically constructed SQL query executed by Dapper. This allows them to inject arbitrary SQL commands into the query. For example, if user input for a `WHERE` clause is concatenated directly into the SQL string, an attacker could inject `'; DROP TABLE Users; --` to potentially drop the `Users` table.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion; potential command execution on the database server leading to complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Dapper Component:** `Query`, `Execute`, `QueryFirstOrDefault`, `ExecuteScalar` methods when used with dynamically constructed SQL strings.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use parameterized queries:** Utilize Dapper's support for parameters by passing user input as parameters instead of concatenating them into the SQL string.

*   **Threat:** Incorrect Parameterization Leading to Unexpected Behavior
    *   **Description:** An attacker might exploit scenarios where parameters are used incorrectly, such as using the wrong data type for a parameter or mismatching parameter names between the SQL query and the parameters passed to Dapper. This could lead to unexpected query results or, in some cases, bypass intended security logic. For instance, if a parameter intended for an integer is passed as a string without proper type checking, it might lead to unexpected comparisons or errors.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, retrieval of incorrect data, potential for bypassing intended access controls.
    *   **Affected Dapper Component:** `Query`, `Execute`, `QueryFirstOrDefault`, `ExecuteScalar` methods when parameters are used incorrectly.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Careful parameter mapping:** Ensure that parameter names and data types in the SQL query match the parameters passed to Dapper.
        *   **Thorough testing:**  Test queries with various input values, including edge cases and potentially malicious inputs, to verify correct parameter handling.
