## Threat Model: Compromising Application Using Dapper - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Objective:** Attacker's Goal: To gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or execute arbitrary code on the application's database by exploiting weaknesses in how the application utilizes the Dapper library.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application via Dapper Exploitation
    * *** Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities ***
        * Identify Input Points Interacting with Dapper
            * Analyze Code for Dapper Query Execution
            * Identify User-Controlled Input Passed to Dapper
        * [CRITICAL] Craft Malicious SQL Payloads
            * Inject SQL into Parameter Values (if improperly handled)
            * *** Inject SQL into Dynamic SQL Constructs (if used with Dapper) *** [CRITICAL]
                * Identify Instances of String Interpolation in Dapper Queries
    * *** Exploit Insecure Coding Practices with Dapper ***
        * *** Abuse of Dynamic SQL Generation *** [CRITICAL]
            * Identify Areas Where Dynamic SQL is Constructed Before Passing to Dapper

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Path: Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities**

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to inject malicious SQL code into database queries executed by Dapper. This allows them to bypass normal security controls and interact with the database in unintended ways.
* **How it works:**
    * **Identify Input Points:** Attackers first identify where user-provided data is used in Dapper queries. This involves analyzing the application's code and understanding data flow.
    * **Craft Malicious SQL Payloads:**  Attackers then craft SQL code designed to perform unauthorized actions, such as retrieving sensitive data, modifying data, or even executing arbitrary database commands.
    * **Inject SQL into Parameter Values (if improperly handled):** While Dapper's parameterization is a defense, developers might make mistakes like using parameters for table or column names, or attempting manual sanitization, which can be exploited.
    * **Inject SQL into Dynamic SQL Constructs (if used with Dapper):**  If developers construct SQL queries using string concatenation or interpolation before passing them to Dapper, this bypasses Dapper's parameterization and allows direct SQL injection.

**Critical Node: Craft Malicious SQL Payloads**

* **Attack Vector:** This is the central point of a SQL injection attack. The attacker's ability to create and inject effective malicious SQL is crucial for compromising the database.
* **How it works:**  Attackers leverage their understanding of SQL syntax and database structure to create payloads that achieve their objectives. This might involve using `UNION` clauses to retrieve data from other tables, `OR 1=1` conditions to bypass authentication, or stored procedures for more complex attacks.

**High-Risk Path: Inject SQL into Dynamic SQL Constructs (if used with Dapper)**

* **Attack Vector:** This specifically targets the dangerous practice of building SQL queries dynamically using string manipulation before using Dapper.
* **How it works:**
    * **Identify Instances of String Interpolation in Dapper Queries:** Attackers look for code where user input is directly inserted into SQL strings using techniques like string interpolation or concatenation before the query is passed to Dapper's methods.
    * **Inject SQL:** Once such instances are found, attackers can inject malicious SQL code within the user-controlled parts of the dynamically constructed SQL string.

**Critical Node: Inject SQL into Dynamic SQL Constructs (if used with Dapper)**

* **Attack Vector:** This node represents the successful exploitation of dynamic SQL usage with Dapper, leading directly to SQL injection.
* **How it works:** By injecting malicious code into the dynamically built SQL string, the attacker manipulates the final query executed against the database, bypassing Dapper's intended security mechanisms.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Insecure Coding Practices with Dapper**

* **Attack Vector:** This path encompasses vulnerabilities arising from developers not using Dapper securely, primarily focusing on the misuse of dynamic SQL.
* **How it works:** Developers might choose to build SQL queries dynamically for perceived flexibility or convenience, unknowingly introducing significant security risks. This bypasses the protection offered by Dapper's parameterization.

**Critical Node: Abuse of Dynamic SQL Generation**

* **Attack Vector:** This node highlights the core insecure practice of generating SQL queries dynamically before using Dapper.
* **How it works:**  Instead of relying on Dapper's parameterized queries, developers construct SQL strings by concatenating or interpolating user input directly into the SQL code. This makes the application vulnerable to SQL injection because the user input is treated as executable code by the database.
* **Identify Areas Where Dynamic SQL is Constructed Before Passing to Dapper:** Attackers analyze the codebase to find instances where SQL queries are built using string manipulation before being passed to Dapper's `Query`, `Execute`, or similar methods.
