Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces that directly involve Dapper, focusing on high and critical severity:

* **Attack Surface:** SQL Injection via Improper Parameterization
    * **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into queries due to developers directly concatenating user input into SQL strings instead of using parameterized queries.
    * **How Dapper Contributes:** Dapper provides methods like `Execute` and `Query` that can be used with raw SQL strings. If developers don't utilize parameterization correctly with these methods, it creates an opening for SQL injection.
    * **Example:**
        ```csharp
        // Vulnerable code
        string userInput = GetUserInput();
        var sql = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '" + userInput + "'";
        connection.Query(sql);

        // Secure code
        string userInput = GetUserInput();
        var sql = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = @Username";
        connection.Query(sql, new { Username = userInput });
        ```
    * **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data, data modification or deletion, potential execution of arbitrary commands on the database server.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Always use parameterized queries with Dapper.**  This is the primary defense against SQL injection.
        * **Avoid string concatenation when building SQL queries with user input.**
        * **Implement input validation and sanitization** as a secondary defense, but never rely on it as the primary protection against SQL injection.
