Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve AutoMapper:

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected AutoMapper Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Configuration Injection/Manipulation** | An attacker gains unauthorized access to the application's AutoMapper configuration (e.g., through file system access, environment variables, or a vulnerable configuration endpoint). They modify the configuration to map sensitive data to unintended destinations or inject malicious data during the mapping process. | Data breach, data corruption, application malfunction, potential for further exploitation if injected data is used in subsequent operations. | `MapperConfiguration`, `Profile` classes, configuration loading mechanisms. | **High** | Secure storage and access control for configuration files and data. Avoid loading configuration from untrusted sources. Implement integrity checks for configuration files. Avoid dynamic configuration based on user input. |
| **Malicious Custom Value Resolver/Type Converter** | An attacker injects or modifies a custom value resolver or type converter within the AutoMapper configuration. This malicious code is executed during the mapping process, allowing the attacker to perform arbitrary actions, such as logging sensitive data, executing commands, or modifying data in transit. | Data breach, remote code execution, data manipulation, denial of service. | Custom `IValueResolver` implementations, custom `ITypeConverter` implementations, `ForMember()` configuration using custom resolvers/converters. | **Critical** | Thoroughly review and test all custom value resolvers and type converters. Implement strict code review processes for these components. Avoid using external libraries or services within resolvers/converters without careful vetting. Implement input validation within resolvers/converters. Consider sandboxing or limiting the capabilities of custom code. |
| **Over-Mapping of Sensitive Data** | An attacker exploits a misconfiguration or oversight in the mapping definitions where sensitive properties from the source object are inadvertently mapped to the destination object, even when they are not intended to be exposed. This can lead to the disclosure of confidential information if the destination object is later serialized, logged, or transmitted. | Data breach, privacy violations, compliance issues. | `CreateMap()`, `ForMember()` configurations, default mapping behavior. | **High** | Explicitly configure mappings to ignore sensitive properties using `Ignore()`. Use `ForMember()` with conditional logic to prevent mapping sensitive data based on context. Regularly review mapping configurations to ensure they align with security requirements. Design DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) that only contain necessary data. |
| **Type Conversion Exploits in Custom Converters** | An attacker provides input data that, when processed by a custom type converter, triggers a vulnerability within the converter's logic. This could lead to unexpected behavior, errors, or even code execution if the converter is not implemented securely. | Data corruption, application errors, potential for code execution (depending on the vulnerability in the converter). | Custom `ITypeConverter` implementations, `ConvertUsing()` configuration. | **High** | Implement thorough input validation and sanitization within custom type converters. Follow secure coding practices. Avoid performing complex or potentially dangerous operations within type converters. Consider using well-tested and vetted third-party libraries for common type conversions. |
| **Vulnerable Dependencies in Custom Components** | If custom value resolvers or type converters rely on external libraries with known vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities through the AutoMapper component. | Remote code execution, data breach, denial of service (depending on the vulnerability in the dependency). | Custom `IValueResolver` and `ITypeConverter` implementations and their dependencies. | **High** (can be critical depending on the dependency) | Regularly update all dependencies used in custom resolvers and converters. Perform security scans on dependencies. Follow secure coding practices when integrating with external libraries. |
