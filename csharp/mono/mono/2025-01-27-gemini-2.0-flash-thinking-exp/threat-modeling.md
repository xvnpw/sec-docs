# Threat Model Analysis for mono/mono

## Threat: [Mono JIT Compiler Exploit](./threats/mono_jit_compiler_exploit.md)

Description: An attacker crafts malicious CIL bytecode to exploit a vulnerability in the Mono JIT compiler. Upon compilation, this leads to arbitrary code execution on the server, granting the attacker full system control.
Impact: Critical. Arbitrary code execution, full system compromise, data breach, denial of service.
Affected Mono Component: JIT Compiler
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Immediately update Mono to the latest stable version.
    * Implement robust input validation for code execution paths.
    * Consider Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation to reduce JIT usage.

## Threat: [Mono Memory Corruption Vulnerability](./threats/mono_memory_corruption_vulnerability.md)

Description: A flaw in Mono's memory management (garbage collector, allocator) is triggered, leading to memory corruption (buffer overflow, use-after-free). This can be exploited for arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
Impact: Critical. Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, potential data corruption.
Affected Mono Component: Garbage Collector, Memory Allocator, Core Runtime Libraries
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Immediately update Mono to the latest stable version.
    * Report any suspected memory issues to the Mono project.

## Threat: [Platform-Specific Path Traversal via Mono Inconsistency](./threats/platform-specific_path_traversal_via_mono_inconsistency.md)

Description: Mono's inconsistent path handling across operating systems (Linux vs. Windows) allows attackers to bypass path traversal protections. Exploiting these differences can lead to unauthorized file access.
Impact: High. Unauthorized file access, information disclosure, potential data modification.
Affected Mono Component: File System APIs, Core Libraries, Platform Abstraction Layer
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Thoroughly test on all target platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows).
    * Use platform-agnostic path handling methods.
    * Avoid platform-specific path assumptions.
    * Implement strict input validation for file paths.

## Threat: [P/Invoke to Vulnerable Native Library](./threats/pinvoke_to_vulnerable_native_library.md)

Description: The application uses P/Invoke to call a vulnerable native library. Exploiting vulnerabilities in the native library via P/Invoke calls can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
Impact: High. Arbitrary code execution, denial of service (depending on native library vulnerability).
Affected Mono Component: P/Invoke Interoperability Layer
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Minimize P/Invoke usage.
    * Thoroughly audit native libraries for vulnerabilities.
    * Keep native libraries updated.
    * Implement strict input validation at P/Invoke boundaries.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Mono Dependency](./threats/vulnerable_mono_dependency.md)

Description: Mono relies on vulnerable third-party libraries. Exploiting these vulnerabilities indirectly through Mono can compromise applications.
Impact: High. Denial of service, information disclosure, potential code execution (depending on dependency vulnerability).
Affected Mono Component: Various Mono Modules and Libraries (Networking, Cryptography, etc.)
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Keep Mono and its dependencies updated.
    * Monitor security advisories for Mono dependencies.
    * Use dependency scanning tools.

## Threat: [Outdated Mono Version - Unpatched Vulnerabilities](./threats/outdated_mono_version_-_unpatched_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: Running applications on outdated Mono versions with known, unpatched security vulnerabilities allows attackers to exploit these publicly known flaws.
Impact: High to Critical. Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, information disclosure (depending on vulnerability).
Affected Mono Component: Entire Mono Runtime
Risk Severity: High to Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Maintain a regular patching schedule for Mono.
    * Promptly upgrade to the latest stable Mono versions.
    * Implement a vulnerability management process for Mono.
