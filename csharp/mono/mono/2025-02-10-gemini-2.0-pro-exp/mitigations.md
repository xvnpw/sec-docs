# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mono/mono

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Mono Runtime Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_mono_runtime_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a Monitoring Process:** Set up automated alerts (e.g., using RSS feeds, email subscriptions, or dependency management tools) to notify the development team of new Mono releases and security advisories.  The Mono project website and GitHub repository are key sources.
    2.  **Define an Update Schedule:** Create a formal schedule for reviewing and applying Mono updates.  This could be monthly, quarterly, or triggered by critical security advisories.  The schedule should balance security needs with the potential for disruption.
    3.  **Testing Procedure:** Before deploying an update to production, thoroughly test the application with the new Mono runtime in a staging environment.  This testing should include:
        *   **Functional Testing:** Verify that all application features work as expected.
        *   **Performance Testing:** Ensure that the update hasn't introduced performance regressions.
        *   **Security Testing:** Repeat relevant security tests (e.g., penetration tests, vulnerability scans) to confirm that the update hasn't introduced new vulnerabilities.
    4.  **Rollback Plan:** Have a documented plan for rolling back to the previous Mono version if the update causes unexpected issues.
    5.  **Automated Deployment (if possible):**  Use infrastructure-as-code and automated deployment pipelines to streamline the update process and reduce the risk of manual errors.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Severity: Critical):** Exploits targeting vulnerabilities in the Mono runtime (JIT compiler, garbage collector, core libraries) could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Denial of Service (Severity: High):** Vulnerabilities could be exploited to crash the Mono runtime or the application, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: High/Medium):**  Some vulnerabilities might allow attackers to access sensitive data handled by the Mono runtime or the application.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** If the application runs with elevated privileges, a runtime vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain those privileges.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Risk reduction: Very High.  Regular updates are the *primary* defense against this.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Risk reduction: High.  Updates address many DoS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduction: Medium to High.  Depends on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduction: High. Updates are crucial for preventing privilege escalation through runtime exploits.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially.  We have a manual process for checking for updates, but it's not automated.  Testing is performed, but not comprehensively.  We have a basic rollback plan.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated monitoring of Mono releases and security advisories.
    *   A formal, documented update schedule.
    *   Comprehensive security testing as part of the update process.
    *   Automated deployment of Mono updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Runtime Configuration Hardening](./mitigation_strategies/runtime_configuration_hardening.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Unnecessary Features:** Analyze the application's code and functionality to determine which Mono runtime features are *not* required.  This might include:
        *   Debugging support (in production).
        *   Remoting capabilities.
        *   Specific JIT optimizations.
        *   Unused .NET Framework compatibility features.
    2.  **Configure Runtime Flags:** Use Mono's command-line options or configuration files (e.g., `mono-config`) to disable the identified unnecessary features.  Consult the Mono documentation for the specific flags and their effects.  Examples:
        *   `--debug-` (disable debugging)
        *   `--optimize=-all` (disable all optimizations - use with extreme caution and thorough testing)
        *   Specific flags to disable remoting, if not used.
    3.  **AOT Compilation (if applicable):** If the application's deployment model allows, investigate using Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation.  This compiles the code to native code before deployment, reducing the attack surface related to the JIT compiler.  This requires careful evaluation of platform support and potential limitations.
    4.  **Security Manager (if applicable):** If the application runs in a context where a Security Manager is appropriate (e.g., a sandboxed environment), configure it to restrict the permissions granted to the Mono runtime and the application code.  This involves defining a security policy that limits access to resources like files, network connections, and system properties.
    5. **Test Thoroughly:** After making any configuration changes, thoroughly test the application to ensure that it functions correctly and that the security restrictions are effective.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Severity: Critical):**  Reduces the attack surface by disabling potential entry points for exploits.  AOT compilation significantly reduces JIT-related risks.
    *   **Denial of Service (Severity: High):**  Disabling unnecessary features can reduce the likelihood of DoS attacks targeting those features.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium):**  The Security Manager can help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** The Security Manager can limit the privileges of the application, reducing the impact of a successful exploit.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Risk reduction: Medium to High (depending on the features disabled and the use of AOT).
    *   **Denial of Service:** Risk reduction: Medium.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduction: Medium (primarily through the Security Manager).
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduction: High (primarily through the Security Manager).

*   **Currently Implemented:**  Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Analysis of unnecessary Mono features.
    *   Configuration of runtime flags to disable those features.
    *   Evaluation and potential implementation of AOT compilation.
    *   Evaluation and potential implementation of a Security Manager.
