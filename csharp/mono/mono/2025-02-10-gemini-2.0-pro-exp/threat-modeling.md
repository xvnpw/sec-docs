# Threat Model Analysis for mono/mono

## Threat: [JIT Compiler Code Injection](./threats/jit_compiler_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious .NET Intermediate Language (IL) code or tampers with existing assemblies. When the Mono JIT compiler processes this code, it's tricked into generating and executing native code of the attacker's choosing. This could involve exploiting a buffer overflow or logic flaw within the JIT compiler itself, or leveraging vulnerabilities in libraries that dynamically generate IL. The key here is a vulnerability *within* Mono's JIT.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker gains arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the application.
    *   **Affected Mono Component:** `mono` runtime executable, JIT compiler (`mini` component within Mono), `System.Reflection.Emit` namespace (if *Mono's implementation* has vulnerabilities when used for dynamic IL generation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Update Mono:** Regularly update to the latest stable Mono release. This is the *primary* defense against JIT vulnerabilities.
        *   **Assembly Signing:** Strongly name and digitally sign all assemblies. Verify signatures.
        *   **Secure Code Signing:** Use a secure code signing process.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run the application with minimal permissions.
        *   **AOT Compilation:** Use AOT compilation where possible.
        *   **Audit Dynamic IL:** Carefully review and audit any code that uses `System.Reflection.Emit` or similar.
        *   **Input Validation:** If accepting user-provided data that influences IL generation (highly unusual), implement extremely strict input validation.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Consider sandboxing untrusted code.

## Threat: [JIT Compiler Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/jit_compiler_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted input designed to exploit weaknesses *in Mono's JIT compiler*, causing it to consume excessive CPU or memory, leading to a denial of service. This is distinct from general resource exhaustion; it targets specific JIT bugs or inefficiencies.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability.
    *   **Affected Mono Component:** `mono` runtime executable, JIT compiler (`mini` component).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Resource Limits:** Configure resource limits for the Mono runtime.
        *   **JIT Monitoring:** Monitor JIT compilation performance.
        *   **AOT Compilation:** Use AOT compilation where feasible.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting.
        *   **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate input that influences JIT compilation.
        *   **Timeout Mechanisms:** Implement timeouts for JIT operations.
        *   **Update Mono:** Regularly update Mono to the latest version.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization (Mono-Specific)](./threats/insecure_deserialization__mono-specific_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides malicious serialized data. *Due to vulnerabilities specifically within Mono's implementation* of deserialization routines (e.g., a bug in Mono's `BinaryFormatter` that isn't present in other .NET implementations), the attacker achieves arbitrary code execution. This is *not* just the general risk of insecure deserialization, but a Mono-specific flaw.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data modification, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Mono Component:** `mscorlib.dll` (core library), `System.Runtime.Serialization` namespace, specific formatters like `System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter` (Mono's implementation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Dangerous Formatters:** *Strongly* avoid `BinaryFormatter` and `SoapFormatter`.
        *   **Use Safer Formats:** Prefer JSON, XML (with security settings), or Protocol Buffers.
        *   **Type Filtering (if BinaryFormatter is unavoidable):** Implement a strict `SerializationBinder` or `TypeFilter`.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate *all* deserialized data.
        *   **Keep Mono Updated:** Apply security patches for Mono promptly. This is crucial for addressing Mono-specific implementation flaws.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run with minimal permissions.

## Threat: [Cryptographic Weakness (Mono Implementation)](./threats/cryptographic_weakness__mono_implementation_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits weaknesses *specifically within Mono's implementation* of cryptographic algorithms or APIs. This could be a bug in Mono's `RNGCryptoServiceProvider`, a flawed implementation of AES, or a side-channel vulnerability unique to Mono's code.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of confidentiality, integrity, or authenticity.
    *   **Affected Mono Component:** `mscorlib.dll`, `System.Security.Cryptography` namespace, specific cryptographic classes (Mono's implementations).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use High-Level APIs:** Prefer high-level cryptographic APIs.
        *   **Vetted Libraries:** Use well-vetted libraries.
        *   **Keep Mono Updated:** Apply security patches promptly. This is critical for addressing implementation flaws.
        *   **Cryptographic Testing:** Thoroughly test cryptographic functionality.
        *   **Platform-Specific Libraries (with caution):** Consider using platform-specific libraries via P/Invoke (with careful security considerations).
        *   **Avoid obsolete algorithms:** Use only modern and secure cryptographic algorithms.

## Threat: [P/Invoke Vulnerability Exploitation *due to Mono Marshalling Bugs*](./threats/pinvoke_vulnerability_exploitation_due_to_mono_marshalling_bugs.md)

* **Description:** While P/Invoke vulnerabilities are often in the *native* libraries, this threat focuses on vulnerabilities *within Mono's P/Invoke marshalling layer itself*.  If Mono has bugs in how it marshals data between managed and unmanaged code, an attacker could exploit this *even if the native library is secure*. This is a subtle but important distinction.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data corruption, denial of service.
    * **Affected Mono Component:** `mono` runtime (P/Invoke marshalling logic), `DllImportAttribute`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Mono Updated:**  The *primary* mitigation is to keep Mono updated, as this addresses bugs in the marshalling layer.
        *   **Native Library Auditing:**  (Still important, even though the core vulnerability is in Mono).
        *   **Input Validation (P/Invoke):** Rigorously validate all data passed to native functions.
        *   **Secure DLL Loading:** Use secure DLL loading practices.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run with minimal permissions.
        *   **Memory Safety:** If possible, use native libraries in memory-safe languages.
        *   **Cross-Platform Testing:** Test P/Invoke calls thoroughly on all platforms.
        *   **Wrapper Functions:** Consider managed code wrappers.
