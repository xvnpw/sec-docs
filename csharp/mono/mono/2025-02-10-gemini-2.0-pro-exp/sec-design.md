Okay, let's create a design document for the "mono/mono" repository, focusing on aspects relevant to threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a cross-platform .NET runtime and framework implementation.
*   Enable developers to build and run .NET applications on various operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows, etc.).
*   Maintain compatibility with the .NET Standard and, where feasible, with existing .NET Framework applications.
*   Offer a viable alternative to the official .NET runtime for specific use cases (e.g., embedded systems, mobile development via Xamarin/MAUI).
*   Foster an open-source community around the project.
*   Provide long-term support and maintenance for the runtime.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Security vulnerabilities in the runtime that could lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.  This is the highest risk, as it directly impacts the users of Mono and applications built upon it.
*   Incompatibility with newer .NET features or breaking changes in the .NET ecosystem, rendering Mono less useful or requiring significant rework.
*   Loss of community support and contributions, leading to stagnation and eventual obsolescence.
*   Legal challenges related to intellectual property (though this risk has likely been mitigated over time).
*   Performance issues or instability compared to the official .NET runtime, hindering adoption.
*   Lack of support for critical platforms or architectures.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Code reviews: The project is open-source, allowing for community scrutiny and peer review of code changes. Implemented in GitHub pull requests.
*   security control: Static analysis: Likely used, though the specific tools and frequency aren't explicitly stated in the top-level repository. Implemented in build scripts and CI pipelines.
*   security control: Fuzzing: Some fuzzing efforts are mentioned in the documentation and issue tracker. Implemented in dedicated fuzzing projects and CI.
*   security control: Issue tracking: A public issue tracker allows for reporting and tracking of security vulnerabilities. Implemented in GitHub Issues.
*   security control: Security advisories: The project publishes security advisories for discovered vulnerabilities. Implemented in GitHub Security Advisories.
*   security control: Sandboxing (partial): Certain components, like the runtime's garbage collector, have inherent security boundaries. Implemented in runtime code.
*   security control: Regular Updates: New releases are published that include security fixes. Implemented in release process.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Legacy code: The codebase has a long history, and some parts may not adhere to modern security best practices.
*   accepted risk: Third-party dependencies: Mono relies on external libraries, which may introduce their own vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Platform-specific vulnerabilities: The security of Mono also depends on the underlying operating system and its security mechanisms.
*   accepted risk: Limited resources: As an open-source project, Mono may have limited resources for dedicated security audits and penetration testing.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement a comprehensive Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) management system to track all dependencies and their versions.
*   Integrate regular dynamic analysis (DAST) into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   Establish a bug bounty program to incentivize external security researchers.
*   Conduct regular penetration testing by independent security experts.
*   Implement more robust sandboxing mechanisms for untrusted code execution.
*   Adopt a "secure by default" configuration approach.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   The runtime itself doesn't directly handle user authentication. This is typically managed by the application using Mono. However, Mono should securely handle any credentials or tokens passed to it by the application.
*   Authorization:
    *   Similar to authentication, authorization is primarily the application's responsibility.  Mono should provide secure mechanisms for applications to implement authorization checks (e.g., role-based access control).
*   Input Validation:
    *   Mono's runtime and libraries must perform rigorous input validation to prevent vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, format string bugs, and injection attacks. This is crucial for all APIs exposed by the runtime.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Mono provides cryptographic libraries (System.Security.Cryptography). These libraries must be implemented correctly and use strong, up-to-date algorithms.  Regular audits of the cryptographic code are essential.  Key management should be handled securely, following best practices.

4.  Containerized deployment: Mono is deployed within a container (e.g., Docker) along with the application.
5.  Embedded deployment: Mono is embedded within a larger application or device.

Chosen Solution (for detailed description): Containerized Deployment (Docker)

```
Build Process Description:

1.  Developers commit code changes to the Git repository (GitHub).
2.  A webhook triggers the CI system (e.g., GitHub Actions).
3.  The CI system executes a build script.
4.  The build script uses build tools (make, msbuild, etc.) to compile the source code, link dependencies, run tests, and package the build artifacts.
5.  Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are run as part of the CI pipeline to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
6.  Dependency check tools are used to scan for known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
7.  The build artifacts (e.g., .tar.gz, .zip, NuGet packages) are created.
8.  The build artifacts are uploaded to an artifact repository.

Security Controls:

*   security control: Secure coding practices: Developers should follow secure coding guidelines to prevent vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Code reviews: All code changes should be reviewed by other developers before being merged.
*   security control: Static analysis (SAST): SAST tools should be integrated into the CI pipeline to automatically scan for vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Dependency management: Dependencies should be carefully managed and scanned for known vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Build automation: The build process should be fully automated to ensure consistency and reproducibility.
*   security control: Secure build environment: The CI system should be configured securely to prevent unauthorized access.
*   security control: Artifact signing: Build artifacts should be digitally signed to ensure their integrity.
*   security control: Supply chain security: Measures should be in place to prevent tampering with the build process or dependencies.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Execution of .NET applications: The primary function of Mono is to run .NET applications reliably and securely.
*   Development of .NET applications: Mono provides the tools and libraries needed to develop .NET applications for various platforms.
*   Maintenance and support of the Mono runtime: Ensuring the long-term viability and security of the project.

Data Sensitivity:

*   Application data: Mono itself doesn't inherently handle sensitive data. The sensitivity of the data depends on the applications running on Mono.  However, vulnerabilities in Mono could expose this data.
*   Source code: The Mono source code is publicly available, so it's not considered sensitive in terms of confidentiality. However, its integrity is crucial.
*   Build artifacts: Build artifacts are not inherently sensitive, but their integrity is critical.
*   Configuration data: Configuration files used by Mono or applications running on it may contain sensitive information (e.g., connection strings, API keys).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific SAST and dependency check tools are currently used in the Mono build process?
*   What is the frequency of security audits and penetration testing?

*   The project uses some form of automated build system.
*   Developers are aware of basic secure coding principles.
*   The project has a process for handling security vulnerabilities.
