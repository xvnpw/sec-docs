## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Mono Runtime Vulnerabilities -> Deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_mono_runtime_vulnerabilities_-_deserialization.md)

*   **Likelihood: High:** Deserialization vulnerabilities are prevalent in many applications that handle serialized data from untrusted sources.
*   **Impact: High:** Successful exploitation almost always leads to RCE.
*   **Effort: Low:** Publicly available exploits and tools make this relatively easy to exploit if the vulnerability exists.
*   **Skill: Medium:** Requires understanding of serialization formats and how to craft malicious payloads, but many resources are available.
*   **Detection Difficulty: Medium:** Can be detected with proper input validation, monitoring of deserialization processes, and intrusion detection systems, but attackers can try to obfuscate their payloads.

## Attack Tree Path: [[9] Exploit insecure deserialization of untrusted data using BinaryFormatter or other serializers](./attack_tree_paths/_9__exploit_insecure_deserialization_of_untrusted_data_using_binaryformatter_or_other_serializers.md)

*   **Description:**  The `BinaryFormatter` in .NET (and Mono's implementation) is known to be unsafe when used with untrusted data. Attackers can craft malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code within the context of the application.  Other serializers can also be vulnerable if not used carefully.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Avoid `BinaryFormatter` with untrusted data.**  Use safer alternatives like JSON.NET with `TypeNameHandling` set to `None` (or a very restrictive whitelist).
    *   **Implement strong input validation *before* deserialization.**  Check the type and structure of the data before attempting to deserialize it.
    *   **Use a `SerializationBinder` to restrict the types that can be deserialized.**
    *   **Run the application with least privilege.**

## Attack Tree Path: [[10] Exploit vulnerabilities in custom deserialization logic](./attack_tree_paths/_10__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_custom_deserialization_logic.md)

*   **Description:** Even if the application avoids standard serializers, custom deserialization code can introduce vulnerabilities if not implemented carefully.  Attackers might be able to inject unexpected data types or trigger unintended code execution.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Thoroughly review and test any custom deserialization logic.**
    *   **Apply the principle of least privilege.**
    *   **Consider using a well-vetted serialization library instead of rolling your own.**

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Mono's Interoperability Features -> P/Invoke Abuse](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_mono's_interoperability_features_-_pinvoke_abuse.md)

*   **Likelihood: High:** P/Invoke is a common source of errors due to the complexity of interacting with native code.
*   **Impact: High:**  Successful exploitation can lead to memory corruption and RCE.
*   **Effort: Medium:** Requires understanding of both managed and unmanaged code, but many examples and tools are available.
*   **Skill: High:** Requires a good understanding of C/C++, memory management, and calling conventions.
*   **Detection Difficulty: Medium:** Can be detected through code analysis, memory analysis, and monitoring of system calls.

## Attack Tree Path: [[13] Incorrectly defined P/Invoke signatures leading to memory corruption](./attack_tree_paths/_13__incorrectly_defined_pinvoke_signatures_leading_to_memory_corruption.md)

*   **Description:**  If the C# signature of a native function (declared using `DllImport`) does not exactly match the actual function signature in the native library, memory corruption can occur.  This can happen due to incorrect data types, calling conventions, or parameter sizes.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Use tools like `PInvoke Interop Assistant` to generate correct P/Invoke signatures.**
    *   **Carefully review and test all P/Invoke declarations.**
    *   **Use managed wrappers for native libraries whenever possible.**

## Attack Tree Path: [[14] Passing attacker-controlled data to vulnerable native functions via P/Invoke](./attack_tree_paths/_14__passing_attacker-controlled_data_to_vulnerable_native_functions_via_pinvoke.md)

*   **Description:** Even if the P/Invoke signature is correct, the native function itself might have vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, format string bugs).  If the application passes attacker-controlled data to such a function, the attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Thoroughly vet any native libraries used.**  Ensure they are up-to-date and free of known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Treat all data passed to native functions as untrusted.**  Validate and sanitize the data before passing it.
    *   **Consider using memory-safe languages (like Rust) for new native code components.**

## Attack Tree Path: [[15] Using P/Invoke to load malicious native libraries](./attack_tree_paths/_15__using_pinvoke_to_load_malicious_native_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** If an attacker can control the path to a DLL loaded via P/Invoke, they can inject their own malicious code.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Use absolute paths when specifying DLLs in P/Invoke declarations.**
    *   **Avoid loading DLLs from untrusted locations.**
    *   **Digitally sign DLLs and verify the signature before loading.**

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Mono's Interoperability Features -> COM Interop Abuse](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_mono's_interoperability_features_-_com_interop_abuse.md)

*    **Likelihood: Medium:** COM Interop is less common than P/Invoke, but still presents risks.
*    **Impact: High:** Successful exploitation can lead to RCE.
*    **Effort: High:** Requires understanding of COM and its security implications.
*    **Skill: High:** Requires knowledge of COM, object lifetimes, and potential vulnerabilities in COM objects.
*    **Detection Difficulty: Medium:** Can be detected through code analysis, monitoring of COM object creation and usage, and intrusion detection systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [[18] Passing attacker-controlled data to vulnerable COM methods](./attack_tree_paths/_18__passing_attacker-controlled_data_to_vulnerable_com_methods.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to P/Invoke, if the application interacts with a vulnerable COM object and passes attacker-controlled data to it, the attacker might be able to exploit the COM object's vulnerabilities.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Thoroughly vet any COM objects used.** Ensure they are up-to-date and free of known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Treat all data passed to COM methods as untrusted.** Validate and sanitize the data before passing it.
    *   **Consider using managed alternatives to COM objects whenever possible.**
