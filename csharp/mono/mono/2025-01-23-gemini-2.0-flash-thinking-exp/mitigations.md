# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mono/mono

## Mitigation Strategy: [Maintain Up-to-Date Mono Runtime](./mitigation_strategies/maintain_up-to-date_mono_runtime.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Mono Update Monitoring Process:** Regularly check for new Mono releases and security advisories on the official Mono project website, mailing lists, and security announcement channels. This is crucial as Mono, like any runtime, receives security patches.
    2.  **Test Updates in a Staging Environment:** Before production deployment, apply the new Mono runtime version to a staging environment mirroring production. This step is vital to ensure application compatibility and stability with the updated Mono runtime.
    3.  **Perform Regression Testing (Focus on Mono Compatibility):** Run tests in staging, specifically focusing on areas where Mono's behavior might differ from other .NET runtimes. This helps identify potential regressions or unexpected issues introduced by the Mono update.
    4.  **Schedule and Apply Updates to Production:** Plan a maintenance window to update the production Mono runtime. Follow deployment procedures and have rollback plans ready in case of issues.
    5.  **Document Update Process and Mono Versions:** Keep detailed records of Mono versions used, update dates, and any encountered issues. This documentation aids in troubleshooting and future updates.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Mono Runtime Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated Mono versions may contain publicly known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause denial of service specifically within the Mono environment.
    *   **Mono-Specific Vulnerabilities (Medium to High Severity):**  Vulnerabilities might be discovered that are unique to the Mono runtime implementation. Keeping Mono updated is essential to patch these.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Mono Runtime Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction - Directly patches known vulnerabilities within the Mono runtime, significantly reducing the attack surface specific to Mono.
    *   **Mono-Specific Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction - Addresses vulnerabilities unique to the Mono implementation, preventing exploits targeting Mono's specific codebase.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** We have a monthly script to check for new Mono versions (`scripts/check_mono_updates.sh` in DevOps pipeline). Staging deployment and automated testing specific to Mono compatibility are not fully integrated.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Automated Staging Deployment and Mono Compatibility Testing:** Automate deployment of new Mono versions to staging and integrate automated tests that specifically check for Mono-related compatibility issues after updates.
    *   **Production Update Automation (with Mono considerations):** Explore safe automation for production Mono updates, considering Mono-specific deployment best practices and rollback strategies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Mono Runtime Permissions](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_mono_runtime_permissions.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Minimum Mono Permissions:** Analyze the application's interaction with the Mono runtime and determine the least set of permissions required for the Mono process to function correctly. Focus on permissions needed by Mono itself, not just the application.
    2.  **Dedicated User Account for Mono Process:** Run the Mono runtime process under a dedicated user account with minimal privileges. This account should only have permissions necessary for Mono to execute and access required resources.
    3.  **File System Permissions for Mono Binaries and Libraries:** Restrict file system permissions on Mono binaries, libraries, and configuration files. The Mono runtime user should only have necessary read and execute permissions, limiting write access to essential temporary directories if needed.
    4.  **Operating System Security Features (Focus on Mono Process Isolation):** Utilize OS-level security features like SELinux or AppArmor to further restrict the capabilities of the Mono runtime process. Define policies that limit system calls and resource access specifically for the Mono process.
    5.  **Containerization (Mono-Specific Container Configuration):** If using containers, configure container security profiles to isolate the Mono runtime and limit its access to the host system, focusing on restrictions relevant to Mono's operation within the container.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation via Mono Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** If the Mono runtime process runs with excessive privileges, vulnerabilities within Mono itself could be exploited to escalate privileges and gain control over the system, leveraging the Mono process's permissions.
    *   **Lateral Movement from Compromised Mono Instance (Medium Severity):** Restricting permissions limits the potential for lateral movement if the Mono runtime is compromised. An attacker with limited Mono process permissions will find it harder to exploit the Mono environment to access other system resources.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation via Mono Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of privilege escalation by limiting the capabilities of a compromised Mono process, specifically mitigating threats originating from within the Mono runtime.
    *   **Lateral Movement from Compromised Mono Instance:** Medium Risk Reduction - Makes lateral movement more difficult for attackers who have compromised the Mono runtime, limiting the impact of a Mono-specific compromise.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** We run the application under a dedicated user (`webapp_user`) (`deploy/deploy_app.sh`). OS-level security features specifically targeting the Mono process are not fully implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Implement OS-Level Security for Mono Process:** Investigate and implement SELinux or AppArmor profiles specifically tailored to restrict the Mono runtime process and its interactions with the system.
    *   **Containerization with Mono Security Focus:** If containerizing, refine container security configurations to specifically address Mono runtime isolation and resource limitations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unnecessary Mono Features](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unnecessary_mono_features.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Mono Configuration Options:** Examine the Mono configuration files and available command-line options to identify optional features and modules that are not essential for the application's functionality.
    2.  **Disable Unused Mono Modules:** Disable any Mono modules or features that are not actively used by the application. This reduces the attack surface by removing potentially vulnerable code paths within the Mono runtime.
    3.  **Minimize Enabled Mono Features:**  Configure Mono to run with the minimal set of features required. For example, if specific JIT optimizations or debugging features are not needed in production, disable them.
    4.  **Regularly Re-evaluate Enabled Features:** Periodically review the enabled Mono features to ensure they are still necessary and that no new, unnecessary features have been enabled inadvertently.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Unused Mono Features (Medium Severity):**  Even if features are not actively used by the application, vulnerabilities within those features in the Mono runtime could still be exploited if they are enabled. Disabling them removes these potential attack vectors.
    *   **Increased Attack Surface of Mono Runtime (Medium Severity):**  A larger codebase with more features generally presents a larger attack surface. Disabling unnecessary features reduces the overall complexity and potential vulnerability points within the Mono runtime.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Unused Mono Features:** Medium Risk Reduction - Eliminates potential vulnerabilities within disabled Mono features, reducing the overall attack surface of the Mono runtime.
    *   **Increased Attack Surface of Mono Runtime:** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the complexity and attack surface of the Mono runtime by disabling unnecessary components.
