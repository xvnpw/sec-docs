# Threat Model Analysis for mono/mono

## Threat: [P/Invoke Buffer Overflow](./threats/pinvoke_buffer_overflow.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a native library called via P/Invoke. They provide overly long input that overflows a buffer in the native code, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and gaining control of the execution flow.

**Impact:** Memory corruption, application crash, denial of service, and potentially remote code execution with the privileges of the Mono process.

**Affected Component:** P/Invoke Marshaller (specifically when interacting with the vulnerable native library).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Carefully vet all native libraries used via P/Invoke. Use safe and well-maintained libraries. Implement robust input validation and sanitization before passing data to native functions. Employ memory safety tools during development and testing.

## Threat: [Malicious CIL via JIT Compiler Vulnerability](./threats/malicious_cil_via_jit_compiler_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides specially crafted Common Intermediate Language (CIL) code that exploits a bug in the Mono Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler. When the JIT compiler attempts to translate this malicious CIL into native code, it generates exploitable machine code.

**Impact:** Remote code execution with the privileges of the Mono process.

**Affected Component:** Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler (e.g., the code generation or optimization phases).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Keep Mono updated to the latest stable version, as JIT compiler vulnerabilities are often patched. Avoid executing untrusted or dynamically generated CIL code if possible. Implement strong input validation to prevent the injection of malicious CIL.

## Threat: [Garbage Collector Use-After-Free](./threats/garbage_collector_use-after-free.md)

**Description:** An attacker triggers a scenario where an object is freed by the Mono garbage collector, but a dangling pointer to that memory location still exists and is later dereferenced. This can lead to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** Memory corruption, application crash, denial of service, and potentially remote code execution.

**Affected Component:** Garbage Collector (specifically the memory management and object tracking mechanisms).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Follow secure coding practices to avoid creating dangling pointers. Be mindful of object lifetimes and resource management. Keep Mono updated, as garbage collector bugs are sometimes discovered and fixed.

## Threat: [Security Feature Implementation Bypass](./threats/security_feature_implementation_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a flaw or inconsistency in Mono's implementation of a .NET security feature (e.g., a specific authentication or authorization mechanism, or a security-related API). This allows them to bypass intended security controls.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, or the ability to perform actions that should be restricted.

**Affected Component:** Specific Mono components implementing security features (e.g., `System.Security.Cryptography`, `System.Net.Security`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Thoroughly test security-sensitive parts of the application on Mono. Be aware of known differences in security feature implementations. Prefer using standard and well-vetted security libraries and patterns.

## Threat: [Exploiting Outdated Mono Version](./threats/exploiting_outdated_mono_version.md)

**Description:** An attacker targets known security vulnerabilities present in an outdated version of the Mono runtime that the application is using. Publicly available exploits can be used to compromise the application.

**Impact:** Depends on the specific vulnerabilities present in the outdated version, but could range from information disclosure and denial of service to remote code execution.

**Affected Component:** Various Mono components depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerabilities present (can be Critical, High, or Medium).

**Mitigation Strategies:** Maintain a regular update schedule for the Mono runtime. Subscribe to security advisories from the Mono project to be aware of newly discovered vulnerabilities. Implement a process for quickly patching or upgrading the Mono runtime when security updates are released.
