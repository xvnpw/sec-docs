# Threat Model Analysis for mono/mono

## Threat: [JIT Compiler Code Injection](./threats/jit_compiler_code_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts input that, when processed by the Mono JIT compiler, leads to the generation of malicious native code. This could involve exploiting bugs in the JIT compilation process or providing specially crafted bytecode that triggers vulnerabilities during compilation. The attacker could potentially gain arbitrary code execution on the target system.

**Impact:** Critical - Full system compromise, arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `mono/mini/` (Mono's JIT compiler module).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the Mono framework updated to the latest stable version, as updates often include fixes for JIT compiler vulnerabilities.
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent the injection of malicious data that could trigger JIT compiler bugs.
*   Consider using Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation where feasible, as it reduces reliance on runtime JIT compilation.

## Threat: [P/Invoke Native Code Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/pinvoke_native_code_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An application using P/Invoke calls interacts with a vulnerable native library. An attacker could leverage vulnerabilities within these native libraries (e.g., buffer overflows, format string bugs) through the application's P/Invoke calls. The attacker manipulates data passed to the native function, causing it to execute arbitrary code or perform unintended actions with the privileges of the Mono process.

**Impact:** High - Potential for arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation (depending on the native library's privileges), denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `mono/metadata/` (P/Invoke marshalling logic), and the specific native library being called.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly vet all native libraries used via P/Invoke for known vulnerabilities.
*   Keep native libraries updated to their latest versions with security patches.
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization before passing data to native functions.
*   Use secure coding practices when interacting with native code, such as careful memory management and bounds checking.
*   Consider using safer alternatives to P/Invoke if available, or sandboxing the native library interactions.

## Threat: [Mono Runtime Memory Corruption](./threats/mono_runtime_memory_corruption.md)

**Description:** A flaw within the Mono runtime itself (outside the JIT compiler) allows an attacker to corrupt memory structures. This could be triggered by specific sequences of operations, manipulation of object states, or through vulnerabilities in garbage collection or other runtime components. Successful exploitation can lead to crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** High - Denial of service, potential for arbitrary code execution depending on the nature of the corruption.

**Affected Component:** Core Mono runtime components (e.g., `mono/object.c`, `mono/gc.c`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the Mono framework updated to the latest stable version, as runtime bugs are often addressed in updates.
*   Report any suspected Mono runtime bugs to the Mono project.
*   While direct mitigation within the application might be limited, robust error handling and process isolation can help contain the impact of crashes.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization in Mono-Specific Formatters](./threats/insecure_deserialization_in_mono-specific_formatters.md)

**Description:** If the application uses Mono-specific serialization formats or libraries with known insecure deserialization vulnerabilities, an attacker can provide malicious serialized data that, when deserialized, leads to arbitrary code execution or other harmful actions. This threat is specific to formats or libraries more prevalent within the Mono ecosystem.

**Impact:** High - Potential for arbitrary code execution, data corruption, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Any Mono-specific serialization libraries or formatters used by the application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using insecure deserialization patterns.
*   If deserialization is necessary, use safe serialization libraries and techniques.
*   Validate and sanitize deserialized data rigorously.
*   Consider using data formats that are less susceptible to deserialization attacks (e.g., JSON instead of binary formats where appropriate).

## Threat: [Assembly Loading Hijacking](./threats/assembly_loading_hijacking.md)

**Description:** An attacker places a malicious assembly with the same name as an expected assembly in a location where Mono searches for assemblies. When the application attempts to load the legitimate assembly, the malicious one is loaded instead, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the application's context.

**Impact:** High - Arbitrary code execution within the application's context.

**Affected Component:** Mono's assembly loading mechanism (`mono/metadata/assembly.c`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure assemblies are loaded from trusted locations and that those locations have appropriate access controls.
*   Use strong naming for assemblies to verify their integrity and origin.
*   Be cautious about adding untrusted assembly search paths.
