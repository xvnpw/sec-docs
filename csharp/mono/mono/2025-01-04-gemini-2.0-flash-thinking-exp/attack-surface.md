# Attack Surface Analysis for mono/mono

## Attack Surface: [Mono's Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/mono's_just-in-time__jit__compiler_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Bugs or vulnerabilities within Mono's JIT compiler can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. The JIT compiler translates bytecode into native code, and flaws in this process can be leveraged by attackers.

**How Mono Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Mono's JIT compiler is a complex component and a potential source of vulnerabilities. Exploits targeting the JIT compiler are specific to the Mono runtime.

**Example:** An attacker might provide specially crafted bytecode that, when processed by Mono's JIT compiler, leads to the execution of malicious native code on the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, full system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Mono updated to the latest stable version, which includes fixes for known JIT compiler vulnerabilities.
* Consider using Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation where feasible, as it reduces reliance on the JIT compiler at runtime.
* Implement strong input validation to prevent the execution of potentially malicious bytecode.

## Attack Surface: [Interoperability with Native Code (P/Invoke)](./attack_surfaces/interoperability_with_native_code__pinvoke_.md)

**Description:** Mono allows managed code to interact with native libraries via Platform Invoke (P/Invoke). Incorrect usage or vulnerabilities in the native code or the marshalling process can introduce security risks.

**How Mono Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Mono acts as the bridge between managed and unmanaged code. Errors in how Mono handles data marshalling or calls to native functions can expose vulnerabilities.

**Example:** An application uses P/Invoke to call a native function that is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. If the application passes unsanitized input to this function through Mono, the overflow can be triggered.

**Impact:** Memory corruption, arbitrary code execution, denial-of-service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data passed to native functions via P/Invoke.
* Use appropriate marshalling attributes to ensure correct data conversion between managed and unmanaged code.
* Securely manage and update any native libraries used by the application.
* Consider using safer alternatives to P/Invoke where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

**Description:**  Similar to .NET, Mono applications are vulnerable to deserialization attacks if they deserialize untrusted data. Attackers can craft malicious serialized payloads to execute arbitrary code upon deserialization.

**How Mono Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Mono's implementation of serialization mechanisms is susceptible to the same types of deserialization vulnerabilities as the .NET Framework.

**Example:** An application deserializes user-provided data without proper validation. An attacker sends a malicious serialized object that, upon deserialization, executes arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, full system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid deserializing untrusted data whenever possible.
* If deserialization of untrusted data is necessary, use secure deserialization techniques or consider alternative data exchange formats.
* Implement strong input validation and sanitization before deserialization.
