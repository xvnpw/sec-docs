* **Description:** Unsecured Elmah User Interface (UI) exposing sensitive error details.
    * **How Elmah Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Elmah provides a built-in web interface (typically `/elmah.axd`) to view logged errors. If this interface is not properly secured, it becomes publicly accessible.
    * **Example:** An attacker navigates to `https://example.com/elmah.axd` and can view detailed error logs, including stack traces, request parameters, and potentially database connection strings or API keys present in error messages.
    * **Impact:** Information Disclosure of sensitive application details, potentially leading to further attacks or compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong authentication (e.g., forms-based authentication, Windows authentication) for the Elmah handler.
        * Implement authorization to restrict access to the Elmah interface to specific roles or users.
        * Consider using a dedicated, non-public URL for the Elmah interface and rely on server-level access controls (e.g., IP restrictions).
        * Disable the Elmah UI entirely if it's not needed for operational purposes.

* **Description:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities via unsanitized data in the Elmah UI.
    * **How Elmah Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Elmah displays logged error data, which may include user-supplied input from request parameters or form data. If this data is not properly sanitized before being rendered in the Elmah UI, it can be used to inject malicious scripts.
    * **Example:** An attacker crafts a request with a malicious JavaScript payload in a parameter. This payload is logged by Elmah. When an administrator views the error details in the Elmah UI, the script executes in their browser, potentially allowing session hijacking or other malicious actions.
    * **Impact:** Account compromise of users accessing the Elmah UI (typically administrators or developers), potentially leading to further system compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure all data displayed in the Elmah UI is properly encoded or sanitized to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.
        * Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to further mitigate the risk of XSS.
        * Regularly review and update Elmah to benefit from any security patches addressing XSS vulnerabilities.
