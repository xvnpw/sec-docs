## High and Critical Elmah Threats

This table outlines high and critical threats that directly involve the Elmah library.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Actions & How) | Impact | Affected Elmah Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Unsecured Elmah UI Access** | An attacker directly accesses the Elmah error log viewer (typically `/elmah.axd`) without proper authentication or authorization. They might guess the URL or find it through information disclosure elsewhere in the application. | Exposure of sensitive application information including stack traces, error messages, potentially user data, internal paths, database connection strings (if logged in errors), and details about application vulnerabilities. This can aid in further attacks. | `Elmah.Mvc.ErrorLogModule` (HTTP Module), `Elmah.ErrorLogPage` (HTTP Handler) | **Critical** | **Implement strong authentication and authorization for the Elmah UI.** Use the `<location>` element in `web.config` to restrict access based on IP address, roles, or other authentication mechanisms. Consider disabling the UI in production environments if not actively needed. |
| **Sensitive Data Exposure in Error Logs (via Elmah)** | The application logs error messages, and Elmah stores these logs, which contain sensitive information like user credentials, API keys, internal system details, or personally identifiable information (PII). An attacker accessing the Elmah logs (through the UI or direct storage access *to Elmah's storage*) can retrieve this data. | Data breach, account compromise, exposure of confidential information, violation of privacy regulations. | `Elmah.ErrorLog.Log(Error error)` (Logging Functionality), potentially all storage providers (e.g., `Elmah.XmlFileErrorLog`, `Elmah.SqlErrorLog`) | **High** | **Review and sanitize error messages *before* they are passed to Elmah for logging.** Avoid logging sensitive data directly. Implement mechanisms to redact or mask sensitive information before Elmah processes the error. Educate developers on secure logging practices. Consider using structured logging and filtering sensitive fields before Elmah logs them. |
| **Elmah UI Resource Exhaustion** | An attacker makes excessive requests to the Elmah UI (`/elmah.axd`), consuming server resources and potentially causing a denial of service. This is more likely if the UI is publicly accessible or not properly protected. | Unavailability of the Elmah UI, potentially impacting monitoring and debugging efforts. In extreme cases, could contribute to overall application instability. | `Elmah.Mvc.ErrorLogModule` (HTTP Module), `Elmah.ErrorLogPage` (HTTP Handler) | **High** | **Implement rate limiting on access to the Elmah UI.** Use caching mechanisms for the UI. Ensure the server has sufficient resources to handle legitimate traffic. If the UI is not actively needed in production, disable it. |
| **Exploiting Elmah Vulnerabilities** | A vulnerability exists within the Elmah library itself (e.g., in its handling of input, storage, or UI rendering) that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code, gain unauthorized access to Elmah's data or functionality, or cause a denial of service of the Elmah feature. | Full compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server (if RCE), unauthorized access to error logs, disruption of error logging functionality. | Various components depending on the specific vulnerability (e.g., `Elmah.ErrorLogPage`, storage providers, core logging functions) | **Critical** (if RCE), **High** (for other vulnerabilities) | **Keep Elmah updated to the latest version.** Monitor security advisories for any reported vulnerabilities in Elmah. Consider using static analysis tools to scan the application and its dependencies. Follow secure coding practices when integrating with Elmah. |
| **Configuration Manipulation of Elmah (if exposed)** | If the application exposes Elmah configuration settings (e.g., through a poorly secured admin panel or insecure file permissions on `web.config`), an attacker could modify Elmah settings to disable logging, redirect logs to a malicious location controlled by the attacker, or introduce other harmful configurations affecting Elmah's behavior. | Disabling security measures (error logging), hiding malicious activity by preventing logging, potentially exposing sensitive information if logs are redirected to an insecure location. | `System.Configuration` (Configuration System, specifically how it affects Elmah's settings), potentially custom configuration interfaces interacting with Elmah's configuration. | **High** | **Restrict access to Elmah configuration settings.** Implement strong authentication and authorization for any configuration interfaces. Secure the `web.config` file with appropriate file system permissions. Avoid storing sensitive configuration data in plain text. |
