## High and Critical DocFX Threats

This table outlines high and critical security threats that directly involve the DocFX application.

| Threat | Description (What the attacker might do and how) | Impact (Describe the impact of the threat) | Affected DocFX Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Malicious Plugin Installation** | An attacker could trick a developer into installing a malicious DocFX plugin (e.g., through social engineering, compromised plugin repository). The plugin could then execute arbitrary code during the build process, potentially compromising the build server or injecting malicious content into the generated documentation. | **High:** Compromise of the build environment, potential injection of malware into the documentation website, leading to user compromise or data theft. | Plugin System, Build Process | High | - **Vet plugin sources:** Only use plugins from trusted and reputable sources. Verify the plugin author and their reputation. <br> - **Code review plugins:** If possible, review the source code of plugins before installation. <br> - **Implement a plugin approval process:** Establish a process for reviewing and approving plugins before they are used in the build pipeline. <br> - **Use a plugin manager with security features:** If available, utilize plugin managers that offer security scanning or sandboxing. |
| **Template Injection** | An attacker could inject malicious code into Markdown or YAML files that gets interpreted and executed by the DocFX templating engine (LiquidJS by default). This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the build server during documentation generation. For example, injecting LiquidJS code that reads sensitive files or executes system commands. | **Critical:** Arbitrary code execution on the build server, potentially leading to full server compromise, data breach, or denial of service. | Templating Engine (LiquidJS) | Critical | - **Strict input validation and sanitization:** Sanitize all user-provided content that might be included in documentation files, especially if it's used within templates. <br> - **Secure template configuration:** Ensure the templating engine is configured securely, limiting access to sensitive functions and objects. <br> - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP in the generated documentation to mitigate the impact of any injected scripts that might bypass server-side sanitization. <br> - **Regularly update DocFX and its dependencies:** Ensure you are using the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities in the templating engine. |
| **Plugin Exploits (Vulnerabilities in Plugins)** | A vulnerability in a DocFX plugin could be exploited by an attacker if the plugin is not properly secured. This could lead to various impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability, potentially including arbitrary code execution or information disclosure. | **High:**  Depending on the plugin vulnerability, impacts could range from information disclosure to arbitrary code execution on the build server. | Plugin System, Specific Plugin Modules | High | - **Keep plugins up-to-date:** Regularly update all DocFX plugins to patch known vulnerabilities. <br> - **Vet plugin sources:** Only use plugins from trusted and reputable sources. <br> - **Monitor plugin vulnerability disclosures:** Stay informed about known vulnerabilities in the plugins you are using. <br> - **Consider alternative solutions:** If a plugin has known vulnerabilities and no updates are available, consider alternative ways to achieve the desired functionality. |
