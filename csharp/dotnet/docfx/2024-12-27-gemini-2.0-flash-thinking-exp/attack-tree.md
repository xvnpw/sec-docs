**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Paths:**

1. **[High-Risk Path] Inject Malicious Content via Markdown -> Exploit XSS Vulnerabilities in Markdown Rendering -> Inject JavaScript to Steal Credentials/Session Tokens / Redirect Users / Perform Actions on Behalf of Users:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into Markdown files processed by Docfx. If Docfx's Markdown rendering engine is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), this JavaScript will execute in the user's browser when they view the generated documentation.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** High (Credentials/Session Theft, Unauthorized Actions), Medium (Redirection)
    * **Effort:** Low
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner/Intermediate
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    * **Mitigation:** Implement robust input sanitization and validation for Markdown content. Utilize a secure Markdown rendering library and enforce a strict Content Security Policy (CSP). Regularly update the Markdown rendering engine.

2. **[High-Risk Path] Inject Malicious Content via Code Snippets -> Exploit Code Execution Vulnerabilities in Code Block Rendering -> Inject code that executes in the browser when viewing documentation:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript or other client-side scripting code within code blocks in the documentation source. If Docfx renders these code blocks in a way that allows script execution in the browser, the attacker's code will run when users view the documentation.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Medium/High (depending on the injected code, potential for data theft, unauthorized actions)
    * **Effort:** Low
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner/Intermediate
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    * **Mitigation:**  Ensure code blocks are rendered securely, preventing client-side script execution. Implement CSP to restrict the execution of inline scripts.
