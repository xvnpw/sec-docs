# Threat Model Analysis for dotnet/docfx

## Threat: [Sensitive Information Disclosure via Configuration](./threats/sensitive_information_disclosure_via_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive information by examining publicly accessible DocFX configuration files (`docfx.json`, `toc.yml`, `.docfxignore`, or files accidentally included in the output) or by inspecting the generated HTML metadata. The attacker might download these files directly if they are exposed on the web server or find them through search engines. They could then analyze these files to discover internal file paths, repository URLs, API keys (if mistakenly included), or other sensitive build-time information.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of internal infrastructure details, potential compromise of source code repositories, unauthorized access to APIs if credentials are leaked, and potential for further targeted attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** `docfx.json` (configuration file), `toc.yml` (table of contents file), `.docfxignore` (file exclusion rules), generated HTML metadata (e.g., `<meta>` tags in the `<head>` section), and any files unintentionally included in the output due to misconfiguration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Configuration Review:** Carefully review all DocFX configuration files (`docfx.json`, `toc.yml`, etc.) to ensure no sensitive data (API keys, passwords, internal paths) is directly included.
    *   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables or a secure secrets management system to store sensitive values, referencing them in the configuration files instead of hardcoding them.
    *   **`.docfxignore` Usage:** Utilize the `.docfxignore` file effectively to explicitly exclude any sensitive files or directories from the build process.  Use specific file names and patterns rather than broad wildcards.
    *   **Metadata Control:** Review the generated HTML output (especially the `<head>` section) for any unintended metadata exposure. Use DocFX's metadata filtering options (if available) to control which metadata is included.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run the DocFX build process with the least privilege necessary.  The build process should only have read access to the required input files and write access to the output directory.
    *   **Web Server Configuration:** Ensure the web server is configured to prevent directory listing and to restrict access to configuration files (e.g., using `.htaccess` rules on Apache or equivalent configurations).

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Plugins/Templates](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_pluginstemplates.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities within custom DocFX templates or plugins to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code.  The attacker might find publicly available exploits for known vulnerabilities in specific plugins or templates, or they might analyze the source code of custom components to discover new vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, the impact could range from information disclosure to arbitrary code execution on the build server (and potentially the web server if the compromised plugin generates malicious output).
*   **Affected Component:** Custom DocFX templates (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), DocFX plugins (Node.js modules).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the plugin/template)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Vetting:** Thoroughly vet any third-party templates or plugins before using them. Examine the source code for potential security issues (e.g., insecure file handling, lack of input sanitization).
    *   **Reputable Sources:** Prefer well-maintained and widely used plugins from reputable sources (e.g., the official DocFX documentation, well-known community repositories).
    *   **Updates:** Keep templates and plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Code Review:** If developing custom templates or plugins, conduct thorough code reviews with a focus on security.
    *   **Sandboxing (Difficult):** Consider sandboxing or isolating the execution of plugins if possible (though this may be difficult with DocFX's architecture).
