## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Source Code Filtering with DocFX](./mitigation_strategies/strict_source_code_filtering_with_docfx.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Strict Source Code Filtering with DocFX**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`.docfxignore` Files:** Create and maintain `.docfxignore` files in the root directory and, if necessary, subdirectories of your project. These files use a syntax similar to `.gitignore`. Add entries to exclude:
        *   Entire directories containing internal-only projects or test code (e.g., `**/InternalProjects/`, `**/Tests/`).
        *   Specific files known to contain sensitive data (e.g., `**/SensitiveConfig.cs`).
        *   Patterns matching files that should be excluded (e.g., `**/*Internal*.cs`).
    2.  **`docfx.json` Configuration:**
        *   **`filterConfig`:** Use the `filterConfig` section to define precise inclusion/exclusion rules.
            *   **`apiRules`:** Define rules based on member visibility. For example:
                ```json
                "filterConfig": {
                  "apiRules": [
                    {
                      "include": {
                        "kind": "class",
                        "visibility": "public"
                      }
                    },
                    {
                      "include": {
                        "kind": "method",
                        "visibility": "public"
                      }
                    },
                    { "exclude": { "uid": ".*Internal.*" } } // Exclude anything with "Internal" in the UID
                  ]
                }
                ```
            *   **`namespace` and `type`:** Specify explicit namespaces and types to include or exclude.
        *   **`metadata`:** Carefully review the `metadata` section to ensure it doesn't contain any sensitive information.
    3. **Regular DocFX Output Audits:** After each DocFX build, *manually* inspect a representative sample of the generated output. Look for:
        *   Unexpectedly exposed internal classes or methods.
        *   Sensitive comments or documentation strings.
        *   Any other information that should not be public.
        *   Consider scripting this audit to search for specific keywords or patterns.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Internal/Sensitive Information:** (Severity: High) - Prevents internal APIs, private methods, sensitive comments, and configuration details from being exposed in the public documentation.
    *   **Accidental Disclosure of Credentials:** (Severity: Critical) - Reduces the risk (though doesn't eliminate it entirely – source code control is still key) of API keys or other credentials being exposed *if* they were accidentally included in the source code *and* not caught by code reviews.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Internal/Sensitive Information:** Risk significantly reduced. The combination of `.docfxignore` and `filterConfig` provides strong control over what DocFX processes.
    *   **Accidental Disclosure of Credentials:** Risk reduced, but relies on other mitigations (code reviews, environment variables) for complete protection.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `.docfxignore` Files: Partially implemented. A basic `.docfxignore` exists, but it may not be comprehensive.
    *   `docfx.json` Configuration: Partially implemented. `filterConfig` is used, but may not be fully optimized.
    *   Regular DocFX Output Audits: Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `.docfxignore` Files: Need to conduct a thorough review of the project structure and create/update `.docfxignore` files to exclude all internal-only code and sensitive files.
    *   `docfx.json` Configuration: Need to refine the `filterConfig` to be more precise and restrictive, especially the `apiRules`.
    *   Regular DocFX Output Audits: Need to establish a schedule and process (potentially automated) for regular audits of the generated documentation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Custom Template Handling within DocFX](./mitigation_strategies/secure_custom_template_handling_within_docfx.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: Secure Custom Template Handling within DocFX**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Handlebars Template Sanitization (Triple Braces):** Within custom Handlebars templates used by DocFX, *always* use triple curly braces (`{{{ ... }}}`) to output *any* data that originates from:
        *   Source code comments.
        *   User-provided input (if any – this should be rare in DocFX contexts).
        *   Any source that is not 100% guaranteed to be safe HTML.
        *   This prevents Handlebars from performing HTML escaping, which is crucial for preventing XSS.
    2.  **Handlebars Template Sanitization (Double Braces - with extreme caution):** If you *absolutely must* use double curly braces (`{{ ... }}`), ensure the data being output is:
        *   Completely trusted (e.g., a hardcoded string within the template itself).
        *   Or, has been *thoroughly* sanitized using a dedicated HTML sanitization library *before* being passed to the template.  This is a complex and error-prone approach; triple braces are strongly preferred.
    3. **Avoid Custom Helpers:** Minimize the use of custom Handlebars helpers.  If you must create custom helpers:
        *   Rigorously review their code for any potential XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   Ensure they properly sanitize any input they receive before incorporating it into the output.
    4. **Review Existing Templates:** Conduct a thorough security review of *all* existing custom Handlebars templates.
        *   Check for any instances of double curly braces being used with untrusted data.
        *   Verify that any custom helpers are secure.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Custom Templates:** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious JavaScript into the generated documentation via vulnerabilities in custom Handlebars templates.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Custom Templates:** Risk significantly reduced. Consistent use of triple curly braces for untrusted data, combined with careful review of existing templates, provides strong protection against XSS.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Handlebars Template Sanitization: Partially implemented. Developers are aware of triple curly braces, but usage may not be consistent or fully understood.
    *   Avoid Custom Helpers: Mostly implemented (few custom helpers are used).
    *   Review Existing Templates: Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Handlebars Template Sanitization: Need to conduct a code review of *all* custom Handlebars templates to ensure consistent and correct use of triple curly braces.  Provide training to developers on the importance of this.
    *   Review Existing Templates: Need to perform a dedicated security review of all existing custom templates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [DocFX Build Process Optimization](./mitigation_strategies/docfx_build_process_optimization.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy: DocFX Build Process Optimization**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Incremental Builds:** *Always* enable incremental builds. This is typically done by:
        *   Adding the `--incremental` flag to the `docfx build` command.
        *   Or, configuring it within the `build` section of your `docfx.json` file:
            ```json
            "build": {
              "incremental": true
            }
            ```
    2.  **`xrefService` Optimization (if used):** If your project uses cross-references to external documentation via the `xrefService`, carefully configure it in `docfx.json`.
        *   Avoid overly broad or unnecessary xref mappings.
        *   Specify only the *required* external documentation sources.
        *   Consider using a local xref map file if the external documentation is static.
    3. **Plugin Minimization:**
        * Only include DocFX plugins that are *absolutely essential* for your documentation needs.
        * Each plugin adds overhead to the build process.
        * Regularly review the list of installed plugins and remove any that are no longer used.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion During Build:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents the DocFX build process from consuming excessive resources (CPU, memory) on the build server, which could lead to a denial-of-service condition.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion During Build:** Risk significantly reduced. Incremental builds, optimized `xrefService` configuration, and plugin minimization all contribute to a more efficient build process.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Incremental Builds: Implemented.
    *   `xrefService` Optimization: Partially implemented (needs review).
    *   Plugin Minimization: Partially implemented (informal practice, needs formal review).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `xrefService` Optimization: Need to thoroughly review the `xrefService` configuration in `docfx.json` to ensure it's as efficient as possible.
    *   Plugin Minimization: Need to conduct a formal review of all installed DocFX plugins and remove any that are not strictly necessary.
