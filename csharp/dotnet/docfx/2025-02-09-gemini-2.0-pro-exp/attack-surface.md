# Attack Surface Analysis for dotnet/docfx

## Attack Surface: [1. Markdown Parsing Exploits](./attack_surfaces/1__markdown_parsing_exploits.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the Markdown parsing engine used by DocFX can allow attackers to inject malicious code or cause unexpected behavior.
    *   **DocFX Contribution:** DocFX relies on a Markdown parser (e.g., Markdig) to process Markdown input.  The parser itself is the potential vulnerability point.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a Markdown document with a specially designed sequence of characters that triggers a buffer overflow or other vulnerability in the Markdown parser, leading to arbitrary code execution during the DocFX build process.  Alternatively, a crafted Markdown link could exploit a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the parser's handling of link attributes.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) during the build process, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the generated output.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (for RCE), **High** (for XSS).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Update DocFX:** Regularly update DocFX to the latest version to incorporate security patches for the Markdown parser.
        *   **Monitor Advisories:**  Stay informed about security advisories related to the specific Markdown parser used by your DocFX version.
        *   **Input Sanitization (Crucial if accepting user input):** If user-submitted Markdown is allowed, *strictly* sanitize and validate it *before* DocFX processes it.  Use a dedicated Markdown sanitization library.  Do *not* rely solely on DocFX's internal parsing.
        *   **Linter:** Employ a Markdown linter to enforce a stricter subset of Markdown and potentially catch suspicious patterns.
        *   **Restrict Features:** Limit the allowed Markdown features to the minimum necessary.

## Attack Surface: [2. YAML/JSON Configuration File Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/2__yamljson_configuration_file_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Flaws in the YAML or JSON parsing libraries used by DocFX to process configuration files (`docfx.json`, `toc.yml`, etc.) can be exploited.
    *   **DocFX Contribution:** DocFX uses these parsers to read and interpret configuration settings.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a maliciously crafted `docfx.json` file that exploits a vulnerability in the YAML parser, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) or potentially leading to code execution during the build.  For example, a YAML bomb attack could exhaust server resources.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) during the build process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** (for potential RCE).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Update DocFX:** Keep DocFX updated to use the latest parser versions.
        *   **Schema Validation:** If possible, validate configuration files against a predefined schema to ensure their structure and content are as expected.
        *   **Trusted Sources Only:** Treat configuration files as trusted input *only* from trusted sources.  *Never* accept user-uploaded configuration files.
        *   **Monitor Advisories:** Watch for security advisories related to the YAML and JSON parsing libraries.

## Attack Surface: [3. Template Injection (Custom Templates)](./attack_surfaces/3__template_injection__custom_templates_.md)

*   **Description:**  If custom templates are used, and user-provided data is incorporated without proper escaping, template injection vulnerabilities can arise.
    *   **DocFX Contribution:** DocFX allows the use of custom templates (e.g., Handlebars, Liquid), providing a mechanism for user data to be rendered.
    *   **Example:**  A custom template includes a user's name without proper escaping.  An attacker provides a name containing malicious JavaScript code (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`).  This code is then injected into the generated HTML, leading to an XSS vulnerability.  If the template engine is used server-side during static site generation, server-side template injection (SSTI) could be possible, leading to RCE.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), potential Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (for SSTI/RCE), **High** (for XSS).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Escaping:** *Always* sanitize and escape any user-provided data before including it in templates.  Use the appropriate escaping functions provided by the template engine (e.g., `{{escape this.userInput}}` in Handlebars).
        *   **Avoid User Data in Logic:**  Minimize the use of user-provided data within template logic (e.g., `if` statements, loops).
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding guidelines for the chosen template engine.
        *   **Prefer Built-in Templates:** If possible, use DocFX's built-in templates, which are generally more thoroughly vetted.
        *   **Contextual Escaping:** Use the correct escaping function for the context (e.g., HTML escaping for HTML attributes, JavaScript escaping for inline JavaScript).

## Attack Surface: [4. File Inclusion Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/4__file_inclusion_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  If DocFX is configured to include files from external sources, there's a risk of Local File Inclusion (LFI) or Remote File Inclusion (RFI).
    *   **DocFX Contribution:** DocFX might have features or configurations that allow including files from various sources.
    *   **Example:**  DocFX is configured to include files from a user-specified path.  An attacker provides a path like `../../../../etc/passwd` (LFI) or `http://attacker.com/malicious.js` (RFI) to include sensitive system files or execute malicious code.
    *   **Impact:** Local File Inclusion (LFI) leading to information disclosure, Remote File Inclusion (RFI) leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (for RFI/RCE), **High** (for LFI).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable/Restrict External Inclusion:**  Disable or severely restrict the ability to include files from external sources.
        *   **Whitelist:** If external file inclusion is necessary, use a *strict* whitelist of allowed file paths and extensions.  *Never* allow user-controlled input to directly specify file paths.
        *   **Web Server Configuration:** Ensure the web server is configured to prevent directory traversal attacks.

## Attack Surface: [5. Client-Side JavaScript Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/5__client-side_javascript_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in DocFX's built-in JavaScript or any custom JavaScript added to the documentation can lead to client-side attacks.
    *   **DocFX Contribution:** DocFX includes client-side JavaScript for features like search and navigation.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in DocFX's search functionality allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that steals cookies or redirects users to a phishing site. Or, a custom JavaScript function added to the documentation contains an XSS vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), other client-side attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Update DocFX:** Keep DocFX updated to get security patches for its included JavaScript.
        *   **Secure Custom JavaScript:** If adding custom JavaScript, follow secure coding practices, use a linter, and perform security reviews.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP on the web server to restrict the execution of inline scripts and limit the sources of external scripts. This is a *critical* defense-in-depth measure.

## Attack Surface: [6. Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/6__dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in DocFX's dependencies (NuGet packages, Node.js modules) can be exploited.
    *   **DocFX Contribution:** DocFX relies on external libraries, which may have their own vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A dependency used by DocFX for image processing has a known vulnerability that allows remote code execution.  An attacker could exploit this by providing a specially crafted image file.
    *   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the dependency and vulnerability, but could range from Denial of Service (DoS) to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   **Risk Severity:**  **Critical** to **High**, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep DocFX and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use dependency vulnerability scanners (e.g., `dotnet list package --vulnerable`, `npm audit`, OWASP Dependency-Check) to identify known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Consider using an SCA tool for a more comprehensive analysis of dependencies and their vulnerabilities.
