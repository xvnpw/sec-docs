# Deep Analysis: File Inclusion Vulnerabilities in DocFX

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly investigate the potential for Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerabilities within a DocFX-powered documentation site.  The goal is to identify specific attack vectors, assess the likelihood and impact of successful exploitation, and provide concrete recommendations for mitigation and remediation.  We will focus on how DocFX's features and configuration options might contribute to these vulnerabilities.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on file inclusion vulnerabilities related to DocFX.  It encompasses:

*   **DocFX Configuration:**  Examining `docfx.json` and other configuration files for settings that control file inclusion.
*   **DocFX Features:**  Analyzing DocFX's built-in features, such as Markdown includes, code snippets, and custom plugins, for potential inclusion vulnerabilities.
*   **User Input:**  Identifying any points where user-supplied data (e.g., through a web interface, API, or build process) might influence file paths used by DocFX.
*   **Deployment Environment:** Considering the web server configuration (e.g., IIS, Nginx, Apache) and how it interacts with DocFX's output.  This is crucial for preventing directory traversal.
*   **Dependencies:**  Assessing if any third-party libraries or plugins used by DocFX introduce file inclusion risks.

This analysis *excludes* general web application vulnerabilities unrelated to DocFX's file inclusion mechanisms (e.g., XSS, SQLi, CSRF), although these should be addressed separately in a comprehensive security assessment.

## 3. Methodology

The following methodology will be used:

1.  **Code Review:**  Manually inspect the DocFX project's configuration files (`docfx.json`, etc.) and any custom scripts or plugins.  Search for keywords related to file inclusion (e.g., "include," "src," "path," "file").
2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**
    *   **Fuzzing:**  If user input influences file paths, use fuzzing techniques to provide a wide range of potentially malicious inputs (e.g., directory traversal sequences, URL-encoded characters, long strings).
    *   **Manual Exploitation:**  Attempt to craft LFI and RFI payloads based on the code review findings.  Try to access sensitive files (e.g., `/etc/passwd` on Linux, `C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM` on Windows) and execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Dependency Analysis:** Use tools like `dotnet list package --vulnerable` or OWASP Dependency-Check to identify known vulnerabilities in DocFX's dependencies.
3.  **Documentation Review:**  Thoroughly review the official DocFX documentation to understand the intended behavior of file inclusion features and any security recommendations provided by the developers.
4.  **Web Server Configuration Review:**  Examine the web server's configuration files to ensure that directory traversal protections are in place and that the server is not configured to execute arbitrary file types.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface

### 4.1. Potential Attack Vectors

Based on DocFX's functionality, the following attack vectors are most likely:

*   **Markdown Includes (`[!include[text](path)]`):**  This is a primary concern.  If the `path` is derived from user input, even indirectly, it's a high-risk area.  DocFX's documentation should be carefully reviewed to understand how it resolves relative paths and handles different file types.
*   **Code Snippets (`[!code-cs[Main](Program.cs#L12-L18)]`):**  Similar to Markdown includes, the file path specified here could be vulnerable if it's influenced by user input.
*   **Custom Plugins:**  If the DocFX project uses custom plugins, these plugins *must* be thoroughly audited for file inclusion vulnerabilities.  Any plugin that reads files based on user-provided paths is a potential risk.
*   **`docfx.json` Configuration:**  The `files` and `resources` sections of `docfx.json` define which files are included in the documentation build.  If these sections are dynamically generated or modified based on user input, it could lead to vulnerabilities.  Specifically, look for glob patterns that might be overly permissive.
*  **TOC (Table of Contents):** If the table of contents is generated dynamically and the file paths are not properly validated, it could be a potential attack vector.
* **Overly Permissive Glob Patterns:** If the configuration uses glob patterns (e.g., `**/*.md`) to include files, ensure these patterns are not too broad. An overly permissive pattern could unintentionally include sensitive files.

### 4.2. Exploitation Scenarios

*   **Scenario 1: LFI via Markdown Include:**
    1.  The DocFX site has a feature that allows users to submit feedback, which is then included in a "Feedback" section of the documentation.
    2.  The feedback text is stored in a file, and the file path is constructed using a user-provided ID: `[!include[Feedback](feedback/{user_id}.md)]`.
    3.  An attacker submits feedback with a `user_id` of `../../../../etc/passwd`.
    4.  DocFX includes the contents of `/etc/passwd` in the generated documentation, exposing sensitive system information.

*   **Scenario 2: RFI via Custom Plugin:**
    1.  A custom DocFX plugin is used to display "related articles" from an external source.
    2.  The plugin takes a URL as input, fetches the content from that URL, and includes it in the documentation.
    3.  An attacker provides a URL pointing to a malicious JavaScript file: `http://attacker.com/malicious.js`.
    4.  The plugin fetches and includes the malicious JavaScript, leading to XSS or potentially RCE if the JavaScript can interact with the DocFX build process.

*   **Scenario 3: LFI via docfx.json manipulation:**
    1.  The `docfx.json` is generated by a script that takes user input to determine which files to include.
    2.  An attacker provides input that modifies the `files` section to include `../../../../etc/passwd`.
    3.  DocFX includes the contents of `/etc/passwd` during the next build.

### 4.3. Risk Assessment

*   **Likelihood:**  Medium to High.  The likelihood depends heavily on how DocFX is configured and whether user input influences file paths.  If user input is involved, the likelihood is high.  If file inclusion is limited to trusted sources, the likelihood is lower.
*   **Impact:**  High to Critical.  LFI can lead to information disclosure, potentially revealing sensitive data like configuration files, source code, or user credentials.  RFI can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), giving the attacker complete control over the server.
*   **Overall Risk:**  High to Critical.  Due to the potential for RCE and significant information disclosure, file inclusion vulnerabilities in DocFX must be treated as a high priority.

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

*   **1. Disable Unnecessary Inclusion Features:**  If Markdown includes, code snippets, or custom plugins are not required, disable them entirely.  This is the most effective way to eliminate the risk.

*   **2. Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Never Trust User Input:**  Treat *all* user input as potentially malicious.
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Characters:**  If user input *must* be used to construct file paths, define a strict whitelist of allowed characters (e.g., alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens).  Reject any input that contains other characters.
    *   **Normalize Paths:**  Use a library function (e.g., `Path.GetFullPath` in .NET) to normalize file paths and resolve any relative path components (`..`, `.`) *before* using them.  This helps prevent directory traversal attacks.
    *   **Validate File Extensions:**  Enforce a strict whitelist of allowed file extensions (e.g., `.md`, `.cs`, `.txt`).  Reject any files with potentially dangerous extensions (e.g., `.js`, `.exe`, `.dll`).
    *   **Reject Suspicious Patterns:**  Specifically reject input containing common directory traversal sequences (`../`, `..\\`, `%2e%2e%2f`).

*   **3. Use a Strict Whitelist of Allowed Paths:**
    *   **Define a Root Directory:**  Specify a dedicated root directory for all files that DocFX is allowed to access.  This directory should be outside of the web root and have minimal permissions.
    *   **Construct Absolute Paths:**  Always construct absolute file paths relative to the defined root directory.  Never use relative paths based on user input.
    *   **Verify Paths:**  Before accessing a file, verify that the constructed absolute path starts with the allowed root directory.  Reject any paths that do not.

*   **4. Secure Web Server Configuration:**
    *   **Disable Directory Listing:**  Ensure that directory listing is disabled on the web server to prevent attackers from browsing the file system.
    *   **Configure File Type Handling:**  Configure the web server to only serve specific file types (e.g., `.html`, `.css`, `.js`, `.md`).  Do not allow the server to execute arbitrary file types.
    *   **Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF can help detect and block common web attacks, including directory traversal and file inclusion attempts.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the DocFX build process and the web server with the least privileges necessary.  Do not run them as root or administrator.

*   **5. Secure Custom Plugins:**
    *   **Thorough Code Review:**  Carefully review the code of any custom plugins for file inclusion vulnerabilities.
    *   **Apply the Same Mitigation Strategies:**  Apply the same input validation, sanitization, and whitelisting techniques to custom plugins as you would to the core DocFX configuration.

*   **6. Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   **Conduct regular security audits** of the DocFX project and its deployment environment.
    *   **Perform penetration testing** to identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities.

*   **7. Keep DocFX and Dependencies Updated:**
    *   Regularly update DocFX and all of its dependencies to the latest versions to patch any known security vulnerabilities. Use dependency checking tools.

* **8. Sandboxing (Advanced):** Consider running the DocFX build process within a sandboxed environment (e.g., a container) to limit the impact of any successful exploits.

## 5. Conclusion

File inclusion vulnerabilities pose a significant risk to DocFX-based documentation sites. By carefully reviewing the configuration, implementing strict input validation and sanitization, and following the mitigation strategies outlined above, the risk of LFI and RFI can be significantly reduced.  Regular security audits and penetration testing are essential to ensure the ongoing security of the site. The most important principle is to *never* trust user input when constructing file paths and to use a whitelist approach whenever possible.
