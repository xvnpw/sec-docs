Okay, let's perform a deep analysis of the "Template Injection (Custom Templates)" attack surface in DocFX.

## Deep Analysis: Template Injection in DocFX Custom Templates

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with template injection vulnerabilities in DocFX when using custom templates, identify specific attack vectors, and propose robust mitigation strategies beyond the initial high-level recommendations.  We aim to provide actionable guidance for developers to prevent and remediate such vulnerabilities.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the use of custom templates within DocFX.  It covers both client-side (XSS) and server-side (SSTI/RCE) template injection vulnerabilities.  We will consider the following template engines commonly used with DocFX:

*   Handlebars
*   Liquid

We will *not* cover vulnerabilities in DocFX's built-in templates, as that falls under a separate attack surface.  We will also not cover general web application security issues unrelated to template injection.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identify potential attackers, their motivations, and the assets they might target.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Examine the DocFX architecture and custom template usage patterns to pinpoint specific areas where template injection could occur.
3.  **Exploit Scenario Development:**  Create realistic scenarios demonstrating how an attacker could exploit identified vulnerabilities.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**  Develop detailed, practical mitigation strategies, including code examples and configuration recommendations.
5.  **Tooling and Testing:**  Recommend tools and testing techniques to detect and prevent template injection vulnerabilities.

### 2. Threat Modeling

*   **Attacker Profiles:**
    *   **Malicious User:**  A user of the system (if user input is allowed to influence template rendering) who aims to inject malicious code for XSS or SSTI.
    *   **External Attacker:**  An attacker who can submit crafted input to the system (e.g., through forms, API calls, or other input vectors) that influences template rendering.
    *   **Compromised Contributor:**  An attacker who has gained access to the DocFX project's source code or build process and can modify templates directly.

*   **Motivations:**
    *   **Data Theft:** Stealing sensitive information (cookies, session tokens, user data) via XSS.
    *   **System Compromise:**  Gaining remote code execution (RCE) via SSTI to take control of the server.
    *   **Defacement:**  Altering the appearance of the generated documentation site.
    *   **Malware Distribution:**  Injecting malicious scripts to infect visitors' browsers.

*   **Targeted Assets:**
    *   **User Browsers:**  (For XSS attacks)
    *   **DocFX Build Server:** (For SSTI/RCE attacks)
    *   **Generated Documentation Website:** (For defacement or malware distribution)
    *   **Sensitive Data:** (Accessed via XSS or RCE)

### 3. Vulnerability Analysis

DocFX's architecture allows for custom templates to be used for rendering documentation.  This flexibility introduces the risk of template injection if user-provided data is incorporated into these templates without proper sanitization and escaping.

**Specific Vulnerable Areas:**

*   **User-Provided Metadata:** If DocFX is configured to use user-supplied metadata (e.g., from YAML front matter, external data sources, or command-line arguments) within custom templates, this is a primary injection point.
*   **Custom Template Logic:**  If templates use user data within conditional statements (`if`), loops (`each`), or other logic constructs, this increases the attack surface.  Even seemingly safe operations can become vulnerable if the template engine has subtle security quirks.
*   **Unescaped Helpers:**  Custom Handlebars or Liquid helpers that process user data without proper escaping are highly vulnerable.
*   **Dynamic Template Loading:** If the application loads templates from user-controlled locations (e.g., a database or file system path specified by the user), this could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary templates.
* **DocFX Configuration:** If the DocFX configuration file (`docfx.json`) itself is susceptible to injection (e.g., through an insecure API or configuration management system), an attacker could modify the template paths or other settings to introduce vulnerabilities.

### 4. Exploit Scenario Development

**Scenario 1: XSS via Metadata Injection (Handlebars)**

1.  **Vulnerable Template:**  A custom Handlebars template (`article.html.hbs`) includes the following:

    ```handlebars
    <h1>{{title}}</h1>
    <p>Author: {{author}}</p>
    ```

2.  **User Input:**  An attacker provides a malicious author name via a YAML front matter field:

    ```yaml
    ---
    title: My Article
    author: <script>alert('XSS');</script>
    ---
    ```

3.  **Exploitation:**  DocFX renders the template, injecting the malicious script into the generated HTML.  When a user views the page, the `alert('XSS')` script executes.  A more sophisticated attacker could steal cookies or redirect the user to a malicious site.

**Scenario 2: SSTI/RCE via Metadata Injection (Liquid)**

1.  **Vulnerable Template:** A custom Liquid template (`page.html.liquid`) includes:

    ```liquid
    <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <p>{{ page.description }}</p>
    ```

2.  **User Input:** An attacker provides a malicious description via a YAML front matter field, exploiting a known Liquid vulnerability (hypothetical, for demonstration):

    ```yaml
    ---
    title: My Article
    description: {{ 'system("id")' | execute_command }}
    ---
    ```
    (Note: This is a *hypothetical* example.  The actual syntax for exploiting Liquid SSTI would depend on the specific Liquid implementation and its configuration.)

3.  **Exploitation:**  If the `execute_command` filter (or a similar vulnerability) exists and is not properly sandboxed, DocFX might execute the `id` command on the server during static site generation, revealing information about the server.  A more sophisticated attacker could use this to achieve RCE.

**Scenario 3: XSS via Unescaped Helper (Handlebars)**

1.  **Vulnerable Helper:** A custom Handlebars helper (`formatName.js`) is defined:

    ```javascript
    Handlebars.registerHelper('formatName', function(name) {
      return "<strong>" + name + "</strong>"; // No escaping!
    });
    ```

2.  **Vulnerable Template:**

    ```handlebars
    <p>Formatted Name: {{formatName author}}</p>
    ```

3.  **User Input:**

    ```yaml
    ---
    author: <img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
    ---
    ```

4.  **Exploitation:** The helper directly concatenates the user-provided `author` string without escaping, leading to XSS.

### 5. Mitigation Strategy Refinement

**5.1. Strict and Contextual Escaping (Primary Defense):**

*   **Handlebars:**
    *   Use `{{{triple-braces}}}` for *intentional* HTML output (rarely needed, and only with thoroughly sanitized data).
    *   Use `{{double-braces}}` for *all other* cases.  Handlebars automatically performs HTML escaping in this context.
    *   For JavaScript contexts (e.g., within `<script>` tags or event handlers), use a dedicated JavaScript escaping library (e.g., `DOMPurify` or a similar library).  *Do not rely on Handlebars for JavaScript escaping.*
    *   For URL contexts, use `encodeURIComponent`.

*   **Liquid:**
    *   Use the `escape` filter for HTML escaping: `{{ variable | escape }}`.
    *   Use the `url_encode` filter for URL encoding: `{{ variable | url_encode }}`.
    *   Liquid does not have built-in JavaScript escaping.  Use a separate JavaScript escaping library if needed.
    *   Be extremely cautious with filters that might execute code (e.g., custom filters).  Avoid them if possible.

**5.2. Avoid User Data in Template Logic:**

*   Minimize the use of user-provided data within `if` statements, loops, or other logic constructs.  If necessary, pre-process the data *before* passing it to the template, ensuring it's in a safe, predictable format.

**5.3. Secure Custom Helpers:**

*   *Always* escape user-provided data within custom helpers.  Use the appropriate escaping functions for the context (HTML, JavaScript, URL).
*   Consider using a linter (e.g., ESLint with security plugins) to detect potential escaping issues in helper code.

**5.4. Input Validation and Sanitization:**

*   Implement strict input validation on *all* user-provided data that might be used in templates.  Validate data types, lengths, and allowed characters.
*   Use a sanitization library (e.g., `DOMPurify`) to remove potentially dangerous HTML tags and attributes from user input *before* it's used in templates.  This is a defense-in-depth measure.

**5.5. Content Security Policy (CSP):**

*   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) for the generated documentation site.  This can mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities by restricting the sources from which scripts can be loaded.  A strict CSP can prevent injected scripts from executing.

**5.6. Sandboxing (for SSTI):**

*   If using a template engine that supports sandboxing (e.g., some Liquid implementations), enable and configure it to restrict the capabilities of the template engine.  This can prevent access to sensitive system resources.
*   Consider running the DocFX build process in a sandboxed environment (e.g., a Docker container with limited privileges) to minimize the impact of a successful SSTI attack.

**5.7. Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**

*   Conduct regular security audits of the DocFX project, including the custom templates and configuration.
*   Perform penetration testing to identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities.

**5.8. Dependency Management:**

*   Keep DocFX and all its dependencies (including template engine libraries) up to date to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Use a dependency vulnerability scanner (e.g., `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, or a dedicated security tool) to identify and address vulnerable dependencies.

**5.9. Least Privilege:**

*   Run the DocFX build process with the least privileges necessary.  Avoid running it as root or with unnecessary permissions.

### 6. Tooling and Testing

*   **Static Analysis Tools:**
    *   **ESLint:** With security plugins (e.g., `eslint-plugin-security`, `eslint-plugin-no-unsanitized`) to detect potential escaping issues in JavaScript code (including Handlebars helpers).
    *   **Template Engine-Specific Linters:**  Some template engines have dedicated linters that can detect security issues.
*   **Dynamic Analysis Tools:**
    *   **Web Application Scanners:**  Tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and Acunetix can be used to scan the generated documentation site for XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Fuzzers:**  Fuzzing tools can be used to generate a large number of inputs to test for unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Manual Code Review:**
    *   Thoroughly review all custom templates and related code for potential injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Pay close attention to the use of user-provided data and escaping.
*   **Unit and Integration Tests:**
    *   Write unit tests for custom helpers to ensure they properly escape user input.
    *   Write integration tests to verify that the entire DocFX build process is secure and does not introduce vulnerabilities.
* **CSP Evaluators:**
    * Use online CSP evaluators (like Google's CSP Evaluator) to check the effectiveness of your Content Security Policy.

### Conclusion

Template injection in DocFX custom templates is a serious security concern, potentially leading to XSS and even RCE. By following the detailed mitigation strategies outlined above, developers can significantly reduce the risk of these vulnerabilities.  A combination of strict escaping, input validation, secure coding practices, and regular security testing is essential to ensure the security of DocFX-generated documentation.  The most important takeaway is to *never* trust user input and to *always* escape it appropriately before including it in templates.
