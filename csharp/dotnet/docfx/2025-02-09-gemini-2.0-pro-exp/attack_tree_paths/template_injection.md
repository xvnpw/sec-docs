# Deep Analysis of DocFX Attack Tree Path: Template Injection

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Template Injection" attack path within the DocFX application, identify specific vulnerabilities, assess the associated risks, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies.  We aim to provide the development team with a clear understanding of how an attacker might exploit template injection vulnerabilities and how to effectively prevent such attacks.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on the "Template Injection" attack path (1.1 & 1.1.1.2) as described in the provided attack tree.  This includes:

*   **DocFX's Template Engine:**  Understanding the specific template engine(s) used by DocFX (e.g., Mustache, Liquid, or custom implementations) and their inherent security features (or lack thereof).  We'll focus on the *current* version of DocFX and its dependencies.
*   **Custom Template Usage:**  Analyzing how DocFX projects typically utilize custom templates, including common patterns and potential areas where user-supplied data might be incorporated unsafely.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Evaluating the existing input validation and sanitization mechanisms within DocFX related to template processing.  This includes identifying any weaknesses or bypass techniques.
*   **Build Process Integration:**  Understanding how the template rendering process integrates with the overall DocFX build process and the potential for code execution on the build server.
*   **Access Control:**  Reviewing how access to template files is managed and the implications of unauthorized modification.

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will perform a static analysis of the DocFX source code (available on GitHub) to identify:
    *   The template engine(s) used.
    *   How user input is handled and passed to the template engine.
    *   The presence (or absence) of input validation and sanitization routines.
    *   The mechanisms for loading and processing custom templates.
    *   Error handling and logging related to template processing.

2.  **Documentation Review:**  We will thoroughly review the official DocFX documentation to understand:
    *   Best practices for using custom templates.
    *   Any documented security considerations related to templates.
    *   Configuration options that might affect template security.

3.  **Vulnerability Research:**  We will research known vulnerabilities in the identified template engine(s) and any previously reported security issues related to DocFX and template injection.  This includes searching vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD) and security advisories.

4.  **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Development (Ethical Hacking):**  If feasible and within ethical boundaries, we will attempt to develop a PoC exploit to demonstrate the feasibility of template injection in a controlled environment.  This will help to confirm the vulnerability and assess its impact.  *This step will only be performed with explicit authorization and in a sandboxed environment.*

5.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use threat modeling techniques to identify potential attack scenarios and assess the likelihood and impact of successful exploitation.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Template Injection Attack Path

Based on the provided attack tree path and the methodology outlined above, we can proceed with a detailed analysis.

**2.1. Template Engine Identification and Analysis**

DocFX primarily uses a modified version of [Markdig](https://github.com/lunet-io/markdig) for Markdown processing and a templating system based on [Scriban](https://github.com/scriban/scriban).  Scriban is a fast, powerful, safe, and lightweight scripting language and engine for .NET.  While Scriban is generally considered secure *when used correctly*, improper configuration or usage can still lead to vulnerabilities.

*   **Scriban Security Features:** Scriban offers features like:
    *   **Limited Functionality:** By default, Scriban restricts access to potentially dangerous .NET methods and objects.
    *   **Object Model Control:**  Developers can explicitly control which objects and properties are exposed to the template.
    *   **Syntax Restrictions:**  Scriban's syntax is designed to limit the potential for code injection.

*   **Potential Weaknesses:**
    *   **Custom Functions:**  If DocFX allows users to define custom Scriban functions, these functions could be a source of vulnerabilities if not carefully implemented and validated.
    *   **Unsafe Object Exposure:**  If DocFX exposes too many .NET objects or properties to the template, attackers might be able to leverage these to perform unintended actions.
    *   **Configuration Errors:**  Incorrect configuration of Scriban (e.g., disabling security features) could increase the risk of template injection.
    *   **Bugs in Scriban:** While Scriban is actively maintained, there's always a possibility of undiscovered bugs that could be exploited.

**2.2. Custom Template Usage and Input Handling**

DocFX allows users to create custom templates to control the appearance and structure of the generated documentation.  These templates are typically written in Scriban.  The key vulnerability lies in how user-provided data is incorporated into these templates.

*   **Common Data Sources:**
    *   **YAML Metadata:**  DocFX uses YAML front matter in Markdown files to define metadata.  This metadata is often used in templates.
    *   **`docfx.json` Configuration:**  The `docfx.json` file contains project-level configuration settings, some of which might be used in templates.
    *   **Command-Line Arguments:**  While less common, it's possible that some command-line arguments could influence template rendering.
    *   **External Data Sources:**  Custom templates *could* potentially access external data sources (e.g., databases, APIs), introducing further risks.

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Critical Area):**  This is the most crucial aspect of preventing template injection.  The code review must focus on:
    *   **Where user input is read:**  Identify all locations in the code where data from the sources listed above is read and processed.
    *   **How input is validated:**  Determine if any validation is performed on this data (e.g., type checking, length limits, regular expressions).
    *   **How input is sanitized:**  Check if any sanitization is performed to remove or escape potentially dangerous characters (e.g., `<`, `>`, `{{`, `}}`).
    *   **How input is passed to Scriban:**  Examine how the validated/sanitized data is passed to the Scriban template engine.  Is it passed as a safe object model, or is it directly concatenated into the template string?

**2.3. Build Process Integration and Code Execution**

The DocFX build process involves several steps, including:

1.  **Loading Configuration:**  Reading the `docfx.json` file.
2.  **Parsing Markdown:**  Processing Markdown files and extracting metadata.
3.  **Loading Templates:**  Loading custom templates from the specified directory.
4.  **Rendering Templates:**  Using Scriban to render the templates with the processed data.
5.  **Generating Output:**  Writing the generated HTML files to the output directory.

*   **Code Execution Risk:**  If an attacker can inject malicious Scriban code into a template, this code will be executed during the "Rendering Templates" step.  Since this step runs within the context of the DocFX build process, the attacker could potentially:
    *   **Execute Arbitrary Code:**  Run arbitrary commands on the build server.
    *   **Access Sensitive Data:**  Read files, environment variables, or other sensitive data accessible to the build process.
    *   **Modify the Build Output:**  Inject malicious content into the generated documentation.
    *   **Compromise the Build Server:**  Potentially gain full control of the build server.

**2.4. Access Control**

Access control to the template files is crucial.  If attackers can modify existing templates or upload new malicious templates, they can easily trigger template injection.

*   **Typical Scenarios:**
    *   **Version Control (Git):**  Most DocFX projects are managed using Git.  Access control is typically managed through the Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
    *   **Shared File Systems:**  In some cases, templates might be stored on a shared file system.  Access control would be managed through file system permissions.
    *   **CI/CD Pipelines:**  CI/CD pipelines often have access to the template files.  Securing the CI/CD pipeline is essential.

*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Weak Git Credentials:**  Compromised Git credentials could allow attackers to modify templates.
    *   **Misconfigured File Permissions:**  Incorrect file permissions on a shared file system could allow unauthorized users to modify templates.
    *   **Vulnerable CI/CD Pipeline:**  A compromised CI/CD pipeline could be used to inject malicious templates.

**2.5. Specific Attack Scenarios**

1.  **YAML Metadata Injection:** An attacker submits a pull request with a Markdown file containing malicious YAML front matter designed to exploit a Scriban vulnerability or bypass input validation.  When the documentation is built, the injected code executes.

2.  **`docfx.json` Manipulation:**  An attacker gains access to the `docfx.json` file and modifies it to include malicious template code or to disable security features.

3.  **Custom Template Modification:**  An attacker with write access to the template directory modifies an existing template or uploads a new malicious template.

4.  **Scriban Vulnerability Exploitation:**  An attacker discovers a zero-day vulnerability in Scriban and crafts a template that exploits this vulnerability.

**2.6. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)**

Based on the analysis above, the following mitigation strategies are recommended:

1.  **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (Highest Priority):**
    *   **Whitelist Approach:**  Instead of trying to blacklist dangerous characters, use a whitelist approach to allow only known-safe characters and patterns.
    *   **Type Validation:**  Ensure that data used in templates is of the expected type (e.g., string, number, boolean).
    *   **Length Limits:**  Enforce reasonable length limits on input data to prevent buffer overflows or other unexpected behavior.
    *   **Regular Expressions:**  Use carefully crafted regular expressions to validate the format of input data.  *Be extremely cautious with regular expressions, as they can be a source of vulnerabilities themselves (e.g., ReDoS).*
    *   **Context-Aware Sanitization:**  Sanitize data based on the context in which it will be used.  For example, escape HTML entities if the data will be displayed in HTML.
    *   **Dedicated Sanitization Library:** Consider using a well-vetted sanitization library specifically designed for template engines or HTML output.

2.  **Secure Scriban Configuration:**
    *   **Restrict Object Model:**  Expose only the necessary objects and properties to the template engine.  Avoid exposing entire .NET objects or classes.
    *   **Disable Unsafe Features:**  Ensure that any unsafe features of Scriban are disabled.  Review the Scriban documentation for security recommendations.
    *   **Regularly Update Scriban:**  Keep Scriban updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.

3.  **Template Auditing:**
    *   **Regular Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular code reviews of custom templates, focusing on how user input is handled.
    *   **Automated Scanning:**  Consider using static analysis tools to automatically scan templates for potential vulnerabilities.

4.  **Sandboxing (If Feasible):**
    *   **AppDomain Sandboxing:**  Explore the possibility of running the template rendering process in a separate AppDomain with restricted permissions.  This can limit the impact of a successful template injection attack.
    *   **Containerization:**  Consider running the DocFX build process within a container (e.g., Docker) to isolate it from the host system.

5.  **Access Control:**
    *   **Strong Authentication:**  Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication for Git repositories and other systems that have access to the template files.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant users and processes only the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   **Secure CI/CD Pipelines:**  Implement security best practices for CI/CD pipelines, including access control, vulnerability scanning, and secret management.

6.  **Output Encoding:**
    *   **HTML Encoding:**  Ensure that all output generated by the templates is properly HTML-encoded to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.  This is a general web security best practice, but it's particularly important in the context of documentation generation.

7.  **Monitoring and Logging:**
    *   **Build Logs:**  Monitor build logs for any suspicious activity or errors related to template processing.
    *   **Security Auditing:**  Implement security auditing to track changes to template files and configuration settings.

8. **Dependency Management:**
    * Regularly update all dependencies, including Markdig and Scriban, to their latest secure versions. Use dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## 3. Conclusion

Template injection is a serious vulnerability that can lead to code execution on the DocFX build server.  By implementing the mitigation strategies outlined in this analysis, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this attack.  The most critical steps are:

*   **Implementing strict input validation and sanitization.**
*   **Securely configuring the Scriban template engine.**
*   **Regularly auditing custom templates.**
*   **Enforcing strong access control to template files.**
*   **Keeping dependencies, especially Scriban, up-to-date.**

This deep analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the template injection attack path and equips the development team with the knowledge to build a more secure DocFX application. Continuous monitoring, regular security assessments, and staying informed about emerging threats are crucial for maintaining the long-term security of the application.
