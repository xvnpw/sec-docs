## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Docfx (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_docfx__critical_node_.md)

* This represents the attacker's ultimate goal. Success at this level means the attacker has achieved significant control over the application or its users.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Docfx Processing (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_docfx_processing__critical_node_.md)

* This category encompasses attacks that directly leverage weaknesses in how Docfx processes input (Markdown, code comments) and generates output. Success here often leads to code execution or the injection of malicious content.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Inject Malicious Code via Markdown (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__inject_malicious_code_via_markdown__high-risk_path_.md)

* This path focuses on exploiting Docfx's Markdown processing capabilities to inject malicious code. The medium likelihood combined with potentially high impact makes this a significant risk.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__server-side_template_injection__ssti___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts malicious Markdown content containing template syntax that is processed by Docfx's template engine on the server. If the template engine is vulnerable or input is not properly sanitized, this malicious syntax can be executed, allowing the attacker to run arbitrary code on the server.
* **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, service disruption.
* **Mitigation:** Sanitize user-provided Markdown content, use secure template engine configurations, implement Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Generated Output (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2__cross-site_scripting__xss__in_generated_output__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious HTML or JavaScript code within Markdown that Docfx fails to sanitize. This malicious code is then included in the generated documentation. When users view this documentation in their browsers, the malicious script executes, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users, or perform other actions on behalf of the user.
* **Impact:** Compromise of end-user accounts, data theft, defacement of documentation.
* **Mitigation:** Implement robust HTML sanitization of Markdown content, use Content Security Policy (CSP), employ Subresource Integrity (SRI) for external resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3. Exploit Dependencies of Docfx (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/1_3__exploit_dependencies_of_docfx__high-risk_path_.md)

* This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in the external libraries and runtime environments that Docfx relies on. The medium likelihood combined with potentially high impact makes this a significant risk.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1. Vulnerable NuGet Packages (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1__vulnerable_nuget_packages__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Docfx depends on various NuGet packages. If any of these packages have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker can potentially exploit these vulnerabilities through Docfx. This could involve using known exploits for those packages.
* **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution, data access, or denial of service.
* **Mitigation:** Regularly update Docfx and all its NuGet dependencies, use vulnerability scanning tools to identify vulnerable packages, consider using a software bill of materials (SBOM).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.2. Vulnerabilities in Node.js or other runtime dependencies (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_2__vulnerabilities_in_node_js_or_other_runtime_dependencies__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Docfx runs on a runtime environment, typically Node.js. If the Node.js installation or other runtime dependencies have security vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the server.
* **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, service disruption.
* **Mitigation:** Keep Node.js and other runtime dependencies up-to-date, follow security best practices for the runtime environment, implement system-level security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1. Modify `docfx.json` to execute arbitrary commands (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1__modify__docfx_json__to_execute_arbitrary_commands__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** If an attacker gains access to the `docfx.json` configuration file (e.g., through a compromised development environment or insecure file permissions), they can modify it to include malicious scripts or commands within the Docfx build pipeline. These commands will then be executed when Docfx builds the documentation.
* **Impact:** Full server compromise, data manipulation, service disruption.
* **Mitigation:** Secure access to Docfx configuration files, implement file integrity monitoring, run the Docfx build process with minimal privileges.
