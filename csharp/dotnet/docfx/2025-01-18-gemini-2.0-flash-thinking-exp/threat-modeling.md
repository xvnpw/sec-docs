# Threat Model Analysis for dotnet/docfx

## Threat: [Malicious Markdown Injection leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/malicious_markdown_injection_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious Markdown code into documentation source files. When DocFX processes these files using its Markdown rendering engine, the malicious code is rendered into the generated HTML documentation. When a user views this documentation, the injected script executes in their browser.
    *   **Impact:**  The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser within the context of the documentation site, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement.
    *   **Affected Component:**  DocFX's Markdown rendering engine (likely within the `Microsoft.DocAsCode.Markdig` or similar module).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization of Markdown content *before* processing by DocFX.
        *   Configure DocFX to use a secure Markdown rendering engine with robust XSS prevention mechanisms.
        *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) headers on the deployed documentation website to mitigate the impact of successful XSS.
        *   Regularly review and audit documentation source files for any suspicious or potentially malicious content.

## Threat: [Malicious Code Comment Injection leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/malicious_code_comment_injection_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code snippets or HTML within code comments in source code files that are processed by DocFX. If DocFX's code comment processing logic renders these comments directly into the documentation without proper sanitization, the malicious code can execute in the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:**  Similar to Markdown injection, leading to potential session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection, or defacement.
    *   **Affected Component:** DocFX's code comment processing logic (potentially within modules handling specific programming languages like `Microsoft.DocAsCode.Common` or language-specific plugins).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization of code comments *before* processing by DocFX.
        *   Configure DocFX to securely render code comments, ensuring HTML and JavaScript are properly escaped.
        *   Utilize CSP headers on the deployed documentation website.
        *   Educate developers about the risks of including potentially malicious content in code comments.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_leading_to_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** DocFX relies on various third-party libraries and components. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on the server running the DocFX build process.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the DocFX build server, potentially leading to data breaches, malware installation, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Various third-party dependencies used by DocFX (e.g., NuGet packages, npm packages if used in the build process).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update DocFX and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk) to identify and address known vulnerabilities in DocFX's dependencies.
        *   Monitor security advisories for DocFX and its dependencies.
