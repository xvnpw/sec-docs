# Attack Surface Analysis for dotnet/docfx

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Markdown/YAML Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_markdownyaml_injection.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Markdown/YAML Injection
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code (e.g., JavaScript) within Markdown or YAML files that DocFX processes.
    *   **How DocFX Contributes:** DocFX parses and renders Markdown and YAML content. If **it** doesn't properly sanitize or escape user-provided content, malicious scripts can be embedded in the generated HTML.
    *   **Example:** A user submits a Markdown file containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When **DocFX** generates the documentation, this script is included in the HTML and executed in a visitor's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), leading to potential session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or other client-side attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and escape user-provided content **before processing it with DocFX**.
        *   Configure **DocFX** to use a strict content security policy (CSP) to limit the execution of inline scripts.
        *   Regularly review and update **DocFX** to the latest version, as updates often include security fixes.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Generated HTML](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_generated_html.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Generated HTML
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in **DocFX's** rendering engine lead to the generation of HTML containing XSS vulnerabilities, even if the input Markdown/YAML is not directly malicious.
    *   **How DocFX Contributes:** **DocFX** transforms Markdown and YAML into HTML. Flaws in **this transformation process** can introduce XSS if output is not properly encoded.
    *   **Example:** **DocFX** might not correctly escape certain characters in code blocks or inline code, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute when users view the documentation.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), leading to potential session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or other client-side attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure **DocFX** is updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for rendering vulnerabilities.
        *   Review the generated HTML output for potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in DocFX Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_docfx_plugins.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in DocFX Plugins
    *   **Description:** Third-party **DocFX** plugins may contain security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How DocFX Contributes:** **DocFX's** plugin architecture allows extending its functionality. If these plugins are not secure, they can introduce vulnerabilities **within the DocFX process**.
    *   **Example:** A plugin might have an XSS vulnerability or allow arbitrary file access **during DocFX execution**.
    *   **Impact:** The impact depends on the plugin's functionality and the nature of the vulnerability, ranging from XSS to remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the plugin vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only use plugins from trusted sources.
        *   Review the code of plugins before using them.
        *   Keep plugins updated to the latest versions.
        *   Consider the principle of least privilege when configuring plugin permissions **within DocFX**.
