## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Version Control System -> Gain Access to Docfx Configuration Files -> Modify Docfx Configuration to Execute Malicious Code -> Inject Malicious Scripts via `postProcessors` or `plugins` configuration](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_version_control_system_-_gain_access_to_docfx_configuration_files_-_modify_docfx_configur_c6e062c0.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker compromises the Version Control System (e.g., Git repository) where the Docfx project and configuration files are stored. This could be through exploiting VCS vulnerabilities or weak credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Successful VCS compromise grants access to sensitive configuration files, including `docfx.json`.
    *   **Next Step:** Attacker gains access to `docfx.json` and other configuration files.
    *   **Further Step:** Attacker modifies the Docfx configuration to inject malicious scripts. This is achieved by configuring `postProcessors` or `plugins` in `docfx.json` to load and execute attacker-controlled scripts during the documentation generation process.
    *   **Final Impact:** Code execution on the server during documentation build, leading to potential data breach, service disruption, or further system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server Misconfiguration -> Gain Access to Docfx Configuration Files -> Modify Docfx Configuration to Execute Malicious Code -> Inject Malicious Scripts via `postProcessors` or `plugins` configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server_misconfiguration_-_gain_access_to_docfx_configuration_files_-_modify_docfx_configurat_da3b88e1.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker exploits server misconfigurations, such as exposed `.git` folders or insecure file permissions on the web server hosting the Docfx project.
    *   **Impact:** Server misconfiguration allows direct access to Docfx configuration files from the web.
    *   **Next Step:** Attacker gains access to `docfx.json` and other configuration files through the server misconfiguration.
    *   **Further Step:** Attacker modifies the Docfx configuration to inject malicious scripts via `postProcessors` or `plugins` as described in path 1.
    *   **Final Impact:** Code execution on the server during documentation build, leading to potential data breach, service disruption, or further system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering/Phishing developers -> Gain Access to Docfx Configuration Files -> Modify Docfx Configuration to Execute Malicious Code -> Inject Malicious Scripts via `postProcessors` or `plugins` configuration](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineeringphishing_developers_-_gain_access_to_docfx_configuration_files_-_modify_docfx_conf_3a0b0c5f.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker uses social engineering or phishing techniques to target developers who have access to the Docfx project and configuration files.
    *   **Impact:** Successful social engineering can trick developers into revealing credentials, modifying configuration files directly, or downloading and executing malicious payloads that compromise their systems and potentially grant access to configuration files.
    *   **Next Step:** Attacker gains access to `docfx.json` and other configuration files through compromised developer accounts or systems.
    *   **Further Step:** Attacker modifies the Docfx configuration to inject malicious scripts via `postProcessors` or `plugins` as described in path 1.
    *   **Final Impact:** Code execution on the server during documentation build, leading to potential data breach, service disruption, or further system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Popular Docfx Plugins -> Identify Vulnerable Docfx Plugins -> Exploit Docfx Plugin Vulnerabilities -> Inject Malicious Plugin into Docfx Environment](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_popular_docfx_plugins_-_identify_vulnerable_docfx_plugins_-_exploit_d95abd1a.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker identifies known vulnerabilities in popular Docfx plugins by searching vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD).
    *   **Impact:** If the application uses a vulnerable plugin, it becomes a target for exploitation.
    *   **Next Step:** Attacker identifies that the target application uses a vulnerable Docfx plugin.
    *   **Further Step:** Attacker exploits the known vulnerability in the plugin. This might involve crafting specific input or requests that trigger the vulnerability in the plugin code.
    *   **Final Impact:** Code execution via the vulnerable plugin, potentially leading to full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [User-Controlled Data in Documentation Content (Markdown, YAML) Processed by Templates -> Identify Injection Points in Docfx Templates -> Exploit Docfx Templating Engine Vulnerabilities (LiquidJS) -> Exploit Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in LiquidJS](./attack_tree_paths/user-controlled_data_in_documentation_content__markdown__yaml__processed_by_templates_-_identify_inj_2cc1e268.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker identifies that Docfx templates process user-controlled data from documentation content (Markdown, YAML).
    *   **Impact:** User-controlled data processed by templates creates potential injection points for Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI).
    *   **Next Step:** Attacker identifies injection points in Docfx templates where user-controlled data is processed without proper sanitization.
    *   **Further Step:** Attacker crafts malicious LiquidJS code and injects it into documentation content (e.g., Markdown files).
    *   **Final Impact:** When Docfx generates documentation, the malicious LiquidJS code is processed by the LiquidJS templating engine, leading to Server-Side Template Injection and potential code execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Docfx Dependencies -> Identify Vulnerable Dependencies -> Exploit Docfx Dependency Vulnerabilities -> Trigger Vulnerability during Docfx Execution](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_docfx_dependencies_-_identify_vulnerable_dependencies_-_exploit_doc_60fca909.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker identifies known vulnerabilities in Docfx's dependencies (Node.js, npm packages) using vulnerability scanning tools or public vulnerability databases.
    *   **Impact:** If Docfx uses vulnerable dependencies, it becomes susceptible to exploitation through these dependencies.
    *   **Next Step:** Attacker identifies that Docfx project uses vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Further Step:** Attacker exploits the known vulnerability in a Docfx dependency. This might be triggered automatically when Docfx executes code that utilizes the vulnerable dependency.
    *   **Final Impact:** Code execution or Denial of Service due to the exploited dependency vulnerability during Docfx execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Markdown, YAML, or Code Parsers used by Docfx -> Identify Vulnerabilities in Docfx Parsers -> Exploit Input Processing Vulnerabilities in Docfx Parsers -> Craft Malicious Input to Trigger Parser Vulnerability -> Achieve Code Execution or Denial of Service](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_markdown__yaml__or_code_parsers_used_by_docfx_-_identify_vulnerabil_5d00bb11.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker identifies known vulnerabilities in the parsers used by Docfx to process input formats like Markdown, YAML, or code files.
    *   **Impact:** Parser vulnerabilities can be exploited to achieve code execution or Denial of Service.
    *   **Next Step:** Attacker identifies that Docfx uses a parser with known vulnerabilities for a specific input format.
    *   **Further Step:** Attacker crafts malicious input (e.g., a specially crafted Markdown file) designed to trigger the parser vulnerability.
    *   **Final Impact:** When Docfx parses the malicious input, the parser vulnerability is triggered, potentially leading to code execution on the server or Denial of Service of the documentation generation process.
