# Threat Model Analysis for dotnet/docfx

## Threat: [Malicious Markdown Injection Leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/malicious_markdown_injection_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code within Markdown files that are processed by DocFX. DocFX's rendering engine might not properly sanitize this input, leading to the execution of the malicious script in the user's browser when they view the generated documentation. This is a direct vulnerability in how DocFX processes and renders Markdown.
    *   **Impact:**  The attacker could steal user cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, deface the documentation, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Markdown Rendering Module (within DocFX)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization of all Markdown content *before* processing by DocFX.
        *   Utilize DocFX's built-in security features or plugins (if available and trustworthy) that offer XSS protection within the DocFX rendering pipeline.
        *   Employ a Content Security Policy (CSP) on the web server hosting the documentation to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources (as a defense-in-depth measure).

## Threat: [Malicious YAML Injection Leading to Arbitrary Code Execution](./threats/malicious_yaml_injection_leading_to_arbitrary_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could craft malicious YAML files that, when processed by DocFX, exploit vulnerabilities in DocFX's YAML parsing functionality or its handling of YAML data. This could lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the server running DocFX. This is a direct risk stemming from DocFX's ability to parse and interpret YAML.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the server running DocFX, allowing the attacker to access sensitive data, modify files, or launch further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** YAML Parsing Module (within DocFX)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep DocFX and its internal YAML parsing dependencies updated to the latest versions with security patches.
        *   Restrict access to the server running DocFX and the directories containing documentation source files.
        *   Avoid processing YAML files from untrusted sources.

## Threat: [Template Injection Leading to Information Disclosure or Code Execution](./threats/template_injection_leading_to_information_disclosure_or_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** If DocFX uses a templating engine (e.g., Liquid) and allows user-controlled input to influence the template rendering process, an attacker could inject malicious template code. This could allow them to access sensitive data or potentially execute arbitrary code within the DocFX process. This directly relates to DocFX's templating capabilities.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive information, potential compromise of the server running DocFX.
    *   **Affected Component:** Template Rendering Engine (within DocFX)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid allowing user-controlled input to directly influence template rendering within DocFX.
        *   Implement strict sanitization and escaping of any user-provided data used in templates by DocFX.
        *   Keep the templating engine used by DocFX updated with security patches.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in DocFX's Core Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_docfx's_core_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** DocFX relies on various third-party libraries. These core dependencies (those bundled with or directly used by DocFX itself, not necessarily plugin dependencies) could contain known security vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit if DocFX is using a vulnerable version. This is a risk inherent in DocFX's architecture and dependency management.
    *   **Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, ranging from information disclosure to arbitrary code execution on the DocFX server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Dependency Management (within DocFX)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update DocFX to benefit from updates to its core dependencies.
        *   Utilize software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify and track known vulnerabilities in DocFX's direct dependencies.

## Threat: [Elevation of Privilege due to DocFX Vulnerabilities](./threats/elevation_of_privilege_due_to_docfx_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within DocFX itself could allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges on the system where DocFX is running. This would be a direct flaw in the DocFX application's code or design.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the system where DocFX is running.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various components depending on the specific vulnerability (e.g., processing engine, file handling).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep DocFX updated with the latest security patches.
        *   Run DocFX with the least privileges necessary for its operation.
        *   Implement security best practices for the server or environment where DocFX is executed.
