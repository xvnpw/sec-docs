## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Content into Generated Documentation to Compromise End-Users](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_content_into_generated_documentation_to_compromise_end-users.md)

*   This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means they have managed to inject malicious content into the documentation generated by Docfx, which can then compromise users who view this documentation. This could involve various types of malicious content, leading to actions like stealing credentials, redirecting users to phishing sites, or executing arbitrary code in their browsers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Docfx](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_docfx.md)

*   This critical node focuses on directly exploiting weaknesses within the Docfx application itself. If successful, an attacker can leverage these vulnerabilities to inject malicious content during the documentation generation process. This bypasses the intended functionality of Docfx and directly manipulates its output.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Markdown Rendering Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_markdown_rendering_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This path exploits Docfx's process of converting Markdown files into HTML. If Docfx doesn't properly sanitize user-provided Markdown, an attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code. This code will then be included in the generated HTML documentation and executed in the browsers of users viewing the documentation, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious HTML/JavaScript via Markdown (e.g., XSS)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_htmljavascript_via_markdown__e_g___xss_.md)

*   This path exploits Docfx's process of converting Markdown files into HTML. If Docfx doesn't properly sanitize user-provided Markdown, an attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code. This code will then be included in the generated HTML documentation and executed in the browsers of users viewing the documentation, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Client-Side Template Injection (CSTI)](./attack_tree_paths/client-side_template_injection__csti_.md)

*   If Docfx utilizes a client-side templating engine, vulnerabilities in this engine can be exploited. Attackers can inject malicious code into template expressions within the documentation source. When the generated documentation is viewed in a user's browser, this malicious code is interpreted and executed by the templating engine within the browser, potentially leading to client-side attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Docfx relies on various third-party libraries and packages. This path involves exploiting known security vulnerabilities present in these dependencies. Attackers can leverage these vulnerabilities to inject malicious content or gain unauthorized access during the Docfx processing or when the generated documentation is served.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Input to Docfx](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_input_to_docfx.md)

*   This critical node centers around influencing the data that Docfx processes. By manipulating the input, attackers can introduce malicious content that Docfx will then incorporate into the generated documentation. This can be achieved through various means, such as malicious pull requests or compromising the source repository.

## Attack Tree Path: [Pull Request Poisoning](./attack_tree_paths/pull_request_poisoning.md)

*   If the documentation source is managed using a version control system like Git, attackers can submit malicious pull requests. These pull requests can contain crafted Markdown files with embedded malicious HTML or JavaScript. If these pull requests are merged without thorough review, the malicious content will be incorporated into the documentation source and subsequently into the generated documentation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Markdown/Code in Documentation Source](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_markdowncode_in_documentation_source.md)

*   If the documentation source is managed using a version control system like Git, attackers can submit malicious pull requests. These pull requests can contain crafted Markdown files with embedded malicious HTML or JavaScript. If these pull requests are merged without thorough review, the malicious content will be incorporated into the documentation source and subsequently into the generated documentation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Source Repository](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_source_repository.md)

*   This path involves a more direct attack where an attacker gains unauthorized access to the repository where the documentation source files are stored. Once inside, they can directly modify the Markdown files or other relevant files to inject malicious content. This bypasses the normal contribution workflow and directly contaminates the source.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Source Repository](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_source_repository.md)

*   This path involves a more direct attack where an attacker gains unauthorized access to the repository where the documentation source files are stored. Once inside, they can directly modify the Markdown files or other relevant files to inject malicious content. This bypasses the normal contribution workflow and directly contaminates the source.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Build Environment](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_build_environment.md)

*   This path targets the infrastructure where Docfx is executed and the documentation is built. If an attacker can compromise the build environment (e.g., the build server), they can manipulate the Docfx execution process or directly modify the generated documentation output before it is deployed. This can lead to the injection of malicious content without directly targeting Docfx's code or input.
