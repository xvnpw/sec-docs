# Attack Surface Analysis for dotnet/docfx

## Attack Surface: [Markdown and Code Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/markdown_and_code_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:**  Docfx parses Markdown and code files to generate documentation. Vulnerabilities in these parsing processes can be exploited.
    * **How Docfx Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Docfx's core functionality involves interpreting and rendering these input formats. Any flaws in its parsing logic directly create potential attack vectors.
    * **Example:** A developer includes a Markdown file containing a specially crafted `<script>` tag within a comment, which Docfx fails to sanitize, leading to JavaScript execution in the generated HTML when a user views the documentation.
    * **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), potentially Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if Docfx attempts to fetch external resources based on input.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Docfx to benefit from security patches in its parsing libraries.
        * Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) on the web server hosting the documentation to mitigate the impact of XSS.
        * Consider using linters or security analysis tools on the Markdown and code files before processing with Docfx.

## Attack Surface: [Theme and Template Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/theme_and_template_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Docfx uses themes and templates (often using Liquid or similar templating languages) to structure and style the generated documentation. Vulnerabilities in these themes or custom templates can be exploited.
    * **How Docfx Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Docfx relies on these themes to render the final output. If a theme allows for the injection of arbitrary code, Docfx indirectly facilitates the vulnerability.
    * **Example:** A custom theme uses a templating construct that allows for the execution of arbitrary code if a specific value is present in the input data (even if that data originates from the source code or configuration). This could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the build server.
    * **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the build server, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the generated documentation if the template doesn't properly escape output.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical (for RCE), High (for XSS)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly review and audit custom themes for potential vulnerabilities.
        * Avoid using user-provided data directly within template expressions without proper sanitization or escaping.
        * If possible, restrict the capabilities of the templating engine to prevent execution of arbitrary code.
        * Consider using well-vetted and maintained official or community themes.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Docfx supports plugins to extend its functionality. Vulnerabilities in these plugins can introduce security risks.
    * **How Docfx Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Docfx's architecture allows for the integration of third-party plugins, expanding its functionality but also the potential attack surface.
    * **Example:** A plugin designed to fetch data from an external API has a vulnerability that allows for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), potentially exposing internal services. Or, a plugin might execute arbitrary code during the build process if provided with malicious input.
    * **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the build server, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), data breaches depending on the plugin's functionality.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Only use trusted and well-maintained plugins.
        * Review the source code of plugins before using them, especially if they perform sensitive operations.
        * Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to benefit from security patches.
        * Implement a process for vetting and approving plugins before they are used in the build process.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Docfx relies on various Node.js packages and other dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can affect Docfx's security.
    * **How Docfx Contributes to the Attack Surface:** By depending on these external libraries, Docfx inherits any vulnerabilities present in them.
    * **Example:** A known security vulnerability exists in a specific version of a Node.js package used by Docfx. This vulnerability could potentially be exploited during the build process or even affect the generated documentation if the vulnerable library is included in the output.
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability in the dependency (e.g., Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Docfx and its dependencies to the latest versions.
        * Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., npm audit, yarn audit, or dedicated security scanners) to identify and address known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        * Consider using a lock file (e.g., `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) to ensure consistent dependency versions across builds.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Misconfigurations in Docfx's settings can create security risks.
    * **How Docfx Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Docfx's behavior is controlled by configuration files. Incorrectly configured settings can expose unintended functionalities or access points.
    * **Example:** The `docfx.json` file might contain paths that allow Docfx to access or modify files outside the intended project directory, potentially leading to information disclosure or file manipulation on the build server.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure, file manipulation on the build server.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Follow secure configuration practices for Docfx.
        * Carefully review and understand all configuration options in `docfx.json` and other configuration files.
        * Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files; use environment variables or secrets management solutions instead.

## Attack Surface: [Build Process Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/build_process_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how Docfx is integrated into the build pipeline can be exploited.
    * **How Docfx Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The way Docfx is invoked and the inputs it receives during the build process can introduce security risks.
    * **Example:** If the command used to execute Docfx in the build script incorporates unsanitized user-provided input, it could lead to command injection on the build server.
    * **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the build server.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Sanitize or avoid using user-provided input directly in the commands used to execute Docfx.
        * Secure the build pipeline itself by following security best practices for CI/CD systems.
        * Limit access to the build environment and restrict who can modify build scripts.
