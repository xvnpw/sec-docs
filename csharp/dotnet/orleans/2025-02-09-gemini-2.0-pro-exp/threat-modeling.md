# Threat Model Analysis for dotnet/orleans

## Threat: [Silo Impersonation](./threats/silo_impersonation.md)

*   **Threat:** Silo Impersonation

    *   **Description:** An attacker introduces a rogue silo into the Orleans cluster. This rogue silo could intercept messages intended for legitimate grains, modify grain state, inject malicious code, or launch further attacks against the system.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data breaches, denial of service, and potential for lateral movement to other systems.
    *   **Orleans Component Affected:** Cluster membership management, Silo-to-silo communication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable and require TLS for all silo-to-silo communication.
        *   Implement a secure membership protocol that requires authentication and authorization for new silos joining the cluster. This often involves using a trusted certificate authority (CA) for silo certificates.
        *   Continuously monitor cluster membership for unexpected changes or unauthorized silos. Alert on any deviations from the expected configuration.

## Threat: [Grain State Tampering (via Malicious Grain)](./threats/grain_state_tampering__via_malicious_grain_.md)

*   **Threat:** Grain State Tampering (via Malicious Grain)

    *   **Description:** A compromised or intentionally malicious grain sends invalid or crafted messages to other grains, attempting to corrupt their state, trigger unexpected behavior, or exploit vulnerabilities in their message handling logic.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, denial of service, potential for code execution within the target grain, and cascading failures.
    *   **Orleans Component Affected:** Grain communication (message passing), Grain state management, Grain method implementation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization in *every* grain's message handlers. Never trust input from other grains, even within the same cluster.
        *   Use immutable data structures for grain state whenever possible to reduce the risk of unintended modification.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege: grains should only have access to the resources (other grains, storage, etc.) they absolutely require.
        *   Consider sandboxing techniques or separate AppDomains (if feasible and performance allows) to isolate grains with different trust levels.

## Threat: [Grain State Tampering (via Storage)](./threats/grain_state_tampering__via_storage_.md)

*   **Threat:** Grain State Tampering (via Storage)

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains direct access to the persistent storage provider (e.g., Azure Table Storage, SQL Server) used by Orleans and modifies grain state directly, bypassing Orleans's internal mechanisms and security checks.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized modification of application state, potential for bypassing security controls implemented within grains.
    *   **Orleans Component Affected:** Grain persistence (storage providers), Grain state management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the storage provider using strong access controls (e.g., RBAC, IAM roles).
        *   Encrypt data at rest and in transit to/from the storage provider.
        *   Implement integrity checks on grain state loaded from storage. This could involve using cryptographic hashes or digital signatures to detect unauthorized modifications.
        *   Choose a storage provider that supports transactional updates to ensure data consistency and prevent partial writes.

## Threat: [Message Tampering (in transit)](./threats/message_tampering__in_transit_.md)

*   **Threat:** Message Tampering (in transit)

    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts and modifies messages exchanged between grains or between clients and silos. This could involve altering message contents, reordering messages, or injecting malicious messages.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized actions, denial of service, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Orleans Component Affected:** Grain communication (message passing), Client-to-silo communication, Silo-to-silo communication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use TLS for *all* communication: client-to-silo and silo-to-silo. This is crucial for protecting message confidentiality and integrity.
        *   For highly sensitive data, consider using message-level encryption or digital signatures in addition to TLS.

## Threat: [Grain Overload (DoS)](./threats/grain_overload__dos_.md)

*   **Threat:** Grain Overload (DoS)

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests to a specific grain, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, network) and preventing it from processing legitimate requests.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service for the targeted grain and potentially for other grains hosted on the same silo.
    *   **Orleans Component Affected:** Grain activation, Message processing, Scheduling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms within grains to limit the number of requests processed per unit of time.
        *   Utilize Orleans' built-in load shedding capabilities to automatically reject requests when a grain is overloaded.
        *   Design grains to handle high load gracefully by using asynchronous operations and avoiding long-running or blocking calls.
        *   Consider using a circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures by temporarily stopping requests to an overloaded grain.

## Threat: [Silo Overload (DoS)](./threats/silo_overload__dos_.md)

*   **Threat:** Silo Overload (DoS)

    *   **Description:** An attacker targets a specific silo with a high volume of requests or malicious traffic, causing it to become unresponsive or crash.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service for all grains hosted on the targeted silo, potential for cluster instability.
    *   **Orleans Component Affected:** Silo hosting, Networking, Resource management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use load balancing across multiple silos to distribute the workload and prevent any single silo from becoming a bottleneck.
        *   Implement resource limits (CPU, memory, network) and monitoring for each silo.
        *   Design the system to be resilient to silo failures. Orleans automatically reactivates grains on other silos when a silo fails, but this should be tested and monitored.

## Threat: [Storage Overload (DoS)](./threats/storage_overload__dos_.md)

*   **Threat:** Storage Overload (DoS)

    *   **Description:** An attacker floods the persistent storage provider (e.g., database, cloud storage) with a large number of read or write requests, making it unavailable or slow for legitimate operations.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service for all grains that rely on the affected storage provider, potential for data loss or corruption if the storage provider becomes completely unavailable.
    *   **Orleans Component Affected:** Grain persistence (storage providers).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Choose a scalable and resilient storage provider that can handle high loads and has built-in mechanisms for dealing with overload (e.g., auto-scaling, throttling).
        *   Implement rate limiting and throttling for storage access within grains.
        *   Continuously monitor storage performance and capacity, and proactively scale the storage provider as needed.

## Threat: [Orleans Streams Overload (DoS)](./threats/orleans_streams_overload__dos_.md)

* **Threat:** Orleans Streams Overload (DoS)

    * **Description:** An attacker sends a massive number of events to an Orleans Stream, overwhelming the stream provider and consumers, leading to message loss or processing delays.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service for stream consumers, potential data loss, disruption of event-driven workflows.
    * **Orleans Component Affected:** Orleans Streams (providers and consumers).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Select an appropriate stream provider and configure it for the expected load and resilience requirements.
        *   Implement backpressure mechanisms to allow consumers to signal to producers when they are overloaded, slowing down the event flow.
        *   Use multiple stream partitions to distribute the load across multiple consumers and storage resources.
        *   Implement error handling and retry logic in stream consumers to handle transient failures.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Grain Activation](./threats/unauthorized_grain_activation.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Grain Activation

    *   **Description:** An attacker attempts to activate a grain that they should not have access to, potentially bypassing security controls or gaining access to sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data or functionality, potential for privilege escalation.
    *   **Orleans Component Affected:** Grain activation, Grain factory.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement authorization checks *within* grains to verify that the caller (client or another grain) is authorized to activate the grain or invoke specific methods.
        *   Avoid using easily guessable or predictable grain IDs.
        *   Consider using a custom `IGrainActivator` or `IIncomingGrainCallFilter` to enforce fine-grained security policies during grain activation.

## Threat: [Exploiting Grain Vulnerabilities (Elevation of Privilege)](./threats/exploiting_grain_vulnerabilities__elevation_of_privilege_.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Grain Vulnerabilities (Elevation of Privilege)

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a grain's code (e.g., a buffer overflow, injection flaw, logic error) to gain elevated privileges within the silo or the cluster.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution within the silo, potential for complete system compromise, data breaches, lateral movement.
    *   **Orleans Component Affected:** Grain method implementation, Grain code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing grains. This includes input validation, output encoding, proper error handling, and avoiding common vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10).
        *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
        *   Keep Orleans and all its dependencies (including the .NET runtime) up to date to patch known security vulnerabilities.
        *   Use static analysis tools to automatically scan grain code for potential security issues.

## Threat: [Grain Identity Spoofing](./threats/grain_identity_spoofing.md)

* **Threat:** Grain Identity Spoofing

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts messages with a forged grain ID, attempting to impersonate a legitimate grain.  They might do this by guessing grain IDs (if predictable), replaying captured messages (if not properly secured), or exploiting a vulnerability that allows them to generate arbitrary grain IDs.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can execute actions as the impersonated grain, potentially accessing sensitive data, modifying state, or triggering unauthorized operations.  This could lead to data breaches, financial loss, or system compromise.
    *   **Orleans Component Affected:** Grain communication (message passing), Grain ID generation (if custom keying is used), Grain activation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong, unpredictable grain IDs (GUIDs are the default and generally sufficient).
        *   Avoid custom grain keying schemes that use sequential or easily guessable IDs.
        *   Implement authentication and authorization *within* the grain's methods, validating the caller's identity even if the client is authenticated at the application boundary.  Don't rely solely on client-side authentication.
        *   If inter-silo communication is sensitive, consider using signed messages or mutual TLS (mTLS) to prevent spoofing between silos.
