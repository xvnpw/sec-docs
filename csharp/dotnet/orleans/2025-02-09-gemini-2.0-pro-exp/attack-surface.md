# Attack Surface Analysis for dotnet/orleans

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Grain Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_grain_access.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to interact with grains (activate, invoke methods) they are not authorized to access.
*   **How Orleans Contributes:** Orleans' distributed nature and ease of obtaining grain references can make it easier for attackers to attempt unauthorized access if proper controls aren't in place. Predictable grain IDs exacerbate this.
*   **Example:** An attacker guesses a grain ID for a `UserAccountGrain` and attempts to call a `GetBalance()` method without proper authentication.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches (sensitive information disclosure), unauthorized actions (e.g., transferring funds), system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Authorization:** Implement robust authorization checks *within* each grain method.  Do *not* rely solely on the client's ability to obtain a grain reference.  Use role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC).
    *   **Secure Grain IDs:** Avoid predictable grain IDs. Use GUIDs or cryptographically strong random identifiers, especially for sensitive grains.
    *   **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate all inputs to grain methods to prevent injection attacks or other malicious data.
    *   **Authentication:** Require strong authentication for all clients interacting with the Orleans cluster.

## Attack Surface: [Message Interception/Modification (MITM)](./attack_surfaces/message_interceptionmodification__mitm_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers intercept or modify messages exchanged between grains or between clients and silos.
*   **How Orleans Contributes:** Orleans relies on network communication for inter-grain and client-silo interactions.  Without proper security, this communication is vulnerable.
*   **Example:** An attacker intercepts a message containing a password reset token sent between two grains.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, credential theft, impersonation, manipulation of application logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **TLS Encryption:** Enforce TLS for *all* inter-silo and client-to-silo communication. Orleans provides built-in support for this.
    *   **Message-Level Encryption:** For highly sensitive data, consider encrypting the message payload *in addition to* TLS.
    *   **Message Integrity:** Use digital signatures or HMACs to verify the integrity of messages and prevent tampering.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Grain/Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_grainresource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers flood the system with requests, overwhelming grains, silos, or the underlying storage provider.
*   **How Orleans Contributes:** Orleans' scalability features, if not properly configured, can be abused to amplify DoS attacks.  Unbounded grain activations or excessive timer/reminder creation can lead to resource exhaustion.
*   **Example:** An attacker repeatedly activates a large number of short-lived grains, consuming all available memory on the silos.
*   **Impact:** Service unavailability, performance degradation, potential system crashes.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on grain activations and method invocations.  Use Orleans' built-in features or custom logic.
    *   **Resource Quotas:** Set limits on the number of grains, timers, and reminders that can be created by a single client or user.
    *   **Load Shedding:** Use Orleans' load shedding capabilities to gracefully handle overload situations.
    *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor cluster health, resource utilization, and request rates.  Set up alerts for unusual activity.
    *   **Circuit Breakers:** Implement circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures and isolate overloaded components.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Attacks](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the deserialization process to inject malicious code.
*   **How Orleans Contributes:** Orleans uses serialization to transmit data between grains and to persist grain state.  If the serialization format is vulnerable, attackers can exploit this.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a crafted message containing a malicious object that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code on the silo.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution (RCE), system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Serializers:** Use a secure serialization format that supports type whitelisting or other security mechanisms. Avoid binary serializers known to be vulnerable.
    *   **Type Whitelisting:** If using a serializer that supports it, configure a whitelist of allowed types to prevent deserialization of arbitrary objects.
    *   **Input Validation (Pre-Deserialization):** Validate data *before* deserialization to the extent possible.  This can help prevent some attacks.
    *   **Custom Serializers:** Consider using Orleans' custom serializer support to implement additional security checks during serialization and deserialization.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Silo](./attack_surfaces/compromised_silo.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control of a single silo within the Orleans cluster.
*   **How Orleans Contributes:** Orleans operates as a distributed system.  A compromised silo can potentially impact the entire cluster.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits an operating system vulnerability on a silo host to gain root access.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, system compromise, denial of service, potential propagation to other silos.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Host Security:** Implement strong host-level security for all silo instances (firewalls, intrusion detection, regular patching).
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate silos from other parts of the infrastructure using network segmentation.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run silos with the least privilege necessary.  Avoid running as root or administrator.
    *   **Monitoring and Auditing:** Monitor silo activity for suspicious behavior.  Implement security auditing.
    *   **Secure Membership Provider:** Use a secure membership provider with strong authentication and authorization to prevent unauthorized silos from joining the cluster.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Stream Access](./attack_surfaces/insecure_stream_access.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to Orleans Streams, allowing attackers to read, write, or tamper with stream data.
*   **How Orleans Contributes:** Orleans Streams provide a mechanism for asynchronous communication.  If not properly secured, streams can be a vector for attack.
*   **Example:** An attacker subscribes to a stream containing sensitive financial transactions without authorization.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, disruption of application logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement authentication and authorization for stream access (subscription and publishing).
    *   **TLS Encryption:** Use TLS to encrypt stream communication.
    *   **Message-Level Security:** Consider message-level encryption and signing for sensitive stream data.
    *   **Stream Provider Security:** Follow security best practices for the chosen stream provider (e.g., Azure Event Hubs, Kafka).
