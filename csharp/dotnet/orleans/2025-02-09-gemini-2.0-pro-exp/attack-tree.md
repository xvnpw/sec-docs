## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Deserialization RCE (Highest Risk)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_deserialization_rce__highest_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This path exploits vulnerabilities in how Orleans (or the application) handles the deserialization of data received from other grains or clients. If the system is configured to allow deserialization of arbitrary types, or if it uses a vulnerable serialization library, an attacker can craft a malicious payload that executes arbitrary code when deserialized.

*   **Steps:**

    *   **[1. Exploit Grain Communication Vulnerabilities]:** The attacker targets the communication mechanisms between grains or between clients and silos.
    *   **[1.1 Deserialization Attacks]:** The attacker focuses on vulnerabilities related to deserialization.
    *   **[1.1.1 Unsafe Type Handling] [!]:**
        *   **Description:** The application or Orleans is configured to allow deserialization of arbitrary types (e.g., using `TypeNameHandling.All` in Newtonsoft.Json or similar settings). This allows an attacker to specify any type in the serialized data, including types that, when instantiated, execute malicious code.
        *   **Example:** An attacker sends a message containing a serialized object that specifies a type designed to execute a system command upon deserialization.
        *   **Mitigation:** Strictly control allowed types during deserialization. Use whitelisting of known-good types. Avoid `TypeNameHandling.All` or equivalent.
    *   **[1.1.2 Known Vulnerable Libs] [!]:**
        *   **Description:** The application or Orleans uses a version of a serialization library (e.g., Newtonsoft.Json, System.Text.Json, BinaryFormatter) that has a known deserialization vulnerability.
        *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in an older version of Newtonsoft.Json to achieve RCE.
        *   **Mitigation:** Keep all dependencies, including serialization libraries, up-to-date. Use dependency scanning tools.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_default_credentials.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This path exploits the use of default credentials on the Orleans management interface (if exposed). If the default credentials haven't been changed, an attacker can easily gain full control of the silo.

*   **Steps:**

    *   **[2. Compromise Silo Management/Configuration]:** The attacker targets the management and configuration aspects of the Orleans silo.
    *   **[2.1 Weak/Default Credentials]:** The attacker focuses on weak or default credentials.
    *   **[2.1.1 Use Default Creds] [!]:**
        *   **Description:** The Orleans management interface (e.g., a dashboard or API) is accessible using default credentials (e.g., "admin/password").
        *   **Example:** An attacker uses the default credentials to log in to the management interface and then uses the interface's features to deploy malicious code or reconfigure the silo.
        *   **Mitigation:** *Never* use default credentials. Change all default passwords immediately after deployment. Use strong, unique passwords.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: MITM leading to Malicious Message Injection](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_mitm_leading_to_malicious_message_injection.md)

* **Overall Description:** This path involves intercepting and modifying network traffic between silos or between clients and silos to inject malicious messages. This requires a lack of TLS encryption.

* **Steps:**
    * **[1. Exploit Grain Communication Vulnerabilities]:** The attacker targets the communication mechanisms.
    * **[1.2 Message Interception/Tampering]:** The attacker aims to intercept or modify messages.
    * **[1.2.1 MITM Attack (if network is unprotected)]:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker positions themselves between communicating parties (e.g., two silos, or a client and a silo) and intercepts the network traffic. This is possible if TLS is not used or is improperly configured.
        *   **Example:** The attacker uses ARP spoofing or DNS hijacking to redirect traffic through their machine.
        *   **Mitigation:** *Always* use TLS for all communication. Enforce strong TLS configurations. Validate certificates.
    * **[1.2.3 Inject Malicious Messages]:**
        * **Description:** After successfully performing a MITM attack, the attacker crafts and injects malicious messages into the communication stream. These messages could exploit vulnerabilities in the grain code or the Orleans runtime.
        * **Example:** The attacker modifies a legitimate message to include a malicious payload that triggers a deserialization vulnerability (connecting back to Path 1).
        * **Mitigation:** Robust input validation and sanitization in all grain methods.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 4: Lack of Network Isolation + Brute Force/Credential Guessing](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_4_lack_of_network_isolation_+_brute_forcecredential_guessing.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This path combines network exposure with attacks on the management API. If silos are directly accessible from the public internet, they are vulnerable to brute-force attacks or credential guessing on their management interfaces.

*   **Steps:**

    *   **[2. Compromise Silo Management/Configuration]:** The attacker targets the management and configuration of the silo.
    *   **[2.2 Misconfigured Clustering]:** The attacker exploits misconfigurations in the cluster setup.
    *   **[2.2.3 Lack of Network Isolation]:**
        *   **Description:** Orleans silos are directly exposed to the public internet without proper network isolation (e.g., no firewall, no network security groups).
        *   **Example:** A silo's IP address is publicly accessible, allowing anyone on the internet to attempt to connect to it.
        *   **Mitigation:** Use network security groups (NSGs) or firewalls to restrict access to silos. Only allow necessary traffic from trusted sources. Use a virtual network (VNet).
    *   **[2.1.2 Brute Force Silo Mgmt API] / [2.1.3 Guess Silo Address]:**
        * **2.1.2 Description:** The attacker attempts to guess the credentials for the silo management API by trying many different username/password combinations.
        * **2.1.3 Description:** The attacker attempts to connect to the silo using a guessed or leaked silo address.
        * **Example (2.1.2):** An attacker uses a tool like Hydra to try thousands of common passwords against the management API.
        * **Example (2.1.3):** An attacker finds a silo address in a leaked log file and attempts to connect.
        * **Mitigation (2.1.2):** Implement account lockout policies and rate limiting. Use strong passwords.
        * **Mitigation (2.1.3):** Protect sensitive configuration information. Use secure configuration management.
