## Attack Tree Path: [Attack Goal: Compromise Orleans Application](./attack_tree_paths/attack_goal_compromise_orleans_application.md)

This is the ultimate objective. Success at any of the leaf nodes in the high-risk paths contributes to achieving this goal.
*   Impact: Full compromise of the application, potentially leading to data breach, service disruption, and reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Configuration Exploitation (1.2.3)](./attack_tree_paths/configuration_exploitation__1_2_3_.md)

Misconfigurations in Orleans setup can directly lead to cluster instability, unauthorized access, or data breaches.
*   Impact: High, as misconfiguration can have wide-ranging consequences across the entire Orleans application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Grain Logic Exploitation (2.1)](./attack_tree_paths/grain_logic_exploitation__2_1_.md)

Vulnerabilities within the application-specific grain code are direct pathways for attackers to manipulate application behavior, gain unauthorized access, or steal data.
*   Impact: High, as grain logic is the core of the application's functionality and data handling.

## Attack Tree Path: [Input Validation Vulnerabilities in Grain Methods (2.1.1)](./attack_tree_paths/input_validation_vulnerabilities_in_grain_methods__2_1_1_.md)

Failure to properly validate inputs to grain methods is a very common and easily exploitable vulnerability, leading to various attack types.

## Attack Tree Path: [Orleans Control Plane Exploitation (2.2)](./attack_tree_paths/orleans_control_plane_exploitation__2_2_.md)

Compromising the Orleans control plane (management interfaces, configuration) can grant attackers broad control over the entire Orleans cluster and application.
*   Impact: Very High, as control plane access can lead to complete system takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [Management Interface Vulnerabilities (If Exposed) (2.2.1)](./attack_tree_paths/management_interface_vulnerabilities__if_exposed___2_2_1_.md)

Exposed and vulnerable management interfaces provide a direct entry point for attackers to control the Orleans cluster.

*   Impact: High, cluster instability, potential for data corruption, unauthorized access if malicious silos are injected.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.3.b. Misconfigured Silo Ports/Firewall Rules](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_3_b__misconfigured_silo_portsfirewall_rules.md)

*   Attack Vector: Opening unnecessary ports or misconfiguring firewall rules exposes silos to unauthorized network access, potentially allowing attackers to directly interact with silos or the cluster network.
*   Impact: Medium, increased attack surface, potential for DoS or further exploitation of silo services.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1.a. Injection Attacks (SQL, NoSQL, Command Injection via Grain Input)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_a__injection_attacks__sql__nosql__command_injection_via_grain_input_.md)

*   Attack Vector: Attackers inject malicious code (SQL, NoSQL queries, system commands) through grain method parameters due to lack of input validation, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or system command execution.
*   Impact: High, data breach, data manipulation, potential for system compromise depending on the injection type.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2.b. Insecure Grain Authorization Logic (Bypass Checks)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_b__insecure_grain_authorization_logic__bypass_checks_.md)

*   Attack Vector: Flaws in grain authorization logic allow attackers to bypass access controls and execute grain methods or access data they are not authorized to, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive functionality or data.
*   Impact: High, unauthorized access to application features and data.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.3.a. Direct Modification of Persistent State Store](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_3_a__direct_modification_of_persistent_state_store.md)

*   Impact: High, data corruption, data manipulation, potential for unauthorized actions by manipulating grain state.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1.a. Unsecured Management Endpoints (No Authentication/Authorization)](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_a__unsecured_management_endpoints__no_authenticationauthorization_.md)
