# Threat Model Analysis for dotnet/orleans

## Threat: [Silo Compromise](./threats/silo_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a silo server. While the initial compromise might leverage general OS vulnerabilities, the impact is directly on the Orleans silo and its hosted grains. Once compromised, the attacker can execute arbitrary code *within the silo context*, access grain state in memory, and manipulate grain logic.

**Impact:**  Critical. Full control over the silo allows data exfiltration (grain state), manipulation of grain logic, cluster disruption, and pivoting to other systems *within the Orleans application*.

**Orleans Component Affected:** Silo Host, Grain Runtime, Cluster Membership

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strong OS and server hardening.
*   Apply regular security patches to OS and Orleans runtime.
*   Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication for server access.
*   Utilize network segmentation to isolate silos.
*   Deploy Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS).
*   Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability scans.

## Threat: [Silo Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/silo_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods a silo with a high volume of requests, specifically targeting Orleans endpoints or grain activation mechanisms, exceeding its processing capacity *within the Orleans framework*. This is a DoS attack focused on overwhelming the Orleans silo's ability to handle grain requests and cluster operations.

**Impact:** High. Silo becomes unresponsive, leading to service disruption, reduced application availability, and potential data loss if grains are not properly replicated *within the Orleans cluster*.

**Orleans Component Affected:** Silo Host, Grain Runtime, Gateway (if applicable)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement rate limiting and request throttling at the silo and gateway levels *specifically for Orleans requests*.
*   Employ load balancing across multiple silos *to distribute Orleans workload*.
*   Conduct capacity planning and resource monitoring *for Orleans silo resources*.
*   Utilize network-level DoS protection (firewalls, DDoS mitigation services) *in conjunction with Orleans-level protections*.

## Threat: [Inter-Silo Communication Interception/Manipulation](./threats/inter-silo_communication_interceptionmanipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between silos, focusing on the *Orleans inter-silo communication channels*. They can eavesdrop on communication or modify messages in transit, targeting Orleans specific messages like grain state replication or cluster management data.

**Impact:** High. Exposure of sensitive data exchanged between silos (grain state, cluster management), manipulation of cluster state *within the Orleans cluster*, and potential injection of malicious commands *into the Orleans system*.

**Orleans Component Affected:** Cluster Membership, Silo-to-Silo Communication Channels

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Enable TLS/SSL encryption for inter-silo communication *within Orleans configuration*.
*   Implement mutual authentication between silos *as supported by Orleans clustering*.
*   Segment the silo network to limit exposure *of Orleans internal network*.
*   Monitor inter-silo traffic for anomalies *related to Orleans communication patterns*.

## Threat: [Grain State Manipulation (Unauthorized Access/Modification)](./threats/grain_state_manipulation__unauthorized_accessmodification_.md)

**Description:** An attacker directly accesses the persistence store used by Orleans, *bypassing Orleans grain logic and access controls*. This is a direct attack on the data layer used by Orleans for grain persistence, exploiting potential weaknesses in persistence provider security or configuration.

**Impact:** Critical. Data corruption, integrity violations, unauthorized modification of application data *managed by Orleans grains*, potential privilege escalation *within the Orleans application context*, and business logic bypass *of grain logic*.

**Orleans Component Affected:** Persistence Providers, Grain State Management

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Securely configure and restrict access to persistence providers *used by Orleans*.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege for persistence store access *for Orleans components*.
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for persistence store access *from Orleans*.
*   Audit data access and modification operations in the persistence layer *related to Orleans grain data*.

## Threat: [Grain Logic Exploitation](./threats/grain_logic_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits vulnerabilities *within the code of Orleans grains*. This is a direct attack on the application logic implemented within the Orleans actor model, exploiting coding errors or insecure dependencies within grain implementations.

**Impact:** High. Unauthorized access to data or functionality *exposed by grains*, denial of service by crashing grains *within the Orleans runtime*, data corruption *of grain state*, and potential for further system compromise depending on the vulnerability *within the Orleans application*.

**Orleans Component Affected:** Grain Implementations, Grain Runtime

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Employ secure coding practices during grain development *specifically for Orleans grains* (input validation, output encoding, etc.).
*   Conduct regular code reviews and security testing of grain implementations *within the Orleans application*.
*   Keep dependencies updated and patched for vulnerabilities *used by Orleans grains*.
*   Implement robust exception handling and error logging within grains *to prevent unexpected Orleans behavior*.

## Threat: [Cluster Membership Manipulation (Unauthorized Silo Joining/Leaving)](./threats/cluster_membership_manipulation__unauthorized_silo_joiningleaving_.md)

**Description:** An attacker attempts to join rogue silos to the cluster or force legitimate silos to leave, *exploiting vulnerabilities in Orleans cluster membership protocols or gaining access to Orleans cluster configuration*. This is a direct attack on the integrity and stability of the Orleans cluster itself.

**Impact:** High. Cluster compromise, denial of service *of the Orleans application*, data loss in split-brain scenarios *within the Orleans cluster*, and instability *of the Orleans system*.

**Orleans Component Affected:** Cluster Membership, Gossip Protocol

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for silo joining/leaving *within Orleans cluster configuration*.
*   Secure cluster configuration and access control *for Orleans cluster management*.
*   Segment the cluster network *used by Orleans*.
*   Monitor cluster membership changes *within Orleans monitoring tools*.

## Threat: [Split-Brain Scenarios (Data Inconsistency/Corruption)](./threats/split-brain_scenarios__data_inconsistencycorruption_.md)

**Description:** Network partitions cause the Orleans cluster to split, leading to independent sub-clusters that may diverge in state *of Orleans grains and cluster metadata*. This is a direct consequence of the distributed nature of Orleans and network failures impacting cluster consistency.

**Impact:** High. Data corruption *of grain state across partitions*, inconsistent application state *within the Orleans application*, unpredictable behavior *of Orleans grains*, and service disruption *of the Orleans application*.

**Orleans Component Affected:** Cluster Membership, Consensus Algorithms

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Utilize robust cluster membership and failure detection *mechanisms provided by Orleans*.
*   Employ quorum-based consensus algorithms *within Orleans clustering configuration*.
*   Monitor cluster health and network connectivity *using Orleans monitoring*.
*   Implement automated recovery procedures for network partitions *within the Orleans application design*.

## Threat: [Persistence Store Compromise (Data Breach/Integrity Violation)](./threats/persistence_store_compromise__data_breachintegrity_violation_.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the underlying persistence store *used by Orleans for grain persistence*. While the initial compromise might be general, the impact is directly on Orleans grain data and application state.

**Impact:** Critical. Exposure of all grain state *persisted by Orleans*, data corruption *of Orleans grain data*, integrity violations *of Orleans application state*, and potential complete application compromise *due to data manipulation*.

**Orleans Component Affected:** Persistence Stores (Database, Cloud Storage)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strong security measures for the persistence store *used by Orleans* (access control, encryption at rest, network security).
*   Apply least privilege for Orleans access to the persistence store *credentials*.
*   Regularly audit and scan the persistence store for vulnerabilities *in the context of Orleans usage*.
*   Encrypt sensitive grain state at rest and in transit *within the Orleans application and persistence configuration*.
