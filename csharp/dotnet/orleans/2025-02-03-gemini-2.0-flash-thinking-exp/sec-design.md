# BUSINESS POSTURE

Orleans is a cross-platform framework for building distributed applications with .NET. It provides a programming model based on actors, called grains, which simplifies the development of scalable and robust applications. Orleans is designed to handle the complexities of distributed systems, allowing developers to focus on business logic.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Enable developers to build scalable and resilient distributed applications more easily.
  - Provide a robust and mature framework for building cloud-native and on-premises distributed systems.
  - Offer a programming model that simplifies concurrency and state management in distributed environments.
  - Support a wide range of application scenarios, from gaming and social media to financial services and IoT.
  - Foster an active community and ecosystem around the framework.

- Most Important Business Risks:
  - Complexity of distributed systems: Despite Orleans's simplification efforts, distributed systems inherently introduce complexities related to networking, concurrency, and failure handling. Misconfigurations or improper usage can lead to instability or data loss.
  - Security vulnerabilities in distributed applications: Distributed systems often expose more attack surfaces. Security flaws in Orleans itself or in applications built with Orleans can have wide-reaching consequences across the distributed environment.
  - Operational complexity: Deploying, managing, and monitoring distributed Orleans applications can be more complex than monolithic applications, requiring specialized skills and tooling.
  - Dependency on the Orleans framework: Organizations adopting Orleans become dependent on its continued development, support, and compatibility.
  - Performance bottlenecks in distributed environments:  Network latency, serialization overhead, and inefficient grain design can lead to performance bottlenecks in Orleans applications.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code reviews - implemented as part of the open-source contribution process on GitHub.
  - security control: Static analysis security testing (SAST) - likely used internally by the .NET team and potentially integrated into GitHub workflows, although not explicitly documented in the repository.
  - security control: Dependency scanning - GitHub Dependabot is likely enabled to scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
  - security control: Secure development lifecycle (SDL) - Microsoft, as the creator of .NET and Orleans, likely follows a secure development lifecycle for its projects.
  - security control: Public vulnerability reporting - GitHub repository allows for issue reporting, including security vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Deployment model flexibility - Orleans can be deployed in various environments (cloud, on-premises, containers), allowing organizations to choose deployment models that align with their security policies.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Open-source nature - While open source allows for community scrutiny, it also means vulnerabilities might be publicly known before patches are available.
  - accepted risk: Third-party dependencies - Orleans relies on third-party libraries, which may introduce vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Configuration complexity - Misconfigurations in Orleans deployments can lead to security vulnerabilities.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement dynamic analysis security testing (DAST) in CI/CD pipelines to detect runtime vulnerabilities in Orleans applications.
  - security control: Conduct regular penetration testing of Orleans applications and deployments to identify and remediate security weaknesses.
  - security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for developers using Orleans to build secure applications, including secure grain design, input validation, and secure communication patterns.
  - security control: Implement security monitoring and logging for Orleans clusters to detect and respond to security incidents.
  - security control: Offer and promote secure configuration templates and hardening guides for different deployment environments.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - requirement: Orleans itself does not enforce specific authentication mechanisms, but applications built with Orleans will need to implement authentication to verify the identity of clients and services interacting with the Orleans cluster.
    - requirement: Support for various authentication methods should be considered, such as API keys, OAuth 2.0, or mutual TLS, depending on the application requirements.
    - requirement: Securely manage and store authentication credentials.

  - Authorization:
    - requirement: Orleans applications must implement authorization mechanisms to control access to grains and grain methods based on user roles or permissions.
    - requirement: Authorization should be enforced at the grain level to ensure that only authorized actors can interact with specific grains and perform certain actions.
    - requirement: Consider attribute-based access control (ABAC) or role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization policies.

  - Input Validation:
    - requirement: All input to grains, whether from external clients or other grains, must be thoroughly validated to prevent injection attacks, data corruption, and unexpected behavior.
    - requirement: Input validation should be performed at the grain level before processing any data.
    - requirement: Use appropriate validation techniques for different input types, such as data type validation, range checks, and format validation.

  - Cryptography:
    - requirement: Sensitive data transmitted between Orleans clients and silos, or between silos, should be encrypted in transit using TLS.
    - requirement: Consider encrypting sensitive data at rest if stored within Orleans grains or in persistent storage used by Orleans.
    - requirement: Use strong cryptographic algorithms and libraries for encryption and hashing.
    - requirement: Securely manage cryptographic keys and certificates.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Distributed computing and processing: Orleans enables building applications that require distributed processing of tasks and data. Disruption could impact application functionality and availability.
  - State management in distributed systems: Orleans manages the state of distributed actors (grains). Data loss or corruption in grain state could lead to application errors and data inconsistencies.
  - Real-time event streaming: Orleans Streams enable real-time event processing and distribution. Issues with stream processing could impact applications relying on real-time data.
  - Cluster management and coordination: Orleans clusters require coordination and management of silos. Failures in cluster management could lead to instability and unavailability.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - Application State Data: Sensitivity depends on the application built with Orleans. Grain state can contain sensitive user data, financial information, or confidential business data. Sensitivity level varies widely based on application domain.
  - Configuration Data: Orleans cluster configuration data, including connection strings, API keys, and security settings, is highly sensitive. Exposure could lead to unauthorized access and compromise of the cluster.
  - Logging and Monitoring Data: Logs and monitoring data may contain operational information and potentially some application data. Sensitivity depends on the level of detail and data included in logs.
  - Build Artifacts: Build artifacts themselves are generally not highly sensitive, but compromised artifacts could be used to deploy malicious code.
