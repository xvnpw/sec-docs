# Threat Model Analysis for dotnet/orleans

## Threat: [Grain State Tampering](./threats/grain_state_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the underlying persistence layer used by Orleans. They then directly modify the stored state of a grain, bypassing the grain's internal logic and authorization mechanisms.

**Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized modification of user data or system settings, potential for privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** Orleans Persistence Provider.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong access control on the persistence layer.
*   Encrypt grain state at rest.
*   Utilize checksums or digital signatures for state integrity.
*   Regularly audit persistence layer access logs.

## Threat: [Grain Impersonation](./threats/grain_impersonation.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts or manipulates messages to appear as if they originate from a legitimate grain instance, bypassing authentication or authorization checks between grains.

**Impact:** Unauthorized invocation of methods on other grains, access to sensitive data, triggering unauthorized actions.

**Affected Component:** Orleans Messaging Layer, Grain Activation System.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure secure communication between silos using encryption (TLS).
*   Implement robust authentication and authorization within grain methods.
*   Explicitly validate caller identity.
*   Consider secure messaging protocols.

## Threat: [Silo Impersonation/Spoofing](./threats/silo_impersonationspoofing.md)

**Description:** An attacker introduces a rogue silo into the Orleans cluster, pretending to be legitimate, by exploiting vulnerabilities in the cluster membership protocol or network configuration.

**Impact:** Interception of communication, data theft, injection of malicious messages, disruption of cluster operation.

**Affected Component:** Orleans Membership Provider, Orleans Networking Layer.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the cluster membership provider with strong authentication and authorization.
*   Use secure communication protocols (TLS) for inter-silo communication.
*   Implement mutual authentication between silos.
*   Harden the network infrastructure.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Silo Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_silo_communication.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between silos if channels are not secured, allowing eavesdropping or modification of messages.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, disruption of cluster operations.

**Affected Component:** Orleans Networking Layer.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce TLS encryption for all inter-silo communication.
*   Implement mutual authentication between silos.
*   Ensure proper certificate management.

## Threat: [Membership Protocol Exploitation](./threats/membership_protocol_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Orleans membership protocol to disrupt the cluster's view of its members, potentially causing split-brain scenarios or preventing legitimate silos from joining.

**Impact:** Cluster instability, service disruption, potential data loss or inconsistencies.

**Affected Component:** Orleans Membership Provider.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use a robust and well-tested membership provider.
*   Secure the underlying storage used by the membership provider.
*   Monitor cluster membership status for anomalies.
*   Consider a membership provider with strong consistency and fault tolerance.

## Threat: [Client-to-Silo Communication Vulnerabilities](./threats/client-to-silo_communication_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The communication channel between external clients and the Orleans cluster is not adequately secured, allowing eavesdropping or manipulation of client requests.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized actions performed on behalf of clients.

**Affected Component:** Orleans Client Libraries, Orleans Gateway, Orleans Networking Layer.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce TLS encryption for client-to-cluster communication.
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for client access.
*   Protect client credentials.
*   Validate and sanitize client input.

## Threat: [Management Interface Vulnerabilities](./threats/management_interface_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Orleans management tools or APIs are exposed without proper authentication and authorization, allowing attackers to perform administrative actions.

**Impact:** Complete cluster compromise, service disruption, data loss, unauthorized access.

**Affected Component:** Orleans Management Tools and APIs.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure all management interfaces with strong authentication and authorization.
*   Restrict access to authorized personnel.
*   Use secure communication protocols (HTTPS).
*   Regularly audit access logs.

## Threat: [Configuration Tampering](./threats/configuration_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to Orleans configuration files or stores and modifies them to alter cluster behavior, potentially introducing security vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Cluster instability, security bypasses, potential for further attacks.

**Affected Component:** Orleans Configuration System.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Protect configuration files and stores with access controls.
*   Encrypt sensitive information in configuration.
*   Implement mechanisms to detect unauthorized modification.
*   Securely store configuration and avoid storing secrets directly.
