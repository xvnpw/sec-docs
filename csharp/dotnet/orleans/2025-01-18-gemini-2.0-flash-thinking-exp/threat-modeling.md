# Threat Model Analysis for dotnet/orleans

## Threat: [Rogue Silo Joining the Cluster](./threats/rogue_silo_joining_the_cluster.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker deploys a malicious silo designed to join the legitimate Orleans cluster. This rogue silo could then impersonate grains, intercept messages, steal data, or disrupt cluster operations. The attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in the Orleans membership provider or use stolen credentials managed by Orleans to join.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, denial of service, unauthorized access to grain state and functionality, potential for lateral movement within the system.
    *   **Affected Orleans Component:** Clustering (Membership Provider)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for silo-to-silo communication and cluster membership within Orleans configuration.
        *   Use secure network configurations and firewalls to restrict access to the cluster.
        *   Regularly audit the active silos in the cluster and have mechanisms within Orleans to detect and remove unauthorized silos.
        *   Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) for silo communication configured through Orleans.

## Threat: [Membership Protocol Exploitation](./threats/membership_protocol_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Orleans membership protocol to disrupt the cluster. This could involve sending malformed messages to the Orleans membership provider, causing nodes to incorrectly join or leave the cluster, leading to instability or partitioning.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, cluster instability, data inconsistencies due to incorrect routing or loss of quorum, potential for data loss.
    *   **Affected Orleans Component:** Clustering (Membership Protocol)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Orleans dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities in the membership protocol.
        *   Implement robust error handling and input validation within custom membership providers if used.
        *   Monitor cluster health and membership status exposed by Orleans for anomalies.
        *   Consider using a more robust and secure membership provider if the default one is insufficient for your security needs.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) on Silo Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__on_silo_communication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between silos if it's not properly encrypted. They could eavesdrop on sensitive data being exchanged between grains or even modify messages to manipulate grain state or behavior. This directly impacts the inter-silo communication managed by Orleans.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, data corruption, unauthorized modification of grain state, potential for privilege escalation if manipulated messages grant unintended access.
    *   **Affected Orleans Component:** Runtime (Silo-to-Silo Communication)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce encryption for all silo-to-silo communication using TLS, configured within Orleans.
        *   Ensure proper certificate management and validation for secure communication.
        *   Consider using network segmentation to limit the attack surface.

## Threat: [Grain Impersonation](./threats/grain_impersonation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts messages that appear to originate from a legitimate grain. This could be achieved by exploiting weaknesses in how Orleans verifies grain identities or by compromising a legitimate silo. The attacker can then send malicious messages to other grains, potentially gaining their trust or triggering unintended actions.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized actions performed by tricked grains, potential for cascading failures within the application.
    *   **Affected Orleans Component:** Runtime (Grain Messaging)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement secure messaging protocols that include mechanisms for verifying the sender's identity within grain communication logic.
        *   Enforce strong authentication and authorization at the grain level.
        *   Consider using digital signatures for grain messages to ensure authenticity and integrity.

## Threat: [Persistence Data Breach](./threats/persistence_data_breach.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the underlying persistence storage used by Orleans (e.g., a database). This could be due to weak database credentials, misconfigured access controls, or vulnerabilities in the Orleans persistence provider configuration. The attacker can then directly read or modify grain state managed by Orleans persistence.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure of sensitive grain data, data corruption, potential for complete compromise of application data.
    *   **Affected Orleans Component:** Persistence (Persistence Providers)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the underlying persistence storage with strong authentication, authorization, and encryption.
        *   Follow database security best practices, including regular patching and access control reviews.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest within the persistence layer.
        *   Limit the permissions of the Orleans application to the persistence store to the minimum required.

## Threat: [Client Impersonation Leading to Unauthorized Grain Access](./threats/client_impersonation_leading_to_unauthorized_grain_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker impersonates a legitimate client when interacting with the Orleans cluster. If client authentication is weak or missing in the application's interaction with Orleans, the attacker can invoke grain methods they shouldn't have access to, potentially accessing or modifying sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized modification of grain state, potential for privilege escalation depending on the accessed grain's functionality.
    *   **Affected Orleans Component:** Client API, Grain Interface
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong client authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys with proper validation) before interacting with the Orleans client.
        *   Enforce authorization checks within grain methods based on the authenticated client's identity.
        *   Use secure communication protocols (HTTPS) for client-to-silo interactions.
