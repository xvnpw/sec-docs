# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for dotnet/eshop

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization at the Ocelot API Gateway (eShopOnContainers)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_at_the_ocelot_api_gateway__eshoponcontainers_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Ocelot Routes in eShopOnContainers:** Examine the `ocelot.json` configuration file in the eShopOnContainers API Gateway project to identify all defined routes and upstream services.
    2.  **Implement Validation Middleware in Ocelot Gateway:**  Develop custom middleware within the eShopOnContainers Ocelot Gateway project (likely in the `ApiGateways.OcelotApiGw` project) to intercept requests *before* they are routed to backend microservices.
    3.  **Define Validation Rules Based on eShopOnContainers APIs:**  Based on the API contracts of the backend microservices in eShopOnContainers (e.g., Catalog API, Ordering API), define validation rules for request headers, query parameters, and request bodies expected by these APIs.
    4.  **Utilize .NET Validation Libraries:**  Within the Ocelot middleware, use .NET validation libraries like `FluentValidation` to implement the defined validation rules.  Create validation classes specific to the DTOs and request models used in eShopOnContainers APIs.
    5.  **Sanitize Input Data in Ocelot Middleware:**  In the same middleware, implement sanitization logic to encode or remove potentially harmful characters from input data before forwarding requests to backend services.
    6.  **Return User-Friendly Error Responses from Ocelot:** Configure Ocelot to return consistent and user-friendly error responses when validation fails, without exposing internal server details.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):**  Mitigates SQL injection vulnerabilities in backend microservices (Catalog, Ordering, etc.) by preventing malicious input from reaching them.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Reduces XSS risks by sanitizing input data at the gateway, preventing injection of malicious scripts into backend services and potentially frontends.
    *   **Command Injection (High Severity):** Prevents command injection vulnerabilities in backend services by validating and sanitizing input.
    *   **API Abuse and Data Corruption (Medium Severity):**  Protects backend APIs from malformed or unexpected data that could lead to errors or data corruption.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **High Risk Reduction:** Significantly reduces the risk of common web application vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, Command Injection) within the eShopOnContainers application.
    *   **Improved API Robustness:** Enhances the robustness and reliability of the eShopOnContainers APIs by ensuring data integrity from the entry point.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely partially implemented in backend microservices. Individual microservices in eShopOnContainers might have some input validation, but centralized validation at the Ocelot gateway is likely missing or not comprehensive.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Ocelot Gateway Middleware for Validation:**  Dedicated middleware in the `ApiGateways.OcelotApiGw` project for centralized input validation and sanitization.
    *   **Validation Rule Definitions for eShopOnContainers APIs:**  Explicit definitions of validation rules tailored to the specific APIs exposed by eShopOnContainers microservices.
    *   **Consistent Sanitization Logic in Ocelot:**  Implementation of consistent sanitization logic within the Ocelot gateway middleware.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting and Throttling at the Ocelot API Gateway (eShopOnContainers)](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_and_throttling_at_the_ocelot_api_gateway__eshoponcontainers_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Ocelot Rate Limiting in `ocelot.json`:**  Utilize Ocelot's built-in rate limiting features by configuring rate limiting policies directly within the `ocelot.json` file of the `ApiGateways.OcelotApiGw` project in eShopOnContainers.
    2.  **Identify Critical eShopOnContainers Routes:** Determine which API routes in eShopOnContainers are most critical and susceptible to abuse (e.g., routes related to ordering, basket updates, login).
    3.  **Define Rate Limits for Critical Routes in Ocelot:**  In `ocelot.json`, define specific rate limits for these critical routes. Consider different rate limits based on request origin (e.g., per IP address).
    4.  **Customize Rate Limiting Responses in Ocelot:**  Configure Ocelot to return appropriate HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests" responses when rate limits are exceeded, potentially including "Retry-After" headers.
    5.  **Monitor Ocelot Rate Limiting Metrics:**  Integrate monitoring for Ocelot's rate limiting functionality to track its effectiveness and adjust policies as needed based on eShopOnContainers traffic patterns.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (High Severity):** Protects the eShopOnContainers application from DoS attacks targeting the API Gateway and backend services.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):**  Slows down brute-force attempts against user authentication endpoints in eShopOnContainers.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Prevents excessive resource consumption on eShopOnContainers infrastructure due to high request volumes.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **High Risk Reduction for DoS:** Significantly reduces the risk of DoS attacks against eShopOnContainers.
    *   **Medium Risk Reduction for Brute-Force:** Makes brute-force attacks against eShopOnContainers less effective.
    *   **Improved Application Stability:** Enhances the stability and availability of eShopOnContainers under heavy load or attack.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Potentially not implemented in the default eShopOnContainers setup. Ocelot has the capability, but explicit configuration for rate limiting in `ocelot.json` is likely missing in the standard project.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Rate Limiting Configuration in `ocelot.json`:**  Explicit rate limiting policies defined in the `ocelot.json` file for critical eShopOnContainers API routes.
    *   **Monitoring of Rate Limiting:**  Integration of monitoring to track and analyze the effectiveness of rate limiting in eShopOnContainers.
    *   **Dynamic Rate Limiting Adjustments:**  Potentially missing dynamic rate limiting that could automatically adjust based on real-time traffic within eShopOnContainers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure IdentityServer4 Configuration in eShopOnContainers](./mitigation_strategies/secure_identityserver4_configuration_in_eshoponcontainers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review IdentityServer4 Configuration in eShopOnContainers:** Examine the IdentityServer4 project within eShopOnContainers (`Services/Identity`) and its configuration files (e.g., `Config.cs`, `appsettings.json`).
    2.  **Change Default Secrets and Keys in IdentityServer4:**  Ensure that default signing keys and secrets used by IdentityServer4 in eShopOnContainers are changed to strong, randomly generated values. This is crucial for token security.
    3.  **Configure Token Lifetimes in IdentityServer4:**  Adjust token lifetimes (access tokens, refresh tokens) in IdentityServer4's configuration to be appropriately short for eShopOnContainers' security needs.
    4.  **Restrict Grant Types in IdentityServer4:**  Review and restrict the enabled grant types in IdentityServer4 to only those necessary for eShopOnContainers (e.g., `ResourceOwnerPassword`, `ClientCredentials`, `AuthorizationCode`). Disable any unnecessary grant types.
    5.  **Implement Security Headers in IdentityServer4:**  Configure IdentityServer4 in eShopOnContainers to send security-related HTTP headers (e.g., `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Content-Security-Policy`) in its responses.
    6.  **Enable Security Auditing in IdentityServer4:**  Configure logging and auditing within IdentityServer4 to track security-relevant events like authentication attempts, authorization failures, and configuration changes.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force Attacks (High Severity):**  Hardening IdentityServer4 makes it more resistant to attacks targeting user credentials in eShopOnContainers.
    *   **Token Theft/Session Hijacking (High Severity):**  Secure configuration reduces the risk of token theft and session hijacking within eShopOnContainers.
    *   **Open Redirect Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):**  Proper configuration helps prevent open redirect vulnerabilities in the IdentityServer4 authentication flow used by eShopOnContainers.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):**  Secure configuration and logging prevent accidental disclosure of sensitive information from IdentityServer4.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **High Risk Reduction for Token Security:** Significantly improves the security of authentication tokens and user sessions in eShopOnContainers.
    *   **Medium Risk Reduction for Credential Attacks:** Makes credential-based attacks against eShopOnContainers harder.
    *   **Improved Overall Authentication Security:** Enhances the overall security posture of authentication and authorization within eShopOnContainers.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. eShopOnContainers uses IdentityServer4, but the default configuration is likely for demonstration purposes and might not include all recommended security hardening steps.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Hardened IdentityServer4 Configuration:**  Explicit implementation of all recommended security hardening steps in the IdentityServer4 project of eShopOnContainers (changing defaults, security headers, restricted grant types, auditing).
    *   **Security Auditing and Monitoring Integration:**  Integration of IdentityServer4 security logs with a central monitoring system for eShopOnContainers.
    *   **Regular Security Review of IdentityServer4 Configuration:**  Establish a process for regularly reviewing and updating the IdentityServer4 configuration in eShopOnContainers to maintain security best practices.
