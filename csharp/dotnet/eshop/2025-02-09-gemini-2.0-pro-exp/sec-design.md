Okay, let's create a design document for the eShopOnContainers project from the provided GitHub repository.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Demonstrate a microservices architecture pattern using .NET technologies.
*   Provide a reference implementation for building cloud-native applications.
*   Showcase best practices for developing, deploying, and managing microservices.
*   Enable developers to learn and experiment with various technologies and patterns.
*   Provide a functional, albeit simplified, e-commerce platform.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Data breaches: Exposure of sensitive customer data (PII, payment information) due to vulnerabilities in the application or infrastructure.
*   Service unavailability: Downtime of critical services (ordering, catalog, identity) leading to lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
*   Scalability issues: Inability to handle increased traffic during peak periods, resulting in performance degradation and lost revenue.
*   Supply chain attacks: Compromise of the application through vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies or build processes.
*   Lack of resilience: Failure of individual services impacting the overall system functionality.
*   Insecure deployments: Misconfigurations in the deployment environment leading to vulnerabilities.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Authentication: Implemented using IdentityServer (now Duende IdentityServer), supporting OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0. Described in the Identity.API project and related documentation.
*   security control: Authorization: Role-based access control (RBAC) is used to restrict access to certain functionalities based on user roles. Implemented within individual microservices and the Identity.API.
*   security control: HTTPS: Communication between services and clients is secured using HTTPS. Enforced through configuration and deployment settings.
*   security control: Input validation: Implemented in various microservices to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). Present in API controllers and data access layers.
*   security control: API Gateways: Use of API gateways (Ocelot) to centralize routing, authentication, and other cross-cutting concerns. Described in the configuration of the Web.Shopping.HttpAggregator and other gateway projects.
*   security control: Containerization: Use of Docker to package and deploy microservices, providing isolation and consistency. Defined in Dockerfiles and docker-compose files.
*   security control: Health checks: Implemented to monitor the status of individual services and enable self-healing capabilities. Defined in individual microservices and used by orchestrators.
*   security control: Logging and monitoring: Integration with logging frameworks (Serilog) and monitoring tools (Application Insights, Grafana) to track application behavior and identify potential issues. Configured in appsettings.json and startup files.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The reference application may not cover all possible security scenarios and edge cases. It serves as a starting point and may require further hardening for production use.
*   accepted risk: Some advanced security features (e.g., advanced threat protection, intrusion detection) may not be fully implemented in the sample application.
*   accepted risk: The focus is on demonstrating architectural patterns, and security is implemented to a reasonable level, but not necessarily to the highest possible standard for every component.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement centralized secret management (e.g., Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault) to securely store and manage sensitive information like connection strings, API keys, and certificates.
*   security control: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically identify vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks.
*   security control: Enforce stricter network policies within the Kubernetes cluster (if used) to limit communication between microservices to only what is necessary (least privilege).
*   security control: Implement regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential weaknesses.
*   security control: Implement robust data loss prevention (DLP) measures to protect sensitive data at rest and in transit.
*   security control: Implement a comprehensive vulnerability management program to track and remediate vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   All users must be authenticated before accessing protected resources.
    *   Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be considered.
    *   Implement secure password management practices (hashing, salting).
    *   Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks.

*   Authorization:
    *   Access to resources and functionalities should be granted based on user roles and permissions (RBAC).
    *   Implement the principle of least privilege.

*   Input Validation:
    *   All user inputs must be validated to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, command injection).
    *   Use whitelisting (allowlisting) instead of blacklisting (denylisting) whenever possible.
    *   Sanitize user inputs before displaying them in the UI.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and protocols (e.g., TLS 1.3, AES-256).
    *   Securely manage cryptographic keys.
    *   Protect data at rest using encryption.

## BUILD

The build process for eShopOnContainers utilizes a combination of Docker build commands, .NET build tools, and potentially CI/CD pipelines (although the specific CI/CD setup is not fully detailed in the repository).

```mermaid
graph LR
    developer["Developer"] -- Code Commit --> git["Git Repository (GitHub)"]
    git -- Webhook --> ci["CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps)"]
    ci -- Build --> dotnet["dotnet build"]
    ci -- Test --> dotnettest["dotnet test"]
    ci -- Docker Build --> docker["docker build"]
    docker -- Push --> registry["Container Registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Azure Container Registry)"]
    registry -- Pull --> deployment["Deployment Environment (Kubernetes/AKS)"]
    dotnet -- Publish --> artifacts["Build Artifacts (.dll, etc.)"]
    sast["SAST Tools"] -- Scan --> artifacts
    dependencycheck["Dependency Check Tools"] -- Scan --> artifacts
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer commits code to the Git repository (GitHub).
2.  A webhook triggers the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps).
3.  The CI/CD pipeline checks out the code.
4.  The `dotnet build` command compiles the .NET code.
5.  The `dotnet test` command runs unit and integration tests.
6.  SAST tools (e.g., SonarQube, OWASP Dependency-Check) scan the code and dependencies for vulnerabilities.
7.  The `docker build` command creates Docker images for each microservice.
8.  Docker images are pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Azure Container Registry).
9.  Build artifacts (.dll files, etc.) are published.
10. The deployment environment (Kubernetes/AKS) pulls the latest images from the container registry.

Security Controls:

*   security control: Use of signed commits to ensure code integrity.
*   security control: Integration of SAST tools to identify code vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Dependency scanning to detect vulnerable third-party libraries.
*   security control: Use of a secure container registry with access controls.
*   security control: Automated build and test processes to ensure consistency and repeatability.
*   security control: Use of minimal base images for Docker containers to reduce the attack surface.
*   security control: Regular updates of build tools and dependencies.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Order placement and fulfillment: Ensuring customers can successfully place orders and receive their products.
*   Product catalog management: Maintaining an accurate and up-to-date product catalog.
*   User account management: Securely managing user accounts and personal information.
*   Payment processing (although not directly implemented in this reference application, it's a critical aspect of a real e-commerce system).

Data Sensitivity:

*   Customer Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers (High sensitivity).
*   Order details: Products ordered, quantities, prices (Medium sensitivity).
*   Payment information (not stored in this reference application, but would be High sensitivity in a real system).
*   User authentication data (passwords, tokens): (High sensitivity).
*   Product catalog data (Low to Medium sensitivity).
*   Marketing data (Low sensitivity).
*   Location data (Medium sensitivity).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What is the specific CI/CD pipeline used (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Jenkins, etc.)?  This impacts the specifics of build security controls.
*   What are the specific monitoring and alerting tools and configurations used?
*   What are the specific logging configurations and retention policies?
*   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS) that need to be considered?
*   What is the expected traffic volume and scalability requirements?
*   What is the disaster recovery plan?
*   What is the incident response plan?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a learning resource and reference implementation, not a production-ready system without further modifications.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: Basic security measures are in place, but further hardening is required for production use.
*   DESIGN: The architecture is based on microservices and uses common patterns and technologies. The deployment environment is assumed to be Kubernetes (AKS) for this detailed design, but other options are possible. The build process is automated, but the specific CI/CD tooling is not fully specified.
