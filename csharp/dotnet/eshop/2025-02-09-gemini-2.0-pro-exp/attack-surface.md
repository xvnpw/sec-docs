# Attack Surface Analysis for dotnet/eshop

## Attack Surface: [Inter-Service Communication (Unauthenticated/Unauthorized)](./attack_surfaces/inter-service_communication__unauthenticatedunauthorized_.md)

*   **Description:**  The risk of unauthorized access to internal microservices due to insufficient authentication or authorization between services.
*   **eShop Contribution:** The application's microservice architecture inherently relies on inter-service communication, increasing the potential for misconfiguration or bypass of security controls.  This is a *core architectural choice* of eShop.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers the internal endpoint for `Ordering.API` and directly sends requests to create orders, bypassing the `WebMVC` frontend and payment processing.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access/modification, order creation without payment, potential denial-of-service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Mutual TLS (mTLS):**  Require each service to present a valid certificate to other services, ensuring both authentication and encryption.
    *   **Use API Keys/Service Tokens:**  Assign unique, secret keys or tokens to each service for authentication.  Rotate these keys regularly.
    *   **Implement JWT Authorization:**  Use JWTs with fine-grained authorization claims (scopes) to control which services can access specific resources and actions within other services.  Enforce these claims at each service.
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Use network policies (e.g., Kubernetes Network Policies) to restrict communication between services to only what is explicitly required.

## Attack Surface: [Event Bus (Unauthorized Message Consumption/Injection)](./attack_surfaces/event_bus__unauthorized_message_consumptioninjection_.md)

*   **Description:**  The risk of attackers gaining unauthorized access to the message bus (RabbitMQ or Azure Service Bus) to read sensitive messages or inject malicious ones.
*   **eShop Contribution:** The application *specifically chooses* to use an event-driven architecture, relying on a message bus for asynchronous communication between services. This is a fundamental design decision.
*   **Example:** An attacker subscribes to the `OrderCreatedIntegrationEvent` queue and steals order information, or injects a fake `OrderPaymentFailedIntegrationEvent` to disrupt order fulfillment.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (order details, customer information), disruption of business processes (order fulfillment), potential for fraudulent activities.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Message Bus Access:**  Implement strong authentication and authorization for access to the message bus (e.g., using usernames/passwords, certificates, or managed identities).
    *   **Message Encryption:**  Encrypt the contents of sensitive messages before publishing them to the bus.
    *   **Message Signing:**  Digitally sign messages to ensure their integrity and prevent tampering.
    *   **Implement Idempotency:**  Design services to handle duplicate messages gracefully, preventing replay attacks.  Use unique message IDs and track processed messages.
    *   **Input Validation on Message Handlers:**  Rigorously validate the content of all messages received from the bus before processing them.

## Attack Surface: [API Gateway (Authentication/Authorization Bypass)](./attack_surfaces/api_gateway__authenticationauthorization_bypass_.md)

*   **Description:**  The risk of attackers bypassing the authentication and authorization mechanisms implemented at the API gateway (Ocelot).
*   **eShop Contribution:** eShop *specifically uses Ocelot* as its API gateway, making Ocelot's security configuration and vulnerability status directly relevant to the application's attack surface.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in Ocelot's JWT validation allows an attacker to forge a valid JWT and access protected resources in backend services.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to all backend services and data, potential for complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Ocelot Updated:**  Regularly update Ocelot to the latest version to patch any known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Thoroughly Test Authentication/Authorization:**  Conduct extensive penetration testing to identify and address any weaknesses in Ocelot's authentication and authorization logic.
    *   **Use Strong JWT Validation:**  Ensure Ocelot rigorously validates all aspects of JWTs (signature, expiration, audience, issuer).  Use a strong, securely stored secret key for signing JWTs.
    *   **Implement Rate Limiting:**  Configure rate limiting in Ocelot to protect against brute-force and denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **Least Privilege for Ocelot:** Ensure that the Ocelot service itself runs with the least necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Data Storage (SQL Injection)](./attack_surfaces/data_storage__sql_injection_.md)

*   **Description:**  The risk of attackers injecting malicious SQL code into database queries, even with the use of an ORM like EF Core.
*   **eShop Contribution:** While EF Core helps, *eShop's specific database interactions and any custom SQL queries* (even within EF Core) are the direct source of potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.  The choice of SQL Server and the schema design are also eShop-specific.
*   **Example:** A custom reporting feature within eShop uses raw SQL queries with user-supplied input without proper parameterization, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (read, modify, or delete data), potential for complete database server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Parameterized Queries:**  Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with the database, even when using EF Core.  Avoid dynamic SQL construction with user input.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user input before using it in any database query, even if it's used within EF Core.
    *   **Least Privilege Database Users:**  Ensure that each application component connects to the database with a user account that has only the necessary permissions (e.g., read-only access for components that only need to read data).
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Use a WAF to detect and block SQL injection attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Identity and Access Management (Weak Authentication)](./attack_surfaces/identity_and_access_management__weak_authentication_.md)

*   **Description:** The risk of attackers compromising user accounts due to weak password policies or vulnerabilities in the IdentityServer implementation.
*   **eShop Contribution:** eShop *specifically uses and configures IdentityServer* for authentication and authorization. The configuration choices made within IdentityServer directly impact the application's security.
*   **Example:** The IdentityServer configuration within eShop allows weak passwords, and an attacker uses a dictionary attack to guess a user's password.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, potential for data breaches and fraudulent activities.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce Strong Password Policies:** Require strong passwords (minimum length, complexity requirements, etc.).
    *   **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Require users to provide a second factor of authentication (e.g., a one-time code from an authenticator app) in addition to their password.
    *   **Protect Against Brute-Force Attacks:** Implement account lockout policies and CAPTCHAs to prevent automated password guessing attacks.
    *   **Regularly Update IdentityServer:** Keep IdentityServer updated to the latest version to patch any known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Prevent Account Enumeration:** Configure IdentityServer to return generic error messages for login and password reset failures, preventing attackers from determining if a username or email address exists.

## Attack Surface: [gRPC Services (Lack of Input Validation)](./attack_surfaces/grpc_services__lack_of_input_validation_.md)

*   **Description:** Insufficient validation of data received by gRPC services, leading to potential vulnerabilities.
*   **eShop Contribution:** The application *specifically chooses* to use gRPC for some inter-service communication. The implementation of these gRPC services within eShop is the direct source of this risk.
*   **Example:** A gRPC service within eShop accepts an integer without bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, potential code execution, data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rigorous Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation for all data received by gRPC services, checking data types, lengths, and ranges.
    *   **Use Protobuf Validation:** Leverage Protobuf's built-in validation features (if available) or use a validation library.
    *   **Secure gRPC Communication:** Always use TLS with gRPC to encrypt communication.
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement authentication and authorization for gRPC services, similar to other services.
