# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: DDoS Attack on Ordering Service (eShop)

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the identified high-risk attack path (DDoS on Ordering Service) within the eShop application.  This involves understanding the specific vulnerabilities, potential attack vectors, and the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to enhance the resilience of the Ordering service against DDoS attacks.  We aim to move beyond a simple listing of mitigations and delve into *how* they should be implemented and configured within the eShop context.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following attack tree path:

*   **High-Risk Path 2: DDoS Attack on Ordering Service**
    *   **2.1.1 Target Ordering Service [CN]**
    *   **2.1.1.1 Flood API Requests [HR]**

The scope includes:

*   The Ordering microservice within the eShop application (as defined by the provided GitHub repository: https://github.com/dotnet/eshop).
*   The API endpoints exposed by the Ordering service.
*   The infrastructure components directly involved in handling requests to the Ordering service (e.g., API Gateway - Ocelot, load balancers, network infrastructure).
*   The interaction of the Ordering service with other microservices, *only* insofar as it relates to the propagation or mitigation of a DDoS attack.

The scope *excludes*:

*   Other attack vectors against the Ordering service (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
*   Attacks targeting other microservices within eShop, unless they directly impact the Ordering service's availability during a DDoS.
*   Physical security or social engineering aspects.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the relevant code in the eShop repository, focusing on:
    *   The Ordering service's API controllers and methods.
    *   Ocelot configuration files (for rate limiting, routing, etc.).
    *   Any existing error handling and resilience mechanisms (e.g., circuit breakers).
    *   Dependency injection configurations related to networking and request handling.

2.  **Infrastructure Analysis:**  Analyze the deployment configuration (e.g., Docker Compose files, Kubernetes manifests if applicable) to understand:
    *   How the Ordering service is exposed (ports, services).
    *   The presence and configuration of load balancers.
    *   Network policies and firewall rules.

3.  **Mitigation Strategy Evaluation:**  For each proposed mitigation strategy, we will:
    *   Assess its feasibility within the eShop architecture.
    *   Identify specific configuration points and code changes required.
    *   Evaluate potential performance impacts.
    *   Consider edge cases and potential bypasses.

4.  **Threat Modeling:**  Use threat modeling techniques (e.g., STRIDE) to identify potential variations of the DDoS attack and ensure mitigations are comprehensive.

5.  **Documentation Review:** Review any existing documentation related to the Ordering service's security and resilience.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

### 4.1.  2.1.1 Target Ordering Service [CN]

*   **Description:**  The attacker identifies the Ordering service as a critical component.  This is a logical prerequisite for any targeted attack.
*   **Analysis:** The Ordering service is inherently a high-value target because it's directly involved in the core business function: processing orders.  Disrupting this service directly impacts revenue and customer satisfaction.  The attacker's reconnaissance might involve:
    *   **Examining the eShop application's frontend:**  Observing network requests made during the checkout process to identify the Ordering service's API endpoints.
    *   **Analyzing publicly available information:**  Reviewing the GitHub repository, documentation, or blog posts about the eShop architecture.
    *   **Port scanning:**  If the eShop deployment is not properly secured, the attacker might be able to directly probe the network for exposed services.

### 4.2. 2.1.1.1 Flood API Requests [HR]

*   **Description:** The attacker overwhelms the Ordering service's API with a high volume of requests.
*   **Analysis:** This is the core of the DDoS attack.  Several attack vectors are possible:
    *   **Simple HTTP Flood:**  A large number of basic HTTP requests (GET, POST) are sent to the Ordering service's API endpoints.  This can be achieved using readily available tools or botnets.
    *   **Application-Layer Flood:**  The attacker crafts requests that are more resource-intensive for the Ordering service to process.  For example, they might:
        *   Submit orders with a large number of items.
        *   Repeatedly call API endpoints that involve complex database queries or calculations.
        *   Exploit any known performance bottlenecks in the Ordering service's code.
    *   **Amplification Attacks:**  While less likely for a direct API attack, the attacker could potentially leverage vulnerabilities in other services or protocols to amplify the attack traffic directed at the Ordering service.
    * **Slowloris/Slow Body/Slow Read:** These attacks consume resources by establishing connections but sending data very slowly, or not completing requests.

*   **Vulnerability Analysis (eShop Specific):**
    *   **Lack of Rate Limiting:**  If Ocelot (the API Gateway) is not configured with appropriate rate limiting rules for the Ordering service's endpoints, the service is highly vulnerable.  We need to examine the `ocelot.json` (or equivalent) configuration file.
    *   **Insufficient Resource Allocation:**  The Ordering service might be deployed with insufficient CPU, memory, or database connections to handle a surge in traffic.  We need to review the deployment configuration (Docker Compose, Kubernetes).
    *   **Inefficient Code:**  The Ordering service's code might contain performance bottlenecks that make it more susceptible to DDoS.  This requires a code review of the relevant controllers and services.  For example, synchronous database calls without proper timeouts could be a problem.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:**  If the Ordering service doesn't properly validate input data, the attacker might be able to craft requests that consume excessive resources.  For example, submitting orders with extremely large or invalid item quantities.
    *  **Lack of Asynchronous Processing:** If order processing is entirely synchronous, a flood of requests can quickly exhaust available threads, leading to denial of service.

### 4.3. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed Evaluation)

*   **Implement rate limiting and throttling (Ocelot and Ordering Service):**
    *   **Ocelot Configuration:**  The `ocelot.json` file should be configured with `RateLimitOptions` for the routes that map to the Ordering service.  This includes setting `ClientWhitelist`, `EnableRateLimiting`, `Period`, `PeriodTimespan`, `Limit`, and potentially `QuotaExceededResponse`.  Crucially, rate limiting should be applied *before* any authentication or authorization checks to prevent authenticated users from being used in a DDoS attack.  Different rate limits might be needed for different API endpoints based on their resource consumption.
        ```json
        // Example Ocelot configuration snippet
        {
          "DownstreamPathTemplate": "/api/v1/orders",
          "DownstreamScheme": "http",
          "DownstreamHostAndPorts": [
            {
              "Host": "ordering.api",
              "Port": 80
            }
          ],
          "UpstreamPathTemplate": "/orders",
          "UpstreamHttpMethod": [ "POST", "GET" ],
          "RateLimitOptions": {
            "ClientWhitelist": [],
            "EnableRateLimiting": true,
            "Period": "1s",
            "PeriodTimespan": 1,
            "Limit": 10, // Allow 10 requests per second
            "QuotaExceededResponse": {
                "StatusCode": 429,
                "Body": "Too Many Requests"
            }
          }
        }
        ```
    *   **Ordering Service (Fallback):**  While Ocelot provides the first line of defense, the Ordering service itself should also implement rate limiting as a fallback.  This can be done using libraries like `AspNetCoreRateLimit`. This is crucial in case Ocelot is bypassed or misconfigured.
    *   **Dynamic Rate Limiting:** Consider implementing dynamic rate limiting based on the current load of the Ordering service.  This can be achieved by monitoring metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, and request queue length.

*   **Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN):**
    *   **Applicability:**  A CDN is primarily useful for caching static content.  While the Ordering service's API likely doesn't serve much static content, a CDN *can* still help by:
        *   Absorbing some of the initial attack traffic, reducing the load on the origin server.
        *   Providing DDoS protection features at the edge of the network.
    *   **Implementation:**  This would involve configuring a CDN (e.g., Azure CDN, Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront) to sit in front of the eShop application.

*   **Implement circuit breakers (Polly):**
    *   **Purpose:**  Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures.  If the Ordering service becomes overloaded and starts failing, the circuit breaker will "trip" and prevent further requests from being sent to it, giving it time to recover.
    *   **Implementation:**  The eShop application likely already uses Polly for resilience.  We need to ensure that Polly is configured with appropriate circuit breaker policies for calls *to* the Ordering service (from other microservices) and for calls *within* the Ordering service (e.g., to the database).  This involves configuring `CircuitBreakerPolicy` with parameters like `exceptionsAllowedBeforeBreaking`, `durationOfBreak`, and potentially `onBreak`, `onReset`, and `onHalfOpen` actions.
    *   **Integration with Health Checks:** The circuit breaker should be integrated with health checks.  If the Ordering service's health check reports it as unhealthy, the circuit breaker should trip.

*   **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    *   **Purpose:**  A WAF can detect and block malicious traffic patterns, including those associated with DDoS attacks.  It can also provide protection against other web application vulnerabilities.
    *   **Implementation:**  This would involve deploying a WAF (e.g., Azure Application Gateway with WAF, AWS WAF, Cloudflare WAF) in front of the eShop application.  The WAF should be configured with rules to detect and block common DDoS attack patterns, such as:
        *   High request rates from a single IP address.
        *   Requests with unusual headers or user agents.
        *   Requests that match known attack signatures.
    *   **OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS):** Consider using the OWASP CRS to provide a baseline level of protection.

*   **Monitor network traffic:**
    *   **Implementation:**  Use network monitoring tools (e.g., Azure Monitor, AWS CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana) to track key metrics, such as:
        *   Request rate to the Ordering service's API endpoints.
        *   Response times.
        *   Error rates.
        *   Network bandwidth usage.
    *   **Alerting:**  Configure alerts to notify administrators when these metrics exceed predefined thresholds, indicating a potential DDoS attack.

*   **Have a DDoS response plan:**
    *   **Documentation:**  Create a documented plan that outlines the steps to take in the event of a DDoS attack.  This plan should include:
        *   Contact information for key personnel.
        *   Procedures for identifying and classifying the attack.
        *   Steps for mitigating the attack (e.g., enabling stricter rate limiting, scaling up resources, contacting the hosting provider).
        *   Procedures for recovering from the attack.
        *   Communication protocols (internal and external).
    *   **Regular Drills:** Conduct regular drills to test the DDoS response plan and ensure that personnel are familiar with the procedures.

* **Additional Considerations Specific to eShop and .NET:**
    * **Connection Pooling:** Ensure that the Ordering service is using connection pooling effectively to avoid exhausting database connections during a flood of requests. Review `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs` where database connections are configured.
    * **Asynchronous Operations:** Utilize asynchronous programming (`async`/`await`) extensively within the Ordering service to prevent thread starvation. This is particularly important for I/O-bound operations like database calls and network requests.
    * **Caching:** Implement caching where appropriate to reduce the load on the database and improve performance. However, be mindful of cache invalidation during a DDoS attack.
    * **Resource Quotas (Kubernetes):** If deploying to Kubernetes, use resource quotas to limit the resources that the Ordering service can consume. This can prevent a single service from monopolizing resources and impacting other services.
    * **.NET-Specific DDoS Protection:** Explore .NET-specific libraries or techniques for DDoS mitigation, such as those related to request filtering or connection management.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The Ordering service in the eShop application is a critical component and a prime target for DDoS attacks.  The analysis above highlights several vulnerabilities and provides detailed recommendations for mitigating the risk.  The most important recommendations are:

1.  **Implement robust rate limiting at both the API Gateway (Ocelot) and the Ordering service level.** This is the first and most crucial line of defense.
2.  **Ensure the Ordering service code is optimized for performance and resilience.** This includes using asynchronous operations, proper connection pooling, and input validation.
3.  **Deploy a WAF and configure it with appropriate rules to detect and block DDoS attack patterns.**
4.  **Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting to detect attacks early.**
5.  **Develop and regularly test a DDoS response plan.**
6. **Utilize circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures.**

By implementing these recommendations, the eShop application's Ordering service can be significantly hardened against DDoS attacks, ensuring its availability and protecting the business from disruption. Continuous monitoring and regular security assessments are essential to maintain a strong security posture.
