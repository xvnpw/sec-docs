# Threat Model Analysis for dotnet/eshop

## Threat: [Vulnerable Inter-Service Communication](./threats/vulnerable_inter-service_communication.md)

**Threat:** Vulnerable Inter-Service Communication
* **Description:** An attacker could intercept or manipulate network traffic between eShop microservices (e.g., `Web.Shopping.HttpAggregator`, `Services.Basket`, `Services.Catalog`, `Services.Ordering`) if the communication isn't properly secured within the application's design. They might eavesdrop on sensitive data exchanged via HTTP or gRPC or forge requests to perform unauthorized actions, such as modifying orders or accessing user data. This directly relates to how eShop's services interact.
* **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification within eShop's domain, potential for service disruption if critical inter-service communication is disrupted.
* **Affected Component:**  Communication layer between eShop microservices, specifically the HTTP or gRPC clients and servers implemented within each service (e.g., controllers, service clients). Also affects the API Gateways like `Web.Shopping.HttpAggregator`.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for authenticating and encrypting communication between eShop services. This would involve configuring certificates and secure communication channels within the service implementations.
    * Utilize signed JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) for authorization and integrity of inter-service requests. This requires implementing token generation, signing, and verification logic within the eShop services.
    * Isolate eShop microservices on a private network or use a service mesh with built-in security features. This is more of a deployment strategy but directly impacts how eShop services communicate.

## Threat: [Identity Service Compromise](./threats/identity_service_compromise.md)

**Threat:** Identity Service Compromise
* **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Identity Service, which is a core component for authentication and authorization in eShop. This could be through exploiting vulnerabilities within the Identity Service's implementation (likely IdentityServer4 or similar, as used by eShop), brute-forcing credentials if the service is exposed, or social engineering targeting administrative accounts. Once compromised, the attacker can mint valid authentication tokens, potentially gaining access to all other eShop services and impersonating any user.
* **Impact:** Complete compromise of the eShop application, as the attacker can impersonate any user or service, leading to data breaches (customer data, order details, etc.), unauthorized transactions, and service disruption.
* **Affected Component:** The Identity Service project within the eShop solution (likely a separate project or container), its authentication endpoints, token issuance logic, and the storage of user credentials.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative accounts of the Identity Service and potentially for all users interacting with eShop. This requires integrating MFA providers into the Identity Service.
    * Regularly patch and update the Identity Service software and its dependencies. This involves staying up-to-date with security advisories for IdentityServer4 or the chosen identity provider.
    * Securely store and manage signing keys used by the Identity Service. This is crucial for preventing token forgery and is a direct responsibility of the eShop deployment.
    * Implement robust intrusion detection and prevention systems around the Identity Service infrastructure.
    * Enforce strong password policies and account lockout mechanisms within the Identity Service configuration.

## Threat: [Insecure Credential Storage within eShop Services](./threats/insecure_credential_storage_within_eshop_services.md)

**Threat:** Insecure Credential Storage within eShop Services
* **Description:** Individual eShop microservices might store sensitive credentials (e.g., database passwords, API keys for external services like payment gateways) in plain text configuration files, environment variables without proper encryption, or even within the codebase itself. An attacker gaining access to a service's environment (e.g., through a container vulnerability or compromised server) could easily retrieve these credentials. This is a direct implementation flaw within the eShop service code and configuration.
* **Impact:** Compromise of backend databases used by eShop (e.g., the SQL Server databases for Catalog, Ordering, etc.) or external services, allowing attackers to access or manipulate sensitive data related to the eShop application. This could also lead to further lateral movement within the infrastructure.
* **Affected Component:** Configuration management within individual eShop microservices (e.g., `appsettings.json`, environment variable handling), specifically where database connection strings, API keys, and other secrets are stored.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Utilize secure secret management solutions like Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, or similar, and integrate them into the eShop deployment process to securely inject secrets into the services.
    * Avoid storing secrets directly in configuration files or environment variables. Refactor the eShop code to retrieve secrets from the secure vault.
    * Encrypt sensitive data at rest within the eShop databases.
    * Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to secrets management resources.

## Threat: [Authorization Logic Flaws in eShop Microservices](./threats/authorization_logic_flaws_in_eshop_microservices.md)

**Threat:** Authorization Logic Flaws in eShop Microservices
* **Description:** Bugs or misconfigurations in the authorization logic implemented within eShop microservices could allow users to access or modify resources they are not authorized to. For example, a user might be able to view another user's order details in the `Services.Ordering` service or add items to another user's basket in the `Services.Basket` service due to flawed authorization checks within the service's code. This is a direct vulnerability in the business logic of the eShop application.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive customer data, potential for data manipulation (e.g., modifying orders, deleting items), and violation of user privacy within the eShop platform.
* **Affected Component:** Authorization logic implemented within individual eShop microservices' APIs (e.g., controllers in `Services.Ordering`, `Services.Basket`) and business logic. This includes code that checks user roles, permissions, and ownership of resources.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement a consistent and well-defined authorization framework across all eShop microservices. This might involve using policy-based authorization or a centralized authorization service.
    * Thoroughly test authorization rules and edge cases within each eShop service. Implement unit and integration tests specifically for authorization logic.
    * Utilize attribute-based access control (ABAC) for more granular authorization within eShop services, allowing for more complex permission rules based on resource attributes.
    * Regularly review and audit authorization policies and code within the eShop application.

## Threat: [Price Manipulation Vulnerabilities](./threats/price_manipulation_vulnerabilities.md)

**Threat:** Price Manipulation Vulnerabilities
* **Description:** Flaws in the `Services.Catalog` or potentially the `Web.Shopping.HttpAggregator` (if it handles price calculations) could allow attackers to manipulate product prices displayed to users or used in order processing. This could be through direct API calls if not properly secured or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the business logic that calculates or retrieves prices within the eShop codebase.
* **Impact:** Financial loss for the business due to underpriced products, potential for reputational damage if customers discover manipulated prices.
* **Affected Component:** Catalog API endpoints in `Services.Catalog`, pricing logic within `Services.Catalog` or potentially `Web.Shopping.HttpAggregator`, and the database storing product information.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement strict input validation and sanitization for price-related data in the `Services.Catalog` API.
    * Secure API endpoints used for modifying product information in `Services.Catalog` with strong authentication and authorization.
    * Implement audit logging for price changes within the `Services.Catalog` service.
    * Regularly review and test pricing logic within the eShop codebase.
