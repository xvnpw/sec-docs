## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Modify Application Settings for Malicious Purposes (eShopOnWeb)

**Attack Tree Path:** Modify Application Settings for Malicious Purposes

**Description:** Allows attackers to alter the application's behavior, potentially disabling security features, redirecting traffic, or causing other harm. The impact is significant.

**Context:** This analysis focuses on the eShopOnWeb application (https://github.com/dotnet/eshop), a reference application built using .NET. We will examine how an attacker could achieve this goal and the potential consequences.

**I. Detailed Analysis of the Attack Path:**

This attack path revolves around gaining unauthorized access and write privileges to the application's configuration settings. These settings can be stored in various locations within the eShopOnWeb application, including:

* **`appsettings.json` and `appsettings.<Environment>.json`:** These files are the primary source of configuration in ASP.NET Core applications. They contain settings for database connections, logging, authentication, third-party integrations, and more.
* **Environment Variables:**  Configuration can be overridden or supplemented by environment variables set on the server or within the container.
* **Azure App Configuration (if used):**  For cloud deployments, eShopOnWeb might leverage Azure App Configuration for centralized configuration management.
* **Command-line arguments:** While less common for persistent settings, some configuration might be passed as command-line arguments during application startup.
* **Database Configuration Tables (less likely in core eShopOnWeb, but possible in extensions):**  In some scenarios, configuration might be stored in database tables.

**The attacker's goal is to manipulate these settings to achieve malicious objectives. This can involve:**

* **Direct Modification:** Directly altering the configuration files or environment variables.
* **Exploiting Vulnerabilities:** Leveraging weaknesses in the application or its infrastructure to gain write access to configuration settings.
* **Leveraging Weak Access Controls:** Exploiting misconfigured permissions or weak authentication mechanisms to access and modify configuration.

**II. Potential Attack Vectors and Techniques:**

Here's a breakdown of potential attack vectors an attacker might employ to modify application settings in eShopOnWeb:

**A. Exploiting Infrastructure Vulnerabilities:**

* **Compromised Server/Container:** If the underlying server or container hosting the eShopOnWeb application is compromised, the attacker likely gains full access, including the ability to modify configuration files directly. This could be due to:
    * **Unpatched Operating System or Container Image:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the OS or container runtime.
    * **Weak Credentials:** Default or easily guessable passwords for server access (SSH, RDP).
    * **Misconfigured Security Groups/Firewalls:** Allowing unauthorized access to the server.
* **Compromised Deployment Pipeline:** If the CI/CD pipeline used to deploy eShopOnWeb is compromised, an attacker could inject malicious configuration changes during the build or deployment process.
* **Cloud Provider Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within the cloud platform (e.g., Azure) hosting the application to gain access to resources, including configuration stores.

**B. Exploiting Application Vulnerabilities:**

* **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**  If the application has an LFI vulnerability, an attacker might be able to read sensitive configuration files like `appsettings.json`. While direct modification through LFI is less common, it could reveal sensitive information needed for further attacks.
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  A successful RCE vulnerability would grant the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server, allowing them to modify configuration files or environment variables.
* **SQL Injection (less direct but possible):** While less direct, if configuration is stored in a database (e.g., for feature flags), a SQL injection vulnerability could be used to modify those settings.
* **Weak Authentication/Authorization on Administrative Interfaces:** If the eShopOnWeb application (or any associated management interface) has weak authentication or authorization, an attacker could gain access and potentially modify configuration settings through legitimate (but misused) channels.
* **Exploiting Misconfigured or Unsecured APIs:** If the application exposes APIs for managing configuration (which is less likely in the core eShopOnWeb but possible in extensions), vulnerabilities in these APIs could be exploited.

**C. Leveraging Weak Access Controls and Misconfigurations:**

* **Insecure Storage of Secrets:** If sensitive configuration values (like database connection strings) are stored in plain text within configuration files or environment variables without proper encryption or secure vaulting, an attacker gaining read access could exploit this.
* **Overly Permissive File System Permissions:** If the web server process has write access to configuration files, and a vulnerability allows an attacker to execute code within that process, they could modify the files.
* **Exposed Management Endpoints:** If administrative or configuration endpoints are exposed without proper authentication or are accessible from the public internet, attackers could potentially manipulate settings.

**D. Social Engineering and Insider Threats:**

* **Phishing Attacks:** Tricking administrators or developers into revealing credentials that grant access to systems where configuration is managed.
* **Compromised Administrator Accounts:** Gaining access to legitimate administrator accounts through credential stuffing, brute-force attacks, or other methods.
* **Malicious Insiders:** A disgruntled or compromised employee with legitimate access to configuration systems could intentionally modify settings for malicious purposes.

**III. Impact Analysis:**

The impact of successfully modifying application settings can be significant and far-reaching:

* **Disabling Security Features:**
    * **Turning off Authentication/Authorization:**  Allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionalities.
    * **Disabling Input Validation:**  Opening the door for various injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS).
    * **Disabling Logging and Auditing:**  Hiding malicious activities and hindering incident response.
    * **Weakening Encryption:**  Potentially exposing sensitive data in transit or at rest.
* **Data Manipulation and Theft:**
    * **Changing Database Connection Strings:**  Redirecting the application to a malicious database to steal or manipulate data.
    * **Modifying Data Access Settings:**  Granting unauthorized users access to sensitive data.
* **Service Disruption and Denial of Service (DoS):**
    * **Changing Resource Limits:**  Causing the application to consume excessive resources and become unavailable.
    * **Modifying Logging Settings:**  Flooding logs to overwhelm the system or hide malicious activity.
    * **Changing Service Endpoints:**  Breaking integrations with other services.
* **Traffic Redirection and Phishing:**
    * **Modifying URLs and Redirects:**  Redirecting users to malicious websites for phishing or malware distribution.
    * **Changing Content Delivery Network (CDN) Settings:**  Serving malicious content to users.
* **Privilege Escalation:**
    * **Modifying User Roles and Permissions:**  Granting attackers higher privileges within the application.
* **Financial Loss and Reputational Damage:**  All the above impacts can lead to significant financial losses due to data breaches, service outages, and the cost of recovery. Reputational damage can be severe and long-lasting.

**IV. Mitigation Strategies:**

To prevent and mitigate the risk of attackers modifying application settings, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Secure Configuration Management:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only necessary access to configuration files and systems.
    * **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing and modifying configuration.
    * **Encryption of Sensitive Configuration Data:** Encrypt sensitive information like database connection strings, API keys, and secrets at rest and in transit. Consider using Azure Key Vault or similar secret management solutions.
