## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit Authorization Issues / Access Administrative Functionality Without Proper Credentials

This analysis delves into the attack tree path "Exploit Authorization Issues / Access Administrative Functionality Without Proper Credentials" within the context of the eShopOnWeb application. We'll break down the potential attack vectors, the impact of a successful attack, and provide actionable mitigation strategies for the development team.

**Understanding the Attack Path:**

This attack path focuses on bypassing the intended authorization mechanisms of the eShopOnWeb application to gain access to administrative functionalities. The core principle is that an attacker, without legitimate administrative credentials, manages to execute actions or access data that should be restricted to authorized administrators.

**Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

Here's a more granular breakdown of how an attacker might achieve this:

1. **Target Identification:** The attacker first identifies administrative functionalities within the eShopOnWeb application. This could involve:
    * **URL Guessing/Enumeration:** Trying common administrative URLs like `/admin`, `/dashboard`, `/settings`, etc.
    * **Analyzing Client-Side Code:** Inspecting JavaScript, HTML, or API calls for references to administrative endpoints.
    * **Error Messages:** Exploiting error messages that might reveal administrative paths or parameters.
    * **Publicly Available Information:** Consulting documentation, blog posts, or older versions of the application for clues.

2. **Authorization Bypass Attempts:** Once potential administrative functionalities are identified, the attacker will attempt to bypass the authorization checks. This can be achieved through various techniques:

    * **Direct Object Reference Manipulation:**
        * **Modified IDs:** Tampering with URL parameters or request body data (e.g., changing a product ID to an administrative user ID) to access resources they shouldn't.
        * **Missing Authorization Checks:** Exploiting endpoints that lack proper authorization checks, assuming only authenticated users can reach them.
    * **Parameter Tampering:**
        * **Role Manipulation:** Modifying parameters related to user roles or permissions in requests.
        * **Bypassing Conditional Checks:** Altering parameters that control access based on user attributes or session data.
    * **Session Hijacking/Fixation:**
        * **XSS Attacks:** Injecting malicious scripts to steal administrator session cookies.
        * **Session Fixation:** Forcing a known session ID onto an administrator.
    * **SQL Injection:**
        * **Bypassing Authentication:** Crafting malicious SQL queries to bypass login checks or retrieve administrative credentials.
        * **Modifying User Roles:** Injecting SQL to directly alter user roles or permissions in the database.
    * **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):**
        * **Predictable IDs:** If administrative resources are accessed using sequential or predictable IDs, an attacker might guess or brute-force them.
    * **Forced Browsing:**
        * **Accessing Unlinked Pages:** Directly navigating to administrative pages that are not linked from the main application.
    * **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Authorization Logic:**
        * **Logical Flaws:** Identifying flaws in the custom authorization code that can be manipulated.
        * **Race Conditions:** Exploiting timing vulnerabilities in authorization checks.
    * **Default Credentials:**
        * **Guessing Default Passwords:** Attempting to log in with common default credentials for administrator accounts (if they haven't been changed).
    * **Privilege Escalation:**
        * **Compromising a Lower-Privilege Account:** Gaining access to a regular user account and then exploiting vulnerabilities to escalate privileges to an administrative level.
    * **API Key Compromise:**
        * **Leaked API Keys:** If administrative functionalities are protected by API keys, and these keys are leaked or exposed, attackers can use them.

**Impact of Successful Attack:**

Gaining unauthorized access to administrative functionality can have severe consequences:

* **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive customer data, order information, financial details, and potentially intellectual property.
* **Application Disruption:**  Altering application configurations, disabling features, or even taking the application offline.
* **Malicious Code Injection:** Injecting malicious code into the application to further compromise systems or users.
* **Account Manipulation:** Creating, deleting, or modifying user accounts, including administrator accounts.
* **Financial Loss:**  Fraudulent transactions, data recovery costs, legal fees, and reputational damage.
* **Reputational Damage:** Loss of customer trust and damage to the brand's reputation.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Failure to meet regulatory requirements like GDPR, PCI DSS, etc.

**Potential Vulnerabilities in eShopOnWeb:**

Considering the eShopOnWeb application built with ASP.NET Core, potential vulnerabilities that could lead to this attack path include:

* **Insecure Authentication and Authorization Implementation:**
    * **Missing or Weak Authorization Attributes:**  Administrative controllers or actions lacking the necessary `[Authorize]` attributes or relying on insecure custom authorization logic.
    * **Overly Permissive Authorization Rules:**  Authorization rules that grant broader access than intended.
    * **Incorrect Role Checks:**  Flaws in the logic that determines if a user belongs to the administrative role.
* **Vulnerabilities in ASP.NET Core Identity Configuration:**
    * **Default Usernames/Passwords:**  Not changing default administrator credentials during setup.
    * **Weak Password Policies:**  Allowing easily guessable passwords for administrator accounts.
    * **Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Making it easier for attackers to gain access with compromised credentials.
* **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Unparameterized Queries:**  Using string concatenation to build SQL queries, making the application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks that could bypass authentication or manipulate roles.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Unsanitized Input:**  Failing to properly sanitize user input, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts that could steal administrator session cookies.
* **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):**
    * **Predictable IDs:**  Using predictable IDs for administrative resources, allowing attackers to guess and access them.
* **API Security Issues:**
    * **Missing or Weak Authentication/Authorization for APIs:**  Administrative APIs not properly secured, allowing unauthorized access.
    * **Exposed API Keys:**  Accidentally exposing API keys used for administrative functions.

**Mitigation Strategies for the Development Team:**

To prevent this attack path, the development team should implement the following security measures:

* **Robust Authentication and Authorization:**
    * **Implement Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong password policies, implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrator accounts.
