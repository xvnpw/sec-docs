## Deep Analysis: Manipulate Basket Data for Financial Gain - eShopOnWeb

This analysis delves into the "Manipulate Basket Data for Financial Gain" attack tree path for the eShopOnWeb application, focusing on the technical aspects, potential vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies for each attack vector.

**Overall Goal:** Manipulate Basket Data for Financial Gain

This overarching goal highlights a critical area of concern for any e-commerce platform: ensuring the integrity of the shopping basket and preventing attackers from manipulating it to their financial advantage. Success in this area directly translates to financial losses for the application owner.

**Attack Vector 1: Add Items with Modified Prices**

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts or manipulates the process of adding items to the basket to modify the price of the items before checkout. This implies the attacker can influence the price data sent to the server when adding an item to their cart.

*   **Technical Breakdown:**
    *   **Client-Side Manipulation:** The attacker might use browser developer tools or intercept HTTP requests (using tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP) to modify the data sent when an "Add to Basket" action is triggered. This could involve altering the `price` parameter in the request body or URL.
    *   **API Endpoint Vulnerability:** If the API endpoint responsible for adding items to the basket doesn't perform proper server-side price validation, it might blindly accept the price sent by the client.
    *   **Race Conditions (Less Likely in this Specific Scenario but worth noting):** In highly concurrent environments with improper locking mechanisms, an attacker might try to exploit race conditions during the price retrieval and basket update process. However, for simple "add to basket" actions, this is less probable.

*   **Potential Vulnerabilities in eShopOnWeb:**
    *   **Lack of Server-Side Price Verification:** This is the most critical vulnerability. If the backend doesn't re-fetch the item price from a trusted source (like the product catalog database) based on the item ID, it's susceptible to client-side price manipulation.
    *   **Insufficient Input Validation:** While not directly related to price verification, inadequate input validation on the "Add to Basket" endpoint could allow attackers to inject malicious code or unexpected data, potentially leading to other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Insecure API Design:**  If the API endpoint for adding to the basket is publicly accessible without proper authentication or authorization, it increases the attack surface.

*   **Risk Analysis:**
    *   **Likelihood: Medium.**  This depends heavily on the implementation. If the development team relies solely on client-side logic or doesn't implement robust server-side checks, the likelihood is higher. The use of HTTPS protects the data in transit from eavesdropping but doesn't prevent a determined attacker from modifying the request on their own machine before it's sent.
    *   **Impact: Significant.**  Successful exploitation leads to direct financial loss for the application owner, as attackers can purchase items at drastically reduced prices. This can also impact inventory management and reporting.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Server-Side Price Verification:** The backend MUST retrieve the current price of the item from a trusted source (e.g., the product catalog database) based on the `productId` received in the "Add to Basket" request. The client-provided price should be completely ignored.
    *   **Secure API Design and Authentication:** Ensure the "Add to Basket" API endpoint requires proper authentication and authorization to prevent unauthorized access.
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation on all parameters received by the API endpoint, including `productId` and `quantity`, to prevent unexpected data or injection attacks.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the "Add to Basket" endpoint to mitigate potential automated attacks attempting to add large quantities of items with modified prices.
    *   **Logging and Monitoring:** Log all "Add to Basket" requests, including the item ID, quantity, and the price received. Monitor for unusual patterns or discrepancies between the received price and the actual product price.

**Attack Vector 2: Apply Invalid or Excessive Discounts**

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits flaws in the discount code logic or validation to apply invalid or excessively large discounts to their orders. This targets the discount functionality of the application.

*   **Technical Breakdown:**
    *   **Predictable Discount Codes:**  If discount codes are generated using simple or predictable algorithms, attackers might be able to guess valid codes.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Attackers might attempt to brute-force discount codes by trying a large number of possibilities.
    *   **Logic Flaws in Discount Application:** Vulnerabilities might exist in how discounts are applied, such as:
        *   **Bypassing Validation Checks:**  Manipulating the request to bypass validation logic that should prevent the application of certain discounts.
        *   **Applying Multiple Discounts:** Exploiting flaws that allow the application of multiple discounts intended to be mutually exclusive.
        *   **Using Expired Codes:**  Circumventing checks that should prevent the use of expired discount codes.
        *   **Manipulating Quantity Requirements:**  Finding ways to apply discounts meant for larger orders to smaller orders.
    *   **Database Manipulation (Less Likely but Possible):** In scenarios with direct database access vulnerabilities, an attacker might try to directly modify discount code data in the database.

*   **Potential Vulnerabilities in eShopOnWeb:**
    *   **Weak Discount Code Generation:**  Using sequential or easily guessable patterns for discount code generation.
    *   **Insufficient Server-Side Validation:**  Not properly validating discount codes against their defined rules (validity period, usage limits, applicable products/categories, minimum order value, etc.) on the server-side.
    *   **Client-Side Validation Reliance:**  Solely relying on client-side validation for discount codes, which can be easily bypassed.
    *   **Lack of Authorization Controls:**  Not properly restricting who can create, modify, or delete discount codes.
    *   **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:**  If discount code validation logic involves dynamically constructed SQL queries without proper sanitization, it could be vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing attackers to bypass validation or even manipulate discount data.

*   **Risk Analysis:**
    *   **Likelihood: Medium.** This depends on the complexity and security of the discount system. Simple discount logic or a lack of robust validation increases the likelihood.
    *   **Impact: Moderate.**  While not as directly impactful as price manipulation, excessive or invalid discounts still lead to financial loss for the application owner, reducing profit margins.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Discount Code Generation:** Use cryptographically secure random number generators to create unpredictable and unique discount codes.
    *   **Robust Server-Side Validation:** Implement comprehensive server-side validation for all discount codes, verifying their validity period, usage limits, applicability to the current cart contents, and any other relevant constraints.
    *   **Avoid Client-Side Validation as the Sole Security Measure:** Client-side validation is for user experience, not security. All critical validation MUST be performed on the server-side.
    *   **Secure Storage of Discount Codes:** Store discount codes securely in the database, potentially using hashing or encryption if sensitive information is included.
    *   **Authorization Controls:** Implement proper role-based access control to restrict who can create, modify, and delete discount codes.
    *   **Rate Limiting on Discount Application:** Implement rate limiting on the discount code application endpoint to mitigate brute-force attacks.
    *   **Regular Audits of Discount Logic:** Periodically review the discount code generation, validation, and application logic for potential flaws or vulnerabilities.
    *   **Parameterized Queries/ORMs:**  When interacting with the database to validate discount codes, use parameterized queries or an ORM like Entity Framework Core to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**General Recommendations for eShopOnWeb Development Team:**

*   **Adopt a "Never Trust the Client" Mentality:**  Always validate and sanitize data received from the client on the server-side.
*   **Implement Strong Server-Side Validation:**  This is crucial for both price and discount code integrity.
*   **Secure API Design Principles:**  Follow secure API design principles, including proper authentication, authorization, and input validation.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Security Awareness Training for Developers:**  Educate developers on common web application vulnerabilities and secure coding practices.
*   **Utilize Security Headers:** Implement appropriate security headers to protect against common attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Clickjacking.
*   **Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date:** Regularly update all libraries and frameworks to patch known security vulnerabilities.
