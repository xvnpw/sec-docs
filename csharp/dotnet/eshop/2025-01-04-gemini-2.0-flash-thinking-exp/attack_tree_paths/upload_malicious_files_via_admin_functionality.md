## Deep Analysis: Upload Malicious Files via Admin Functionality - eShopOnWeb

**Context:** This analysis focuses on the attack path "Upload Malicious Files via Admin Functionality" within the context of the eShopOnWeb application (https://github.com/dotnet/eshop). This attack leverages the privileges of an administrative user to upload files that can then be exploited to compromise the server.

**Severity:** **Critical**

**Introduction:**

The ability for administrators to upload files is a common feature in web applications, often used for managing content, plugins, or themes. However, if not implemented securely, this functionality can be a significant vulnerability. An attacker who gains access to the administrative panel can exploit this feature to upload malicious files, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE), data breaches, or denial-of-service. This analysis will delve into the specifics of this attack path, considering the potential methods, impacts, detection, and mitigation strategies relevant to the eShopOnWeb application.

**Detailed Analysis of the Attack Path:**

1. **Attacker Goal:** The primary goal of the attacker is to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the eShopOnWeb application. This can be achieved by uploading and then accessing a malicious file.

2. **Prerequisites:**
    * **Compromised Administrator Credentials:** The attacker must have valid administrative credentials to access the admin panel. This could be obtained through various means, including:
        * **Credential Stuffing/Brute-force:** Attempting to log in with commonly used or leaked credentials.
        * **Phishing:** Tricking an administrator into revealing their credentials.
        * **Exploiting other vulnerabilities:** Gaining access through a less privileged account and then escalating privileges.
        * **Insider Threat:** A malicious actor with legitimate access.
    * **Vulnerable File Upload Functionality:** The admin panel must have a file upload feature that lacks sufficient security controls. This could involve:
        * **Lack of File Type Validation:** Allowing the upload of executable file types (e.g., `.aspx`, `.php`, `.jsp`, `.py`, `.sh`).
        * **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** Not properly sanitizing the filename or file content, potentially allowing for path traversal or other injection attacks.
        * **Predictable or Publicly Accessible Upload Location:** Storing uploaded files in a location that can be easily accessed by an attacker.
        * **Lack of Proper Permissions:** Uploaded files being stored with execute permissions.

3. **Attack Execution Steps:**

    * **Accessing the Admin Panel:** The attacker logs into the administrative interface using the compromised credentials.
    * **Locating the File Upload Feature:** The attacker identifies the file upload functionality within the admin panel. This might be related to managing products, categories, themes, or plugins.
    * **Crafting a Malicious File:** The attacker creates a malicious file designed to execute code on the server. Examples include:
        * **Web Shell:** A script (e.g., `.aspx`, `.php`) that allows the attacker to execute commands remotely through a web interface.
        * **Reverse Shell:** A script that connects back to the attacker's machine, providing command-line access.
        * **Malicious Libraries/Plugins:**  Files designed to be loaded by the application, containing malicious code.
    * **Uploading the Malicious File:** The attacker uses the file upload functionality to upload the crafted malicious file.
    * **Accessing the Malicious File:** The attacker attempts to access the uploaded file through a web browser. This could involve knowing or guessing the file's location on the server.
    * **Code Execution:** If the server is configured to execute the uploaded file type and the file is accessible, the malicious code within the file will be executed with the privileges of the web server process.

4. **Potential Impacts:**

    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This is the most critical impact. Successful RCE allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to:
        * **Data Breach:** Accessing sensitive customer data, product information, or internal system configurations.
        * **System Takeover:** Gaining full control of the server, allowing the attacker to install malware, create new accounts, or pivot to other systems.
        * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crashing the server or consuming resources to make the application unavailable.
    * **Website Defacement:** Modifying the website's content to display malicious or inappropriate information.
    * **Malware Distribution:** Using the compromised server to host and distribute malware to website visitors.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** If the web server process has elevated privileges, the attacker can leverage this to gain further access within the infrastructure.

**Technical Details and Potential Vulnerabilities in eShopOnWeb:**

While a direct code review of the specific file upload functionality in eShopOnWeb is required for a definitive assessment, we can speculate on potential vulnerabilities based on common practices and potential weaknesses:

* **File Extension Filtering:** The application might rely solely on client-side JavaScript validation or weak server-side filtering based on file extensions. Attackers can easily bypass client-side checks or use techniques like double extensions (e.g., `malicious.php.txt`) to bypass basic server-side checks.
* **MIME Type Validation:**  The application might rely on the `Content-Type` header sent by the browser, which can be easily manipulated by the attacker.
* **Filename Sanitization:**  Insufficient sanitization of the uploaded filename could allow for path traversal attacks. For example, uploading a file named `../../../../evil.php` might overwrite critical system files or place the malicious file in an accessible location.
* **Storage Location and Permissions:** If uploaded files are stored in a publicly accessible directory without proper restrictions, attackers can directly access and execute them. Furthermore, if the web server process has write permissions to the upload directory and the files are stored with execute permissions, this exacerbates the risk.
* **Lack of Content Scanning:** The application might not scan uploaded files for malicious content (e.g., using antivirus or signature-based detection).
* **Insufficient Authentication and Authorization:** While the attack path assumes compromised admin credentials, weaknesses in the authentication or authorization mechanisms could make it easier for attackers to gain access to the upload functionality.

**Detection Methods:**

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Logs:** A WAF can detect attempts to upload files with suspicious extensions or content. Look for patterns indicative of malicious uploads.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Network-based IDS/IPS can identify malicious traffic associated with file uploads and attempts to access uploaded files.
* **Server Logs (Web Server and Application Logs):** Analyze web server access logs for unusual requests to newly created files in upload directories. Application logs might record file upload events and any associated errors.
* **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** FIM tools can detect unauthorized changes to files on the server, including the creation of new, potentially malicious files.
* **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Regular security assessments can identify vulnerabilities in the file upload functionality before they are exploited.
* **Behavioral Analysis:** Monitoring for unusual process execution or network activity originating from the web server process after a file upload can indicate a successful attack.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrator accounts and enforce strong password policies. Regularly review and revoke unnecessary administrative privileges.
* **Strict File Type Validation:** Implement robust server-side validation to allow only explicitly permitted file types. Use a whitelist approach rather than a blacklist.
* **Content-Based Validation:**  Go beyond file extensions and MIME types. Analyze the file content to determine its actual type (e.g., using magic number analysis).
* **Filename Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize uploaded filenames to prevent path traversal and other injection attacks. Rename uploaded files to a safe, predictable format.
* **Secure File Storage:** Store uploaded files outside the webroot or in a directory with restricted access. Configure the web server to prevent direct execution of files in the upload directory (e.g., using `.htaccess` for Apache or request filtering rules for IIS).
* **Randomized Filenames:** Generate unique, unpredictable filenames for uploaded files to make it harder for attackers to guess their location.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Configure CSP headers to restrict the sources from which the application can load resources, mitigating the impact of executing malicious scripts.
* **Input Sanitization and Output Encoding:** Sanitize user-provided input related to file uploads and encode output to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities that could be used in conjunction with file upload attacks.
* **Regular Security Updates:** Keep the operating system, web server, application framework (.NET Core), and all dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* **Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Regularly review the file upload functionality for potential vulnerabilities.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to filter malicious requests and block attempts to upload suspicious files.
* **Antivirus and Malware Scanning:** Integrate antivirus or malware scanning tools to scan uploaded files for malicious content before they are stored on the server.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the web server process runs with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the impact of a successful RCE.

**Specific Considerations for eShopOnWeb:**

* **ASP.NET Core Framework:** Leverage the security features provided by ASP.NET Core, such as input validation attributes, anti-forgery tokens, and content security policy.
* **File Handling Libraries:** Ensure that any third-party libraries used for file handling are up-to-date and free from known vulnerabilities.
* **Admin Panel Implementation:** Carefully review the code responsible for the admin panel and the file upload functionality. Pay close attention to how file uploads are handled, validated, and stored.
* **Docker Containerization:** If eShopOnWeb is deployed using Docker, ensure that the container image is built securely and that file permissions within the container are appropriately configured.

**Defense in Depth:**

It's crucial to implement a defense-in-depth strategy, layering multiple security controls to protect against this attack. Relying on a single mitigation technique is insufficient.

**Conclusion:**

The "Upload Malicious Files via Admin Functionality" attack path poses a significant risk to the eShopOnWeb application. Compromising the administrative panel and exploiting a vulnerable file upload feature can lead to critical consequences, including RCE and data breaches. By understanding the attack vector, implementing robust security controls, and adhering to secure development practices, the development team can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of this type of attack. Regular security assessments and ongoing vigilance are essential to maintain a secure application.
