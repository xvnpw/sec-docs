## Deep Analysis: Compromise Admin Credentials (Specific to eShopOnWeb)

**Context:** This analysis focuses on the attack tree path "Compromise Admin Credentials" within the context of the eShopOnWeb application (https://github.com/dotnet/eshop). This path represents a high-impact threat as successful compromise grants attackers significant control over the application and its data.

**Impact:** As stated in the path description, compromising admin credentials allows for "full control over the eShopOnWeb application, allowing for any malicious action." This includes but is not limited to:

* **Data Breach:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive customer data (personal information, order history, payment details).
* **Financial Loss:** Manipulating pricing, processing fraudulent orders, redirecting payments.
* **Reputational Damage:** Defacing the website, disrupting services, leading to loss of customer trust.
* **System Disruption:** Shutting down the application, deleting critical data, rendering the system unusable.
* **Privilege Escalation:** Potentially using compromised admin access to gain access to underlying infrastructure or connected systems.
* **Malware Deployment:** Injecting malicious code into the application or its dependencies.

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors within this Path:**

To compromise admin credentials in eShopOnWeb, an attacker could employ various techniques targeting different aspects of the application and its environment. Here's a detailed breakdown:

**1. Web Application Vulnerabilities:**

* **SQL Injection (SQLi):**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's database interactions to bypass authentication or retrieve stored credentials. This could involve injecting malicious SQL code into login forms or other input fields.
    * **Specific to eShopOnWeb:**  Examine the data access layer (likely using Entity Framework Core) for potential areas where user-supplied input is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterized queries.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by administrators. This could be used to steal session cookies or redirect the admin to a fake login page to capture credentials.
    * **Specific to eShopOnWeb:** Analyze admin-facing pages for potential XSS vulnerabilities, especially in areas where administrators input or view data.
* **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** Exploiting vulnerabilities where the application exposes internal object references (e.g., user IDs) without proper authorization checks. An attacker might be able to manipulate these references to access or modify admin accounts.
    * **Specific to eShopOnWeb:** Review the application's API endpoints and administrative interfaces for instances where object IDs are used in URLs or parameters without sufficient validation.
* **Authentication/Authorization Flaws:**
    * **Weak Password Policies:** If the application doesn't enforce strong password requirements, attackers can easily guess or brute-force admin passwords.
    * **Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Without MFA, a compromised password is sufficient for access.
    * **Session Hijacking:** Stealing or predicting valid admin session cookies to bypass authentication. This could be achieved through XSS or network sniffing.
    * **Insecure Password Reset Mechanisms:** Exploiting flaws in the password reset process to gain access to admin accounts.
    * **Insufficient Authorization Checks:**  Bypassing authorization controls to access admin functionalities without proper credentials.
    * **Specific to eShopOnWeb:** Examine the implementation of ASP.NET Core Identity for weaknesses in password policies, session management, and authorization rules.

**2. Social Engineering:**

* **Phishing:** Tricking administrators into revealing their credentials through deceptive emails, websites, or messages that mimic legitimate login pages.
    * **Specific to eShopOnWeb:**  Attackers might target administrators with emails that appear to be from the development team, IT department, or other trusted sources, directing them to fake eShopOnWeb login pages.
* **Spear Phishing:**  Targeted phishing attacks focusing on specific individuals within the organization who have administrative access.
* **Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force Attacks:** Using lists of known usernames and passwords or attempting numerous login combinations to guess admin credentials.
    * **Specific to eShopOnWeb:**  Attackers might target the admin login page with automated tools. Rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms are crucial here.

**3. Infrastructure and Deployment Vulnerabilities:**

* **Default Credentials:** If default administrator credentials are not changed during deployment, attackers can easily gain access.
    * **Specific to eShopOnWeb:**  Check for any default credentials used in the initial setup or configuration of the application or related services (e.g., database).
* **Insecure Configuration:** Weak security configurations in the web server, database server, or operating system can expose vulnerabilities that facilitate credential compromise.
    * **Specific to eShopOnWeb:**  Review the configuration of IIS (or Kestrel if self-hosted), the database server (likely SQL Server), and the Azure environment (if deployed on Azure) for security best practices.
* **Exposed Configuration Files:** If configuration files containing sensitive information (like database connection strings with credentials) are accessible, attackers can retrieve them.
    * **Specific to eShopOnWeb:** Ensure that `appsettings.json` and other configuration files are properly secured and not accessible through the web server.
* **Compromised Development or Staging Environments:** If these environments have weaker security measures, attackers might compromise admin credentials there and then use them to access the production environment.
    * **Specific to eShopOnWeb:**  Emphasize the importance of maintaining consistent security practices across all environments.

**4. Supply Chain Attacks:**

* **Compromised Dependencies:** If any third-party libraries or components used by eShopOnWeb are compromised, attackers might inject malicious code that steals admin credentials.
    * **Specific to eShopOnWeb:** Regularly review and update NuGet packages and other dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools.

**5. Insider Threats:**

* **Malicious Insiders:**  Individuals with legitimate access who intentionally misuse their privileges to compromise admin credentials.
* **Negligent Insiders:**  Administrators who inadvertently expose their credentials through poor security practices (e.g., writing down passwords, using weak passwords).

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To effectively mitigate the risk of compromised admin credentials, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce complex password requirements (length, character types, no reuse) and regularly prompt password changes.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA for all administrator accounts. This adds an extra layer of security even if the password is compromised.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks. Use parameterized queries or ORM frameworks correctly.
* **Secure Credential Storage:**  Never store passwords in plain text. Use strong hashing algorithms (like bcrypt or Argon2) with unique salts. Consider using Azure Key Vault for storing sensitive credentials and connection strings.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments, including penetration testing, to identify vulnerabilities in the application and infrastructure.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to administrator accounts. Avoid using the same admin account for all tasks.
* **Secure Session Management:** Implement secure session management practices, including HTTP-only and Secure flags for cookies, and session timeouts.
* **Rate Limiting and Account Lockout:** Implement mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks on the login page.
* **Security Awareness Training:** Educate administrators about phishing attacks, social engineering tactics, and secure password practices.
* **Regular Software Updates:** Keep all software components (frameworks, libraries, operating systems) up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):** Implement IDPS to monitor network traffic and system activity for suspicious behavior.
* **Logging and Monitoring:**  Implement comprehensive logging of authentication attempts and administrative actions. Monitor these logs for anomalies.
* **Secure Development Practices:** Integrate security considerations into the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC).
* **Secure Deployment Practices:** Follow secure deployment guidelines and ensure that default credentials are changed and configurations are hardened.
* **Incident Response Plan:** Have a well-defined incident response plan in place to handle security breaches, including procedures for containing the damage and recovering from a credential compromise.

**Specific Considerations for eShopOnWeb:**

* **Leverage ASP.NET Core Security Features:** Utilize the built-in security features of ASP.NET Core Identity for password hashing, authentication, and authorization.
* **Secure Configuration Management:** Utilize the .NET Configuration system securely. Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files. Consider using Azure Key Vault for secrets management.
* **Review Middleware Configuration:** Ensure that security-related middleware in the ASP.NET Core pipeline is correctly configured (e.g., authentication, authorization, CORS).
* **Analyze Admin Interfaces:** Pay close attention to the security of the administrative interfaces and functionalities within eShopOnWeb.
* **Consider Azure Security Features:** If deployed on Azure, leverage Azure Active Directory for identity management and Azure Security Center for threat detection and security recommendations.

**Conclusion:**

Compromising admin credentials in eShopOnWeb is a critical threat with potentially devastating consequences.
