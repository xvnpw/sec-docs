# Attack Surface Analysis for dotnet/eshop

## Attack Surface: [API Gateway Misconfiguration Leading to Direct Access of Internal APIs](./attack_surfaces/api_gateway_misconfiguration_leading_to_direct_access_of_internal_apis.md)

**Description:** Incorrectly configured API Gateway rules can allow external access to internal microservices (Catalog, Ordering, Basket, Identity) without proper authorization or authentication checks intended by the Web UI's BFF pattern.

**How eShop Contributes:** eShop's microservice architecture relies on an API Gateway to route requests. Misconfiguration here directly exposes the internal APIs.

**Example:** An attacker discovers a route on the API Gateway that directly exposes the "CreateOrder" endpoint of the Ordering API without requiring prior interaction with the Basket API or Web UI's order confirmation flow.

**Impact:** Bypassing intended business logic, potential for data manipulation (creating fraudulent orders), and unauthorized access to sensitive data.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement strict and well-defined routing rules on the API Gateway, ensuring that internal APIs are not directly accessible without proper authentication and authorization checks enforced by the gateway. Use a principle of least privilege for API access. Regularly review and audit API Gateway configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Overly Permissive Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Policies](./attack_surfaces/overly_permissive_cross-origin_resource_sharing__cors__policies.md)

**Description:** Relaxed CORS policies on the backend APIs can allow malicious websites to make unauthorized requests on behalf of a user, potentially leading to data theft or manipulation.

**How eShop Contributes:** eShop's APIs need to interact with the Web UI. If CORS is not configured correctly, it can be exploited.

**Example:** A malicious website embeds JavaScript that makes requests to eShop's Basket API to add items to a logged-in user's basket without their knowledge or consent.

**Impact:** Unauthorized actions on behalf of users, potential for account compromise or data modification.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement restrictive CORS policies, allowing only trusted origins (e.g., the eShop Web UI domain). Avoid using wildcard (`*`) for `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` in production.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/insecure_direct_object_references__idor__in_api_endpoints.md)

**Description:** API endpoints that use predictable or easily guessable IDs to access resources can be exploited to access resources belonging to other users.

**How eShop Contributes:** eShop's APIs likely use IDs to reference entities like baskets, orders, and products. If these IDs are not handled securely, IDOR vulnerabilities can arise.

**Example:** An attacker changes the `basketId` in an API request from their own basket ID to another user's likely ID (e.g., incrementing the number) to view or modify that basket.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive user data (order history, basket contents, personal information).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement proper authorization checks on all API endpoints to ensure users can only access resources they own. Use non-sequential, unpredictable, and preferably UUIDs for resource identifiers.

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities in API Request Handling](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities_in_api_request_handling.md)

**Description:** API endpoints that blindly bind request parameters to internal data models without proper filtering can allow attackers to modify unintended fields, including sensitive ones.

**How eShop Contributes:** eShop's APIs likely handle data updates for various entities. If not carefully implemented, mass assignment can occur.

**Example:** An attacker sends a request to update their profile information, including an unexpected field like `isAdmin: true`, which is then inadvertently applied to their user account.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized modification of user data, potential for complete account takeover.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) or View Models to explicitly define the allowed request parameters for each API endpoint. Avoid directly binding request parameters to database entities. Implement allow-lists for request parameters.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization in API Endpoints Accepting Complex Objects](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization_in_api_endpoints_accepting_complex_objects.md)

**Description:** If API endpoints accept serialized objects (e.g., JSON, XML) without proper validation, attackers can inject malicious payloads that execute arbitrary code upon deserialization.

**How eShop Contributes:** eShop's APIs might use serialization for data exchange. If not secured, this becomes a vulnerability.

**Example:** An attacker sends a crafted JSON payload to an API endpoint that, when deserialized, triggers the execution of malicious code on the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Avoid deserializing untrusted data directly. If necessary, use safe deserialization libraries and techniques. Implement strict input validation before deserialization. Consider using alternative data formats that are less prone to deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Client-Side Libraries (Web UI)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_client-side_libraries__web_ui_.md)

**Description:** The Web UI likely uses JavaScript libraries. Known vulnerabilities in these libraries can be exploited to perform actions like cross-site scripting (XSS).

**How eShop Contributes:** eShop's Web UI, being an ASP.NET Core MVC application, will likely utilize client-side JavaScript libraries for enhanced functionality.

**Example:** A vulnerable version of a JavaScript library used by the eShop Web UI allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into a product description, which is then executed in other users' browsers when they view the product.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, and other malicious actions on behalf of the user.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Regularly update all client-side dependencies to their latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS. Perform static and dynamic analysis of client-side code.
