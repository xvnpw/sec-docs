## Deep Analysis: Authorization Logic Flaws in eShop Microservices

This analysis delves into the threat of "Authorization Logic Flaws in eShop Microservices" within the context of the eShopOnContainers application. We will explore the potential attack vectors, the specific areas within the codebase that are most vulnerable, and provide more detailed recommendations for mitigation.

**Understanding the Threat in the eShop Context:**

The core of this threat lies in the possibility of bypassing intended access controls within the individual microservices that make up the eShop application. Since eShop is built on a microservice architecture, each service is responsible for managing its own data and enforcing its own security policies. If the authorization logic within these services is flawed, attackers can exploit these weaknesses to gain unauthorized access or manipulate data.

**Potential Attack Vectors and Scenarios:**

Let's expand on the provided description with more specific attack scenarios within the eShop ecosystem:

* **Direct API Manipulation:**
    * **Scenario:** An attacker identifies the API endpoint for retrieving order details in the `Services.Ordering` service (e.g., `/api/v1/orders/{orderId}`). They then attempt to access an order belonging to another user by simply changing the `orderId` in the request. If the service only checks if the user is authenticated but not if they *own* the order, the attacker succeeds.
    * **Code Vulnerability:** Missing or insufficient checks in the controller action or business logic to verify if the requesting user's ID matches the `BuyerId` associated with the requested order.
* **Basket Manipulation:**
    * **Scenario:** An attacker discovers the API endpoint for adding items to a basket in the `Services.Basket` service (e.g., `/api/v1/basket/items`). They manipulate the request body to specify a `CustomerId` belonging to another user. If the service only verifies authentication and not the ownership of the basket, the attacker can add items to someone else's cart.
    * **Code Vulnerability:** Lack of validation within the `AddItemToBasket` action or related business logic to ensure the authenticated user matches the `CustomerId` being targeted.
* **Exploiting UI Weaknesses (Indirectly):**
    * **Scenario:** While not directly a flaw in the microservice, a vulnerability in the front-end application could allow an attacker to craft requests that the microservice then processes without proper authorization. For example, a poorly designed UI might allow manipulation of hidden fields that determine the target user or resource.
    * **Code Vulnerability:**  The microservice might trust the data received from the front-end without performing sufficient server-side validation and authorization.
* **Parameter Tampering:**
    * **Scenario:** An attacker intercepts a legitimate request to modify an order and alters parameters like the quantity of an item or the shipping address. If the authorization logic only checks basic authentication and not the integrity of the request parameters in relation to the user's permissions, the attacker can modify the order.
    * **Code Vulnerability:**  Insufficient validation and authorization checks on the parameters being used to perform actions.
* **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference):**
    * **Scenario:**  As mentioned in the description, predictable or easily guessable IDs for resources (like order IDs or basket IDs) can allow attackers to directly access resources belonging to other users by simply iterating through possible IDs.
    * **Code Vulnerability:**  Reliance on sequential or predictable IDs without proper authorization checks based on user ownership.

**Specific Areas in eShopOnContainers Codebase to Focus On:**

Based on the threat description and common microservice architectures, here are key areas within the eShopOnContainers codebase that require careful scrutiny for authorization logic flaws:

* **API Controllers in Microservices:**
    * **`Services/Ordering/Ordering.API/Controllers/OrdersController.cs`:**  Focus on actions like `GetOrder`, `CancelOrder`, `UpdateOrderAddress`. Ensure these actions verify the requesting user's ownership of the order.
    * **`Services/Basket/Basket.API/Controllers/BasketController.cs`:**  Examine actions like `GetBasket`, `UpdateBasket`, `AddItemToBasket`, `RemoveItemFromBasket`. Verify that the authenticated user matches the basket owner.
    * **`Services/Catalog/Catalog.API/Controllers/CatalogController.cs`:** While less directly related to user-specific data, consider if any actions allow unauthorized modification of catalog items based on user roles.
* **Application Services/Business Logic:**
    * **`Services/Ordering/Ordering.Application/Services/OrderAppService.cs`:**  Inspect the logic within methods that handle order retrieval, creation, and modification to ensure authorization checks are in place.
    * **`Services/Basket/Basket.Application/Services/BasketService.cs`:**  Analyze the methods responsible for managing basket items and ensure they enforce ownership.
* **Authorization Handlers and Policies:**
    * Explore if custom authorization handlers or policies are implemented within the microservices. If so, verify their correctness and completeness. Look for files related to authorization configuration or custom attribute usage.
* **Data Access Layer (Potentially):**
    * While less likely, review the data access logic to ensure it doesn't bypass authorization checks performed at higher layers. For example, raw SQL queries might not enforce the same level of authorization as the application logic.
* **API Gateway (Ocelot Configuration):**
    * Examine the Ocelot configuration files (`ocelot.json`) to see if any basic authorization rules are being enforced at the gateway level. While this is a good first line of defense, it shouldn't be the *only* place authorization is handled.

**Detailed Mitigation Strategies for eShopOnContainers:**

Let's expand on the suggested mitigation strategies with specific recommendations for the eShopOnContainers project:

1. **Implement a Consistent and Well-Defined Authorization Framework:**
    * **Leverage ASP.NET Core Authorization Features:** Utilize the built-in `[Authorize]` attribute extensively on controller actions.
    * **Policy-Based Authorization:** Define authorization policies that encapsulate specific business rules (e.g., "MustBeBasketOwner", "CanViewOrder"). This makes authorization logic more readable and maintainable.
    * **Custom Authorization Handlers:** Create custom authorization handlers to implement complex authorization logic that goes beyond simple role checks. For example, a handler to verify if the logged-in user is the owner of the requested order.
    * **Centralized Authorization Service (Consider Future Enhancement):** For larger, more complex applications, consider a dedicated authorization service (like Auth0 or Okta) or implementing a custom one. This centralizes authorization logic and improves consistency across services.

2. **Thoroughly Test Authorization Rules and Edge Cases:**
    * **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests specifically for authorization logic within controllers and application services. Mock dependencies to isolate the authorization checks. Test scenarios for authorized and unauthorized access attempts.
    * **Integration Tests:** Create integration tests that simulate real-world scenarios, involving multiple microservices. Verify that authorization is correctly enforced when requests flow between services.
    * **End-to-End Tests:**  Automated UI tests can help verify authorization from the user's perspective.
    * **Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities that might be missed by automated tests.

3. **Utilize Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):**
    * **Identify Relevant Attributes:** Determine the attributes that are relevant for authorization decisions within eShop. This could include user roles, user ID, resource ID, order status, etc.
    * **Implement ABAC Logic:**  Within custom authorization handlers or policies, implement logic that evaluates these attributes to make authorization decisions. For example, an authorization rule for viewing an order might check if the `UserId` of the logged-in user matches the `BuyerId` of the order.
    * **Consider Libraries:** Explore libraries that can simplify ABAC implementation in .NET Core.

4. **Regularly Review and Audit Authorization Policies and Code:**
    * **Code Reviews:**  Make authorization logic a key focus during code reviews. Ensure that authorization checks are present and correctly implemented for all relevant actions.
    * **Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits specifically focused on authorization. This can involve manual code review and the use of static analysis tools.
    * **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement robust logging to track authorization attempts (both successful and failed). Monitor these logs for suspicious activity.

**Specific Code Examples (Illustrative):**

**Example in `Services/Ordering/Ordering.API/Controllers/OrdersController.cs`:**

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Ordering.API.Controllers
{
    [ApiController]
    [Route("api/v1/[controller]")]
    [Authorize] // Requires authentication
    public class OrdersController : ControllerBase
    {
        // ... other actions

        [HttpGet("{id}")]
        public async Task<IActionResult> GetOrder(int id)
        {
            // **Crucial Authorization Check:**
            var userId = User.FindFirst("sub")?.Value; // Assuming JWT with 'sub' claim for user ID
            var order = await _orderService.GetOrderByIdAsync(id);

            if (order == null)
            {
                return NotFound();
            }

            if (order.BuyerId != userId)
            {
                return Forbid(); // User is authenticated but not authorized
            }

            return Ok(order);
        }

        // ... other actions
    }
}
```

**Example of Policy-Based Authorization (Startup.cs or similar):**

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // ... other service registrations

    services.AddAuthorization(options =>
    {
        options.AddPolicy("MustBeBasketOwner", policy =>
            policy.RequireAuthenticatedUser()
                  .RequireClaim("sub") // Ensure user is authenticated and has a user ID claim
                  .AddRequirements(new BasketOwnerRequirement()));
    });

    services.AddScoped<IAuthorizationHandler, BasketOwnerAuthorizationHandler>();
}
```

**Example of Custom Authorization Handler (`BasketOwnerAuthorizationHandler.cs`):**

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using System.Security.Claims;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class BasketOwnerRequirement : IAuthorizationRequirement { }

public class BasketOwnerAuthorizationHandler : AuthorizationHandler<BasketOwnerRequirement>
{
    private readonly IBasketService _basketService;

    public BasketOwnerAuthorizationHandler(IBasketService basketService)
    {
        _basketService = basketService;
    }

    protected override async Task HandleRequirementAsync(AuthorizationHandlerContext context, BasketOwnerRequirement requirement)
    {
        var userId = context.User.FindFirstValue("sub");
        if (userId == null)
        {
            return; // Not authenticated
        }

        // Assuming the resource being accessed has a 'basketId' route parameter
        if (context.Resource is Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Filters.AuthorizationFilterContext mvcContext &&
            mvcContext.RouteData.Values.TryGetValue("id", out var basketIdObj) &&
            int.TryParse(basketIdObj.ToString(), out var basketId))
        {
            var basket = await _basketService.GetBasketByIdAsync(basketId);
            if (basket != null && basket.BuyerId == userId)
            {
                context.Succeed(requirement);
            }
        }

        return;
    }
}
```

**Conclusion:**

Authorization Logic Flaws represent a significant security risk for the eShopOnContainers application. By understanding the potential attack vectors, focusing on vulnerable areas in the codebase, and implementing robust mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the likelihood of these flaws being exploited. A layered approach, combining authentication, policy-based authorization, thorough testing, and regular security audits, is crucial for building a secure and trustworthy eShop platform.
