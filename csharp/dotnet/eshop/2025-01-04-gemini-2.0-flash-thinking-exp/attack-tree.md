*   **Risk:** This leads to direct financial loss for the application owner as attackers can purchase items at significantly reduced prices. The likelihood is medium if server-side price verification is weak, and the impact is significant.
*   **Attack Vector (Apply Invalid or Excessive Discounts):** An attacker exploits flaws in the discount code logic or validation to apply invalid or excessively large discounts to their orders.
*   **Risk:** This results in financial loss for the application owner. The likelihood is medium depending on the complexity and security of the discount system, and the impact is moderate.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Admin Panel Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_admin_panel_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector (General):**  If the admin panel is exposed or has vulnerabilities, attackers can gain unauthorized access to administrative functionalities.
*   **Risk:** This grants attackers significant control over the application, allowing them to modify data, add malicious users, inject code, or disrupt services. The likelihood depends on the security of the admin panel access controls, and the impact is critical.
*   **Attack Vector (Inject Malicious Code via Admin Input Fields):** An attacker uses admin input fields to inject malicious code (e.g., server-side scripts) due to a lack of input sanitization.
*   **Risk:** This can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server, allowing the attacker to gain complete control. The likelihood is medium if input sanitization is missing, and the impact is critical.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit API Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector (Exploit API Endpoint Security Flaws / Unauthorized Access):** An attacker exploits a lack of proper authentication or authorization on API endpoints to access sensitive data or functionalities without proper credentials.
*   **Risk:** This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized data modification, or disruption of services. The likelihood is medium if API security is not properly implemented, and the impact is significant.
*   **Attack Vector (Data Manipulation via API):** An attacker exploits a lack of input validation on API requests to manipulate data.
*   **Risk:** This can lead to data corruption, financial manipulation, or other malicious actions. The likelihood is medium if input validation is missing, and the impact is moderate.
