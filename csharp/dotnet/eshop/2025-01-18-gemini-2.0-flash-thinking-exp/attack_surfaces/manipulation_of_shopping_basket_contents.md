### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Manipulation of Shopping Basket Contents

This attack surface presents a significant risk due to the direct financial implications and potential for operational disruption. The core vulnerability lies in the lack of robust server-side validation and authorization when handling requests to modify the shopping basket.

**4.1. Vulnerability Breakdown:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:**
    *   **Negative Quantities:** The application likely doesn't prevent users from submitting negative quantities for items. This could lead to incorrect order totals (credits instead of debits) or potentially exploit backend logic if not handled correctly.
    *   **Zero Quantities (with malicious intent):** While seemingly harmless, allowing setting quantities to zero without proper authorization could be used to remove items from other users' baskets if session management is flawed.
    *   **Arbitrary Prices:**  The most critical vulnerability is the potential to manipulate the price of items in the basket. If the application relies solely on client-provided prices or doesn't re-verify prices against the `Catalog` service on the server-side, attackers can set prices to zero or any arbitrary low value.
    *   **Invalid Item IDs:**  The application might not strictly validate if the provided item ID exists in the `Catalog`. This could allow attackers to add non-existent items to the basket, potentially causing errors or exploiting backend processing logic.
    *   **Excessive Quantities:**  While inventory checks are mentioned as a mitigation, the application might not have initial safeguards against adding extremely large quantities that could overwhelm the system or lead to incorrect calculations.
    *   **Malicious Input Encoding:**  The application might be vulnerable to injection attacks if it doesn't properly sanitize or encode data received from the client before processing it (though less likely in simple quantity/price fields, it's a general security principle).

*   **Lack of Server-Side Authorization:**
    *   **Unauthenticated Modification:**  If the basket management endpoints don't require proper authentication, anyone could potentially modify any basket. This is highly unlikely in a typical e-commerce application but worth considering.
    *   **Insufficient Authorization Checks:** Even with authentication, the application might not properly verify if the user making the request is the actual owner of the basket. This could allow attackers to modify other users' baskets if they can guess or obtain their basket identifiers.

*   **Weak Interaction with Catalog Service:**
    *   **Stale Price Data:** If the basket stores price information directly and doesn't always fetch the latest price from the `Catalog` service before order processing, attackers could exploit price fluctuations.
    *   **Missing Availability Checks:**  As highlighted, the lack of real-time checks against the `Catalog` for item availability allows adding out-of-stock items.

**4.2. Attack Vectors and Scenarios:**

*   **Direct API Manipulation:** An attacker could use tools like `curl` or browser developer tools to directly send crafted HTTP requests to the basket management API endpoints (e.g., `POST /basket/items`, `PUT /basket/items/{id}`, `DELETE /basket/items/{id}`). These requests could contain malicious payloads with negative quantities, zero prices, or invalid item IDs.
*   **Intercepting and Modifying Requests:** An attacker could intercept legitimate requests sent from the user's browser to the server and modify the request parameters before they reach the server. This could be achieved through techniques like man-in-the-middle attacks (though less likely without compromising the network).
*   **Automated Scripting:** Attackers could write scripts to automatically add items with manipulated prices or quantities to multiple baskets, potentially exploiting the vulnerability at scale.

**Example Scenarios:**

*   **Scenario 1 (Price Manipulation):** An attacker adds a high-value item to their basket. They then intercept the request to update the item quantity and modify the price parameter to "0.01". If the server doesn't re-validate the price against the `Catalog`, the attacker can purchase the item for a significantly reduced price.
*   **Scenario 2 (Negative Quantity Exploit):** An attacker adds an item and sets the quantity to "-1". If the backend logic isn't robust, this could potentially result in a credit being applied to the attacker's account or lead to errors in inventory management.
*   **Scenario 3 (Out-of-Stock Manipulation):** An attacker adds an item that is currently out of stock. If the application doesn't perform a real-time availability check, the order might be placed, leading to fulfillment issues and customer dissatisfaction.
*   **Scenario 4 (Basket Takeover - if authorization is weak):** An attacker discovers a way to guess or obtain another user's basket identifier. They then send requests to modify that basket, adding or removing items without the legitimate user's knowledge.

**4.3. Impact Assessment:**

The impact of successful exploitation of this attack surface is significant:

*   **Financial Loss:**  The most direct impact is financial loss due to attackers purchasing items at manipulated prices or generating fraudulent orders.
*   **Inventory Discrepancies:** Adding items with negative quantities or adding non-existent items can lead to inaccurate inventory records, making it difficult to manage stock levels effectively.
*   **Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion):**  Attackers could potentially add a large number of items with zero prices, overwhelming the order processing system and potentially leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  If customers discover they are being charged incorrectly or experience issues with their orders due to these manipulations, it can severely damage the business's reputation and customer trust.
*   **Operational Disruption:**  Dealing with fraudulent orders, investigating discrepancies, and correcting inventory issues can consume significant time and resources for the business.

**4.4. Validation of Risk Severity:**

The "High" risk severity assigned to this attack surface is justified due to the potential for significant financial loss and operational disruption. The ease with which these vulnerabilities can be exploited (often requiring only basic knowledge of web requests) further elevates the risk.

### 5. Detailed and Actionable Mitigation Strategies

Building upon the initial mitigation strategies, here's a more detailed breakdown with actionable steps for the development team:

**5.1. Server-Side Input Validation (within eShop's basket management components):**

*   **Quantity Validation:**
    *   **Action:** Implement strict validation to ensure quantities are always positive integers. Reject any requests with negative or non-integer values.
    *   **Implementation:**  Within the API controllers and the `Basket` aggregate logic, add checks using conditional statements or validation libraries to verify the quantity parameter.
*   **Price Validation:**
    *   **Action:** **Never trust client-provided prices.**  Always fetch the current price of the item from the `Catalog` service on the server-side before adding or updating items in the basket. Compare the fetched price with any price potentially sent by the client (for logging or display purposes, but not for calculation).
    *   **Implementation:**  When processing requests to add or update basket items, make a synchronous or asynchronous call to the `Catalog` service using the item ID to retrieve the current price. Use this server-fetched price for all calculations.
*   **Item ID Validation:**
    *   **Action:**  Verify that the provided item ID exists in the `Catalog` service before adding it to the basket.
    *   **Implementation:**  Before adding an item, query the `Catalog` service using the provided item ID. If the item is not found, reject the request.
*   **Quantity Limits:**
    *   **Action:** Implement reasonable limits on the maximum quantity of each item that can be added to the basket. This can help prevent resource exhaustion attacks.
    *   **Implementation:**  Define configuration settings for maximum quantity limits and enforce these limits during basket updates.
*   **Data Type Validation:**
    *   **Action:** Ensure that all input parameters (quantity, item ID) are of the expected data type (e.g., integer).
    *   **Implementation:** Utilize type checking mechanisms provided by the programming language or framework.

**5.2. Authorization Checks (within eShop's basket API):**

*   **Authentication Requirement:**
    *   **Action:** Ensure that all basket management endpoints require proper authentication. Only authenticated users should be able to view or modify their baskets.
    *   **Implementation:**  Utilize the authentication mechanisms provided by ASP.NET Core (e.g., `[Authorize]` attribute) to protect the relevant API endpoints.
*   **Basket Ownership Verification:**
    *   **Action:**  When a request is made to modify a basket, verify that the authenticated user is the owner of that specific basket.
    *   **Implementation:**  Associate the basket with the user's identity (e.g., using the user ID stored in the session or a dedicated basket identifier linked to the user). Before processing any modification request, compare the user's identity with the owner of the target basket.
*   **Session Management Security:**
    *   **Action:**  Ensure secure session management practices are in place to prevent session hijacking or fixation attacks.
    *   **Implementation:**  Use secure session cookies with appropriate flags (HttpOnly, Secure), implement session timeouts, and regenerate session IDs after login.

**5.3. Interaction with Catalog Service:**

*   **Real-time Price Retrieval:**
    *   **Action:** As mentioned before, always fetch the current price from the `Catalog` service before any basket operation involving pricing.
    *   **Implementation:**  Implement a reliable and efficient mechanism for communicating with the `Catalog` service. Consider caching strategies to optimize performance but ensure the cache is invalidated appropriately when prices change.
*   **Availability Checks:**
    *   **Action:**  Check the availability of items in the `Catalog` service before allowing them to be added to the basket.
    *   **Implementation:**  Integrate with the inventory management system (potentially through the `Catalog` service) to get real-time stock levels. Display clear messages to the user if an item is out of stock.

**5.4. Logging and Monitoring:**

*   **Action:** Implement comprehensive logging of all basket modification attempts, including the user, item ID, quantity, price, and the outcome of the operation (success or failure).
    *   **Implementation:**  Use a structured logging framework to record relevant events. Include details about validation failures and unauthorized access attempts.
*   **Action:** Monitor these logs for suspicious activity, such as repeated attempts to add items with invalid prices or quantities.
    *   **Implementation:**  Set up alerts for unusual patterns in the logs that might indicate an attack.

**5.5. Rate Limiting:**

*   **Action:** Implement rate limiting on the basket management endpoints to prevent attackers from making a large number of requests in a short period, which could be indicative of an automated attack.
    *   **Implementation:**  Use middleware or API gateway features to limit the number of requests from a specific IP address or user within a given timeframe.

**5.6. Security Testing:**

*   **Action:** Conduct regular security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, specifically targeting the basket management functionality.
    *   **Implementation:**  Engage security professionals to perform thorough testing and identify potential weaknesses.
