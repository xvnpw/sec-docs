## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Inter-Service Communication Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_inter-service_communication_vulnerabilities.md)

* **CRITICAL NODE: Lack of Mutual TLS/Authentication between Services:**
    * Attackers can eavesdrop on network traffic between services.
    * Attackers can intercept and modify requests and responses.
    * This allows manipulation of data in transit, such as order details or prices.
* **CRITICAL NODE: Weak or Default Service Credentials:**
    * Attackers can gain unauthorized access to service accounts.
    * This allows impersonation of legitimate services.
    * Attackers can then access sensitive data or trigger unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Event Bus Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_event_bus_vulnerabilities.md)

* **CRITICAL NODE: Lack of Authentication/Authorization for Event Publishing:**
    * Attackers can publish malicious events to the event bus.
    * This can trigger unintended actions in subscribing services.
    * Examples include creating fake orders or manipulating inventory levels.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Data Handling and Validation Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_data_handling_and_validation_weaknesses.md)

* **CRITICAL NODE: Vulnerable Deserialization Libraries/Configurations:**
    * Attackers can send malicious serialized data to the application.
    * This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    * This allows for full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Infrastructure and Configuration Vulnerabilities Introduced by eShopOnWeb](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_infrastructure_and_configuration_vulnerabilities_introduced_by_eshoponweb.md)

* **CRITICAL NODE: Misconfigured Environment Variables or Secrets Management:**
    * Attackers can discover sensitive information like database credentials or API keys.
    * This allows direct access to backend systems and external services.
    * This can lead to data breaches and further compromise.
