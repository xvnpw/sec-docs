# Threat Model Analysis for dotnet/eshop

## Threat: [Insecure Inter-Service Communication - Lack of Mutual TLS](./threats/insecure_inter-service_communication_-_lack_of_mutual_tls.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could intercept network traffic between eShopOnWeb microservices. Without mutual TLS, they could potentially impersonate a legitimate service by spoofing its identity or eavesdrop on sensitive data being exchanged between eShop services.
*   **Impact:** Confidential data (e.g., user details, order information) within the eShopOnWeb application could be exposed. A malicious service could inject false data or commands, leading to data corruption or unauthorized actions within the eShop system.
*   **Affected Component:** All backend microservices within the eShopOnWeb application (e.g., Catalog API, Basket API, Ordering API) and the network infrastructure connecting them.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for all inter-service communication within the eShopOnWeb application. Enforce strong certificate validation. Regularly rotate certificates used for inter-service authentication. Consider using a service mesh for managing secure communication between eShop services.

## Threat: [API Gateway Compromise](./threats/api_gateway_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the eShopOnWeb's API Gateway (e.g., through misconfigurations, unpatched software, or exposed management interfaces) to gain control. This could allow them to intercept, modify, or redirect traffic intended for eShopOnWeb backend services.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the eShopOnWeb application's entry point, potentially leading to data breaches affecting eShop users and data, unauthorized access to all backend services of eShop, and denial of service for the entire eShop application.
*   **Affected Component:** The API Gateway component of the eShopOnWeb application.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strong access controls and authentication for the eShopOnWeb API Gateway. Keep the API Gateway software up-to-date with security patches. Regularly review and harden the API Gateway configuration. Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems specifically for the API Gateway.

## Threat: [Data Leakage through Insecure Message Broker](./threats/data_leakage_through_insecure_message_broker.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could eavesdrop on messages being exchanged through the message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ) used by eShopOnWeb if the communication channels are not properly secured (e.g., lack of encryption in transit). This could expose sensitive data related to eShop operations.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data contained within eShopOnWeb messages, such as order details, user actions, or internal system information flowing between eShop services.
*   **Affected Component:** The message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ) used by the eShopOnWeb application and the eShop services communicating through it.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Enable encryption in transit for the message broker used by eShopOnWeb (e.g., using TLS). Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing queues and exchanges within the eShop message broker. Consider encrypting sensitive data within the message payload.

## Threat: [Identity Server Misconfiguration Leading to Authentication Bypass](./threats/identity_server_misconfiguration_leading_to_authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfigurations in the eShopOnWeb's Identity Server (e.g., overly permissive grant types, weak signing keys, insecure client configurations) could allow an attacker to bypass authentication or impersonate legitimate eShop users.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to eShopOnWeb user accounts and application functionalities, potentially leading to data breaches of user information, fraudulent activities within the eShop platform, and manipulation of user data.
*   **Affected Component:** The Identity Server component of the eShopOnWeb application.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Follow security best practices for configuring the eShopOnWeb Identity Server. Regularly review and audit the Identity Server configuration. Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication for eShop users. Securely manage signing keys and secrets used by the Identity Server.

## Threat: [Container Escape due to Vulnerable Base Images](./threats/container_escape_due_to_vulnerable_base_images.md)

*   **Description:** If the Docker images used for deploying the eShopOnWeb microservices are based on images with known vulnerabilities, an attacker who gains access to an eShop container could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities to escape the container and gain access to the underlying host system.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of the host system running eShopOnWeb containers, potentially affecting other containers running on the same host and the underlying infrastructure, leading to broader impact than just the eShop application.
*   **Affected Component:** Docker images used for all microservices within the eShopOnWeb application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Regularly scan container images used for eShopOnWeb for vulnerabilities. Use minimal and trusted base images for eShop containers. Implement a process for patching and updating container images. Employ container security best practices.

## Threat: [Insecure Management of Database Connection Strings](./threats/insecure_management_of_database_connection_strings.md)

*   **Description:** If database connection strings, including credentials, for eShopOnWeb databases are stored insecurely (e.g., in plain text configuration files or environment variables without proper protection), an attacker who gains access to the eShopOnWeb's deployment environment could retrieve these credentials.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the eShopOnWeb's databases, potentially leading to data breaches of customer and product information, data manipulation, and denial of service for the eShop application.
*   **Affected Component:** Configuration management for all eShopOnWeb microservices that connect to databases.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Use secure secrets management solutions (e.g., Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault) to store and manage database credentials for eShopOnWeb. Avoid storing credentials directly in code or configuration files. Implement proper access controls for accessing secrets.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Middleware or Libraries](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_middleware_or_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** Custom middleware or third-party libraries used within the eShopOnWeb application might contain security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers targeting the eShop platform.
*   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to various impacts within the eShopOnWeb application, including remote code execution on eShop servers, data breaches of eShop data, or denial of service for eShop services.
*   **Affected Component:** All microservices within the eShopOnWeb application utilizing the vulnerable middleware or libraries.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, can be High or Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Regularly update all dependencies of the eShopOnWeb application, including custom middleware and third-party libraries. Perform security code reviews and static analysis on custom code developed for eShop. Subscribe to security advisories for libraries used in eShop.
