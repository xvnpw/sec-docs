# Attack Surface Analysis for dotnet/eshop

## Attack Surface: [Manipulation of Shopping Basket Contents](./attack_surfaces/manipulation_of_shopping_basket_contents.md)

*   **Description:**  The application allows manipulation of the shopping basket (adding, removing, modifying quantities) without sufficient server-side validation and authorization.
    *   **How eShop Contributes:** The specific logic within eShop for managing the shopping basket, including how items are added to the `Basket` aggregate, quantities are updated, and prices are retrieved from the `Catalog`. The lack of robust validation in these eShop-specific components creates the vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies the request to add items with negative quantities, change prices to zero (bypassing eShop's pricing logic), or add items that are out of stock without proper checks against eShop's inventory management.
    *   **Impact:** Financial loss for the business due to incorrect order totals, inventory discrepancies because of invalid additions, potential for denial of service by exhausting resources with fraudulent orders.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict server-side validation within eShop's basket management components for all basket operations. Verify item availability against the `Catalog` service, enforce price integrity based on the `Catalog`, and validate quantity limits. Use session management within eShop to securely associate baskets with users and prevent unauthorized modifications. Implement authorization checks within eShop's basket API to ensure only the rightful user can modify their basket.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Access to Admin Interface](./attack_surfaces/insecure_access_to_admin_interface.md)

*   **Description:** The administrative interface (if present and distinct within the eShop application or a related admin project) lacks strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   **How eShop Contributes:** The design and implementation of eShop's administrative features, including user authentication for admin roles and the role-based access control logic that governs access to sensitive eShop functionalities (e.g., product management, order management).
    *   **Example:** Using default credentials configured within eShop's deployment, brute-forcing login attempts against eShop's admin login page, or exploiting vulnerabilities in eShop's custom authentication process to gain unauthorized access to administrative functions.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the eShop application, including the ability to modify product data (prices, descriptions), user accounts, orders, and potentially inject malicious code that affects the storefront.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Enforce strong password policies specifically for eShop admin accounts, implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin logins, use role-based access control within eShop with the principle of least privilege, regularly audit admin user accounts within eShop's identity system, and secure the admin interface behind a separate network or VPN.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Inter-Service Communication (if using microservices within eShop)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_inter-service_communication__if_using_microservices_within_eshop_.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between different backend services that are part of the eShop architecture (e.g., catalog service, ordering service, basket service) lacks proper authentication and encryption.
    *   **How eShop Contributes:** The architectural decision within eShop to use a microservices approach and the specific technologies chosen for inter-service communication within the eShop ecosystem (e.g., HTTP calls between eShop services, gRPC, or message queues). The lack of security measures in these eShop-specific communication channels creates the risk.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts communication between eShop's ordering service and its payment processing service to modify payment details before they reach the external payment gateway, or gains unauthorized access to sensitive order information being passed between eShop services.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches involving sensitive customer or order information, unauthorized access to internal eShop functionalities, manipulation of core eShop business logic, and potential for service disruption within the eShop platform.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for authentication and encryption of inter-service communication within the eShop architecture. Use secure protocols like HTTPS or gRPC with TLS for communication between eShop services. Implement message signing and verification for messages exchanged between eShop services to ensure integrity.

## Attack Surface: [Image Upload Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/image_upload_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The eShop application allows users or administrators to upload images (e.g., product images in the catalog management, user avatars if implemented) without proper validation and sanitization.
    *   **How eShop Contributes:** The specific feature within eShop that allows image uploads, the code responsible for handling these uploads, and how these images are stored and served by eShop.
    *   **Example:** Uploading a malicious file disguised as a product image that, when accessed by a user browsing the eShop catalog, executes code in their browser (cross-site scripting) or potentially on the server if the image processing logic within eShop is vulnerable.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server hosting eShop, cross-site scripting attacks affecting users browsing the eShop storefront, defacement of the eShop website by replacing legitimate images with malicious ones, and potential compromise of the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict validation within eShop's image upload functionality for uploaded file types and sizes. Sanitize filenames before storing them within eShop's storage. Store uploaded files outside the webroot accessible by eShop and serve them through a separate, secure mechanism. Use image processing libraries within eShop to re-encode images and remove potentially malicious metadata. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) within eShop to mitigate XSS.
