**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** AI Software Architect

## 1. Introduction

This document provides an enhanced architectural design of the eShopOnWeb application, an open-source .NET reference application showcasing a simplified eCommerce platform. This design document is specifically created to facilitate subsequent threat modeling activities. It offers a more detailed view of the key components, their interactions, data flows, and security considerations, building upon the previous version.

## 2. Goals

The primary goals of this design document are:

*   Provide a more granular and detailed articulation of the eShopOnWeb application's architecture.
*   Clearly identify the technologies and frameworks used within each major component.
*   Elaborate on the interactions and data flow between components, including authentication and authorization processes.
*   Highlight specific security considerations and potential threat vectors relevant for each component and interaction.
*   Serve as a robust and comprehensive foundation for effective threat modeling sessions.

## 3. Scope

This document covers the core architectural components of the eShopOnWeb application with increased detail, including:

*   The web frontend (ASP.NET Core MVC).
*   The backend API (ASP.NET Core Web API).
*   The data access layer (Entity Framework Core).
*   The identity and authentication mechanisms (likely ASP.NET Core Identity or a similar framework).
*   Key external dependencies and integrations.
*   Specific data elements handled by each component.

This document still does not cover:

*   Highly granular UI/UX design specifics.
*   Detailed implementation specifics within individual classes or methods beyond their architectural role.
*   Precise infrastructure setup or deployment configurations, although a more detailed high-level deployment model is included.

## 4. High-Level Architecture

The eShopOnWeb application maintains a layered architecture. The main layers and their key components are:

*   **Presentation Layer:**
    *   **Component:** ASP.NET Core MVC Web
    *   **Responsibility:** User interface rendering, handling user input, and presenting information.
*   **Application Layer:**
    *   **Component:** ASP.NET Core Web API
    *   **Responsibility:** Business logic execution, orchestration of domain logic, and exposing API endpoints.
*   **Domain Layer:**
    *   **Description:** Contains core business entities and logic (not explicitly a separate deployable component but a logical grouping of code).
*   **Infrastructure Layer:**
    *   **Component:** Entity Framework Core (Data Access)
    *   **Component:** SQL Server Database (Data Persistence)
    *   **Component:** ASP.NET Core Identity (Authentication and Authorization - potentially)
    *   **Component:**  Potentially other services like caching or message queues (if implemented).

Here's an updated high-level diagram illustrating the main components and their relationships:

    participant "Identity Provider" as IDP

    User->>Web: Access Protected Resource
    activate Web
    Web->>IDP: Redirect for Authentication
    activate IDP
    User->>IDP: Provide Credentials
    IDP->>User: Authentication Result & Tokens
    IDP-->>Web: Authentication Response & Tokens
    deactivate IDP
    Web->>Web: Store Authentication Cookie/Tokens
    Web-->>User: Access Granted
    deactivate Web
```

**API Request with Authentication:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
