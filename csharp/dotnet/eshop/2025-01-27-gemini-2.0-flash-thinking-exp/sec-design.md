**Deployment Notes:**

*   Each microservice is deployed as a set of pods within a Kubernetes cluster.
*   Databases (SQL Server, Redis) and message broker (RabbitMQ) are also typically deployed within the cluster or as managed cloud services.
*   A Load Balancer is used to expose the API Gateway and potentially Identity Server to the internet.
*   Persistent Volumes are used for database storage to ensure data persistence across pod restarts.
*   Kubernetes Namespaces are used for logical isolation of the eShopOnContainers application.

This document provides a comprehensive design overview of eShopOnContainers for threat modeling purposes. It should be used as a starting point for deeper security analysis and identification of potential vulnerabilities. Further threat modeling activities should involve detailed analysis of each component, data flow, and technology stack to create a robust security posture for the application. The expanded security considerations section in particular provides a more structured and actionable framework for identifying and mitigating potential threats.
