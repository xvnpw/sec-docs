*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium/High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation Insight:** Implement proper authorization checks in backend services to ensure users can only access resources they are permitted to. Use GUIDs or UUIDs instead of predictable sequential IDs.

*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Low/Medium
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation Insight:** Implement robust coupon validation logic, limit coupon usage, and monitor for suspicious coupon activity.

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploit deserialization vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code by providing malicious serialized objects.
*   **Description:** If backend services use insecure deserialization of data (e.g., for inter-service communication or data storage), an attacker can craft malicious serialized objects. When these objects are deserialized by the application, they can trigger arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Critical
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High
*   **Mitigation Insight:** Avoid deserializing untrusted data. If necessary, use secure serialization libraries and implement input validation.

*   **Attack Vector:** Access API endpoints that expose sensitive information without proper authorization or through verbose error messages.
*   **Description:** Attacker discovers and accesses API endpoints that are not properly secured and inadvertently expose sensitive information such as user data, internal system details, or configuration parameters. Verbose error messages can also leak sensitive information.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low
*   **Mitigation Insight:** Implement proper authorization for all API endpoints. Minimize information leakage in error messages. Regularly review API documentation and endpoints for sensitive data exposure.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1.1: Weak or Default Secrets/Keys [HR] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_1_weak_or_default_secretskeys__hr___critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Weak or default secrets/keys are used for signing tokens or encryption in IdentityServer4.

*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Critical
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate/Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High
*   **Mitigation Insight:** Ensure strong, randomly generated secrets and keys are used for IdentityServer4 and securely managed (e.g., using Azure Key Vault or HashiCorp Vault). Rotate keys regularly.

*   **Attack Vector:** Steal or intercept access tokens or refresh tokens and replay them to gain unauthorized access to resources.
*   **Description:** Attacker steals or intercepts valid access or refresh tokens (e.g., through network sniffing, malware, or phishing). They can then replay these tokens to impersonate legitimate users and gain unauthorized access to protected resources.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low/Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner/Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation Insight:** Implement secure token storage and transmission (HTTPS). Use short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens with proper rotation and revocation mechanisms. Implement token binding if possible.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1: Container Escape (Less likely to be eShop specific, but consider if misconfigurations exist) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_container_escape__less_likely_to_be_eshop_specific__but_consider_if_misconfigurations_exist___cr_f6ab5bd4.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploit vulnerabilities in the container runtime or kernel to escape the container and gain access to the host system.
*   **Description:** Attacker exploits security vulnerabilities in the container runtime environment (e.g., Docker, containerd) or the underlying host kernel to break out of the container's isolation. Successful container escape grants access to the host system and potentially other containers running on the same host.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Critical
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High
*   **Mitigation Insight:** Keep container runtime and kernel up-to-date with security patches. Implement container security best practices (least privilege, resource limits, etc.).

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2: Docker API Exposure (Deployment/Configuration issue, but relevant to eShop deployment) [HR] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_docker_api_exposure__deploymentconfiguration_issue__but_relevant_to_eshop_deployment___hr___crit_fddd20af.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Docker API is exposed without proper authentication.
*   **Description:** If the Docker API is exposed without proper authentication and authorization (e.g., listening on a public network interface without TLS and client certificate authentication), an attacker can gain full control over the Docker daemon. This allows them to manage containers, images, and potentially compromise the host system.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Critical
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner/Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low
*   **Mitigation Insight:** Ensure Docker API is not exposed publicly. If remote access is needed, use secure authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., TLS and client certificates).

*   **Attack Vector:** Secrets are stored in plaintext or easily accessible locations.
*   **Description:** Sensitive information like database passwords, API keys, and encryption keys are not properly secured and are stored in plaintext configuration files, environment variables, or even directly in code. This makes it easy for attackers to access these secrets and use them to compromise backend services and data.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Critical
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

*   **Attack Vector:** Default credentials are used for databases, message queues, or other services.
*   **Description:** Services like databases, message queues, and management consoles are deployed with default usernames and passwords. Attackers can easily find these default credentials and use them to gain unauthorized access to these services, potentially leading to full system compromise.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Critical
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low
*   **Mitigation Insight:** Change default credentials for all services immediately upon deployment. Enforce strong password policies.

*   **Description:** Management interfaces for services like databases (e.g., phpMyAdmin), message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ management UI), or Redis (Redis CLI) are exposed without proper authentication or are accessible from the public internet. This allows attackers to gain administrative access to these services and potentially compromise the entire application.
*   **Likelihood:** Low/Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low
*   **Mitigation Insight:** Secure management interfaces with strong authentication and restrict access to authorized personnel only. Consider disabling or removing unnecessary management interfaces in production.
