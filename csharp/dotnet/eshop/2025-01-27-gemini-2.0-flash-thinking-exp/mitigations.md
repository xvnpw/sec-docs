# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for dotnet/eshop

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Route Configuration Review (Ocelot)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_route_configuration_review__ocelot_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Document all intended API endpoints:** Create a comprehensive list of all API endpoints that should be exposed through the API Gateway (Ocelot) for the eShopOnContainers application. This list should be based on the application's functional requirements.
2.  **Review Ocelot route configurations:**  Carefully examine the `ocelot.json` configuration files (or equivalent configuration mechanism) within the eShopOnContainers project to ensure that each route defined aligns with the documented intended API endpoints.
3.  **Implement a "deny-by-default" approach:**  Start with a minimal set of routes in Ocelot configuration and explicitly add routes as needed for eShopOnContainers. Avoid wildcard routes or overly permissive configurations that could unintentionally expose backend services.
4.  **Regularly audit route configurations:**  Establish a process for periodically reviewing and validating Ocelot route configurations within the eShopOnContainers project to ensure they remain accurate and secure as the application evolves. This should be part of the regular security review process for eShopOnContainers.
5.  **Automate route validation (optional):**  Consider implementing automated scripts or tools within the eShopOnContainers CI/CD pipeline to validate Ocelot route configurations against the documented API endpoint list. This can help catch misconfigurations early in the development lifecycle of eShopOnContainers.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Backend Microservices (High Severity):  Misconfigured Ocelot routes in eShopOnContainers can allow attackers to bypass intended access controls and directly access backend microservices, potentially gaining access to sensitive eShop data or functionality.
*   **Impact:** High - Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to eShopOnContainers backend services by ensuring only intended endpoints are exposed through the API Gateway.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. eShopOnContainers uses `ocelot.json` to define routes, demonstrating a route configuration approach. However, a formal review process and automated validation specific to eShopOnContainers are likely missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Formalized route configuration review process for eShopOnContainers, automated validation of route configurations against intended API specifications for eShopOnContainers, and potentially more granular route definitions to limit exposure in the eShopOnContainers context.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Mutual TLS (mTLS) for Inter-Service Communication within eShopOnContainers](./mitigation_strategies/implement_mutual_tls__mtls__for_inter-service_communication_within_eshoponcontainers.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Generate Certificates for eShopOnContainers Microservices:** Create X.509 certificates for each microservice within the eShopOnContainers application. Each service will need a certificate and a private key. These certificates should be signed by a common Certificate Authority (CA), ideally an internal CA for eShopOnContainers microservices.
2.  **Configure eShopOnContainers Microservices for TLS:** Configure each microservice in eShopOnContainers to use TLS for incoming and outgoing connections. This typically involves configuring the web server (e.g., Kestrel in .NET) within each eShopOnContainers microservice to use the generated certificate and private key.
3.  **Configure eShopOnContainers Microservices for Client Certificate Authentication:** Configure each microservice in eShopOnContainers to require client certificates for incoming connections from other eShopOnContainers microservices. This means the server will verify the client's certificate against the trusted CA.
4.  **Distribute CA Certificate within eShopOnContainers Environment:** Distribute the CA certificate to all eShopOnContainers microservices so they can trust each other's certificates. This can be done through configuration management or a service mesh within the eShopOnContainers deployment.
5.  **Enforce mTLS in API Gateway (Ocelot) for Backend Communication in eShopOnContainers:** Configure Ocelot in eShopOnContainers to also use mTLS when communicating with backend microservices, ensuring end-to-end encrypted and mutually authenticated communication within the eShopOnContainers ecosystem.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Inter-Service Communication within eShopOnContainers (High Severity): Without mTLS, communication between eShopOnContainers microservices could be intercepted and eavesdropped upon or manipulated by an attacker on the network.
    *   Service Impersonation within eShopOnContainers (Medium Severity): Without mutual authentication, a malicious service could potentially impersonate a legitimate eShopOnContainers service and gain unauthorized access to other services or data.
*   **Impact:** High -  Strongly mitigates MITM and service impersonation risks within eShopOnContainers by ensuring encrypted and mutually authenticated communication between its microservices.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely missing. eShopOnContainers demonstrates microservices architecture, but mTLS for inter-service communication is not a standard out-of-the-box feature and requires explicit implementation. Basic TLS (HTTPS) for external access is likely implemented for eShopOnContainers.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Full implementation of mTLS across all eShopOnContainers microservices communication channels, including configuration and certificate management infrastructure within the eShopOnContainers project.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Harden IdentityServer4 Configuration in eShopOnContainers](./mitigation_strategies/harden_identityserver4_configuration_in_eshoponcontainers.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Review Default Configuration in eShopOnContainers IdentityServer4:** Examine the default IdentityServer4 configuration within the eShopOnContainers project. Identify any default settings that are not secure or optimal for production deployments of eShopOnContainers.
2.  **Disable Unnecessary Features in eShopOnContainers IdentityServer4:** Disable any IdentityServer4 features or grant types within the eShopOnContainers configuration that are not required by the application. This reduces the attack surface of the eShopOnContainers authentication system. For example, if implicit grant is not needed, disable it in eShopOnContainers.
3.  **Configure Strong Client Secrets for eShopOnContainers Clients:** Ensure that client secrets for all configured clients in eShopOnContainers IdentityServer4 are strong, randomly generated, and securely stored. Avoid default or weak secrets in the eShopOnContainers configuration.
4.  **Implement Refresh Token Rotation in eShopOnContainers IdentityServer4:** Enable refresh token rotation in eShopOnContainers IdentityServer4 to mitigate the risk of stolen refresh tokens being used indefinitely. This invalidates old refresh tokens after a new one is issued within the eShopOnContainers authentication flow.
5.  **Configure Token Expiration in eShopOnContainers IdentityServer4:** Set appropriate expiration times for access tokens and refresh tokens in eShopOnContainers IdentityServer4. Shorter expiration times reduce the window of opportunity for stolen tokens to be used within the eShopOnContainers context.
6.  **Secure Key Storage for eShopOnContainers IdentityServer4:** Ensure that signing keys used by eShopOnContainers IdentityServer4 are securely stored and protected. Consider using hardware security modules (HSMs) or secure key vaults for key management in production environments of eShopOnContainers.
7.  **Implement Brute-Force Protection for eShopOnContainers IdentityServer4:** Implement mechanisms to protect against brute-force attacks on login endpoints of eShopOnContainers IdentityServer4, such as rate limiting and account lockout policies.
8.  **Regularly Update eShopOnContainers IdentityServer4:** Keep IdentityServer4 and its dependencies within the eShopOnContainers project up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access due to eShopOnContainers IdentityServer4 Vulnerabilities (High Severity): Vulnerabilities in IdentityServer4 itself or its configuration within eShopOnContainers could be exploited to bypass authentication and authorization, leading to unauthorized access to eShopOnContainers resources.
    *   Credential Stuffing and Brute-Force Attacks against eShopOnContainers (Medium Severity): Weak configurations or lack of protection against brute-force attacks can make eShopOnContainers IdentityServer4 vulnerable to credential stuffing and brute-force attacks.
    *   Token Theft and Reuse in eShopOnContainers (Medium Severity):  Insecure token handling or long-lived tokens in eShopOnContainers IdentityServer4 increase the risk of token theft and reuse by attackers.
*   **Impact:** High - Significantly reduces the risk of identity-related attacks against eShopOnContainers by hardening its authentication and authorization system.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. eShopOnContainers integrates IdentityServer4, indicating a security-conscious approach to authentication. However, the level of hardening and specific configurations (like refresh token rotation, HSM usage) within eShopOnContainers would need to be verified and potentially improved.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Potentially missing advanced hardening configurations like refresh token rotation, HSM integration for key storage, explicit brute-force protection mechanisms, and a documented security configuration baseline for IdentityServer4 within the eShopOnContainers project.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Dependency Scanning and Management for eShopOnContainers Microservices](./mitigation_strategies/implement_dependency_scanning_and_management_for_eshoponcontainers_microservices.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Choose a Dependency Scanning Tool for eShopOnContainers:** Select a suitable dependency scanning tool (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, WhiteSource Bolt) that integrates with the eShopOnContainers development workflow and build pipeline.
2.  **Integrate Scanning into eShopOnContainers CI/CD Pipeline:** Integrate the chosen dependency scanning tool into the Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline of eShopOnContainers. This ensures that dependencies are scanned automatically with each build of eShopOnContainers microservices.
3.  **Configure Tool for Vulnerability Reporting for eShopOnContainers:** Configure the dependency scanning tool to generate reports on identified vulnerabilities in eShopOnContainers dependencies, including severity levels and remediation advice.
4.  **Establish Remediation Process for eShopOnContainers Dependencies:** Define a process for reviewing and addressing identified vulnerabilities in eShopOnContainers dependencies. This includes prioritizing vulnerabilities based on severity and impact, and applying patches or updates to vulnerable dependencies within eShopOnContainers.
5.  **Regularly Update eShopOnContainers Dependencies:**  Establish a schedule for regularly updating dependencies of eShopOnContainers microservices to the latest versions, including security patches.
6.  **Monitor for New Vulnerabilities in eShopOnContainers Dependencies:** Continuously monitor for new vulnerabilities in eShopOnContainers dependencies and proactively address them.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries within eShopOnContainers (High Severity): eShopOnContainers microservices rely on numerous third-party libraries and frameworks. Known vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited by attackers to compromise the eShopOnContainers application.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High - Reduces the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities in eShopOnContainers by proactively identifying and managing vulnerable dependencies. The impact depends on the frequency of scanning and the effectiveness of the remediation process within the eShopOnContainers project.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely missing or partially implemented. Dependency scanning is a best practice, but it's not always included in basic project setups. eShopOnContainers might use basic dependency management, but automated scanning and a formal remediation process are likely not in place by default for eShopOnContainers.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Integration of a dependency scanning tool into the eShopOnContainers CI/CD pipeline, automated vulnerability reporting for eShopOnContainers dependencies, and a documented process for dependency vulnerability remediation within the eShopOnContainers project.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Network Policies in Kubernetes for eShopOnContainers Microservice Isolation](./mitigation_strategies/implement_network_policies_in_kubernetes_for_eshoponcontainers_microservice_isolation.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Enable Network Policy Enforcement in eShopOnContainers Kubernetes Cluster:** Ensure that network policy enforcement is enabled in the Kubernetes cluster where eShopOnContainers is deployed. This is often not enabled by default in all Kubernetes distributions.
2.  **Define Network Policies for eShopOnContainers:** Create NetworkPolicy resources in Kubernetes specifically for eShopOnContainers to define granular network access rules between pods and namespaces within the eShopOnContainers deployment.
3.  **Default Deny Policies for eShopOnContainers:** Start with default deny policies for eShopOnContainers that restrict all traffic and then selectively allow necessary traffic based on eShopOnContainers application requirements.
4.  **Namespace-Based Isolation for eShopOnContainers:** Use namespaces in Kubernetes to logically group eShopOnContainers microservices and apply network policies to control traffic between namespaces within the eShopOnContainers deployment.
5.  **Microservice-Specific Policies for eShopOnContainers:** Define network policies that restrict communication between eShopOnContainers microservices to only the necessary ports and protocols. For example, restrict access to database microservices to only application microservices that require database access within eShopOnContainers.
6.  **Regularly Review and Update Policies for eShopOnContainers:**  As eShopOnContainers evolves, regularly review and update network policies to ensure they remain effective and aligned with eShopOnContainers application requirements.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Lateral Movement within eShopOnContainers Kubernetes Cluster (Medium to High Severity): Without network policies, if one eShopOnContainers microservice is compromised, an attacker could potentially move laterally within the Kubernetes cluster to access other eShopOnContainers microservices and resources.
    *   Excessive Network Exposure of eShopOnContainers Microservices (Medium Severity): Without network policies, eShopOnContainers microservices might be unnecessarily exposed to network traffic from other parts of the cluster, increasing the attack surface of eShopOnContainers.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High - Significantly reduces the risk of lateral movement within eShopOnContainers and limits the blast radius of a potential compromise by enforcing network segmentation for eShopOnContainers microservices. The impact depends on the granularity and effectiveness of the implemented policies.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely missing or partially implemented. Network policies are a Kubernetes feature, but they require explicit configuration and are not enabled by default in eShopOnContainers or typical Kubernetes setups.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Definition and deployment of Kubernetes NetworkPolicy resources to enforce microservice isolation for eShopOnContainers and restrict network traffic within the eShopOnContainers Kubernetes deployment.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Message Broker (RabbitMQ) Configuration for eShopOnContainers](./mitigation_strategies/secure_message_broker__rabbitmq__configuration_for_eshoponcontainers.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Secure RabbitMQ Configuration for eShopOnContainers:** Harden RabbitMQ configuration used by eShopOnContainers, including enabling authentication and authorization, limiting access to management interfaces, and disabling unnecessary features.
2.  **Authentication and Authorization for eShopOnContainers Message Queues:** Implement authentication and authorization for access to message queues used by eShopOnContainers to prevent unauthorized publishing or consumption of messages.
3.  **Encryption for eShopOnContainers Message Broker Communication (TLS/SSL):** Enable TLS/SSL encryption for communication between eShopOnContainers microservices and the message broker to protect message confidentiality and integrity.
4.  **Message Signing and Verification for eShopOnContainers (Optional):** Consider implementing message signing and verification for eShopOnContainers messages to ensure message integrity and authenticity.
5.  **Rate Limiting and Queue Management for eShopOnContainers Message Broker:** Implement rate limiting and queue management policies for the eShopOnContainers message broker to protect it from overload and denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Message Interception and Tampering in eShopOnContainers (Medium Severity): Insecure RabbitMQ configuration in eShopOnContainers could allow attackers to intercept or tamper with messages exchanged between microservices.
    *   Unauthorized Access to eShopOnContainers Message Broker (Medium Severity):  Without proper authentication and authorization, unauthorized parties could gain access to the eShopOnContainers message broker and potentially disrupt operations or access sensitive information.
    *   Denial of Service against eShopOnContainers Message Broker (Medium Severity):  Insecure configuration or lack of rate limiting could make the eShopOnContainers message broker vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Impact:** Medium - Reduces the risk of message-related attacks and unauthorized access to the message broker within eShopOnContainers.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely partially implemented. eShopOnContainers uses RabbitMQ, and basic security configurations might be in place. However, advanced hardening measures like comprehensive authentication/authorization policies, TLS/SSL encryption, and message signing are likely missing or need review.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Full hardening of RabbitMQ configuration for eShopOnContainers, implementation of TLS/SSL encryption for message broker communication within eShopOnContainers, and potentially message signing and verification mechanisms for eShopOnContainers messages.
