## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2.1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in APIs [HR] - eShopOnContainers

This document provides a deep analysis of the "1.2.1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in APIs [HR]" attack tree path within the context of the eShopOnContainers application ([https://github.com/dotnet/eshop](https://github.com/dotnet/eshop)). This analysis outlines the objective, scope, methodology, and a detailed breakdown of the attack path, including potential vulnerabilities within eShopOnContainers and mitigation strategies.

### 1. Define Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the potential for Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities within the APIs of the eShopOnContainers application. This includes:

*   Understanding how an attacker could exploit IDOR vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to resources.
*   Identifying specific API endpoints within eShopOnContainers that are susceptible to IDOR.
*   Assessing the potential impact of successful IDOR attacks on the application and its users.
*   Recommending concrete and actionable mitigation strategies tailored to the eShopOnContainers architecture to prevent IDOR vulnerabilities.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the "1.2.1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in APIs [HR]" attack path. The scope includes:

*   **API Endpoints:** Examination of API endpoints within the eShopOnContainers application, particularly those that handle user-specific resources such as orders, basket items, user profiles, and addresses.
*   **Microservices:** Analysis will consider relevant microservices within eShopOnContainers, including but not limited to:
    *   **Ordering Service:**  Handles order creation, retrieval, and management.
    *   **Basket Service:** Manages user shopping baskets.
    *   **Identity Service:**  Manages user authentication and authorization (though IDOR is typically an authorization issue *after* authentication).
    *   **Catalog Service:** While less directly related to user-specific resources, it will be considered if relevant APIs exist.
*   **Code Review (Limited):**  A high-level review of relevant code sections within the identified microservices to understand resource access patterns and authorization mechanisms. A full code audit is outside the scope of this *deep analysis of a specific path*, but key areas will be examined.
*   **Attack Vector Simulation (Conceptual):**  We will conceptually simulate how an attacker might exploit IDOR in the context of eShopOnContainers APIs without performing live penetration testing on a deployed instance (unless explicitly stated and permitted).

**Out of Scope:**

*   Detailed analysis of other attack tree paths.
*   Performance testing or scalability analysis.
*   Deployment and infrastructure security.
*   Comprehensive code audit of the entire eShopOnContainers application.
*   Live penetration testing on a production or staging environment without explicit permission.

### 3. Methodology

The methodology for this deep analysis will involve the following steps:

1.  **Understanding eShopOnContainers Architecture:**  Review the eShopOnContainers documentation and codebase to gain a solid understanding of its microservice architecture, API structure, and technologies used (ASP.NET Core Web APIs, likely using RESTful principles).
2.  **API Endpoint Identification:** Identify key API endpoints within the relevant microservices that are likely to handle user-specific resources and could be susceptible to IDOR. This will involve examining API controllers and route definitions.
3.  **Authorization Mechanism Analysis (High-Level):**  Examine the code related to authorization within the identified API endpoints. Look for how resource access is controlled and if direct object references are used without proper authorization checks.  We will look for patterns like retrieving resources directly by ID from the database without verifying user ownership or permissions.
4.  **Attack Vector Construction (Conceptual):**  Develop conceptual attack vectors demonstrating how an attacker could manipulate API requests to exploit potential IDOR vulnerabilities. This will involve crafting example API requests with modified resource IDs.
5.  **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluate the potential impact of successful IDOR attacks on eShopOnContainers, considering the sensitivity of the resources that could be accessed (e.g., order details, personal information, basket contents).
6.  **Mitigation Strategy Formulation:** Based on the analysis, propose specific and practical mitigation strategies tailored to the eShopOnContainers architecture and technology stack. These strategies will focus on preventing IDOR vulnerabilities and enhancing the application's security posture.
7.  **Documentation and Reporting:**  Document the findings of the analysis, including identified vulnerabilities, potential impact, and recommended mitigation strategies in this markdown document.

**Attack Tree Path:** 1.2.1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in APIs [HR]

*   **Attack Vector:** Manipulate API requests to access resources belonging to other users or entities by guessing or brute-forcing resource IDs.
*   **Description:** Attacker manipulates resource identifiers (e.g., order IDs, user IDs) in API requests to access data or perform actions on resources that they are not authorized to access.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium/High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation Insight:** Implement proper authorization checks in backend services to ensure users can only access resources they are permitted to. Use GUIDs or UUIDs instead of predictable sequential IDs.

**Deep Dive into eShopOnContainers Context:**

**4.1. Potential Vulnerable Areas in eShopOnContainers APIs:**

Based on the eShopOnContainers architecture and common e-commerce functionalities, the following API endpoints are potentially vulnerable to IDOR:

*   **Ordering Service APIs:**
    *   `GET /api/v1/orders/{orderId}`:  Retrieving order details by order ID.  An attacker might try to access orders belonging to other users by manipulating the `orderId` in the request.
    *   `GET /api/v1/orders/userOrders`: While this endpoint likely retrieves orders for the *current* user, if there's another endpoint to retrieve orders by *user ID* (even internally used), it could be vulnerable if user ID is directly exposed or predictable.
*   **Basket Service APIs:**
    *   `GET /api/v1/basket/{basketId}` or `GET /api/v1/basket/{userId}`: Retrieving basket details. If basket IDs or user IDs are predictable or exposed in a way that allows manipulation, IDOR could be possible.
    *   `PUT /api/v1/basket/{basketId}` or `PUT /api/v1/basket/{userId}`: Updating a basket.  An attacker might attempt to modify another user's basket.
*   **Identity Service APIs (Less likely for *direct* IDOR, but consider user profile APIs):**
    *   `GET /api/v1/account/profile/{userId}` or similar: Retrieving user profile information. If user IDs are predictable and not properly authorized, accessing other user profiles could be possible.

**4.2. Attack Vector Breakdown in eShopOnContainers:**

1.  **Authentication:** The attacker first authenticates as a legitimate user in the eShopOnContainers application. This is a prerequisite for accessing protected API endpoints.
2.  **Identify Target API Endpoint:** The attacker identifies an API endpoint that retrieves or manipulates user-specific resources using an identifier in the request (e.g., `orderId`, `basketId`, `userId`). Let's take the example of `GET /api/v1/orders/{orderId}` in the Ordering Service.
3.  **Resource ID Manipulation:**
    *   **Guessing/Brute-forcing:** The attacker attempts to guess or brute-force valid `orderId` values. If order IDs are sequential integers (e.g., 1, 2, 3...), this becomes trivial. Even if they are slightly more complex, predictable patterns might exist.
    *   **Information Leakage:**  The attacker might observe legitimate requests (e.g., their own order IDs) and try to infer or extrapolate other valid IDs.
4.  **Send Malicious Request:** The attacker crafts an API request to the identified endpoint, replacing their *own* resource ID with a *guessed* or *obtained* resource ID belonging to another user. For example, if their own order ID is `123`, they might try `orderId = 124`, `125`, etc.
5.  **Bypass Authorization (Vulnerability):** If the backend API endpoint *fails to properly authorize* the request and only checks if the user is authenticated but not if they are *authorized* to access the specific resource identified by `orderId`, the attacker will successfully retrieve or manipulate the resource.
6.  **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to resources belonging to other users. In the case of `GET /api/v1/orders/{orderId}`, they could view another user's order details, including potentially sensitive information like purchased items, shipping address, billing address, etc.

**4.3. Description in eShopOnContainers Context:**

In the context of eShopOnContainers, a successful IDOR attack could allow an attacker to:

*   **View other users' order history:** Access details of orders placed by other customers, potentially revealing purchased products, quantities, prices, and personal information.
*   **View other users' basket contents:** See what items other users have added to their shopping baskets, potentially gaining insights into their shopping habits or even manipulating their baskets if update endpoints are also vulnerable.
*   **Potentially access user profile information:** If user profile APIs are vulnerable, attackers could access personal details like names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers of other users.

**4.4. Likelihood, Impact, Effort, Skill Level, Detection Difficulty (Reiterated and Contextualized):**

*   **Likelihood: Medium:**  IDOR vulnerabilities are common in web applications, especially in APIs that are rapidly developed or where authorization is not thoroughly implemented. In eShopOnContainers, depending on the implementation of authorization in each microservice API, the likelihood could range from low to high.  A "Medium" assessment is reasonable as a starting point for further investigation.
*   **Impact: Medium/High:** The impact is significant because successful IDOR attacks can lead to the exposure of sensitive user data (personal information, order details, purchase history). This can result in privacy violations, reputational damage, and potentially financial losses for users and the e-commerce platform. The impact is "Medium/High" due to the potential for data breaches and privacy concerns.
*   **Effort: Low:** Exploiting IDOR vulnerabilities typically requires minimal effort. Attackers can use readily available tools like web proxies (e.g., Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP) to intercept and modify API requests. Scripting or automated tools can be used for brute-forcing resource IDs.
*   **Skill Level: Beginner:**  Exploiting basic IDOR vulnerabilities does not require advanced hacking skills.  Understanding HTTP requests and responses and using a web proxy is sufficient for many IDOR attacks.
*   **Detection Difficulty: Medium:**  Detecting IDOR attacks can be challenging through standard security monitoring if the attacks are subtle and blend in with legitimate traffic.  However, monitoring for unusual access patterns, failed authorization attempts (if logged properly), and discrepancies in resource access can aid in detection. "Medium" difficulty reflects that it's not trivial but also not extremely difficult with proper monitoring and logging.

**4.5. Mitigation Insight and Specific Recommendations for eShopOnContainers:**

The provided mitigation insight is: "Implement proper authorization checks in backend services to ensure users can only access resources they are permitted to. Use GUIDs or UUIDs instead of predictable sequential IDs."

**Specific Mitigation Strategies for eShopOnContainers:**

1.  **Implement Robust Authorization Checks in Backend APIs:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that users are only granted access to the resources they absolutely need to perform their intended actions.
    *   **Authorization Logic within API Endpoints:**  Within each API endpoint that handles user-specific resources, implement authorization logic to verify that the currently authenticated user is authorized to access the requested resource. **Do not rely solely on authentication.**
    *   **Resource Ownership Verification:** When retrieving or manipulating resources based on an ID (e.g., `orderId`), always verify that the resource belongs to the currently authenticated user. This can be done by:
        *   Retrieving the resource from the database based on the provided ID.
        *   Checking if the retrieved resource is associated with the current user's ID (e.g., by checking a `UserId` field in the order record against the authenticated user's ID).
    *   **Authorization Libraries/Frameworks:** Leverage ASP.NET Core's built-in authorization features (e.g., Policies, Roles, Claims-based authorization) to implement consistent and maintainable authorization logic across microservices. Consider using attribute-based authorization for declarative checks.

2.  **Use GUIDs/UUIDs for Resource Identifiers:**
    *   **Replace Sequential IDs:**  Replace predictable sequential integer IDs (e.g., auto-incrementing database IDs) with Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) or Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) for resource identifiers exposed in APIs (e.g., `orderId`, `basketId`).
    *   **Reduced Predictability:** GUIDs/UUIDs are virtually impossible to guess or brute-force due to their large size and randomness. This significantly reduces the risk of IDOR by making resource IDs unpredictable.
    *   **Database Considerations:** Ensure that database schema and ORM (like Entity Framework Core likely used in eShopOnContainers) are configured to use GUIDs/UUIDs as primary keys or unique identifiers where appropriate.

3.  **Input Validation and Sanitization (Defense in Depth):**
    *   **Validate Input IDs:**  While GUIDs/UUIDs are less predictable, still validate the format of input IDs to ensure they are valid GUID/UUID strings. This can prevent unexpected errors or potential injection vulnerabilities (though less relevant to IDOR directly).

4.  **Logging and Monitoring:**
    *   **Log Authorization Failures:**  Implement logging to record failed authorization attempts. This can help detect potential IDOR attacks in progress. Monitor logs for unusual patterns of failed authorization requests.
    *   **Audit Logging:** Consider implementing audit logging for sensitive resource access to track who accessed what resources and when.

5.  **Security Testing and Code Reviews:**
    *   **Include IDOR Testing in Security Assessments:**  Specifically test for IDOR vulnerabilities during security testing and penetration testing of eShopOnContainers APIs.
    *   **Code Reviews with Security Focus:**  Conduct code reviews with a focus on authorization logic and potential IDOR vulnerabilities, especially when developing new APIs or modifying existing ones.

**Conclusion:**

Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) poses a significant risk to the eShopOnContainers application. By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, particularly focusing on robust authorization checks and using GUIDs/UUIDs for resource identifiers, the development team can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of IDOR vulnerabilities, enhancing the overall security and trustworthiness of the eShopOnContainers platform.  Further investigation and code review of the specific API endpoints mentioned above are recommended to confirm the presence of vulnerabilities and prioritize mitigation efforts.
