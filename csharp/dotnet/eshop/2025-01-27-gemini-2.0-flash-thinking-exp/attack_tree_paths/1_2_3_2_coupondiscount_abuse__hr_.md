### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2.3.2 Coupon/Discount Abuse [HR]

#### 4.1. Detailed Description of the Attack

The "Coupon/Discount Abuse" attack path targets vulnerabilities in the application's logic for handling coupons and discounts. Attackers aim to manipulate this system to gain unauthorized benefits, such as:

*   **Applying Invalid Coupons:** Using coupon codes that are expired, non-existent, or not intended for the attacker's account or purchase.
*   **Multiple Coupon Application (Stacking):**  Combining multiple coupons when the system is designed to allow only one, or combining coupons in unintended combinations for excessive discounts.
*   **Circumventing Usage Limits:**  Using single-use coupons multiple times by exploiting flaws in session management, user identification, or coupon redemption tracking.
*   **Exploiting Race Conditions:**  Attempting to redeem a limited-quantity coupon multiple times concurrently before the system can update the available quantity.
*   **Bypassing Validation Logic:**  Finding ways to bypass or circumvent the intended validation checks for coupons, such as manipulating request parameters or exploiting input validation vulnerabilities.
*   **Generating Valid Coupons (Less Likely in eShopOnWeb):** In more complex scenarios, attackers might attempt to reverse-engineer coupon generation algorithms if they are predictable or based on weak secrets (less relevant for typical e-commerce platforms like eShopOnWeb, which usually use database-driven coupon management).

#### 4.2. eShopOnWeb Specific Considerations

To analyze this attack path in the context of eShopOnWeb, we need to consider the application's architecture and technologies:

*   **ASP.NET Core MVC:** eShopOnWeb is built using ASP.NET Core MVC. This means coupon logic is likely implemented in controllers, services, and potentially within the Razor views. We need to examine these components for vulnerabilities.
*   **Entity Framework Core (EF Core):**  Coupon data (if persisted) would likely be stored and managed using EF Core and a database (e.g., SQL Server, SQLite). Database schema and EF Core queries related to coupons are relevant.
*   **Session/Cookie Management:**  Session and cookie handling are crucial for managing user carts and potentially tracking coupon usage. Vulnerabilities in session management could be exploited for multiple coupon usage.
*   **Checkout Process:** The checkout process, particularly the steps where coupons are applied and discounts are calculated, is the primary area of interest.
*   **API Endpoints:** If eShopOnWeb exposes APIs for coupon application (e.g., for mobile apps or integrations), these endpoints need to be analyzed for security.

**Initial Assessment based on eShopOnWeb Structure (Without Deep Code Review):**

*   eShopOnWeb is designed as a relatively straightforward e-commerce application. It's likely that coupon functionality, if implemented, would be in the checkout process.
*   Potential areas of concern could be in the validation logic within the controllers or services responsible for applying discounts.
*   Input validation on coupon codes submitted by users is critical.
*   Proper database constraints and transaction management are needed to prevent race conditions in coupon redemption.

#### 4.3. Potential Vulnerabilities in eShopOnWeb

Based on the attack description and eShopOnWeb's technology stack, potential vulnerabilities that could lead to coupon abuse include:

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** Lack of proper validation on coupon codes submitted by users. This could allow attackers to inject malicious input or bypass validation checks.
*   **Logic Flaws in Coupon Validation:** Errors in the code that validates coupon codes, such as:
    *   Incorrectly checking expiration dates.
    *   Failing to enforce usage limits (per user or globally).
    *   Not properly handling case sensitivity or whitespace in coupon codes.
    *   Weak or missing checks for coupon applicability to specific products or categories.
*   **Lack of Atomicity in Coupon Redemption:** If the process of validating and applying a coupon is not atomic (e.g., not within a database transaction), race conditions could occur, allowing multiple redemptions of single-use coupons.
*   **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):**  If coupon codes are predictable or sequentially generated, attackers might try to guess valid coupon codes. (Less likely if coupons are randomly generated).
*   **Client-Side Validation Only:** Relying solely on client-side JavaScript for coupon validation is highly insecure and easily bypassed. Server-side validation is essential.
*   **Missing or Inadequate Error Handling:**  Verbose error messages during coupon application could reveal information to attackers about the validation logic or available coupons.

#### 4.4. Re-evaluation of Attack Attributes (eShopOnWeb Context)

Based on the general nature of eShopOnWeb and common web application vulnerabilities, we can refine the initial attack attributes:

*   **Likelihood:** **Medium to High**. Coupon abuse vulnerabilities are relatively common in e-commerce applications if not properly addressed.  The likelihood depends on the actual implementation in eShopOnWeb. Without code review, we assume a medium likelihood as a starting point, which could increase if vulnerabilities are found.
*   **Impact:** **Low to Medium**. The impact is primarily financial loss due to reduced revenue from discounted sales.  It could also lead to customer dissatisfaction if coupon abuse is widespread and perceived as unfair.  The impact is generally not critical in terms of data breaches or system downtime, hence Low/Medium.
*   **Effort:** **Low**. Exploiting coupon abuse vulnerabilities often requires minimal effort.  Beginner attackers can try common techniques like brute-forcing coupon codes or manipulating request parameters.
*   **Skill Level:** **Beginner to Intermediate**. Basic coupon abuse can be achieved by beginners. More sophisticated attacks, like exploiting race conditions or complex logic flaws, might require intermediate skills.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** **Medium**. Detecting coupon abuse can be challenging without proper monitoring and logging.  Suspicious activity might be masked within normal user behavior.  However, anomalies in discount application or coupon redemption patterns can be detected with appropriate monitoring.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Insights and eShopOnWeb Specific Recommendations

To mitigate the risk of coupon/discount abuse in eShopOnWeb, the following mitigation strategies are recommended:

*   **Robust Server-Side Validation:** Implement comprehensive server-side validation for all coupon codes and discount applications. **This is the most critical mitigation.**
    *   **Validate Coupon Existence:** Ensure the coupon code exists in the database and is active.
    *   **Validate Expiration Dates:** Check if the coupon is still valid based on its start and end dates.
    *   **Enforce Usage Limits:** Track coupon usage and enforce limits (total uses, uses per user). Implement database constraints to ensure limits are not bypassed.
    *   **Validate Applicability:** If coupons are restricted to specific products, categories, or user groups, enforce these restrictions during validation.
    *   **Normalize Coupon Codes:**  Handle case sensitivity and whitespace consistently (e.g., convert all coupon codes to uppercase before validation).
*   **Atomic Coupon Redemption:** Ensure that the entire process of validating, applying, and recording coupon redemption is performed atomically, ideally within a database transaction. This prevents race conditions and ensures consistent state.
    *   **Utilize Database Transactions:** Wrap the coupon redemption logic within a transaction to ensure atomicity.
*   **Secure Coupon Code Generation (If Applicable):** If coupon codes are generated programmatically, use cryptographically secure random number generators to make them unpredictable and prevent guessing. However, for eShopOnWeb, database-driven coupon management is more likely and recommended.
*   **Rate Limiting and CAPTCHA (For Brute-Force Attempts):** Implement rate limiting on coupon application endpoints to prevent brute-force attempts to guess valid coupon codes. Consider using CAPTCHA if necessary to further mitigate automated attacks.
*   **Input Sanitization and Encoding:** Sanitize and encode user inputs (coupon codes) to prevent injection vulnerabilities, although input validation is the primary defense.
*   **Secure Session Management:** Implement secure session management practices to prevent session hijacking and ensure proper user identification for coupon usage tracking.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging of coupon application attempts, including successful and failed attempts, user IDs, coupon codes used, and timestamps. Monitor these logs for suspicious patterns, such as:
    *   High volumes of failed coupon applications.
    *   Multiple redemptions of single-use coupons from the same or different users.
    *   Unusual discount amounts applied.
    *   Alert on anomalies and investigate suspicious activity.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically focusing on coupon and discount functionalities, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively.

**Specific eShopOnWeb Development Team Actions:**
