### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.2.3.1: Price Manipulation during Checkout [HR]

#### 4.1. Attack Vector: Request Parameter Tampering

Request parameter tampering is a common web application attack vector where an attacker manipulates the parameters of HTTP requests (GET or POST) to alter application behavior or access unauthorized data. In the context of e-commerce checkout, this involves intercepting and modifying requests sent from the user's browser or client application to the server during the checkout process.

**How it works:**

1.  **Interception:** An attacker can intercept network traffic between the user's browser and the eShopOnWeb server. This can be achieved through various techniques, including:
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks:**  Attacker positions themselves between the user and the server, intercepting and potentially modifying traffic. This can be easier on insecure networks (e.g., public Wi-Fi) or through techniques like ARP poisoning.
    *   **Browser Developer Tools:**  Modern browsers provide developer tools that allow users to inspect and modify network requests before they are sent to the server. While less sophisticated, this is readily available to even beginner attackers.
    *   **Proxy Tools:**  Tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP allow attackers to intercept, inspect, and modify HTTP requests and responses.

2.  **Parameter Identification:** Once the traffic is intercepted, the attacker identifies request parameters related to price and quantity. These parameters might be in the query string (for GET requests) or in the request body (for POST requests, often in JSON or form-urlencoded format). Common parameter names might include `price`, `quantity`, `itemPrice`, `productPrice`, `qty`, etc.

3.  **Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the identified parameters to their desired values. For example, they might change the `price` parameter of an item to `0.01` or reduce the `quantity` parameter to a very low value and then increase it again to trigger logic errors.

4.  **Request Replay:** The modified request is then replayed to the eShopOnWeb server. If the server-side application does not properly validate these parameters, the attacker's manipulated values might be accepted, leading to price manipulation.

#### 4.2. eShopOnWeb Checkout Flow and Potential Vulnerability Points

Assuming a typical e-commerce checkout flow for eShopOnWeb, potential vulnerability points for request parameter tampering could exist at the following stages:

*   **Adding to Basket:** When a user adds an item to their shopping basket, an API request is likely sent to the server to update the basket. While less directly related to *checkout* price manipulation, vulnerabilities here could lead to adding items with incorrect prices initially.
*   **Viewing Basket:**  When the user views their shopping basket, the frontend likely retrieves basket details from the server via an API. This stage is less vulnerable to *direct* price manipulation but could reveal API endpoints and data structures.
*   **Updating Basket (Quantity Changes):** If users can update quantities in the basket, API requests are sent to reflect these changes. This is a potential point for manipulation if quantity updates are not properly validated server-side, potentially leading to price discrepancies if pricing logic is tied to quantity.
*   **Proceeding to Checkout (Order Summary Generation):**  Before final confirmation, the application typically generates an order summary displaying items, quantities, prices, and totals. This summary is often generated based on data retrieved from the server. **This is a critical vulnerability point.** If the frontend calculates the final price based on data received from the server *without re-validation on the server-side during the final order placement*, an attacker could manipulate parameters in the request that generates this summary or in subsequent requests.
*   **Placing Order (Final Submission):**  The final step involves submitting the order to the server for processing. **This is the most critical vulnerability point.** If the server relies on data received in previous requests without re-validating prices and quantities at this stage, manipulated values can be used to place orders at incorrect prices.

**Specifically for Price Manipulation:** The most likely attack scenario involves manipulating requests during the "Proceeding to Checkout (Order Summary Generation)" or "Placing Order (Final Submission)" stages. An attacker would aim to modify parameters related to item prices or quantities in the API requests sent during these steps.

#### 4.3. Attack Scenario Examples

**Scenario 1: Price Modification during Order Summary Generation**

1.  User adds items to their basket and proceeds to checkout.
2.  The frontend sends an API request to the backend to generate the order summary. This request might include item IDs and quantities.
3.  Attacker intercepts this request using browser developer tools or a proxy.
4.  The attacker identifies parameters related to item prices (e.g., in a JSON response from the server containing item details).
5.  The attacker modifies the price of one or more items in the intercepted request (or the subsequent request to place the order if prices are sent again). For example, changing the price of an expensive item to $0.01.
6.  The attacker replays the modified request.
7.  If the server does not re-validate the prices at this stage and relies on potentially manipulated data, the order summary and subsequent order placement will reflect the attacker's modified prices.

**Scenario 2: Quantity Manipulation leading to Price Exploitation**

1.  User adds items to their basket.
2.  The application might have a vulnerability where pricing logic is incorrectly tied to quantity updates.
3.  Attacker intercepts the API request to update the quantity of an item in the basket.
4.  The attacker manipulates the quantity parameter to a very low value (e.g., 1) and then immediately changes it back to the desired quantity (e.g., 10).
5.  If the server-side logic has a flaw in handling quantity updates and price recalculations, this manipulation could potentially lead to incorrect price calculations, especially if discounts or tiered pricing are involved.

#### 4.4. Risk Assessment Justification

*   **Likelihood: Medium:**  While sophisticated MITM attacks might be less common for typical users, the use of browser developer tools and proxy tools to intercept and modify requests is relatively easy for anyone with basic technical knowledge.  Web application vulnerabilities related to insufficient server-side validation are also common. Therefore, the likelihood of this attack being feasible is considered medium.
*   **Impact: Medium:**  Successful price manipulation can lead to direct financial loss for the e-commerce platform.  If attackers can purchase items at significantly reduced prices or for free, it can impact revenue and potentially damage the platform's reputation. The impact is medium as it's primarily financial and doesn't directly lead to data breaches or system compromise, but repeated exploitation can be significant.
*   **Effort: Low:**  The effort required to perform this attack is relatively low. Beginner attackers can use readily available browser tools or proxy software. No advanced programming or hacking skills are strictly necessary to intercept and modify HTTP requests.
*   **Skill Level: Beginner:**  As mentioned, the skill level required is beginner. Basic understanding of web requests and browser developer tools is sufficient to attempt this attack.
*   **Detection Difficulty: Medium:**  Detecting price manipulation attacks can be moderately difficult if not specifically monitored.  Standard web application firewalls (WAFs) might not always detect parameter tampering if it's within expected data types.  Detecting subtle price discrepancies requires careful monitoring of order values and potentially anomaly detection systems.  However, with proper logging and monitoring of checkout processes and order values, detection is achievable, hence "Medium" difficulty.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate the risk of price manipulation during checkout in eShopOnWeb, the following strategies should be implemented:

1.  **Robust Server-Side Validation (Crucial):**
    *   **Validate Prices and Quantities at Every Stage:**  Do not rely on client-side calculations or data passed from previous requests without thorough server-side validation at each step of the checkout process, especially during order summary generation and final order placement.
    *   **Authoritative Data Source:**  Always fetch the correct price and quantity information directly from the authoritative data source (e.g., the product database) on the server-side during each checkout step. Do not trust data received from the client without re-verification.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate all input parameters related to price and quantity to ensure they are within expected ranges and formats. Reject requests with invalid or suspicious values.

2.  **Implement Digital Signatures or Message Authentication Codes (MACs) for Data Integrity:**
    *   **Protect Critical Data in Transit:**  Use digital signatures or MACs to ensure the integrity of sensitive data transmitted between the server and the client during the checkout process. This can prevent tampering with data in transit.
    *   **Example using MAC:** When generating the order summary on the server, calculate a MAC (e.g., HMAC-SHA256) of critical data like item IDs, quantities, and prices using a secret key known only to the server. Include this MAC in the response sent to the client. When the client submits the order, the server can recalculate the MAC based on the received data and compare it to the MAC received from the client. If they don't match, it indicates data tampering.

3.  **Secure API Endpoints:**
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Ensure all checkout-related API endpoints are properly authenticated and authorized. Only authenticated and authorized users should be able to access and modify checkout data.
    *   **HTTPS Enforcement:**  Enforce HTTPS for all communication to protect data in transit from eavesdropping and MITM attacks.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on checkout API endpoints to prevent automated attacks and brute-force attempts to manipulate prices.

4.  **Input Sanitization and Output Encoding:**
    *   **Sanitize User Inputs:** Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (though less directly related to price manipulation, it's a general security best practice).
    *   **Encode Outputs:** Properly encode outputs to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

5.  **Logging and Monitoring:**
    *   **Comprehensive Logging:** Implement detailed logging of all checkout-related activities, including API requests, user actions, and order details. Log parameters related to price and quantity.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Monitor logs for suspicious patterns, such as unusual price changes, orders with drastically reduced prices, or rapid quantity updates. Set up alerts for anomalies.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the checkout process.

6.  **Consider CAPTCHA or Similar Mechanisms:**
    *   For critical steps like final order placement, consider implementing CAPTCHA or similar mechanisms to prevent automated attacks and ensure human interaction.

**Mitigation Insight Elaboration:** The original mitigation insight correctly points to **server-side validation** and **digital signatures/MACs** as key strategies.  This deep analysis expands on these points and adds further crucial measures like API security, logging, and monitoring to provide a comprehensive mitigation plan for price manipulation during checkout in eShopOnWeb.

By implementing these mitigation strategies, the eShopOnWeb development team can significantly reduce the risk of price manipulation attacks and enhance the security and integrity of the application's checkout process.
