# Threat Model Analysis for dotnet/reactive

## Threat: [Unbounded Stream Consumption Leading to Denial of Service](./threats/unbounded_stream_consumption_leading_to_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could intentionally trigger a source observable to emit a massive number of events without bound. This could overwhelm the application's processing capabilities, consuming excessive CPU, memory, and potentially leading to crashes or unresponsiveness. The attacker might achieve this by manipulating input that feeds directly into a reactive stream or by exploiting a vulnerability in an external system that is the source of the stream consumed by a reactive pipeline.
*   **Impact:** Application becomes slow or unresponsive, potentially leading to service disruption or failure. Resource exhaustion can impact other parts of the system.
*   **Affected Component:** `Observable.Create`, `Subject`, any observable source within `System.Reactive` without proper backpressure or throttling.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement backpressure mechanisms using `System.Reactive.Linq` operators like `Buffer`, `Throttle`, `Debounce`, `Sample`, `Window`, or `Batch`.
    *   Set limits on the number of events processed within a specific time window within the reactive pipeline.
    *   Use appropriate `System.Reactive.Concurrency` schedulers to isolate stream processing and prevent it from blocking the main thread.
    *   Monitor resource usage of reactive streams and implement alerts for excessive consumption.
    *   Validate and sanitize input that feeds directly into `System.Reactive` observable streams to prevent malicious triggers.

## Threat: [Injection of Malicious Data into Observable Streams](./threats/injection_of_malicious_data_into_observable_streams.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious data into a `System.Reactive` observable stream if the source of the stream is not properly secured or validated. This could involve manipulating external data sources that are converted into observables, exploiting vulnerabilities in APIs that feed the stream via reactive bindings, or even compromising components that push data into a `Subject`. The malicious data could then be processed by the application's reactive pipeline, leading to unexpected behavior, data corruption, or even code execution if the data is used in a vulnerable way within a reactive operator or observer.
*   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise within the reactive data flow, application malfunction due to processing unexpected data, potential for remote code execution if the injected data is processed unsafely within a reactive component.
*   **Affected Component:** `Subject`, `BehaviorSubject`, `ReplaySubject`, `Observable.FromEvent`, any `System.Reactive.Linq` operator processing the injected data.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data entering `System.Reactive` observable streams, especially from external or untrusted sources.
    *   Use strong input validation techniques and data type enforcement within the reactive pipeline.
    *   Implement access controls to restrict who can push data into `System.Reactive` subjects.
    *   Consider using immutable data structures within the reactive pipeline to limit the impact of malicious data modification.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege to components consuming the reactive stream.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Observable Streams](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_observable_streams.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data might inadvertently be included in the data emitted by a `System.Reactive` observable stream. If this stream is logged, persisted, or transmitted without proper protection (potentially by a reactive observer or a side-effecting operator), an attacker could gain access to this information. This could happen due to developer error in the reactive pipeline, insufficient data masking within reactive operators, or a lack of awareness about the sensitivity of the data being streamed reactively.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, violation of privacy regulations, reputational damage due to exposure of data handled by the reactive components.
*   **Affected Component:** Any `System.Reactive` observable emitting sensitive data, logging mechanisms triggered by reactive observers, data persistence layers interacting with reactive streams, network transmission components used by reactive observers.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review the data being pushed through `System.Reactive` observables and identify any sensitive information.
    *   Sanitize or encrypt sensitive data before it enters the reactive stream, potentially using custom reactive operators.
    *   Avoid logging sensitive information directly from reactive streams or their observers.
    *   Implement access controls on reactive stream consumers and data storage used by reactive components.
    *   Use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) for transmitting streams if reactive components are involved in network communication.

## Threat: [Malicious or Faulty Observers Causing Side Effects](./threats/malicious_or_faulty_observers_causing_side_effects.md)

*   **Description:** If a `System.Reactive` observer is compromised or contains a bug, it could perform malicious actions or introduce unintended side effects when it receives events from the observable. This could involve writing incorrect data to a database via the observer, triggering external actions through the observer's logic, or causing other parts of the application to malfunction due to the observer's behavior. An attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in the observer's implementation or compromise the system where the observer is running.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption caused by the observer, application malfunction triggered by the observer's actions, potential for unauthorized actions performed by the compromised observer.
*   **Affected Component:** Custom `IObserver<T>` implementations, `Subscribe` method implementations within `System.Reactive`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement proper access controls and authorization for `System.Reactive` observers.
    *   Thoroughly test observer implementations and ensure they handle data correctly and securely within the reactive context.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege to observer components interacting with the reactive stream.
    *   Consider using immutable data structures within the reactive pipeline to limit the impact of faulty observers.
    *   Monitor the behavior of observers for unexpected actions or side effects.
