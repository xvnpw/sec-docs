# Attack Tree Analysis for dotnet/reactive

Objective: Gain unauthorized access or control over the application or its data by exploiting vulnerabilities introduced by the use of Reactive Extensions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Stream Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_stream_manipulation.md)

**CRITICAL NODE** Inject Malicious Data into Stream
    *   **CRITICAL NODE** Exploit Input Validation Weakness in Observable Source:
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies a source of an Observable within the application that lacks proper input validation. They then craft malicious data payloads designed to exploit vulnerabilities in downstream processing logic.
        *   **Example:** An Observable receives user input for a search query. If this input isn't sanitized, an attacker could inject SQL commands or script code that gets executed when the data is processed later in the reactive pipeline.
        *   **Consequences:** Data corruption, unauthorized data access, execution of arbitrary code, application crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Race Conditions in Data Processing](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_race_conditions_in_data_processing.md)

**CRITICAL NODE** Exploit Shared State Access in Observers/Operators:
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Multiple Observers or Operators within the reactive pipeline access and modify shared mutable state without proper synchronization. An attacker can manipulate the timing of events or data flow to create race conditions, leading to unpredictable and potentially exploitable outcomes.
    *   **Example:** Two Observers update a shared counter. Due to a race condition, the counter might be incremented incorrectly, leading to incorrect business logic execution or authorization bypass.
    *   **Consequences:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, authorization bypass, denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion via Unbounded Streams](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion_via_unbounded_streams.md)

**CRITICAL NODE** Create Memory Leaks
    *   **CRITICAL NODE** Fail to Dispose of Subscriptions Properly:
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies Observables that emit data continuously or for extended periods. If subscriptions to these Observables are not properly disposed of when they are no longer needed, the application will accumulate references to these subscriptions and their associated resources, leading to memory leaks.
        *   **Example:** An Observable streams real-time sensor data. If a component subscribes to this stream but doesn't unsubscribe when it's no longer needed, the application's memory usage will steadily increase.
        *   **Consequences:** Application slowdown, increased memory consumption, eventual application crash (Out of Memory error), denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Subject Misuse](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_subject_misuse.md)

**CRITICAL NODE** Allow External Control over Stream Emission:
    *   **Attack Vector:**  The application inadvertently exposes the `OnNext`, `OnError`, or `OnCompleted` methods of a Subject, allowing external entities (potentially malicious actors) to directly control the data flow of the reactive stream.
    *   **Example:** A Subject is used to broadcast events. If its `OnNext` method is exposed through an insecure API endpoint, an attacker could inject arbitrary events into the stream, potentially triggering unintended actions or bypassing security checks.
    *   **Consequences:** Complete control over the data stream, ability to inject malicious data, trigger arbitrary application logic, bypass security controls, denial of service.
