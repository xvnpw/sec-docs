# Attack Surface Analysis for dotnet/reactive

## Attack Surface: [Unbounded Observables and Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/unbounded_observables_and_resource_exhaustion.md)

* **Description:** An observable stream receives an uncontrolled and potentially infinite number of events, leading to excessive resource consumption.
    * **How Reactive Contributes:** Rx facilitates the creation and processing of asynchronous data streams. Without proper management, these streams can become unbounded. Operators like `Buffer` or `Window` without size limits exacerbate this.
    * **Example:** A real-time data feed (e.g., stock prices) is pushed to an observable without any mechanism to limit the rate or buffer size. An attacker could flood the feed, causing the application to run out of memory.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application crash, performance degradation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement backpressure mechanisms (e.g., `Sample`, `Throttle`, `Latest`).
        * Use bounded buffer operators (e.g., `Buffer(count)`, `Window(count)`).
        * Implement timeouts for observable operations.
        * Monitor resource usage and implement alerts for excessive consumption.
        * Limit the rate of incoming events at the source if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Subject Misuse and Data Injection](./attack_surfaces/subject_misuse_and_data_injection.md)

* **Description:**  `Subject` instances, acting as both observable and observer, are exposed in a way that allows external entities to inject malicious data into reactive streams.
    * **How Reactive Contributes:** `Subject` provides a way to manually push values into an observable stream. If not properly controlled, this becomes an injection point.
    * **Example:** A `Subject` is used to broadcast real-time updates to connected clients. If an attacker gains access to the `OnNext` method of this `Subject`, they could inject arbitrary data that is then processed by all clients.
    * **Impact:** Code execution on clients, data corruption, information disclosure, denial of service to other users.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid exposing `Subject` instances for external input unless absolutely necessary.
        * Implement strict validation and sanitization of any data pushed into a `Subject`.
        * Consider using read-only observable interfaces instead of directly exposing `Subject`.
        * Implement authentication and authorization for entities pushing data into `Subject` instances.

## Attack Surface: [Serialization/Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Reactive Streams](./attack_surfaces/serializationdeserialization_vulnerabilities_in_reactive_streams.md)

* **Description:** When observable streams are serialized and deserialized, standard serialization vulnerabilities can be exploited to inject malicious payloads.
    * **How Reactive Contributes:** Rx streams might be serialized for persistence, inter-process communication, or network transfer.
    * **Example:** An application serializes an observable stream containing user-defined objects. An attacker could craft a malicious serialized payload that, upon deserialization, executes arbitrary code.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, data corruption, privilege escalation.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid serializing complex object graphs within observable streams if possible.
        * Use secure serialization formats and libraries that mitigate known vulnerabilities.
        * Implement input validation and sanitization on deserialized data.
        * Consider using immutable data structures in observable streams.

## Attack Surface: [Third-Party Operator Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/third-party_operator_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Custom or third-party Rx operators might contain security vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
    * **How Reactive Contributes:** Rx's extensibility allows for the creation of custom operators, which might not undergo the same level of scrutiny as the core library.
    * **Example:** A third-party operator designed for data transformation has a buffer overflow vulnerability. By sending specific data through the observable pipeline using this operator, an attacker could trigger the overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, data corruption, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly vet and review any custom or third-party Rx operators before using them.
        * Keep third-party operator libraries up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        * Consider the source and reputation of the operator provider.
        * Implement sandboxing or isolation for untrusted operators if possible.
