# Threat Model Analysis for dotnet/reactive

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Leakage via Shared Subject](./threats/sensitive_data_leakage_via_shared_subject.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Leakage via Shared Subject

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a shared `Subject` (e.g., `BehaviorSubject`, `ReplaySubject`) that is inadvertently used across different security contexts or user sessions.  The attacker subscribes to the `Subject` and receives sensitive data intended for other users.  This is a *direct consequence* of how Rx.NET's `Subject` types manage and replay values.
    *   **Impact:** Data Breach.  Confidential information (e.g., user credentials, personal data, financial information) is exposed to unauthorized parties.  This can lead to identity theft, financial loss, or reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Subject<T>`, `BehaviorSubject<T>`, `ReplaySubject<T>`, `AsyncSubject<T>`, or any hot Observable that is shared across security boundaries.  The core issue is the *shared and replayable nature* of these Rx.NET components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Shared Subjects:**  Minimize the use of shared `Subject` instances, especially across security contexts. This is the primary mitigation.
        *   **Per-User Observables:** Create new Observable instances per user or session when dealing with sensitive data.  This avoids the sharing inherent in `Subject` types.
        *   **Access Control:** Implement strict access control mechanisms *before* data enters the Observable stream.  Ensure that only authorized subscribers can receive sensitive data.
        *   **Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data *before* it enters the Observable stream.
        *   **Auditing:** Log all subscriptions and data emissions to shared Observables to detect any unauthorized access.

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection into Observable Pipeline](./threats/malicious_code_injection_into_observable_pipeline.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Code Injection into Observable Pipeline

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability (e.g., a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw, a dependency vulnerability) to inject malicious code into the Observable pipeline.  This could be done by manipulating input data that is used to construct a custom operator or by compromising a third-party library. The *reactive pipeline itself* provides the attack vector.
    *   **Impact:** Code Execution, Data Tampering.  The attacker can execute arbitrary code within the application, potentially gaining full control over the system.  They can also modify the data flowing through the Observable stream, leading to incorrect results or security breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** Custom operators, `Select`, `SelectMany`, `Where`, `Aggregate`, or any operator that takes a lambda expression or a delegate as input.  Third-party Rx.NET extensions are also potential targets. The vulnerability lies in the *ability to inject code into the processing logic* of the Rx pipeline.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all input data that is used to construct or configure Observable operators. This is crucial to prevent injection.
        *   **Dependency Management:**  Carefully vet all dependencies and ensure they are from trusted sources and kept up-to-date.  Use a dependency vulnerability scanner.
        *   **Code Review:**  Conduct thorough code reviews of all custom operators and Rx.NET-related code, paying close attention to security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Least Privilege:**  Run the application with the least privilege necessary.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  If applicable (e.g., in a web application), use CSP to restrict the sources of executable code.

## Threat: [Uncontrolled Observable Emission Flood](./threats/uncontrolled_observable_emission_flood.md)

*   **Threat:** Uncontrolled Observable Emission Flood

    *   **Description:** An attacker, controlling an external data source (e.g., a compromised network connection, a malicious input field), floods an Observable with a high volume of events.  This could be done by rapidly sending data, triggering events, or exploiting a vulnerability in the data source itself. The *asynchronous, event-driven nature* of Rx.NET makes it susceptible to this.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).  The application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory, threads) while processing the flood of events.  Downstream systems relying on the application may also be affected.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any `IObservable<T>` source, particularly those connected to external inputs.  Operators like `FromEvent`, `FromEventPattern`, or custom Observables that wrap external APIs are vulnerable.  Subscribers that perform heavy processing on each event are at higher risk. The *reactive nature* of handling events is the core issue.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Backpressure:** Implement backpressure using operators like `Buffer`, `Sample`, `Throttle`, `Debounce`, or `Window`.  Choose the operator based on the application's needs (e.g., `Throttle` for rate limiting, `Debounce` for ignoring rapid bursts). These are *Rx.NET specific* mitigations.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate all input data *before* it enters the Observable stream.  Reject malformed or excessively large inputs.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting at the source of the Observable, if possible (e.g., at the network layer or API gateway).
        *   **Circuit Breaker:** Use a circuit breaker pattern to temporarily stop processing events from a source that is exhibiting suspicious behavior.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor the event emission rate and trigger alerts if it exceeds a predefined threshold.

## Threat: [Deadlock due to Improper Scheduler Usage](./threats/deadlock_due_to_improper_scheduler_usage.md)

*   **Threat:** Deadlock due to Improper Scheduler Usage

    *   **Description:** An attacker triggers a specific sequence of events that leads to a deadlock within the application due to incorrect use of Schedulers. This might involve manipulating the timing of events or exploiting race conditions in the interaction between different Schedulers. This is a *direct consequence of misusing Rx.NET's concurrency features*.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). The application becomes unresponsive because threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ObserveOn`, `SubscribeOn`, any custom `IScheduler` implementation, and interactions between different Schedulers (e.g., `TaskPoolScheduler`, `DispatcherScheduler`). The problem stems from *incorrect use of Rx.NET's scheduling mechanisms*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Blocking Operations:**  Minimize the use of blocking operations within Observable pipelines, especially when using Schedulers that introduce parallelism.
        *   **Understand Scheduler Semantics:**  Carefully understand the concurrency implications of each Scheduler and use them appropriately. This is key to avoiding Rx.NET-specific deadlocks.
        *   **Avoid Shared Mutable State:**  Minimize the use of shared mutable state between different Observable sequences or subscribers.  If shared state is necessary, use proper synchronization mechanisms (but be very careful to avoid deadlocks).
        *   **Testing:**  Thoroughly test the application under concurrent load to identify and address any potential deadlocks.
        *   **Timeout:** Use timeouts when waiting for resources or events to prevent indefinite blocking.

## Threat: [Cross-Thread UI Access Violation](./threats/cross-thread_ui_access_violation.md)

* **Threat:** Cross-Thread UI Access Violation

    * **Description:** An Observable running on a background thread attempts to directly modify UI elements, which are only accessible from the main UI thread. This can be triggered by an attacker manipulating the timing of events or exploiting a race condition. This is a common issue when using Rx.NET with UI frameworks.
    * **Impact:** Application Crash, UI Unresponsiveness. The application may crash with a cross-thread access exception, or the UI may become unresponsive or exhibit erratic behavior.
    * **Affected Component:** `ObserveOn`, any operator that performs work on a background thread and then attempts to update the UI without using the appropriate dispatcher. The issue is directly related to how Rx.NET handles threading and interacts with UI threads.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **`ObserveOn(DispatcherScheduler)`:** Use `ObserveOn` with the appropriate UI thread Scheduler (e.g., `DispatcherScheduler` in WPF, `SynchronizationContextScheduler` in WinForms) to marshal UI updates back to the UI thread. This is the *Rx.NET specific* solution.
        *   **UI Thread Check:** Before accessing UI elements, check if the current thread is the UI thread and, if not, use the dispatcher to invoke the operation on the UI thread.
        *   **Asynchronous Patterns:** Use asynchronous patterns (e.g., `async`/`await`) to avoid blocking the UI thread while waiting for background operations to complete.
