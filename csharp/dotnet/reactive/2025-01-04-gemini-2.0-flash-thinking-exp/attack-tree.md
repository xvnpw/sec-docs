## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Reactive Stream Manipulation -> Inject Malicious Events into Stream](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_reactive_stream_manipulation_-_inject_malicious_events_into_stream.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Reactive Stream Manipulation -> Inject Malicious Events into Stream**

*   **Compromise Event Source (AND) *** CRITICAL NODE ***:**
    *   **Exploit Vulnerability in Upstream Service/Component:** An attacker gains control of a service or component that feeds data into the reactive stream. This could involve exploiting known vulnerabilities (e.g., authentication bypass, injection flaws) in the upstream system.
    *   **Manipulate Underlying Data Source:** The attacker directly modifies the data source that the reactive stream is observing. This could involve unauthorized database access, tampering with files, or manipulating sensor data.

*   **Intercept and Forge Events (AND):**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Event Communication:** The attacker intercepts communication between components in the reactive system and injects their own crafted events into the stream. This requires compromising the network or communication channels.
    *   **Exploit Weaknesses in Event Handling Logic:** The attacker leverages flaws in how the application processes incoming events to inject malicious data or trigger unintended actions. This could involve exploiting insufficient input validation or insecure deserialization practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Reactive Stream Manipulation -> Modify Existing Events within Stream](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_reactive_stream_manipulation_-_modify_existing_events_within_stream.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Reactive Stream Manipulation -> Modify Existing Events within Stream**

*   **Intercept and Alter Event Data (AND):**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** Similar to the previous path, the attacker intercepts communication and modifies the content of existing events before they reach their intended destination.
    *   **Exploit Shared Mutable State in Stream Processing:** If multiple parts of the reactive stream processing pipeline share mutable state without proper synchronization, an attacker could manipulate this shared state at a specific point, affecting the outcome of subsequent processing steps for other events.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Event Source](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_event_source.md)

**Critical Node: Compromise Event Source**

*   As detailed in the "Inject Malicious Events into Stream" high-risk path, compromising the event source allows the attacker to inject arbitrary and malicious events directly into the reactive stream. This bypasses normal application logic and can lead to a wide range of attacks depending on the nature of the application and the injected events. The impact is potentially very high as the attacker effectively controls the initial input to the reactive system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Shared Mutable State Without Proper Synchronization](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_shared_mutable_state_without_proper_synchronization.md)

**Critical Node: Exploit Shared Mutable State Without Proper Synchronization**

*   This vulnerability arises when multiple asynchronous operations within the reactive stream access and modify shared data without using appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks, mutexes, thread-safe data structures). This can lead to:
    *   **Race Conditions:** The outcome of the operations depends on the unpredictable order in which they execute, potentially leading to incorrect data or application state.
    *   **Data Corruption:** Concurrent modifications can lead to inconsistent or corrupted data.
    *   **Deadlocks:**  Although listed separately in the full tree, improper synchronization is a key factor in causing deadlocks.
    *   An attacker can intentionally trigger these race conditions by manipulating the timing or volume of events in the stream to exploit the lack of synchronization and achieve a desired (malicious) outcome. The detection of these vulnerabilities is often difficult due to their intermittent nature.
