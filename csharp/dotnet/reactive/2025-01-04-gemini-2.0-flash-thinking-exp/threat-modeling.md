# Threat Model Analysis for dotnet/reactive

## Threat: [Race Conditions in Observable Processing](./threats/race_conditions_in_observable_processing.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit the asynchronous nature of reactive streams *provided by Reactive Extensions* to cause unintended side effects by manipulating the order in which operations on shared state are executed. This could involve sending multiple requests in a specific sequence to trigger a vulnerable state *within the reactive pipeline*.

**Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, authorization bypass, or unexpected application behavior leading to security vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** Observables, Observers, Subjects (when used for shared state), potentially custom operators *built using Reactive Extensions primitives*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Employ proper synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks, mutexes) when accessing shared mutable state within observable pipelines.
*   Favor immutable data structures and functional programming paradigms within reactive streams to minimize shared state.
*   Use operators like `Synchronize` or `ObserveOn` with appropriate schedulers *provided by Reactive Extensions* to control the execution context of critical operations.
*   Thoroughly test concurrent scenarios to identify potential race conditions.

## Threat: [Deadlocks in Reactive Streams](./threats/deadlocks_in_reactive_streams.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft input or trigger specific sequences of events that cause circular dependencies or blocking operations within reactive streams *managed by Reactive Extensions*, leading to a deadlock where the application becomes unresponsive.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application hangs, inability to process requests.

**Affected Component:** Observables, Observers, Schedulers *provided by Reactive Extensions*, potentially custom operators involving blocking operations.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully design reactive pipelines to avoid circular dependencies between asynchronous operations.
*   Avoid blocking operations within reactive streams. If unavoidable, execute them on dedicated threads or use asynchronous alternatives.
*   Implement timeouts for operations that might potentially block indefinitely.
*   Monitor application responsiveness and resource usage to detect potential deadlocks.

## Threat: [Malicious Data Injection into Observables](./threats/malicious_data_injection_into_observables.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious or unexpected data into an observable stream *provided by Reactive Extensions* if the source of the observable is compromised or lacks proper input validation. This could be done by manipulating external data sources or intercepting communication channels *before the data enters the reactive pipeline*.

**Impact:** Application crashes, data corruption, execution of arbitrary code (if the data is used in a vulnerable way), or other security breaches depending on how the data is processed *within the reactive stream*.

**Affected Component:** `Observable.Create`, Subjects, event sources feeding observables, any external data source consumed by an observable.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data sources feeding into observables.
*   Use secure communication channels (e.g., HTTPS) to protect data in transit.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege to data sources and ensure only authorized components can push data into observables.
