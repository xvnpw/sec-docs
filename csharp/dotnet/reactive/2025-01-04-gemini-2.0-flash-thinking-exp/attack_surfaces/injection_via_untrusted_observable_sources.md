**Explanation of the Code Example:**

1. **Simulating Untrusted Source:** The `untrusted_data_source` list simulates data coming from an external source that might contain malicious payloads.
2. **Vulnerable Processing:** The `vulnerable_processor` directly processes the data without any checks. In a real application, this could lead to the execution of the injected script.
3. **Mitigation with Sanitization:**
    *   The `sanitize_data` function demonstrates a basic sanitization technique (HTML escaping).
    *   The `ops.map(sanitize_data)` operator applies this sanitization to each item in the stream *before* it reaches the `safe_processor`.
4. **Mitigation with Validation:**
    *   The `is_safe_data` function implements a simple validation rule.
    *   The `ops.filter(is_safe_data)` operator filters out any data that does not pass the validation check.
5. **Mitigation with Type Validation:**
    *   The `validate_expected_type` function checks if the data is a string and contains only alphanumeric characters.
    *   The `ops.map(validate_expected_type)` operator applies this validation.
    *   The `ops.catch` operator handles any `ValueError` exceptions raised during validation, preventing the entire stream from failing and providing a mechanism for error handling.

**Key Takeaways from the Code Example:**

*   **Early Intervention:** The examples emphasize the importance of applying mitigation strategies (sanitization, validation, type checking) as early as possible in the Observable stream.
*   **Rx Operators for Security:** Rx operators like `map`, `filter`, and `catch` are powerful tools for implementing security measures within the reactive pipeline.
*   **Context Matters:** The specific sanitization and validation techniques will depend on the context of the application and the expected data format.
*   **Error Handling:** It's crucial to handle validation errors gracefully to prevent unexpected application behavior.

This deep analysis and the accompanying code example provide a comprehensive understanding of the "Injection via Untrusted Observable Sources" attack surface in Rx applications and offer practical guidance for mitigation. Remember that security is a continuous process, and thorough analysis and implementation of appropriate safeguards are essential to protect your applications.
