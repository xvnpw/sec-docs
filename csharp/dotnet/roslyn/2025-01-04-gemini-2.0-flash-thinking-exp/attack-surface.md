# Attack Surface Analysis for dotnet/roslyn

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection via Scripting APIs](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_via_scripting_apis.md)

*   **Description:**  Untrusted input is used to construct and execute arbitrary code through Roslyn's scripting capabilities.
    *   **How Roslyn Contributes:** Roslyn provides APIs like `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Scripting.CSharpScript` that allow for dynamic execution of C# code.
    *   **Example:** A web application allows users to enter C# code snippets that are then executed using `CSharpScript.RunAsync()`. A malicious user could inject code to access sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Remote code execution, data breach, privilege escalation, complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid exposing Roslyn's scripting APIs to untrusted users if possible.
        *   If scripting is necessary, strictly sanitize and validate all user-provided input before using it in script compilation or execution.
        *   Run scripts in a sandboxed environment with minimal privileges and restricted access to resources.
        *   Carefully define the `ScriptOptions`, limiting access to namespaces, types, and members.
        *   Implement strong input validation and escaping to prevent code injection.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Malicious Code Compilation](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_malicious_code_compilation.md)

*   **Description:**  Providing excessively complex or resource-intensive code to Roslyn for compilation can consume significant CPU and memory, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **How Roslyn Contributes:** Roslyn's compilation process requires resources. Maliciously crafted code can exploit the compiler's resource consumption.
    *   **Example:** A user uploads a very large C# file with deeply nested structures or an extremely long method to an application that uses Roslyn for code analysis. This overwhelms the compiler, making the application unresponsive.
    *   **Impact:** High. Application unavailability, resource exhaustion, impacting other services on the same infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement input size limits for code provided for compilation or analysis.
        *   Set timeouts for compilation processes to prevent indefinite resource consumption.
        *   Use resource monitoring and throttling to limit the resources consumed by Roslyn.
        *   Consider using a separate, isolated environment for compilation tasks.
        *   Implement rate limiting to prevent excessive compilation requests from a single source.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Analyzers and Code Fix Providers](./attack_surfaces/malicious_analyzers_and_code_fix_providers.md)

*   **Description:**  Loading and executing custom Roslyn analyzers or code fix providers from untrusted sources can introduce malicious code execution within the application's process.
    *   **How Roslyn Contributes:** Roslyn's extensibility model allows for custom analyzers and fix providers to be loaded and executed during the compilation process.
    *   **Example:** An application loads an analyzer package from an untrusted NuGet feed. This analyzer contains code that exfiltrates sensitive data or modifies the compilation output in a harmful way.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Remote code execution, data exfiltration, manipulation of compiled code, compromise of the development environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only load analyzers and code fix providers from trusted and verified sources.
        *   Implement a mechanism to verify the integrity and authenticity of analyzer packages (e.g., using signed packages).
        *   Run analyzers in a sandboxed environment with restricted access to resources.
        *   Carefully review the code of any custom analyzers before deploying them.
        *   Implement a process for managing and updating analyzer dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Roslyn Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_roslyn_itself.md)

*   **Description:**  Security vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, memory corruption) within the Roslyn library itself could be exploited.
    *   **How Roslyn Contributes:** The application directly relies on the Roslyn library for compilation and code analysis.
    *   **Example:** A specific version of Roslyn has a known buffer overflow vulnerability that can be triggered by providing a specially crafted code input.
    *   **Impact:** Can range from Medium to Critical depending on the vulnerability. Potential for remote code execution, denial of service, or other unexpected behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (Medium to Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Roslyn NuGet packages updated to the latest stable versions to benefit from security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories related to Roslyn and .NET.
        *   Consider using static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the application's usage of Roslyn.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Roslyn APIs to Untrusted Users](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_roslyn_apis_to_untrusted_users.md)

*   **Description:**  Directly exposing Roslyn's APIs (e.g., through a web service) without proper authorization and input validation allows attackers to interact directly with the compiler.
    *   **How Roslyn Contributes:** Roslyn provides a rich set of APIs for programmatic interaction with the compilation process.
    *   **Example:** A web API allows unauthenticated users to submit arbitrary C# code for compilation using Roslyn.
    *   **Impact:** High to Critical. Code injection, resource abuse, information disclosure, potential for complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid directly exposing Roslyn's APIs to untrusted users.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for any endpoints that utilize Roslyn APIs.
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input provided to Roslyn APIs.
        *   Implement rate limiting and resource quotas to prevent abuse.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Analyzer Configuration](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_analyzer_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**  Some analyzers might rely on deserialization of configuration data. If this deserialization is not handled securely, it could be vulnerable to deserialization attacks.
    *   **How Roslyn Contributes:** The mechanism for configuring analyzers might involve deserializing data from files or other sources.
    *   **Example:** A malicious analyzer configuration file, when deserialized by the application, executes arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Remote code execution, allowing attackers to gain control of the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid deserializing untrusted data.
        *   If deserialization is necessary, use secure deserialization methods and frameworks that prevent arbitrary code execution (e.g., avoid `BinaryFormatter`).
        *   Validate the structure and content of configuration data before deserialization.
