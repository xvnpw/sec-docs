## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Roslyn Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_roslyn_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node signifies a complete breach of the application by leveraging vulnerabilities within the Roslyn compiler platform.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code within Application Context (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH Parent)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_within_application_context__critical_node__high-risk_path_parent_.md)

Achieving arbitrary code execution is a critical turning point. It grants the attacker significant control over the application, allowing them to perform actions such as data exfiltration, further exploitation, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Roslyn Compilation Process (HIGH-RISK PATH Parent)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_roslyn_compilation_process__high-risk_path_parent_.md)

This category of attacks targets the core functionality of Roslyn â€“ the compilation of source code. Successful exploitation here allows the attacker to introduce malicious logic during the compilation phase.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Compiler Input (HIGH-RISK PATH Parent)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_compiler_input__high-risk_path_parent_.md)

This attack vector involves providing malicious input to the Roslyn compiler. The application, in its normal operation, might compile code provided by users or generated from external sources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Malicious C#/VB.NET Code Snippet (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_c#vb_net_code_snippet__high-risk_path_.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a specific code snippet in C# or VB.NET that, when compiled by Roslyn, introduces malicious functionality into the application. This could involve actions like accessing sensitive data, making unauthorized network requests, or modifying application behavior.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium -  Applications that compile user-provided or externally influenced code are susceptible.
            *   **Impact:** High - Successful injection leads to arbitrary code execution within the application's context.
            *   **Effort:** Medium - Requires understanding of C#/VB.NET and potential vulnerabilities in how the application handles compiled code.
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium -  Requires competent development skills and some knowledge of security principles.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (if the malicious code is obfuscated or cleverly disguised) to Medium (if the malicious intent is more straightforward).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Roslyn Scripting/REPL Features (HIGH-RISK PATH Parent)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_roslyn_scriptingrepl_features__high-risk_path_parent_.md)

If the application utilizes Roslyn's scripting or REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) capabilities, this attack vector becomes relevant. Attackers can try to inject malicious code that will be executed by the scripting engine.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Script Input (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_script_input__high-risk_path_.md)

**Description:**  The attacker provides malicious code as input to the Roslyn scripting engine. If the application executes this input without proper sanitization or sandboxing, the malicious code will be executed within the scripting context, potentially compromising the application.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium -  Depends on whether the application exposes scripting functionality to external input.
            *   **Impact:** High -  Successful injection leads to arbitrary code execution within the scripting environment, potentially escalating to full application compromise.
            *   **Effort:** Low to Medium -  May involve simple scripting techniques or more sophisticated methods to bypass security measures.
            *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium -  Basic scripting knowledge is often sufficient, but more complex attacks might require deeper understanding.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium -  Detection depends on the logging and monitoring of script execution and the sophistication of the injected code.
