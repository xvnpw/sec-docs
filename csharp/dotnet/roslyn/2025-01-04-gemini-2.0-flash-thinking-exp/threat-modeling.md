# Threat Model Analysis for dotnet/roslyn

## Threat: [Code Injection via Dynamic Compilation](./threats/code_injection_via_dynamic_compilation.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides malicious code as input to the application. The application uses Roslyn to dynamically compile and execute this code. The attacker can execute arbitrary code within the application's context, potentially gaining access to sensitive data, modifying data, or disrupting operations.

**Impact:** Critical. Full compromise of the application, potential data breach, complete system takeover depending on the application's privileges.

**Affected Roslyn Component:** `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.CSharpCompilation`, `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Emit.EmitResult` (when emitting and executing the compiled code).

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid dynamic compilation of user-provided code if possible.
*   If dynamic compilation is necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent the injection of malicious code constructs.
*   Execute dynamically compiled code in a secure sandbox environment with restricted permissions.
*   Employ code analysis tools to identify potentially dangerous code patterns before compilation.
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to limit who can trigger dynamic compilation.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Compiler Abuse](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_compiler_abuse.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides extremely large, complex, or deliberately crafted code snippets to the application for compilation. Roslyn consumes excessive CPU, memory, or other resources attempting to compile this code, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition for the application.

**Impact:** High. Application unavailability, performance degradation for other users, potential infrastructure overload.

**Affected Roslyn Component:** `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.CSharpCompilation`, the overall compilation process.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement limits on the size and complexity of code that can be submitted for compilation.
*   Set timeouts for compilation operations to prevent indefinite resource consumption.
*   Monitor resource usage during compilation and implement alerting for unusual spikes.
*   Consider using a separate process or container for compilation to isolate resource consumption.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Roslyn Metadata or Compilation Outputs](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_roslyn_metadata_or_compilation_outputs.md)

**Description:** If the application processes serialized Roslyn metadata (e.g., compilation outputs, syntax trees) from untrusted sources, vulnerabilities in the deserialization process could be exploited to execute arbitrary code. This is similar to general deserialization vulnerabilities but specific to Roslyn's data structures.

**Impact:** High. Potential for arbitrary code execution, leading to application compromise.

**Affected Roslyn Component:** Components involved in serializing and deserializing Roslyn objects, such as those within the `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Serialization` namespace or custom serialization logic.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid deserializing Roslyn metadata from untrusted sources.
*   If deserialization is necessary, use secure deserialization techniques and validate the integrity of the data.
*   Keep Roslyn and its dependencies updated to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Bugs or Vulnerabilities within the Roslyn Compiler](./threats/exploitation_of_bugs_or_vulnerabilities_within_the_roslyn_compiler.md)

**Description:** Like any complex software, Roslyn might contain undiscovered bugs or vulnerabilities in its parsing, semantic analysis, or code generation logic. An attacker could craft specific code inputs that trigger these vulnerabilities, potentially leading to crashes, unexpected behavior, or even arbitrary code execution within the Roslyn process.

**Impact:** Medium to Critical. Depending on the nature of the vulnerability, it could lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution.

**Affected Roslyn Component:** Any part of the Roslyn compiler pipeline.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (when leading to arbitrary code execution).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Stay updated with the latest Roslyn releases and security advisories.
*   Participate in bug bounty programs or report potential vulnerabilities to the Roslyn team.
*   Implement robust error handling around Roslyn operations to mitigate the impact of unexpected behavior.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Generated Code or Metadata](./threats/manipulation_of_generated_code_or_metadata.md)

**Description:** If the application relies on the output of Roslyn (e.g., generated assemblies, metadata) without proper verification, an attacker might be able to tamper with this output before it is used by the application. This could involve injecting malicious code into the generated assembly or altering metadata to bypass security checks.

**Impact:** High. Potential for arbitrary code execution, security bypasses, and application compromise.

**Affected Roslyn Component:** `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Emit.EmitResult`, the generated assembly files, and metadata.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement integrity checks and digital signatures for generated assemblies and metadata.
*   Store generated artifacts in secure locations with restricted access.
*   Verify the integrity of loaded assemblies and metadata before execution.
