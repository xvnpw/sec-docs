# Deep Analysis of Roslyn Attack Tree Path: Abuse of Compilation/Scripting Capabilities

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with the "Abuse Roslyn's Compilation/Scripting Capabilities" attack vector and to develop concrete, actionable recommendations for mitigating those risks.  We aim to provide the development team with specific guidance on how to securely integrate Roslyn into their application, minimizing the potential for malicious code execution.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following attack path:

**1. Abuse Roslyn's Compilation/Scripting Capabilities [HIGH RISK]**

We will *not* delve into other potential attack vectors against the application, except where they directly relate to the exploitation of Roslyn.  The scope includes:

*   **Types of Malicious Input:**  Identifying the various forms of malicious input that could be used to exploit Roslyn.
*   **Roslyn API Misuse:**  Analyzing how specific Roslyn APIs could be leveraged for malicious purposes.
*   **Mitigation Techniques:**  Evaluating the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies, including their limitations and implementation considerations.
*   **Concrete Code Examples:** Providing illustrative code snippets (both vulnerable and secure) to demonstrate the concepts.
*   **.NET Security Features:**  Leveraging relevant .NET security features to enhance the robustness of the solution.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow a structured approach:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identify specific threat scenarios related to Roslyn abuse.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Examine the Roslyn API surface for potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors.
3.  **Mitigation Strategy Evaluation:**  Assess the effectiveness and practicality of various mitigation techniques.
4.  **Code Example Development:**  Create code examples to illustrate both vulnerable and secure implementations.
5.  **Documentation and Recommendations:**  Summarize the findings and provide clear, actionable recommendations for the development team.

We will use a combination of static analysis, dynamic analysis (where appropriate and safe), code review, and documentation review to achieve these steps.  We will also leverage existing security best practices for .NET development and sandboxing.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

### 2.1 Threat Modeling: Specific Scenarios

Here are some specific threat scenarios related to abusing Roslyn's compilation/scripting capabilities:

*   **Scenario 1: Remote Code Execution (RCE) via User-Supplied Code:**  An attacker provides C# code as input to the application (e.g., through a web form, API endpoint, or configuration file).  The application uses Roslyn to compile and execute this code *without* proper sanitization or sandboxing.  The attacker's code could then perform arbitrary actions on the server, such as:
    *   Reading/writing files.
    *   Accessing network resources.
    *   Executing system commands.
    *   Installing malware.
    *   Exfiltrating data.

*   **Scenario 2:  Bypassing Security Restrictions via Reflection:** Even with some restrictions in place, an attacker might use reflection within the user-supplied code to access restricted APIs or bypass security checks.  For example, they could:
    *   Use `Assembly.Load` to load arbitrary assemblies.
    *   Use `Type.GetType` to obtain references to restricted types.
    *   Use `MethodInfo.Invoke` to call restricted methods.

*   **Scenario 3:  Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion:** An attacker could submit code designed to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition.  Examples include:
    *   Infinite loops.
    *   Allocating large amounts of memory.
    *   Creating excessive numbers of threads.
    *   Performing computationally expensive operations.

*   **Scenario 4:  Escaping the Sandbox via `#r` or `#load`:** If the application doesn't properly restrict the use of `#r` (reference assembly) or `#load` (load script) directives, an attacker could use these to load arbitrary assemblies or scripts, potentially bypassing the intended sandbox restrictions.

* **Scenario 5: Using `unsafe` code:** If application doesn't restrict usage of `unsafe` code, attacker can use pointers and unmanaged code to bypass .NET security restrictions.

### 2.2 Vulnerability Analysis: Roslyn API Misuse

The core vulnerability lies in the inherent power of Roslyn: it's designed to execute arbitrary code.  The following Roslyn APIs are particularly relevant to this attack vector:

*   **`CSharpCompilation.Create`:**  This is the entry point for creating a compilation.  The attacker controls the source code provided to this API.
*   **`CSharpCompilation.Emit`:**  This method compiles the code into an assembly.
*   **`Assembly.Load` (within the compiled code):**  The attacker could attempt to load arbitrary assemblies.
*   **`Activator.CreateInstance` (within the compiled code):**  The attacker could attempt to create instances of arbitrary types.
*   **Reflection APIs (within the compiled code):**  The attacker could use reflection to bypass restrictions.
*   **`#r` and `#load` directives (within the source code):**  The attacker could use these to load external code.
*   **`unsafe` keyword (within the source code):** The attacker could use this to write unsafe code.

### 2.3 Mitigation Strategy Evaluation

Let's evaluate the mitigation strategies mentioned in the original attack tree, along with some additional techniques:

*   **Least Privilege (Highly Effective):**
    *   **Implementation:** Run the Roslyn-related code in a separate process under a dedicated user account with minimal permissions.  This user account should *not* have access to sensitive files, network resources, or administrative privileges.  Consider using a Windows service account configured with the "Log on as a service" right.  Even better, use a container (e.g., Docker) to isolate the process further.
    *   **Limitations:**  Doesn't prevent all attacks (e.g., DoS), but significantly reduces the impact of successful code execution.  Requires careful configuration.
    *   **Code Example (Conceptual):**
        ```csharp
        // (In a separate, low-privilege process)
        // ... Roslyn compilation and execution code ...
        ```

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Crucial, but Complex):**
    *   **Implementation:**  This is the *most challenging* mitigation to implement correctly.  It's generally *impossible* to perfectly sanitize arbitrary C# code.  *Never* rely solely on blacklisting keywords or patterns.  Instead, focus on:
        *   **Whitelisting (if possible):** If the expected input has a very limited structure, define a strict whitelist of allowed constructs.  This is rarely feasible for general-purpose code execution.
        *   **Parsing and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Analysis:**  Use Roslyn itself to parse the input code into an AST.  Then, *traverse the AST* and check for disallowed constructs (e.g., specific method calls, types, language features).  This is the most robust approach, but it's complex to implement and maintain.
        *   **Rejecting Complex Code:**  Set limits on code length, complexity (e.g., cyclomatic complexity), and the number of allowed statements.
    *   **Limitations:**  Extremely difficult to achieve perfect sanitization.  AST analysis is complex and can be computationally expensive.  There's always a risk of overlooking a bypass.
    *   **Code Example (AST Analysis - Conceptual):**
        ```csharp
        using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis;
        using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp;
        using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Syntax;

        public static bool IsCodeSafe(string code)
        {
            SyntaxTree tree = CSharpSyntaxTree.ParseText(code);
            CompilationUnitSyntax root = tree.GetCompilationUnitRoot();

            // Custom visitor to check for disallowed constructs
            var visitor = new DisallowedConstructsVisitor();
            visitor.Visit(root);

            return !visitor.HasDisallowedConstructs;
        }

        class DisallowedConstructsVisitor : CSharpSyntaxWalker
        {
            public bool HasDisallowedConstructs { get; private set; } = false;

            public override void VisitInvocationExpression(InvocationExpressionSyntax node)
            {
                // Example: Disallow System.IO.File.WriteAllText
                if (node.Expression.ToString().Contains("System.IO.File.WriteAllText"))
                {
                    HasDisallowedConstructs = true;
                    return; // Stop further processing
                }

                base.VisitInvocationExpression(node);
            }
            // Add more Visit methods for other disallowed constructs (e.g., #r, #load, unsafe, reflection)
            public override void VisitUsingDirective(UsingDirectiveSyntax node)
            {
                if (node.Name.ToString() == "System.IO")
                {
                    HasDisallowedConstructs = true;
                    return;
                }
                base.VisitUsingDirective(node);
            }
        }
        ```

*   **API Restriction (Highly Effective):**
    *   **Implementation:**  Use `CSharpCompilationOptions` and `CSharpParseOptions` to control the compilation process.  Specifically:
        *   **`MetadataReferenceResolver`:**  Create a custom resolver that only allows access to a predefined set of trusted assemblies.  *Do not* allow the user to specify arbitrary assembly references.
        *   **`SourceReferenceResolver`:** Create a custom resolver that prevents the use of `#load`.
        *   **`AllowUnsafe`:** Set to `false` to prevent the use of `unsafe` code.
        *   **`OptimizationLevel`:**  Set to `OptimizationLevel.Release` for production code.
        *   **`Platform`:** Specify the target platform (e.g., `Platform.AnyCpu` or `Platform.X64`).
        *   **`CheckOverflow`:** Set to `true` to enable arithmetic overflow checking.
        *   **`OutputKind`:** Set to `OutputKind.DynamicallyLinkedLibrary` to prevent the creation of executable files.
        *   **`Usings`:** Use to pre-import a limited set of namespaces.
    *   **Limitations:**  Doesn't prevent all forms of malicious code (e.g., resource exhaustion), but significantly limits the attacker's capabilities.
    *   **Code Example:**
        ```csharp
        using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis;
        using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp;
        using System.Collections.Immutable;

        // ...

        var trustedAssemblies = new List<MetadataReference>()
        {
            MetadataReference.CreateFromFile(typeof(object).Assembly.Location), // mscorlib
            MetadataReference.CreateFromFile(typeof(System.Linq.Enumerable).Assembly.Location), // System.Core
            // Add other *essential* and *trusted* assemblies here
        };

        var parseOptions = new CSharpParseOptions(
            languageVersion: LanguageVersion.Latest,
            kind: SourceCodeKind.Script, // Or SourceCodeKind.Regular, depending on your needs
            preprocessorSymbols: null
        ).WithFeatures(new[] { new KeyValuePair<string, string>("IO", "false") }); // Disable custom features if needed

        var compilationOptions = new CSharpCompilationOptions(
            outputKind: OutputKind.DynamicallyLinkedLibrary,
            optimizationLevel: OptimizationLevel.Release,
            allowUnsafe: false,
            platform: Platform.AnyCpu,
            checkOverflow: true,
            assemblyIdentityComparer: DesktopAssemblyIdentityComparer.Default
        ).WithMetadataReferenceResolver(new CustomMetadataReferenceResolver(trustedAssemblies))
         .WithSourceReferenceResolver(new CustomSourceReferenceResolver())
         .WithUsings("System", "System.Linq", "System.Collections.Generic"); // Pre-import allowed namespaces

        // Create the compilation
        var compilation = CSharpCompilation.Create(
            "MyDynamicAssembly",
            syntaxTrees: new[] { CSharpSyntaxTree.ParseText(userCode, parseOptions) },
            references: trustedAssemblies,
            options: compilationOptions
        );

        // ... (Emit and execute the assembly) ...

        // Custom MetadataReferenceResolver
        public class CustomMetadataReferenceResolver : MetadataReferenceResolver
        {
            private readonly ImmutableArray<MetadataReference> _trustedAssemblies;

            public CustomMetadataReferenceResolver(IEnumerable<MetadataReference> trustedAssemblies)
            {
                _trustedAssemblies = trustedAssemblies.ToImmutableArray();
            }

            public override ImmutableArray<PortableExecutableReference> ResolveReference(string reference, string baseFilePath, MetadataReferenceProperties properties)
            {
                // Only allow references to trusted assemblies
                foreach (var trustedAssembly in _trustedAssemblies)
                {
                    if (trustedAssembly.Display == reference)
                    {
                        return ImmutableArray.Create((PortableExecutableReference)trustedAssembly);
                    }
                }
                return ImmutableArray<PortableExecutableReference>.Empty; // Or throw an exception
            }
            public override bool Equals(object other) => other is CustomMetadataReferenceResolver;
            public override int GetHashCode() => 0;
        }
        // Custom SourceReferenceResolver to prevent #load
        public class CustomSourceReferenceResolver : SourceReferenceResolver
        {
            public override string NormalizePath(string path, string baseFilePath)
            {
                return null; // Prevent any path resolution
            }

            public override string ResolveReference(string path, string baseFilePath)
            {
                return null; // Prevent any reference resolution
            }

            public override Stream OpenRead(string resolvedPath)
            {
                return null; // Prevent opening any files
            }
            public override bool Equals(object other) => other is CustomSourceReferenceResolver;
            public override int GetHashCode() => 0;
        }
        ```

*   **Code Review (Essential):**  Thorough code review is crucial for identifying any potential vulnerabilities in the code that interacts with Roslyn.  Pay close attention to:
    *   Input handling.
    *   Error handling.
    *   The use of `CSharpCompilationOptions` and `CSharpParseOptions`.
    *   Any custom security logic.

*   **Sandboxing (AppDomains - Legacy, but useful):**
    *   **Implementation:**  Create a separate `AppDomain` with restricted permissions to execute the compiled code.  Use `PermissionSet` to define the allowed permissions (e.g., `SecurityPermissionFlag.Execution`).  This is a .NET Framework feature and is less commonly used in .NET Core/.NET, where containers are preferred.
    *   **Limitations:**  AppDomains are considered a legacy technology and have some limitations.  They are not fully supported in .NET Core/.NET.  They can be complex to configure correctly.  They don't provide the same level of isolation as a separate process or container.
    *   **Code Example (Conceptual):**
        ```csharp
        // (In the main application)
        // Create a PermissionSet with restricted permissions
        PermissionSet permSet = new PermissionSet(PermissionState.None);
        permSet.AddPermission(new SecurityPermission(SecurityPermissionFlag.Execution));
        // ... (Add other necessary permissions, but keep them minimal) ...

        // Create an AppDomainSetup
        AppDomainSetup setup = new AppDomainSetup();
        setup.ApplicationBase = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory;

        // Create the AppDomain
        AppDomain newDomain = AppDomain.CreateDomain("SandboxDomain", null, setup, permSet);

        // ... (Load and execute the compiled assembly in the newDomain) ...
        ```
*  **Sandboxing (Containers - Recommended):**
    * **Implementation:** Use containerization technologies like Docker to create isolated environments for executing the compiled code. This provides the strongest level of isolation.
    * **Limitations:** Requires setting up and managing containers.
    * **Code Example (Conceptual):** This would involve creating a Dockerfile to build a container image with the necessary .NET runtime and minimal dependencies, and then running the Roslyn compilation and execution code within that container.

* **Timeouts and Resource Limits (DoS Mitigation):**
    * **Implementation:** Set timeouts for the compilation and execution processes.  Limit the amount of memory and CPU time that the compiled code can consume.  This can be achieved using `CancellationToken` and by monitoring resource usage.
    * **Limitations:**  Doesn't prevent all DoS attacks, but can mitigate their impact.  Requires careful tuning of the limits.
    * **Code Example (Timeout - Conceptual):**
        ```csharp
        using System.Threading;
        using System.Threading.Tasks;

        // ...

        var cts = new CancellationTokenSource(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5)); // 5-second timeout

        try
        {
            // Execute the compilation/execution within a Task
            await Task.Run(() =>
            {
                // ... Roslyn compilation and execution code ...
            }, cts.Token);
        }
        catch (OperationCanceledException)
        {
            // Handle timeout
            Console.WriteLine("Compilation/execution timed out.");
        }
        ```

### 2.4 Summary and Recommendations

The "Abuse Roslyn's Compilation/Scripting Capabilities" attack vector is a **high-risk** threat that requires a multi-layered defense strategy.  Here are the key recommendations:

1.  **Prioritize Least Privilege:** Run the Roslyn-related code in a separate process with the absolute minimum necessary privileges.  Containers (e.g., Docker) are strongly recommended for isolation.
2.  **Implement Strict API Restrictions:** Use `CSharpCompilationOptions` and `CSharpParseOptions` to disable unsafe code, restrict assembly references, and prevent the use of `#r` and `#load`.  Use custom resolvers to enforce these restrictions.
3.  **Perform AST Analysis:**  Use Roslyn's own parsing capabilities to analyze the input code's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and reject any disallowed constructs.  This is the most robust approach to input validation, but it's complex to implement.
4.  **Enforce Timeouts and Resource Limits:**  Set timeouts for compilation and execution, and limit the resources (memory, CPU) that the compiled code can consume.
5.  **Conduct Thorough Code Reviews:**  Regularly review the code that interacts with Roslyn, paying close attention to input handling and security logic.
6.  **Avoid AppDomains if possible:** If using .NET Core/.NET, prefer containers over AppDomains for sandboxing. If using .NET Framework, carefully configure AppDomains with minimal permissions.
7.  **Monitor and Log:** Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to detect any suspicious activity related to Roslyn usage.
8. **Regularly update Roslyn:** Keep Roslyn NuGet packages updated to the latest versions to benefit from security patches.

By implementing these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of malicious code execution via Roslyn and build a more secure application.  It's crucial to understand that no single mitigation is foolproof, and a layered approach is essential for robust security.
```

This detailed analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the attack vector, its potential consequences, and the most effective mitigation strategies. The code examples illustrate how to implement these strategies in practice. The recommendations are prioritized based on their effectiveness and practicality. This document should serve as a valuable resource for the development team to build a secure application that leverages the power of Roslyn responsibly.
