# Project Design Document: Roslyn (.NET Compiler Platform)

## BUSINESS POSTURE

*   Priorities and Goals:
    *   Provide a robust, performant, and extensible compiler platform for C# and Visual Basic .NET.
    *   Enable developers to build rich code analysis tools, refactorings, and diagnostics.
    *   Support the evolution of the C# and VB.NET languages.
    *   Offer a modern, open-source compiler infrastructure.
    *   Maintain backward compatibility where feasible, while allowing for language innovation.
    *   Provide high-fidelity parsing and semantic analysis.
    *   Enable cross-platform development.

*   Business Risks:
    *   Security vulnerabilities in the compiler itself could lead to the generation of insecure code or compromise build environments.
    *   Performance regressions in the compiler could significantly impact developer productivity.
    *   Inability to keep pace with the evolving .NET ecosystem and language features.
    *   Lack of adoption by the developer community due to complexity or usability issues.
    *   Compatibility issues with existing codebases or tools.
    *   Inadequate support for new platforms or architectures.

## SECURITY POSTURE

*   Existing Security Controls:
    *   security control: Code signing of official builds (described in release documentation and build scripts).
    *   security control: Regular security reviews and penetration testing (implied by Microsoft's security practices).
    *   security control: Use of static analysis tools during development (evident in build configurations and CI pipelines).
    *   security control: Fuzz testing to identify potential vulnerabilities (mentioned in documentation and issue discussions).
    *   security control: Secure development lifecycle (SDL) practices followed by Microsoft (publicly documented).
    *   security control: Input validation within the compiler to prevent injection attacks (inherent in compiler design).
    *   security control: Handling of untrusted input (e.g., source code) in a secure manner (fundamental to compiler operation).
    *   security control: Strong name signing of assemblies.

*   Accepted Risks:
    *   accepted risk: Reliance on the security of the underlying .NET runtime and operating system.
    *   accepted risk: Potential for denial-of-service attacks against the compiler (e.g., through extremely large or complex input files). This is mitigated but not entirely eliminated.
    *   accepted risk: The possibility of undiscovered vulnerabilities, despite rigorous testing.

*   Recommended Security Controls:
    *   security control: Implement a comprehensive Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for all compiler components and dependencies.
    *   security control: Integrate dynamic analysis (e.g., runtime instrumentation) to detect vulnerabilities during testing.
    *   security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process.
    *   security control: Regularly audit and update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.

*   Security Requirements:

    *   Authentication: Not directly applicable to the compiler itself, but relevant to build and deployment environments. Build servers and package repositories should use strong authentication mechanisms.
    *   Authorization: Not directly applicable to the compiler itself. Access control to build servers and source code repositories should be enforced.
    *   Input Validation: The compiler must rigorously validate all input, including source code, configuration files, and command-line arguments. This is crucial to prevent injection attacks and ensure the integrity of the compilation process.
    *   Cryptography: The compiler should use strong cryptographic algorithms for code signing and other security-sensitive operations.  It should adhere to current best practices for key management and algorithm selection.

    9.  The build script packages the build artifacts (NuGet packages).
    10. The packager publishes the packages to an artifact repository (NuGet.org, Azure Artifacts).
    11. SAST scanner and test framework reports are sent to CI build server.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

*   Critical Business Processes:
    *   Compiling C# and VB.NET code accurately and efficiently.
    *   Providing a reliable and extensible platform for code analysis.
    *   Supporting the development and evolution of the .NET ecosystem.

*   Data:
    *   Source Code (Sensitivity: Varies - from public open-source to highly confidential proprietary code). The compiler processes source code, but does not store it persistently. The primary concern is ensuring that the compiler does not introduce vulnerabilities into the compiled code.
    *   Intermediate Language (IL) Code (Sensitivity: Lower than source code, but still represents the application's logic). The compiler generates IL code, which is then executed by the .NET runtime.
    *   Metadata (Sensitivity: Lower than source code, but can reveal information about the application's structure). The compiler generates metadata, which describes the types and members in the compiled code.
    *   PDB Files (Sensitivity: Contains debugging information, including source code paths and line numbers. Should be protected to prevent reverse engineering). The compiler generates PDB files to enable debugging.
    *   Build Artifacts (Sensitivity: Varies depending on the application). The compiler produces build artifacts, which are then deployed and executed.
    *   Compiler Configuration Files (Sensitivity: Can contain sensitive information, such as build settings and paths). The compiler uses configuration files to control its behavior.
    *   Compiler Diagnostics (Sensitivity: Can reveal information about potential vulnerabilities or errors in the code). The compiler generates diagnostics to report errors, warnings, and other information.

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

*   Questions:
    *   What specific threat models have been used for Roslyn in the past?
    *   What are the current performance benchmarks and targets for the compiler?
    *   What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities reported by external researchers?
    *   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., FIPS) that need to be considered?
    *   What level of support is provided for older versions of the .NET Framework?

*   Assumptions:
    *   BUSINESS POSTURE: Microsoft prioritizes the security and reliability of the .NET ecosystem.
    *   SECURITY POSTURE: Microsoft follows its internal Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) practices.
    *   DESIGN: The design of the compiler is modular and extensible, allowing for future enhancements and security improvements. The build process is automated and secure. The deployment process is well-defined and reliable.
