# Attack Surface Analysis for dotnet/roslyn

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection into Compilation](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_into_compilation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious C# or VB.NET code into the source code that Roslyn compiles, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Roslyn Contribution:** Roslyn's core function is to compile code; this inherent capability is the attack vector.  Roslyn *directly* executes the injected code upon compilation.
*   **Example:**
    *   A web application allows users to enter C# code snippets for "live evaluation." An attacker submits code that downloads and executes a malware payload.
    *   An application uses Roslyn to generate code based on user-provided templates.  The attacker injects malicious code into the template.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise; data theft; malware installation; denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous validation of *all* input used in code generation. Reject any input that contains unexpected characters, keywords, or patterns. Prefer allow-listing (whitelisting).
    *   **Sandboxing:** Execute the compiled code in a highly restricted environment (container, VM). This limits the damage even if code execution occurs.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Compilation (if possible):** If functionality can be achieved without dynamic compilation, choose that approach.
    *   **Template Engine Security:** If using a template engine, ensure it's secure and user input is properly escaped *within the template*.
    *   **Code Signing (Post-Compilation):** Digitally sign the compiled assembly to detect tampering *after* compilation.
    *   **Allow Lists (Whitelisting):** Define a strict allow list of permitted code constructs, libraries, and APIs.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Compilation](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_compilation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker submits excessively large or complex code to Roslyn, causing resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk) and denial of service.
*   **Roslyn Contribution:** Roslyn's compilation process is resource-intensive; this is exploited to cause DoS. Roslyn *directly* consumes the resources during the compilation attempt.
*   **Example:**
    *   An attacker submits a C# script with deeply nested loops or a large number of classes, causing the compilation process to consume all available memory.
    *   An attacker repeatedly submits code for compilation, overwhelming the server.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability; service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Resource Limits:** Impose strict limits on code size, complexity (e.g., nesting depth), and compilation time.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the frequency of compilation requests.
    *   **Asynchronous Compilation:** Compile code in a background process.
    *   **Queueing:** Use a queue to manage compilation requests.
    *   **Input Size Limits:** Enforce maximum input size limits.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Roslyn Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_roslyn_itself.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities within the Roslyn library itself.
*   **Roslyn Contribution:** Roslyn, like any software, may contain vulnerabilities. The vulnerability is *directly* within the Roslyn codebase.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in Roslyn's parsing logic is exploited by providing specially crafted code.
*   **Impact:** Varies; could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical, depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Roslyn Updated:** Regularly update to the latest version of Roslyn.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about Roslyn security advisories.
    *   **Defense in Depth:** Implement multiple layers of security.
