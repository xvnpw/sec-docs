*   **Impact:** All Roslyn-Specific Threats: High risk reduction. Provides a comprehensive approach to identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities across all threat categories related to Roslyn usage.

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Accuracy:** The claim that this strategy mitigates "All Roslyn-Specific Threats" is a strong statement and potentially an oversimplification. While the strategy is comprehensive and addresses a wide range of threats, it's important to acknowledge that no security strategy can guarantee 100% mitigation of all possible threats.  However, it *significantly reduces* the risk associated with a broad spectrum of Roslyn-related vulnerabilities.
    *   **Scope of Threats:** The listed examples (code injection, resource exhaustion, information disclosure) are indeed relevant Roslyn-specific threats.  Other potential threats could include:
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Through malicious code that consumes excessive resources during compilation or execution.
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** If Roslyn is used in a context where it could potentially gain elevated privileges.
        *   **Data Integrity Issues:**  If malicious code manipulates data during compilation or execution.
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks:**  If dependencies used by Roslyn integration are compromised. (While less directly Roslyn-specific, it's relevant in the broader context).
    *   **Impact Justification:**  The "High risk reduction" impact is justified. Implementing this strategy comprehensively would significantly reduce the attack surface and likelihood of successful exploitation of Roslyn-related vulnerabilities. The multi-layered approach (code review, audits, penetration testing) provides robust defense-in-depth.
    *   **Refinement:**  Instead of claiming mitigation of "All Roslyn-Specific Threats," it would be more accurate and realistic to state that the strategy "significantly reduces the risk from a wide range of Roslyn-specific threats" or "provides comprehensive mitigation for known and anticipated Roslyn-specific vulnerabilities."

### 6. Currently Implemented and Missing Implementation Analysis
