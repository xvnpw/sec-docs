    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Define roles and permissions to restrict access to scripting functionalities based on user roles and responsibilities.
    *   **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** For more granular control, consider ABAC to define access policies based on user attributes, resource attributes, and environmental conditions.
    *   **API Keys and Tokens:**  Utilize API keys or tokens for programmatic access to scripting endpoints, ensuring secure key management and rotation practices.
    *   **Least Privilege Principle:** Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to users and processes accessing scripting features.

*   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization for Scripts:**
    *   **Whitelisting Approach:**  Prefer whitelisting valid input patterns and data types over blacklisting. Define strict rules for acceptable script inputs.
    *   **Data Type Validation:**  Enforce strict data type validation for all script inputs to prevent unexpected data or code injection.
    *   **Input Length Limits:**  Implement limits on the length of script inputs to prevent buffer overflows or denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **Context-Aware Sanitization:**  Sanitize inputs based on the context in which they will be used within the script. Use appropriate encoding and escaping techniques to prevent code injection.
    *   **Regular Expression Validation:**  Employ robust regular expressions to validate script inputs against expected patterns and formats.
    *   **Code Analysis Tools:**  Integrate static and dynamic code analysis tools to automatically detect potential code injection vulnerabilities in script inputs.

*   **Principle of Least Privilege for Scripts:**
    *   **Restricted Execution Context:** Execute scripts within a restricted execution context with minimal permissions.
    *   **Dedicated User Accounts:** Run scripts under dedicated user accounts with limited privileges, separate from the main application process.
    *   **API Access Control:**  Limit the APIs and system resources that scripts can access to only those strictly necessary for their intended functionality.
    *   **Resource Quotas and Limits:**  Implement resource quotas and limits (CPU, memory, network) for script execution to prevent resource exhaustion and denial-of-service attacks.

*   **Script Sandboxing and Isolation:**
    *   **Process Isolation:** Execute scripts in separate processes or containers to isolate them from the main application and limit the impact of malicious scripts.
    *   **Virtualization:** Utilize virtual machines or sandboxing technologies to create isolated environments for script execution.
