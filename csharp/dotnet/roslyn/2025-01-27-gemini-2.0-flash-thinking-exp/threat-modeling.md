# Threat Model Analysis for dotnet/roslyn

## Threat: [Dynamic Code Injection via Unsanitized Input](./threats/dynamic_code_injection_via_unsanitized_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code by providing unsanitized input to the application. This input is then used to construct code strings or influence compilation parameters in Roslyn APIs like `CSharpCompilation.Create` or `Script.Run`. Roslyn compiles and executes this injected code within the application's context.
**Impact:** Full application compromise, data breaches, remote code execution on the server, malicious actions performed under the application's identity.
**Roslyn Component Affected:** `CSharpCompilation.Create`, `Script.Run`, Code Generation APIs, Scripting APIs.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly validate and sanitize all user inputs used in code generation or compilation.
*   Use input validation libraries and techniques to prevent injection attacks.
*   Employ parameterized code generation or safer Roslyn APIs to minimize direct string manipulation.
*   Implement sandboxing or process isolation for dynamic code execution if absolutely necessary.

## Threat: [Deserialization of Untrusted Roslyn Workspaces or Compilation Objects](./threats/deserialization_of_untrusted_roslyn_workspaces_or_compilation_objects.md)

**Description:** An attacker could provide a malicious serialized Roslyn `Workspace` or `Compilation` object to the application. If the application deserializes this object from an untrusted source (e.g., user uploads, external APIs), vulnerabilities in deserialization or within the Roslyn objects could be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
**Impact:** Remote code execution, application compromise, data breaches.
**Roslyn Component Affected:** `Workspace` serialization/deserialization, `Compilation` serialization/deserialization.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid deserializing Roslyn `Workspace` or `Compilation` objects from untrusted sources.
*   If deserialization is necessary, carefully validate the source and integrity of the serialized data.
*   Keep Roslyn libraries updated to the latest versions to mitigate known deserialization vulnerabilities.
*   Use secure serialization methods and libraries.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Roslyn Compiler Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_roslyn_compiler_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft specific code inputs designed to trigger vulnerabilities within the Roslyn compiler itself. This could lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or even code execution within the Roslyn process when the application uses Roslyn to compile or analyze this code.
**Impact:** Denial of service, potential code execution if vulnerabilities are severe, application instability.
**Roslyn Component Affected:** Roslyn Compiler (various modules).
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Roslyn libraries updated to the latest stable versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Monitor security advisories and release notes for Roslyn and .NET.
*   Sandbox Roslyn execution when processing untrusted code to limit exploit impact.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation through Roslyn in Privileged Contexts](./threats/privilege_escalation_through_roslyn_in_privileged_contexts.md)

**Description:** If Roslyn is used in a privileged context, vulnerabilities in its usage or interaction could be exploited by an attacker to escalate privileges. This could allow unauthorized access to system resources or privileged actions.
**Impact:** System compromise, unauthorized access to sensitive resources, privilege escalation to administrator level.
**Roslyn Component Affected:** Application's interaction with Roslyn APIs, Process execution context.
**Risk Severity:** High (if running in privileged context)
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Minimize privileges granted to the application and Roslyn processes.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege.
*   Implement robust input validation and security checks in privileged contexts.
*   Use process isolation and sandboxing to limit privilege escalation impact.
