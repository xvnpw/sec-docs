# Attack Surface Analysis for dotnet/roslyn

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection via Dynamic Compilation](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_via_dynamic_compilation.md)

* **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code that is then compiled and potentially executed by the application using Roslyn.
    * **How Roslyn Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Roslyn provides the functionality to compile C# or VB.NET code at runtime. If the application takes user-provided input and uses Roslyn to compile it, this creates a direct pathway for code injection.
    * **Example:** A web application allows users to enter custom C# scripts to automate tasks. A malicious user enters a script that deletes files on the server. Roslyn compiles and the application executes this malicious script.
    * **Impact:**  Critical. Can lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, denial of service, and other severe consequences depending on the privileges of the application.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid Dynamic Compilation from Untrusted Sources:**  The most effective mitigation is to avoid compiling code directly from user input or any untrusted source.
        * **Input Sanitization and Validation:** If dynamic compilation is necessary, rigorously sanitize and validate all input to ensure it conforms to expected patterns and does not contain malicious code constructs. This is extremely difficult to do perfectly for arbitrary code.
        * **Sandboxing and Isolation:** Execute the compilation and any resulting code in a highly restricted sandbox environment with minimal privileges.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application running the Roslyn compilation has the absolute minimum necessary permissions.
        * **Static Analysis of Input:** If possible, perform static analysis on the input code before compilation to detect potentially malicious patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion during Compilation](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_during_compilation.md)

* **Description:** An attacker provides excessively complex or large code snippets that consume significant resources (CPU, memory) during compilation, leading to denial of service.
    * **How Roslyn Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Roslyn's compilation process, like any compiler, requires resources. Maliciously crafted code can exploit the compiler's algorithms to consume excessive resources.
    * **Example:** A user submits a very large C# file with deeply nested structures and complex generic types, causing the Roslyn compiler to consume all available CPU and memory, making the application unresponsive.
    * **Impact:** High. Can lead to application downtime, impacting availability for legitimate users.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Timeouts and Resource Limits:** Implement timeouts and resource limits (CPU time, memory usage) for the compilation process.
        * **Rate Limiting:** Limit the frequency and size of code submissions for compilation.
        * **Complexity Analysis:**  If feasible, analyze the complexity of the submitted code before compilation and reject overly complex submissions.
        * **Queueing and Prioritization:** Implement a queueing system for compilation requests to prevent a single malicious user from overwhelming the system.

## Attack Surface: [Compiler Bugs and Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/compiler_bugs_and_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:**  Attackers exploit undiscovered bugs or vulnerabilities within the Roslyn compiler itself.
    * **How Roslyn Contributes to the Attack Surface:** As a complex piece of software, Roslyn might contain vulnerabilities that could be triggered by specific code inputs or compiler configurations.
    * **Example:** A specific combination of language features and compiler options triggers a buffer overflow in the Roslyn compiler, potentially leading to a crash or, in more severe cases, arbitrary code execution within the compiler process.
    * **Impact:** High. Impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability. Could lead to crashes, information disclosure, or potentially even code execution within the compilation process.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep Roslyn Updated:** Regularly update to the latest stable version of Roslyn to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        * **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories related to Roslyn and .NET.
        * **Consider Beta/Preview Programs (with caution):**  Participating in beta or preview programs can help identify potential issues early, but should be done with caution in production environments.
        * **Code Review and Static Analysis:** While not directly mitigating Roslyn bugs, thorough code review and static analysis of the application's code can help identify potential interactions that might exacerbate compiler vulnerabilities.
