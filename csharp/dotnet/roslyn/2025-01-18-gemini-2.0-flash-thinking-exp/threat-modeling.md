# Threat Model Analysis for dotnet/roslyn

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Dynamic Compilation](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_dynamic_compilation.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides malicious code as input to the application, which is then directly compiled and potentially executed *by Roslyn's* dynamic compilation capabilities. The attacker might leverage input fields, API parameters, or configuration files to inject this code that Roslyn then processes.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server or client machine running the application, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.

**Affected Roslyn Component:** `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.CSharpCompilation` (or similar for other languages), `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Emit.EmitResult`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Sanitize and validate all user-provided input that influences the code being compiled *by Roslyn*.
* Implement strict input validation and encoding before passing code to Roslyn for compilation.
* Run the compilation process *initiated by Roslyn* in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges.
* Employ static analysis tools on the input code before it is processed by Roslyn (if feasible).
* Limit the capabilities of the compiled code *generated by Roslyn* through security policies or code access security.
* Avoid directly compiling user-provided code *with Roslyn* if possible; consider alternative approaches like pre-compilation or using a more restricted scripting language.

## Threat: [Code Injection via Roslyn Scripting APIs](./threats/code_injection_via_roslyn_scripting_apis.md)

**Description:** If the application uses *Roslyn's* scripting APIs (e.g., `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Scripting`), an attacker can inject malicious code into the scripts being executed *by Roslyn*. This could happen through manipulated input parameters or by compromising the source of the scripts that Roslyn interprets.

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code within the application's context, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, or denial of service.

**Affected Roslyn Component:** `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Scripting.CSharpScript`, `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Scripting.Script`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Treat all script input as untrusted before it is processed by Roslyn.
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization for script content and parameters passed to Roslyn's scripting engine.
* Run scripts *executed by Roslyn* in a secure sandbox with restricted access to system resources.
* Consider using a more restricted scripting language or a domain-specific language (DSL) instead of full C# scripting with Roslyn if possible.
* Implement code signing or verification for scripts executed by Roslyn.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Excessive Compilation/Analysis](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_excessive_compilationanalysis.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides extremely large, complex, or intentionally crafted code that consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk space) during *Roslyn's* compilation or analysis processes, leading to a denial of service.

**Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to Roslyn's resource exhaustion, preventing legitimate users from accessing its services.

**Affected Roslyn Component:** `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Compilation`, `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.SyntaxTree`, `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.SemanticModel`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement timeouts and resource limits for *Roslyn* operations (compilation, analysis, scripting).
* Implement rate limiting for actions that trigger *Roslyn* operations.
* Analyze the complexity of the code being processed *by Roslyn* and reject overly complex inputs.
* Monitor resource usage during *Roslyn* operations and implement alerts for anomalies.

## Threat: [Tampering with Compilation Inputs via Interception](./threats/tampering_with_compilation_inputs_via_interception.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between the application and *Roslyn*, potentially modifying the source code or compilation options before they reach the compiler *within Roslyn*.

**Impact:** Introduction of malicious code into the compiled output *generated by Roslyn*, leading to arbitrary code execution or unexpected application behavior.

**Affected Roslyn Component:**  The interfaces and data structures used to pass code and compilation options *to Roslyn* (e.g., `SyntaxTree.ParseText()`, `CSharpCompilation.Create()`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure secure communication channels between the application and *Roslyn* (e.g., if they are separate processes).
* Implement integrity checks on the code and compilation options before passing them *to Roslyn*.
* Protect the storage and retrieval mechanisms for source code that will be processed by Roslyn.
