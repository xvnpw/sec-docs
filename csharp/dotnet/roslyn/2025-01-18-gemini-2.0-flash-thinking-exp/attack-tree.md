## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Roslyn (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_roslyn__critical_node_.md)

* **Compromise Application Using Roslyn (Critical Node):**
    * This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this level means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application through Roslyn vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Processing Vulnerabilities (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_processing_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* **Exploit Input Processing Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):**
    * This category of attacks focuses on manipulating the data or code provided as input to Roslyn.
    * Attackers aim to leverage weaknesses in how the application processes and handles external input when using Roslyn.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Dynamic Compilation (Critical Node, Start of High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_dynamic_compilation__critical_node__start_of_high-risk_path_.md)

* **Inject Malicious Code via Dynamic Compilation (Critical Node, Start of High-Risk Path):**
    * **Attack Vector:** If the application allows users to provide code snippets (e.g., C#) for dynamic compilation using Roslyn, attackers can inject malicious code.
    * **Potential Impact:** This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server or within the application's context.
    * **Key Characteristics:** Requires the application to utilize Roslyn for dynamic code compilation of user-provided input.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious C# Code Snippets (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_c#_code_snippets__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Supply Malicious C# Code Snippets (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers provide crafted C# code snippets designed to exploit vulnerabilities or perform malicious actions when compiled and executed.
    * **Potential Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary commands, data exfiltration, system compromise.
    * **Key Characteristics:**  Relies on the application's dynamic compilation functionality and lack of proper input sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Code Execution Flaws in Compiled Code (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_code_execution_flaws_in_compiled_code__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Code Execution Flaws in Compiled Code (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
    * **Attack Vector:** The malicious C# code, once compiled, contains instructions that exploit vulnerabilities in the application's environment or the underlying system.
    * **Potential Impact:** Full system compromise, data breaches, denial of service.
    * **Key Characteristics:**  Exploits inherent weaknesses in the compiled code itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Build Targets (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_build_targets__critical_node_.md)

* **Inject Malicious Build Targets (Critical Node):**
    * **Attack Vector:** If the application processes or loads project files (e.g., `.csproj`) using Roslyn, attackers can inject malicious build targets within these files.
    * **Potential Impact:** Execution of arbitrary commands during the build process, potentially compromising the build environment and the resulting application.
    * **Key Characteristics:**  Requires the application to process project files and execute build targets defined within them.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Commands During Build (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_commands_during_build__critical_node_.md)

* **Execute Arbitrary Commands During Build (Critical Node):**
    * **Attack Vector:** The malicious build targets contain commands that are executed by the build system, allowing the attacker to perform unauthorized actions.
    * **Potential Impact:** System compromise, installation of malware, data manipulation.
    * **Key Characteristics:**  Leverages the build process as an execution environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* **Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):**
    * This category focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities present in the NuGet packages that Roslyn or the application using Roslyn depends on.
    * Attackers target known security flaws in these external libraries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Target Vulnerable NuGet Packages Used by Roslyn (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/target_vulnerable_nuget_packages_used_by_roslyn__critical_node_.md)

* **Target Vulnerable NuGet Packages Used by Roslyn (Critical Node):**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify and target known vulnerabilities in the direct dependencies of Roslyn or the application.
    * **Potential Impact:**  Depends on the specific vulnerability, but can range from remote code execution to denial of service.
    * **Key Characteristics:**  Relies on the presence of outdated or vulnerable NuGet packages in the project.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Transitive Dependencies (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_transitive_dependencies__critical_node_.md)

* **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Transitive Dependencies (Critical Node):**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in the dependencies of Roslyn's direct dependencies (transitive dependencies).
    * **Potential Impact:** Similar to direct dependency vulnerabilities, can lead to various forms of compromise.
    * **Key Characteristics:**  Requires a deeper understanding of the project's dependency tree.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Resource Exhaustion (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_resource_exhaustion__critical_node_.md)

* **Exploit Resource Exhaustion (Critical Node):**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers provide extremely large or complex code files to the Roslyn compiler, causing it to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory).
    * **Potential Impact:** Denial of service, making the application unavailable.
    * **Key Characteristics:**  Relatively easy to execute, requiring minimal specialized knowledge.
