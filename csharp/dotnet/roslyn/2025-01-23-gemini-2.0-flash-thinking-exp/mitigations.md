# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for dotnet/roslyn

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation for User-Provided Code using Roslyn Syntax Analysis](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_for_user-provided_code_using_roslyn_syntax_analysis.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Parse User Input with Roslyn:** Use Roslyn's `SyntaxTree.ParseText` to convert user-provided code strings into Roslyn Syntax Trees. This is the first step in analyzing the code structure.
    2.  **Define Allowed Syntax Rules:**  Establish a clear set of rules defining the permitted C# or VB.NET syntax. This should be a *whitelist* of allowed language features, focusing on only what is absolutely necessary for the intended functionality.  For example, allow basic expressions, limited control flow, and specific API calls, but disallow unsafe code, pointers, reflection, or file system/network access.
    3.  **Implement Syntax Tree Validation with Roslyn APIs:** Create a custom `SyntaxWalker` or `SyntaxRewriter` class that leverages Roslyn's syntax analysis APIs to traverse the parsed Syntax Tree. Within this walker/rewriter, implement checks to ensure that only syntax nodes and tokens conforming to the defined allowed syntax rules are present.
    4.  **Reject Invalid Syntax:** If the `SyntaxWalker` or `SyntaxRewriter` detects any syntax elements that are not on the whitelist, reject the user-provided code.  Use Roslyn's diagnostic reporting mechanisms (though sanitize output - see later mitigation) to provide informative error messages to developers during testing, but provide generic, safe error messages to end-users.
    5.  **Code Size and Complexity Limits (Roslyn Analysis):**  Use Roslyn's syntax tree analysis to assess code complexity (e.g., depth of syntax tree, number of nodes).  Reject code that exceeds predefined complexity limits to prevent resource exhaustion during compilation.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Code Injection (High Severity):** Directly prevents injection of arbitrary code by strictly controlling the allowed language constructs processed by Roslyn.
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical Severity):**  Significantly reduces RCE risk by limiting the attacker's ability to introduce and execute malicious code through Roslyn.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity - if code output is rendered):**  If Roslyn output is rendered, validation helps prevent XSS by ensuring only safe code structures are processed.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Code Injection: Significantly reduces risk. Roslyn's syntax analysis provides granular control over allowed code structures.
        *   RCE: Significantly reduces risk.  Restricting language features makes RCE much harder to achieve via Roslyn.
        *   XSS: Moderately reduces risk. Adds a layer of defense against XSS if output is handled carefully.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in the "Plugin Processing Module" using a custom `SyntaxWalker` to validate plugin code against a defined API whitelist.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Needs stricter implementation in the "Dynamic Scripting Feature." Currently, validation is less strict and needs to be refined using Roslyn's syntax analysis to enforce a more limited language subset.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Roslyn Compilation Resource Limits (Timeouts and Complexity Analysis)](./mitigation_strategies/roslyn_compilation_resource_limits__timeouts_and_complexity_analysis_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Compilation Timeouts with `CancellationToken`:** When initiating Roslyn compilation (e.g., using `CSharpCompilation.Create` and `compilation.Emit`), use a `CancellationTokenSource` with a defined timeout period. Pass the `CancellationToken` to the compilation and emit operations. If compilation exceeds the timeout, cancel the operation gracefully.
    2.  **Pre-Compilation Syntax Tree Complexity Analysis:** Before compilation, use Roslyn's syntax tree analysis to estimate the complexity of the code to be compiled.  Metrics could include:
        *   Number of syntax nodes.
        *   Maximum depth of the syntax tree.
        *   Number of loops or complex control flow structures.
        *   Number of symbols to resolve.
    3.  **Reject Complex Code Before Compilation:** Based on the complexity analysis, reject or limit the compilation of code deemed excessively complex. Define thresholds for complexity metrics and prevent compilation if these thresholds are exceeded.
    4.  **Limit Concurrent Roslyn Compilations:** Control the number of simultaneous Roslyn compilation tasks. Use a `SemaphoreSlim` or similar mechanism to limit concurrency and prevent resource exhaustion if multiple compilation requests arrive concurrently.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Prevents DoS attacks by limiting the resources consumed by individual and concurrent Roslyn compilation tasks. Timeouts and complexity limits prevent resource exhaustion from malicious or overly complex code.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Protects against unintentional resource exhaustion from legitimate but resource-intensive compilation, ensuring system stability.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   DoS: Significantly reduces risk. Roslyn-specific resource limits directly address DoS threats related to compilation.
        *   Resource Exhaustion: Significantly reduces risk. Limits ensure compilation processes are bounded in resource usage.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Timeouts are implemented using `CancellationTokenSource` for all Roslyn compilation operations. Concurrent compilation is limited using `SemaphoreSlim`.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Pre-compilation syntax tree complexity analysis using Roslyn APIs is not yet implemented. Complexity thresholds need to be defined and integrated into the compilation pipeline.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitized Roslyn Error Handling and Information Disclosure Prevention](./mitigation_strategies/sanitized_roslyn_error_handling_and_information_disclosure_prevention.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Catch Roslyn Compilation and Runtime Exceptions:** Implement try-catch blocks around Roslyn compilation and code execution sections to handle potential exceptions thrown by Roslyn.
    2.  **Sanitize Roslyn Diagnostic Messages:** When compilation errors occur, Roslyn provides detailed diagnostic messages. Sanitize these messages before displaying them to users or logging them externally. Remove sensitive information like:
        *   Internal file paths from diagnostic locations.
        *   Potentially revealing variable names or code snippets from error messages.
        *   Full stack traces in user-facing errors.
    3.  **Provide Generic Error Responses for Users:** For user-facing errors related to Roslyn, provide generic, safe error messages (e.g., "Compilation error," "Script error"). Avoid exposing detailed Roslyn diagnostics directly to users.
    4.  **Secure Internal Logging of Roslyn Diagnostics:** Log detailed Roslyn diagnostic information internally for debugging and monitoring purposes. Ensure these logs are stored securely and accessed only by authorized personnel. Consider redacting or masking sensitive information in internal logs as well.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Prevents leakage of internal information through detailed Roslyn error messages, which could aid attackers in understanding the application or finding vulnerabilities.
        *   **Security Misconfiguration (Low Severity):** Reduces risk of misconfiguration due to overly verbose error messages or insecure logging of Roslyn diagnostics.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Information Disclosure: Moderately reduces risk. Sanitization and generic messages limit information available to attackers.
        *   Security Misconfiguration: Minimally reduces risk. Secure logging of diagnostics improves overall security posture.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Basic sanitization of user-facing error messages in the "Dynamic Scripting Feature" by replacing detailed Roslyn errors with generic messages. Internal logging uses structured logging.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** More comprehensive sanitization of Roslyn diagnostic messages is needed across all modules using Roslyn. Secure logging practices (redaction, access control) for detailed Roslyn logs need to be fully implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Roslyn NuGet Packages Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_roslyn_nuget_packages_updated.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Roslyn NuGet Package Updates:** Regularly monitor for new releases and security advisories related to the Roslyn NuGet packages used in the project (e.g., `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp`, `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.VisualBasic`, `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Compilers`).
    2.  **Apply Updates Promptly:** When new stable versions of Roslyn packages are released, especially those addressing security vulnerabilities, update the project dependencies promptly.
    3.  **Automate Dependency Updates (Consider):** Explore using automated dependency update tools or processes to streamline the process of checking for and applying Roslyn package updates.
    4.  **Test After Updates:** After updating Roslyn packages, perform thorough testing to ensure compatibility and that the updates haven't introduced any regressions or unexpected behavior in the application's Roslyn-using functionalities.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Vulnerability Exploitation (Variable Severity - depends on Roslyn vulnerability):** Directly mitigates the risk of attackers exploiting known security vulnerabilities within the Roslyn library itself. Severity depends on the specific vulnerability.
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Variable Severity - indirect):** Reduces the risk of supply chain attacks by ensuring that the Roslyn dependency is kept secure and patched against known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Vulnerability Exploitation: Significantly reduces risk. Regular Roslyn updates are crucial for patching known vulnerabilities in the library.
        *   Supply Chain Attacks: Moderately reduces risk. Keeping dependencies updated is a key aspect of supply chain security.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Roslyn NuGet packages are generally updated during major release cycles.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** A more systematic and frequent process for monitoring and applying Roslyn package updates is needed. Automation of this process should be explored.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Security-Focused Code Review of Roslyn Usage](./mitigation_strategies/security-focused_code_review_of_roslyn_usage.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Focus Code Reviews on Roslyn Code:** During code reviews, specifically emphasize the sections of code that interact with Roslyn APIs and handle user-provided code or dynamic code generation using Roslyn.
    2.  **Roslyn Security Checklist for Reviews:** Develop and use a checklist of security considerations specific to Roslyn usage during code reviews. This checklist should include items related to input validation (using Roslyn syntax analysis), resource management (compilation timeouts, complexity), error handling (sanitization), and secure coding practices when using Roslyn APIs.
    3.  **Security Training for Developers on Roslyn Risks:** Provide developers with training on common security risks associated with using Roslyn, such as code injection, DoS via compilation, and information disclosure through error messages. Educate them on secure coding practices when working with Roslyn.
    4.  **Dedicated Security Review for Roslyn Components:** For significant changes or new features involving Roslyn, conduct dedicated security reviews specifically focused on the security implications of the Roslyn integration.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **All Roslyn-Related Threats:** Code review helps identify and mitigate vulnerabilities across all threat categories related to Roslyn usage (Code Injection, RCE, DoS, Information Disclosure, etc.).
        *   **Design Flaws and Implementation Errors (Variable Severity):** Catches security design flaws and implementation errors early in the development lifecycle, reducing the likelihood of vulnerabilities in production.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   All Roslyn-Related Threats: Moderately to Significantly reduces risk. Code review is a proactive security measure for catching issues early.
        *   Design Flaws and Implementation Errors: Significantly reduces risk. Early detection is more effective and less costly than fixing production vulnerabilities.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Code reviews are standard practice, but security aspects related to Roslyn are not always explicitly emphasized.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Security-focused code reviews with a Roslyn-specific checklist are not consistently performed. Developers need more specific training on Roslyn security risks and best practices. Dedicated security reviews for Roslyn components are not yet systematically conducted.
