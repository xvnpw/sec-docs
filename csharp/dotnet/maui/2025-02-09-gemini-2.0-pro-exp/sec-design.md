# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Enable .NET developers to build cross-platform native applications for mobile and desktop from a single codebase.
*   Provide a modern, productive development experience that simplifies and accelerates UI development.
*   Offer a consistent API and UI framework across different platforms (Android, iOS, macOS, Windows).
*   Maintain high performance and native look-and-feel on each platform.
*   Facilitate code reuse and reduce development time and cost.
*   Expand the reach of .NET to new platforms and devices.
*   Attract and retain developers within the .NET ecosystem.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Failure to deliver a stable and performant framework could lead to developer frustration and abandonment.
*   Inability to keep pace with platform-specific updates (Android, iOS, etc.) could render applications obsolete or incompatible.
*   Security vulnerabilities in the framework could expose user data and damage the reputation of .NET MAUI and Microsoft.
*   Lack of adoption by the developer community could limit the framework's success and impact.
*   Competition from other cross-platform frameworks (e.g., React Native, Flutter) could diminish market share.
*   Inconsistent UI/UX across platforms could lead to a fragmented user experience.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls (based on the repository and general .NET practices):

*   security control: Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) practices are likely followed, although the specific details are not fully exposed in the public repository. This includes threat modeling, code reviews, static analysis, and security testing.
*   security control: .NET platform security features: .NET MAUI leverages the underlying security features of the .NET platform, such as code access security (CAS), role-based security, and cryptographic libraries. Implemented in .NET runtime and Base Class Library (BCL).
*   security control: Platform-specific security features: .NET MAUI applications utilize the security mechanisms provided by each target platform (Android, iOS, macOS, Windows). This includes sandboxing, permissions models, and secure storage APIs. Implemented in platform-specific bindings and native code.
*   security control: Managed code: The majority of .NET MAUI code is written in C#, which is a memory-safe language, reducing the risk of common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows. Implemented in .NET MAUI codebase.
*   security control: Regular updates and patching: Microsoft provides regular updates and security patches for .NET and .NET MAUI to address newly discovered vulnerabilities. Implemented through NuGet package updates and platform updates.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on third-party libraries and dependencies: .NET MAUI, like any complex framework, depends on third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities in these libraries could impact the security of .NET MAUI applications.
*   accepted risk: Platform-specific vulnerabilities: While .NET MAUI abstracts away many platform details, vulnerabilities in the underlying operating systems (Android, iOS, macOS, Windows) can still affect applications.
*   accepted risk: Developer errors: The security of a .NET MAUI application ultimately depends on the developers who build it. Poor coding practices or security misconfigurations can introduce vulnerabilities.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a robust dependency management process, including regular scanning for known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries (e.g., using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk).
*   security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and security assessments of .NET MAUI applications, focusing on platform-specific attack vectors.
*   security control: Provide clear security guidance and documentation for developers building .NET MAUI applications, covering topics like secure coding practices, data protection, and authentication/authorization.
*   security control: Implement a mechanism for securely reporting and handling security vulnerabilities discovered in .NET MAUI itself.
*   security control: Integrate automated security checks into the build pipeline, including static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST).

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support for standard authentication protocols (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect).
    *   Integration with platform-specific authentication mechanisms (e.g., biometric authentication).
    *   Secure storage of authentication tokens and credentials.
*   Authorization:
    *   Fine-grained access control to application features and data.
    *   Role-based access control (RBAC) capabilities.
    *   Integration with platform-specific authorization mechanisms.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Thorough validation of all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).
    *   Use of whitelisting and input sanitization techniques.
    *   Validation of data received from external sources (e.g., APIs, web services).
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms for data protection (e.g., AES, RSA).
    *   Secure key management practices.
    *   Protection of sensitive data in transit and at rest.
    *   Compliance with relevant cryptographic standards (e.g., FIPS 140-2).
