## Mitigation Strategy: [Platform-Specific API Least Privilege (MAUI-Centric)](./mitigation_strategies/platform-specific_api_least_privilege__maui-centric_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce the Principle of Least Privilege using MAUI's Permission System.

**Description:**
1.  **Identify MAUI Permission Requests:**  Examine your MAUI project's platform-specific configuration files:
    *   **Android:** `Platforms/Android/AndroidManifest.xml`
    *   **iOS/macOS:** `Platforms/iOS/Info.plist` and `Platforms/MacCatalyst/Info.plist`
    *   **Windows:** `Platforms/Windows/Package.appxmanifest`
2.  **Minimize Permissions:**  Remove any `<uses-permission>` (Android), permission keys (iOS/macOS), or capabilities (Windows) that are not *absolutely essential* for your application's functionality.  Use the most granular permissions available.
3.  **MAUI `Permissions` Class:** Utilize the `Microsoft.Maui.ApplicationModel.Permissions` class for runtime permission requests.  This provides a cross-platform abstraction for requesting permissions.  Example:
    ```csharp
    var status = await Permissions.CheckStatusAsync<Permissions.Camera>();
    if (status != PermissionStatus.Granted)
    {
        status = await Permissions.RequestAsync<Permissions.Camera>();
    }
    if (status == PermissionStatus.Granted)
    {
        // Access the camera
    }
    else
    {
        // Handle permission denial
    }
    ```
4.  **Conditional Compilation:** Use preprocessor directives (`#if ANDROID`, `#if IOS`, etc.) to handle platform-specific permission logic or UI elements related to permissions.
5. **Rationale:** Provide clear and concise rationale to the user *within the MAUI application* explaining why each permission is needed. This is often done through UI elements before calling `Permissions.RequestAsync`.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Malware Exploitation (High Severity):** Limits the damage malware can do if it compromises the app.
*   **Data Breaches (High Severity):** Reduces the scope of potential data breaches.
*   **Privacy Violations (Medium Severity):** Protects user privacy.
*   **Reputational Damage (Medium Severity):** Improves user trust.

**Impact:**
*   **Malware Exploitation:** High impact.
*   **Data Breaches:** High impact.
*   **Privacy Violations:** High impact.
*   **Reputational Damage:** Moderate impact.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   **Example:** Camera permissions are requested using `Permissions.Camera` in the `CameraService.cs` file, and the `AndroidManifest.xml` and `Info.plist` files are configured accordingly.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   **Example:** Location permissions are requested too broadly.  The `Info.plist` needs to be updated to use `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` instead of `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription`. The `LocationService.cs` file needs to use `Permissions.LocationWhenInUse` and handle the different permission states.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Platform-Specific API Input Validation (MAUI Abstraction Layer)](./mitigation_strategies/platform-specific_api_input_validation__maui_abstraction_layer_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Validate all data received from platform APIs, leveraging MAUI abstractions where possible.

**Description:**
1.  **Identify MAUI API Usage:** Identify all uses of MAUI APIs that interact with the underlying platform and return data.  Examples include:
    *   `Microsoft.Maui.Devices.Sensors` (Geolocation, Accelerometer, etc.)
    *   `Microsoft.Maui.Storage.FileSystem`
    *   `Microsoft.Maui.ApplicationModel.Communication` (Email, Phone Dialer, SMS)
    *   `Microsoft.Maui.Media` (MediaPicker)
    *   Any custom platform-specific code invoked via `DependencyService` or handlers.
2.  **Implement Validation within MAUI Code:**  Within your MAUI C# code, *immediately* after receiving data from these APIs, implement validation checks:
    *   **Type Checks:** Ensure the data is of the expected .NET type.
    *   **Range/Format Checks:** Validate numerical ranges, string formats, etc., based on the expected data.
    *   **Sanitization:** If the data will be used in a `WebView` or other context where it could be interpreted as code, sanitize it appropriately.
3.  **Centralized Validation (MAUI):**  If you frequently use a particular MAUI API, create a helper class or extension methods *within your MAUI project* to centralize the validation logic. This promotes consistency and reduces code duplication.
4. **Conditional Validation:** If a MAUI API behaves differently or returns different data types on different platforms, use `#if ANDROID`, `#if IOS`, etc., to implement platform-specific validation logic.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Code Injection (High Severity):** Prevents injection attacks through platform APIs.
*   **Buffer Overflows (High Severity):** Protects against buffer overflows.
*   **Data Corruption (Medium Severity):** Ensures data integrity.
*   **Logic Errors (Medium Severity):** Improves application stability.

**Impact:**
*   **Code Injection:** High impact.
*   **Buffer Overflows:** High impact.
*   **Data Corruption:** Moderate to high impact.
*   **Logic Errors:** Moderate impact.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   **Example:** Basic type checking is done on data returned by `Geolocation.GetLocationAsync()` in `LocationService.cs`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   **Example:**  No validation is performed on file paths returned by `FileSystem.OpenAppPackageFileAsync` in `FileAccessService.cs`.  This needs to be added, including checks for path traversal vulnerabilities. A helper class for file path validation could be created.

## Mitigation Strategy: [WebView Security (MAUI `WebView` Control)](./mitigation_strategies/webview_security__maui__webview__control_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Securely configure and manage MAUI's `WebView` control.

**Description:**
1.  **Identify `WebView` Usage:** Locate all instances of the `Microsoft.Maui.Controls.WebView` control in your MAUI XAML or C# code.
2.  **Disable JavaScript (If Possible):** If the `WebView` is *only* used to display static, trusted content, disable JavaScript entirely:
    ```csharp
    <WebView Source="local.html" >
        <WebView.Behaviors>
            <local:DisableJavaScriptBehavior />
        </WebView.Behaviors>
    </WebView>
    ```
    (You would need to create a custom behavior `DisableJavaScriptBehavior` that sets the appropriate platform-specific settings to disable JavaScript.)
3.  **`WebMessageReceived` Event:** If you *must* use JavaScript and communicate between the `WebView` and your MAUI code, use the `WebView.WebMessageReceived` event and the `WebView.PostMessage` method (from JavaScript).  *Never* use `WebView.EvaluateJavaScriptAsync` to execute arbitrary JavaScript from the native side.  Treat all messages received in the `WebMessageReceived` event handler as *untrusted*.
    ```csharp
    // In your MAUI code:
    webView.WebMessageReceived += (sender, args) =>
    {
        string message = args.Message; // Validate this message!
        // ... process the message ...
    };

    // In your JavaScript (within the WebView):
    window.chrome.webview.postMessage("Hello from JavaScript!");
    ```
4.  **Source Property:** Carefully control the `WebView.Source` property.
    *   **Local Content:** If loading local HTML, use a `HtmlWebViewSource` and ensure the HTML files are stored securely within the app package.
    *   **Remote Content:** If loading remote content, use an `UrlWebViewSource` and ensure the URL is HTTPS and points to a trusted server.  Consider implementing URL filtering to block known malicious domains.
5. **Custom Handlers (Advanced):** For very fine-grained control, consider creating custom handlers for the `WebView` to override platform-specific behavior and security settings.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):**  A major concern with `WebView`.
*   **Data Exfiltration (High Severity):**  Preventing the `WebView` from sending data to malicious servers.
*   **Platform API Access (High Severity):**  Preventing compromised `WebView` content from accessing native platform APIs.

**Impact:**
*   **XSS:** High impact.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** High impact.
*   **Platform API Access:** High impact.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   **Example:** The `HelpPage.xaml` uses a `WebView` to display local HTML content. JavaScript is enabled.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   **Example:**  JavaScript should be disabled for the `HelpPage` `WebView` since it's only displaying static content.  A custom behavior to disable JavaScript needs to be created and applied.  If JavaScript were required, the `WebMessageReceived` event should be used for communication, and all messages should be validated.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Storage (MAUI `SecureStorage`)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_storage__maui__securestorage__.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Use MAUI's `SecureStorage` API for all sensitive data.

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:**  List all data within your MAUI application that should be considered sensitive (API keys, tokens, user credentials, etc.).
2.  **MAUI `SecureStorage` API:** Use the `Microsoft.Maui.Storage.SecureStorage` class to store and retrieve this data.  This API leverages platform-specific secure storage mechanisms.
    ```csharp
    // Store data:
    await SecureStorage.Default.SetAsync("my_secret_key", secretValue);

    // Retrieve data:
    string secretValue = await SecureStorage.Default.GetAsync("my_secret_key");

    // Remove data:
    SecureStorage.Default.Remove("my_secret_key");
    ```
3.  **Error Handling:**  Implement proper error handling around `SecureStorage` calls.  Handle cases where secure storage might be unavailable or fail.
4. **Avoid `Preferences`:** Do *not* use MAUI's `Preferences` API for sensitive data. `Preferences` is intended for simple application settings, not secrets.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Breaches (High Severity):** Protects sensitive data stored on the device.
*   **Unauthorized Access (Medium Severity):** Prevents other apps from accessing the data.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Breaches:** High impact.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** High impact.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   **Example:** The user's authentication token is stored using `SecureStorage` in `AuthenticationService.cs`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   **Example:**  An API key for a third-party service is currently stored in a plain-text configuration file.  This needs to be moved to `SecureStorage`, and the `ApiService.cs` file needs to be updated to retrieve it from there.
