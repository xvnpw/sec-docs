# Threat Model Analysis for dotnet/maui

## Threat: [Malicious Package Impersonation (Dependency Confusion)](./threats/malicious_package_impersonation__dependency_confusion_.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Package Impersonation (Dependency Confusion)

    *   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious NuGet package with a name very similar to a legitimate .NET MAUI or .NET dependency (e.g., `CommunityToolkit.Maui` vs. `CommunnityToolkit.Maui`). The attacker might use typosquatting or social engineering. The malicious package could contain code that steals data, installs malware, or performs other harmful actions. This directly impacts MAUI because MAUI relies heavily on NuGet packages for core functionality and extensions.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete application compromise, data theft, malware installation, remote code execution.
    *   **Affected MAUI Component:** NuGet Package Manager, Project Dependencies, Build Process (specifically as it relates to MAUI and its dependencies).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Carefully verify package names and sources before installation. Double-check for typos.
            *   Use only official NuGet feeds or trusted private feeds.
            *   Pin dependency versions to prevent automatic updates to potentially compromised versions (e.g., use `<PackageReference Include="CommunityToolkit.Maui" Version="1.2.3" />` instead of `Version="*" `).
            *   Use package signing and verification (if available) to ensure package integrity.
            *   Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `dotnet list package --vulnerable`.
            *   Consider using a tool like Dependabot to automatically check for and update vulnerable dependencies.

## Threat: [Application Tampering via Unprotected Custom URL Schemes](./threats/application_tampering_via_unprotected_custom_url_schemes.md)

*   **Threat:**  Application Tampering via Unprotected Custom URL Schemes

    *   **Description:**  A MAUI application uses a custom URL scheme (e.g., `myapp://`) for deep linking. An attacker crafts a malicious URL that exploits a vulnerability in the MAUI application's URL scheme handler. This is MAUI-specific because MAUI provides the framework for handling these schemes across different platforms. The vulnerability lies in how the MAUI application *processes* the data received from the URL.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution, data modification, unauthorized access to application features, denial of service.
    *   **Affected MAUI Component:**  `App.xaml.cs` (or equivalent) where URL scheme handling is implemented (using MAUI's `AppActions` or similar), Platform-specific URL scheme registration facilitated by MAUI (e.g., through project settings that affect `Info.plist` on iOS, `AndroidManifest.xml` on Android).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Thoroughly validate *all* input received via the URL scheme within the MAUI application code. Treat it as untrusted data.
            *   Use a strict whitelist of allowed parameters and values. Reject any unexpected input.
            *   Avoid executing code directly based on URL parameters. Use a secure dispatch mechanism within the MAUI application.
            *   Implement robust error handling to prevent crashes or information disclosure.
            *   Consider using App Links (Android) or Universal Links (iOS) instead of custom URL schemes, as they provide better security, and integrate these using MAUI's platform integration features.

## Threat: [Data Leakage via Insecure `SecureStorage` Implementation](./threats/data_leakage_via_insecure__securestorage__implementation.md)

*   **Threat:**  Data Leakage via Insecure `SecureStorage` Implementation

    *   **Description:**  A MAUI application uses MAUI's `SecureStorage` to store sensitive data. The developer misunderstands the platform-specific limitations of `SecureStorage`, leading to data exposure. This is MAUI-specific because it's MAUI's abstraction over platform-specific secure storage. The vulnerability is in the *reliance* on the abstraction without understanding its underlying behavior.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data (API keys, tokens, user credentials), leading to unauthorized access to backend services or user accounts.
    *   **Affected MAUI Component:**  `Microsoft.Maui.Storage.SecureStorage`, MAUI's platform-specific implementations of secure storage (which wrap Keychain on iOS, Keystore on Android).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Thoroughly understand the security guarantees and limitations of `SecureStorage` on *each* target platform that MAUI supports. Read the official MAUI documentation carefully.
            *   Consider using additional encryption on top of `SecureStorage` for highly sensitive data, managed within the MAUI application.
            *   Implement key rotation and management best practices within the MAUI application.
            *   Avoid storing unnecessary sensitive data on the device.
            *   If possible, and for greater control, use platform-specific secure storage APIs directly via MAUI's platform interop capabilities (but this reduces cross-platform portability).
            *   Educate users about the risks of using rooted/jailbroken devices.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Unprotected WebView](./threats/information_disclosure_via_unprotected_webview.md)

*   **Threat:**  Information Disclosure via Unprotected WebView

    *   **Description:**  A MAUI application uses MAUI's `WebView` control to display web content. If the `WebView` is not configured securely within the MAUI application, it could be vulnerable to XSS, JavaScript injection, and data leakage. This is MAUI-specific because it involves the MAUI `WebView` control and its configuration.
    *   **Impact:**  Cross-site scripting (XSS), JavaScript injection, data leakage, phishing, session hijacking.
    *   **Affected MAUI Component:**  `Microsoft.Maui.Controls.WebView`, MAUI's platform-specific implementations of WebView (which wrap `WKWebView` on iOS, `WebView` on Android).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Enable JavaScript in the MAUI `WebView` only if absolutely necessary.
            *   Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) within the web content loaded into the MAUI `WebView` to restrict resources.
            *   Sanitize and validate all data displayed in the MAUI `WebView`.
            *   Avoid loading untrusted content in the MAUI `WebView`.
            *   Use `WebView.Eval` and `WebView.InvokeAsync` (MAUI's methods for interacting with the WebView) with extreme caution. Validate any data passed to these methods.
            *   Consider using a custom `WebViewRenderer` (a MAUI feature for customizing control rendering) to implement additional security controls.
            *   Keep the underlying WebView implementations up-to-date by updating the MAUI framework and platform SDKs.

## Threat: [Bypassing Permissions via Platform-Specific Vulnerabilities (through MAUI Abstractions)](./threats/bypassing_permissions_via_platform-specific_vulnerabilities__through_maui_abstractions_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Bypassing Permissions via Platform-Specific Vulnerabilities (through MAUI Abstractions)

    *   **Description:** A MAUI application requests permissions using the MAUI permissions API.  A vulnerability in the *underlying platform's* permission system (accessed *through* MAUI's abstraction) could allow bypassing these permissions. This is MAUI-specific because the application relies on MAUI's cross-platform permission handling.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to device features (camera, location, etc.), data theft, privacy violation.
    *   **Affected MAUI Component:** `Microsoft.Maui.ApplicationModel.Permissions`, MAUI's platform-specific implementations of permission handling (which interact with Android's permission system, iOS's privacy settings, etc.).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Request only the minimum necessary permissions using MAUI's API.
            *   Handle permission denials gracefully within the MAUI application.
            *   Regularly review and update the application's permission requests, managed through MAUI.
            *   Stay informed about platform-specific security vulnerabilities (for the platforms MAUI targets) and apply updates promptly.
            *   Test the MAUI application on a variety of devices and OS versions.
            *   Consider using platform-specific permission APIs directly via MAUI's platform interop capabilities for greater control and to address known platform-specific issues (but this reduces cross-platform portability).

## Threat: [Code Injection via Unsafe Deserialization](./threats/code_injection_via_unsafe_deserialization.md)

* **Threat:** Code Injection via Unsafe Deserialization

    * **Description:** The MAUI application deserializes data from an untrusted source without proper validation. An attacker crafts a malicious serialized payload. This is relevant to MAUI as MAUI applications often handle data from various sources (network, files, etc.) and might use serialization for data persistence or communication.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, complete application compromise, data theft, denial of service.
    * **Affected MAUI Component:** Any MAUI component or code that uses serialization/deserialization (e.g., `System.Text.Json`, `Newtonsoft.Json`, data input handling within MAUI, network communication handled by MAUI).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:**
            *   Avoid using `BinaryFormatter`.
            *   Use secure serializers like `System.Text.Json` with appropriate configuration (e.g., type validation, `TypeNameHandling` set to `None` if possible) within the MAUI application.
            *   Validate the type and structure of deserialized data *before* using it within the MAUI application.
            *   Implement a whitelist of allowed types for deserialization within the MAUI application.
            *   Consider using a schema validation library to ensure the data conforms to an expected format, applied to data handled by the MAUI application.
            *   If using a custom serializer within MAUI, ensure it is designed with security in mind.
