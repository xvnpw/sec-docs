# Threat Model Analysis for dotnet/maui

## Threat: [Insecure Keychain/Keystore Storage (iOS/Android)](./threats/insecure_keychainkeystore_storage__iosandroid_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could attempt to access sensitive data (e.g., API keys, user credentials) stored using `Xamarin.Essentials.SecureStorage` if vulnerabilities exist within the MAUI implementation of this feature or in its interaction with the underlying platform secure storage. This could involve exploiting bugs in the MAUI framework's wrappers around the native Keychain/Keystore APIs.

**Impact:** Compromise of user accounts, unauthorized access to backend services, theft of sensitive personal or financial information.

**Affected Component:** `Xamarin.Essentials.SecureStorage` (MAUI abstraction over platform secure storage).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure you are using the latest stable version of the .NET MAUI framework, which includes potential security fixes for `Xamarin.Essentials.SecureStorage`.
* Follow best practices for using `Xamarin.Essentials.SecureStorage`, such as using strong authentication contexts where supported.
* Monitor for security advisories related to `Xamarin.Essentials` and the underlying platform secure storage implementations.

## Threat: [Platform API Abuse/Exploitation via MAUI Interop](./threats/platform_api_abuseexploitation_via_maui_interop.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in how the .NET MAUI framework facilitates calls to native platform APIs (e.g., through P/Invoke or platform-specific service access). This could involve crafting malicious input that bypasses MAUI's safety checks or exploiting bugs within the MAUI interop layer itself, leading to unexpected behavior or security breaches in the underlying native code.

**Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, arbitrary code execution within the application's context, potentially escalating to system-level compromise depending on the exploited API.

**Affected Component:** MAUI's P/Invoke implementation, platform service access mechanisms within MAUI, any MAUI code directly interacting with native APIs.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the exploited API and its privileges).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Stay updated with the latest .NET MAUI framework releases, which may include fixes for interop-related vulnerabilities.
* Carefully review and audit any code that uses P/Invoke or platform service access for potential vulnerabilities.
* Minimize the surface area of native API interactions, relying on secure MAUI abstractions where possible.
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization before passing data to native APIs.

## Threat: [Insecure Native Library Loading within MAUI](./threats/insecure_native_library_loading_within_maui.md)

**Description:** If the .NET MAUI framework itself has vulnerabilities in how it loads or manages native libraries, an attacker could potentially exploit this to load malicious libraries into the application's process. This could occur if MAUI doesn't properly validate the source or integrity of native libraries it depends on.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the application, data theft, system-level access (depending on application privileges).

**Affected Component:** The .NET MAUI runtime and its mechanisms for loading and managing native dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure you are using the latest stable version of the .NET MAUI framework, as the development team actively works on addressing such vulnerabilities.
* Monitor for security advisories related to the .NET MAUI framework and its native dependencies.
* Report any suspected vulnerabilities in MAUI's native library loading mechanisms to the .NET team.
