# Attack Surface Analysis for dotnet/maui

## Attack Surface: [Native Interop and Platform Invokes (P/Invoke)](./attack_surfaces/native_interop_and_platform_invokes__pinvoke_.md)

*   **Description:** MAUI allows calling native libraries or platform APIs directly using P/Invoke. This introduces risks if the called native code has vulnerabilities or if data marshaling between managed and unmanaged code is done incorrectly.
    *   **How MAUI Contributes:** MAUI provides the mechanism (P/Invoke) for developers to interact with native code, which can bypass the managed environment's safety features.
    *   **Example:** A MAUI application uses P/Invoke to call a vulnerable native library for image processing. An attacker provides a specially crafted image that exploits a buffer overflow in the native library, leading to code execution within the application's context.
    *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, crashes, arbitrary code execution, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Minimize the use of P/Invoke. Thoroughly vet any native libraries used for security vulnerabilities. Implement robust input validation and sanitization before passing data to native functions. Use secure coding practices for data marshaling to prevent buffer overflows or other memory safety issues. Consider using safer alternatives if available.

## Attack Surface: [Web View Security (if using WebView)](./attack_surfaces/web_view_security__if_using_webview_.md)

*   **Description:** If a MAUI application embeds web content using the `WebView` control, it inherits the security risks associated with web applications.
    *   **How MAUI Contributes:** MAUI provides the `WebView` control, enabling the integration of web content within the native application. This creates a bridge between the native and web security models.
    *   **Example:** A MAUI application embeds a web page from an untrusted source. The web page contains malicious JavaScript that can access local resources through the `WebView`'s context or perform actions on behalf of the user. This could include stealing cookies or accessing device sensors.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Frame Scripting (XFS), information disclosure, session hijacking, potentially gaining access to native device features depending on `WebView` configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Treat all web content loaded in `WebView` as untrusted. Implement robust Content Security Policy (CSP). Sanitize any data passed between the MAUI application and the `WebView`. Avoid enabling unnecessary permissions for the `WebView`. Validate and sanitize URLs loaded into the `WebView`. Consider using secure communication protocols (HTTPS) for all web content.

## Attack Surface: [Build and Distribution Process](./attack_surfaces/build_and_distribution_process.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities can be introduced during the build and distribution process of the MAUI application.
    *   **How MAUI Contributes:** The MAUI build process involves compiling .NET code and packaging it for different platforms, introducing potential points of compromise.
    *   **Example:** A compromised build server injects malicious code into the MAUI application during the build process. Users who download and install this compromised application are then at risk.
    *   **Impact:**  Distribution of malware, compromised application functionality, data theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Secure the build environment. Implement code signing to verify the authenticity and integrity of the application. Use secure distribution channels (e.g., official app stores). Implement integrity checks within the application to detect tampering.
