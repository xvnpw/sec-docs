## Attack Surface: [WebView Exploits (Hybrid Applications) - Critical](./attack_surfaces/webview_exploits__hybrid_applications__-_critical.md)

**Description:** When MAUI applications utilize WebViews for displaying web content or hybrid functionalities, they inherit the attack surface of web applications, including severe vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and related web-based attacks within the native application context.

**MAUI Contribution:** MAUI framework facilitates the integration of WebViews, making it straightforward to build hybrid applications. This ease of integration directly introduces the entire web application attack surface into the MAUI application.

**Example:** A MAUI application displays user-generated content in a WebView without proper sanitization. An attacker injects malicious JavaScript (XSS) through user content. This script executes within the WebView, potentially stealing user credentials stored in the application's context or performing actions on behalf of the user, even interacting with native functionalities if bridges are insecurely implemented.

**Impact:** Data theft, session hijacking, unauthorized actions within the application, complete compromise of user accounts and potentially the native application's resources and functionalities if bridges are exploited.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strict Input Sanitization & Output Encoding:**  Thoroughly sanitize all user inputs and encode outputs displayed in WebViews to prevent XSS attacks. Use robust libraries and frameworks designed for secure output encoding.
*   **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Enforce a strong Content Security Policy for WebViews to strictly control the sources of content, significantly mitigating XSS risks by limiting where scripts and other resources can be loaded from.
*   **Secure WebView Configuration:**  Disable unnecessary and potentially risky WebView features like file access APIs if not absolutely required. Ensure secure SSL/TLS handling and carefully configure all WebView settings according to security best practices.
*   **Regular and Rigorous Web Security Testing:** Conduct frequent and comprehensive web security testing specifically targeting the web content displayed in WebViews. This should include penetration testing and automated vulnerability scanning to identify and remediate web-based vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [JavaScript Injection & Bridge Exploitation (WebView) - Critical](./attack_surfaces/javascript_injection_&_bridge_exploitation__webview__-_critical.md)

**Description:** Communication bridges between native MAUI code and JavaScript within WebViews, if not meticulously secured, can become critical attack vectors. Malicious JavaScript could exploit these bridges to execute arbitrary native code or gain unauthorized access to sensitive native resources and functionalities.

**MAUI Contribution:** MAUI provides mechanisms to establish communication bridges between the native application code and JavaScript running within WebViews.  The security of these bridge implementations is directly the responsibility of the MAUI application developer, and vulnerabilities here are a direct consequence of using MAUI's hybrid capabilities.

**Example:** A poorly designed JavaScript bridge allows JavaScript code in the WebView to directly invoke native functions without proper authorization or input validation. An attacker injects malicious JavaScript that calls a native function exposed through the bridge to access sensitive device data (like contacts, location, or files) and exfiltrate it to a remote server, or even execute arbitrary system commands.

**Impact:**  Complete unauthorized access to native device resources, arbitrary native code execution leading to full device compromise, privilege escalation allowing attackers to gain control over the application and potentially the device, and significant data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure-by-Design Bridge Implementation:** Design communication bridges with security as the paramount concern from the outset. Implement robust authorization and authentication mechanisms for all bridge calls.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege for Bridge Exposure:**  Expose only the absolutely necessary native functionalities through the bridge. Minimize the surface area available for potential exploitation by limiting the number and capabilities of exposed native functions.
*   **Strict Input Validation & Sanitization at the Bridge:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize *all* data received from JavaScript through the bridge *before* it is processed by native code. Assume all data from JavaScript is potentially malicious and treat it accordingly.
*   **Comprehensive Code Reviews Focused on Bridge Security:**  Conduct dedicated and in-depth security code reviews specifically targeting the JavaScript bridge implementation. Involve security experts to identify potential vulnerabilities and design flaws in the bridge communication logic and authorization mechanisms.

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Native Libraries & Interop Layer Vulnerabilities - High to Critical](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_native_libraries_&_interop_layer_vulnerabilities_-_high_to_critical.md)

**Description:** MAUI applications can interact with native libraries for platform-specific functionalities. Vulnerabilities residing within these external native libraries, or within MAUI's interop layer itself, can be exploited through the MAUI application, leading to severe consequences.

**MAUI Contribution:** MAUI's architecture inherently supports interoperability with native code and libraries. This capability, while powerful, directly extends the application's attack surface to include any vulnerabilities present in the integrated native libraries and the MAUI interop mechanisms.

**Example:** A MAUI application utilizes a third-party native library for advanced image processing. This library contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. An attacker crafts a specially designed malicious image that, when processed by the vulnerable native library through the MAUI application, triggers the buffer overflow. This can lead to arbitrary code execution within the application's context, potentially allowing the attacker to take control of the application or the device.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, privilege escalation allowing attackers to gain elevated permissions, and application crashes leading to instability and potential data loss.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature of the vulnerability and the privileges held by the application).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Rigorous Vetting and Auditing of Native Libraries:**  Before integrating any native library, conduct thorough vetting and security audits. Evaluate the library's source, reputation, security track record, and known vulnerabilities. Use libraries from trusted and reputable sources only.
*   **Secure Interop Coding Practices:**  Adhere to strict secure coding practices when implementing native interop within the MAUI application. Pay close attention to memory management, input validation, and robust error handling in the interop layer to prevent vulnerabilities.
*   **Continuous Dependency Monitoring and Updates:**  Implement a system for continuously monitoring dependencies, including native libraries, for known vulnerabilities. Promptly update native libraries to the latest versions to incorporate security patches and bug fixes as they become available.
*   **Sandboxing and Isolation Techniques:**  Utilize platform-specific sandboxing and process isolation mechanisms to limit the potential impact of vulnerabilities within native libraries. Restrict the permissions and access rights granted to native libraries to minimize the damage in case of exploitation.

## Attack Surface: [MAUI Framework Specific Vulnerabilities - High to Critical](./attack_surfaces/maui_framework_specific_vulnerabilities_-_high_to_critical.md)

**Description:** Like any complex software framework, .NET MAUI itself may contain undiscovered vulnerabilities, bugs, or design flaws. If exploited, these framework-level vulnerabilities could have widespread impact on applications built using MAUI.

**MAUI Contribution:**  Applications built on .NET MAUI are inherently dependent on the framework. Any vulnerability within the MAUI framework directly translates into a potential vulnerability for all applications built upon it. This is a direct attack surface introduced by choosing to use the MAUI framework.

**Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in MAUI's layout engine that allows for arbitrary code execution when processing specially crafted UI layouts. An attacker could exploit this by delivering malicious UI data to a MAUI application, leading to remote code execution on the user's device.

**Impact:** Application crashes, denial of service affecting application availability, potentially remote code execution allowing attackers to gain control of the application and potentially the device, and privilege escalation depending on the nature of the framework vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity and exploitability of the framework vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Maintain Up-to-Date MAUI Framework:**  Ensure that the MAUI framework and all related NuGet packages are consistently updated to the latest stable versions. This is crucial to benefit from security patches and bug fixes released by the .NET MAUI team.
*   **Proactive Security Monitoring and Awareness:**  Actively monitor security advisories, vulnerability databases, and community discussions related to .NET MAUI. Stay informed about any reported vulnerabilities and recommended mitigations.
*   **Participate in Security Community and Reporting:**  Engage with the .NET MAUI security community. If you discover a potential vulnerability in the MAUI framework, follow responsible disclosure practices and report it to the .NET MAUI team to contribute to the framework's overall security.
*   **Implement General Security Best Practices:** While framework updates are critical, also implement general application security best practices within your MAUI application. This can help reduce the impact of potential framework vulnerabilities and provide defense-in-depth.
