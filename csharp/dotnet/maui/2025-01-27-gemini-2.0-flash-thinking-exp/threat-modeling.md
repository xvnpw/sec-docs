# Threat Model Analysis for dotnet/maui

## Threat: [Cross-Platform Handler Injection](./threats/cross-platform_handler_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities within MAUI's handler and renderer system. By crafting specific inputs or exploiting memory corruption bugs in the MAUI framework's code that translates platform-agnostic UI definitions to native platform UI elements, they can inject malicious code. This code executes within the application's context across all platforms MAUI supports.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the device, manipulation of the user interface for phishing or data theft, denial of service by crashing the application on multiple platforms simultaneously.
*   **MAUI Component Affected:** MAUI Handlers, Renderers, Platform Abstraction Layer
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep MAUI Framework Updated:** Regularly update the .NET MAUI framework and related NuGet packages to the latest versions to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
    *   **Security Code Reviews of Custom Handlers:** If developing custom handlers, conduct thorough security code reviews, paying close attention to memory management, input validation, and interactions with native platform APIs.
    *   **Input Validation in UI Logic:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all data that influences UI rendering and handler behavior to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling to prevent application crashes and expose potential vulnerabilities due to unexpected inputs or framework errors.

## Threat: [Platform API Misuse - Permission Bypass](./threats/platform_api_misuse_-_permission_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Developers, when using platform-specific code within MAUI (via Platform Invoke or custom platform code in handlers), may incorrectly utilize native platform APIs. This can lead to unintended permission escalation or bypass of platform security mechanisms. An attacker could exploit this by triggering specific application functionalities that leverage these misused APIs to gain unauthorized access to device resources (camera, location, contacts, etc.) without proper user consent or platform authorization.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive device resources and user data, privacy violations, potential for device compromise depending on the misused API.
*   **MAUI Component Affected:** Platform-Specific Code (Platform Invoke, Custom Handlers), Platform API Interop
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly Adhere to Platform Security Guidelines:** When using platform-specific APIs, meticulously follow the official security guidelines and best practices for each target platform (iOS, Android, Windows, macOS).
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Permissions:** Request and use only the necessary permissions required for the application's functionality. Avoid requesting broad or unnecessary permissions.
    *   **Thorough Permission Testing:** Rigorously test permission requests and usage across all target platforms to ensure they are correctly implemented, justified, and respect user privacy.
    *   **Minimize Platform-Specific Code:** Reduce the reliance on platform-specific code as much as possible. Utilize MAUI's cross-platform abstractions to minimize direct interaction with potentially risky native APIs.
    *   **Security Code Reviews Focused on Platform Interop:** Conduct focused security code reviews specifically examining platform API interactions and permission handling logic in custom platform code and handlers.

## Threat: [Insecure Platform Channel - Code Injection](./threats/insecure_platform_channel_-_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:** The communication channel between the MAUI application's .NET code and platform-specific native code (using platform channels or platform invocation) is implemented insecurely. An attacker, potentially through a compromised native library or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the communication mechanism itself, could inject malicious code or manipulate data during transmission. This could lead to code injection on either the .NET or native side of the application due to improper serialization, lack of input validation, or insecure channel design within MAUI's interop layer.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation, complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying device, data breaches through manipulation of transmitted data.
*   **MAUI Component Affected:** Platform Channels, Platform Invocation (P/Invoke), Inter-Process Communication within MAUI
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Serialization and Deserialization:** Implement secure serialization and deserialization mechanisms for all data exchanged through platform channels. Avoid using insecure serialization formats that are prone to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Robust Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for all data received from platform channels in both the .NET and native code to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Minimize Sensitive Data Transmission:** Reduce the amount of sensitive data transmitted through platform channels. If sensitive data must be transmitted, ensure it is properly encrypted.
    *   **Encrypt Platform Channel Communication:** Encrypt sensitive data transmitted through platform channels to protect confidentiality and integrity during transit.
    *   **Security Code Reviews of Platform Channel Implementation:** Conduct thorough security code reviews specifically focusing on the implementation of platform channel communication, data handling, and security controls within the MAUI application.
