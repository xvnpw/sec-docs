# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for dotnet/maui

## Mitigation Strategy: [Platform-Specific Security Testing](./mitigation_strategies/platform-specific_security_testing.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Platform-Specific Security Testing
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Target Platforms:** Define all platforms your MAUI application supports (iOS, Android, Windows, macOS).
        2.  **Establish Testing Environments:** Set up testing environments for each platform (devices, emulators/simulators).
        3.  **Utilize Platform-Specific Tools:** Use security tools tailored to each platform (static/dynamic analyzers, penetration testing tools).
        4.  **Focus on Platform-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Prioritize testing for vulnerabilities unique to each OS (iOS sandbox escapes, Android intent issues, Windows privilege escalation, macOS bypasses).
        5.  **Document and Remediate:** Document findings and prioritize remediation based on severity and platform impact.
        6.  **Integrate into CI/CD:** Include platform-specific security testing in your CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Platform-Specific Vulnerabilities (High Severity): Exploits unique to an OS leading to data leaks, unauthorized access, or code execution.
        *   Inconsistent Security Posture (Medium Severity): Security variations across platforms leading to weaker security on some.
    *   **Impact:** Significantly reduces platform-specific vulnerability risks and ensures consistent security across platforms.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic functional tests across platforms exist in CI/CD. Dedicated platform security testing is missing.
        *   *Location:* CI/CD pipeline has functional tests, lacks platform-specific security stages.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Dedicated security testing stages per platform in CI/CD. Integration of platform-specific security tools. Specialized platform security expertise.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure P/Invoke Usage](./mitigation_strategies/secure_pinvoke_usage.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Secure Practices for Platform Invoke (P/Invoke)
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Minimize P/Invoke Usage:** Reduce reliance on P/Invoke, use MAUI/.NET libraries if possible.
        2.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Rigorously validate and sanitize inputs *before* P/Invoke calls to prevent injection attacks.
        3.  **Output Validation:** Validate and sanitize data received *from* native code after P/Invoke calls.
        4.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for P/Invoke calls to prevent unexpected behavior and security issues.
        5.  **Security Reviews:** Conduct security reviews specifically for P/Invoke implementations, focusing on data flow and vulnerabilities.
        6.  **Principle of Least Privilege (Native Code):** If using custom native libraries, ensure they have minimal privileges and follow secure native coding practices.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Injection Vulnerabilities (High Severity): SQL Injection, Command Injection, Buffer Overflows via insecure data handling at managed-native boundary.
        *   Data Corruption/Unexpected Behavior (Medium Severity): Incorrect data to native code causing crashes, data corruption, potentially exploitable for DoS.
    *   **Impact:** Significantly reduces injection risks and data integrity issues from P/Invoke. Enhances stability and security when interacting with native components.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic input validation exists in some areas, but security-focused validation for P/Invoke is inconsistent. Error handling for P/Invoke is present but may lack security focus.
        *   *Location:* Input validation in some UI fields, not specifically for P/Invoke data exchange.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Systematic input/output validation for all P/Invoke calls. Dedicated security reviews of P/Invoke. Robust error handling for security in P/Invoke interactions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [NuGet Package Security Management](./mitigation_strategies/nuget_package_security_management.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Robust NuGet Package Security Management
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Integrate an SCA tool to scan NuGet dependencies for vulnerabilities in MAUI projects.
        2.  **Vulnerability Database Integration:** Ensure SCA uses up-to-date vulnerability databases (NVD).
        3.  **Automated Dependency Scanning:** Automate NuGet scanning in CI/CD for early vulnerability detection in MAUI projects.
        4.  **Prioritize Vulnerability Remediation:** Process to prioritize and fix vulnerabilities based on severity and exploitability in MAUI dependencies.
        5.  **Package Source Control:** Use reputable NuGet sources. Consider private feeds for curated packages in MAUI projects.
        6.  **Regular Updates:** Keep NuGet packages updated in MAUI projects. Regularly review and update dependencies for security patches.
        7.  **Dependency Review:** Periodically review NuGet dependencies in MAUI projects, remove unnecessary/outdated packages.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Vulnerable Dependencies (High Severity): Exploitable vulnerabilities in third-party NuGet packages used in MAUI apps.
        *   Supply Chain Attacks (Medium Severity): Compromised/malicious NuGet packages in MAUI dependencies, leading to backdoors/malware.
    *   **Impact:** Significantly reduces risks from vulnerable NuGet packages in MAUI apps. Proactively manages dependency-related risks.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Developers aware of updates, occasional manual updates. No automated SCA or systematic dependency management for MAUI projects.
        *   *Location:* Manual package updates during bug fixes or when prompted.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** SCA tool in CI/CD for MAUI projects. Automated vulnerability scanning and reporting for NuGet. Formal process for dependency review, updates, and remediation in MAUI projects.

## Mitigation Strategy: [WebView Security Hardening](./mitigation_strategies/webview_security_hardening.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement WebView Security Hardening
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Minimize WebView Usage:** Reduce/eliminate WebView use in MAUI apps if possible. Consider native UI or custom rendering.
        2.  **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all input loaded into WebView in MAUI apps, especially from external/user sources. Prevent script injection.
        3.  **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Disable non-essential WebView features in MAUI apps (JavaScript execution if not needed, file access, restrict navigation).
        4.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers for WebView content in MAUI apps to mitigate XSS by controlling resource sources.
        5.  **Secure Communication (HTTPS):** Ensure WebView content in MAUI apps is loaded over HTTPS to protect data in transit.
        6.  **WebView Updates:** Keep WebView component updated in MAUI apps. Update MAUI framework and platform SDKs for WebView security patches.
        7.  **JavaScript Bridge Security (If used):** Secure JavaScript bridges in MAUI apps. Validate data exchanged through bridges.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity): Script injection in WebView in MAUI apps, leading to data theft, session hijacking, or defacement.
        *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Medium Severity): If WebView content in MAUI apps is HTTP, attackers can intercept/modify communication.
        *   Code Execution (Medium to High Severity): Attackers executing code within MAUI app context via WebView vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Significantly reduces XSS and web-based vulnerabilities in MAUI WebView components. Enhances security of displayed content.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. WebView used for dynamic content, but security hardening (CSP, JavaScript disabling, sanitization) is missing in MAUI apps. HTTPS used, but further WebView security configurations are absent.
        *   *Location:* WebView for dynamic help and external links in MAUI app.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** CSP headers for WebView content in MAUI apps. Disabling unnecessary WebView features. Input sanitization for WebView content. Regular security audits of WebView configurations in MAUI apps.
