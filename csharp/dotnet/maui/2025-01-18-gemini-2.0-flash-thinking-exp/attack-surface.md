# Attack Surface Analysis for dotnet/maui

## Attack Surface: [Platform-Specific Renderer Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/platform-specific_renderer_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities within the underlying native UI rendering components (e.g., UIKit on iOS, Android View system) that are used by MAUI's abstraction layer.
*   **How MAUI Contributes:** MAUI relies on these platform-specific renderers to display UI elements. Bugs or vulnerabilities in these native components can be indirectly exposed through MAUI.
*   **Example:** A specially crafted image or text input could trigger a buffer overflow or crash within the native rendering engine, leading to a denial-of-service.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential for remote code execution if the vulnerability is severe enough.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the target platform's operating system and SDK updated to receive security patches for the native rendering components.
    *   Thoroughly test the application with various inputs and data formats to identify potential rendering issues.
    *   Consider using MAUI controls that have been rigorously tested and are less likely to expose underlying platform vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Native API Interop](./attack_surfaces/insecure_native_api_interop.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from the interaction between MAUI's .NET code and platform-specific native APIs. This includes incorrect data marshalling, use of insecure APIs, or lack of proper validation.
*   **How MAUI Contributes:** MAUI provides mechanisms to call native platform APIs. If developers use these mechanisms incorrectly or call inherently insecure APIs, it introduces risk.
*   **Example:** Passing unsanitized user input directly to a native API that expects a specific format, leading to a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issue.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, data corruption, potential for privilege escalation or remote code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review and validate all data passed to native APIs.
    *   Use secure and up-to-date native APIs. Avoid deprecated or known vulnerable APIs.
    *   Implement proper error handling and boundary checks when interacting with native code.
    *   Consider using MAUI's built-in abstractions where possible to minimize direct native API calls.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure WebView Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_webview_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities stemming from improper configuration of the WebView control used by MAUI to display web content. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) or other web-related attacks.
*   **How MAUI Contributes:** MAUI integrates WebView controls for displaying web content. Developers are responsible for configuring these WebViews securely.
*   **Example:** Disabling Content Security Policy (CSP) in the WebView, allowing malicious JavaScript injected into a loaded webpage to access sensitive data or perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, session hijacking, execution of arbitrary JavaScript within the application's context.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable and properly configure Content Security Policy (CSP) for WebViews.
    *   Sanitize and validate any data passed to the WebView.
    *   Avoid loading untrusted or dynamically generated web content in the WebView if possible.
    *   Ensure the WebView is running with the least necessary privileges.
    *   Keep the underlying WebView component (platform-specific) updated.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Communication between WebView and Native Code](./attack_surfaces/insecure_communication_between_webview_and_native_code.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the communication channel between the WebView and the native part of the MAUI application, often using JavaScript bridges.
*   **How MAUI Contributes:** MAUI facilitates communication between the WebView and native code. If this communication is not secured, it can be exploited.
*   **Example:** A malicious script running in the WebView could call a native function with unexpected or malicious parameters, leading to unintended actions or data breaches.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, execution of arbitrary native code, data manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully design and secure the communication interface between the WebView and native code.
    *   Validate all data received from the WebView before processing it in native code.
    *   Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for communication between the WebView and native code.
    *   Avoid exposing sensitive native functionalities directly to the WebView.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable NuGet Package Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_nuget_package_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Introduction of security vulnerabilities through the use of outdated or compromised NuGet packages that are dependencies of the MAUI application.
*   **How MAUI Contributes:** MAUI applications rely on NuGet packages for various functionalities. If these packages have vulnerabilities, the application inherits them.
*   **Example:** Using an older version of a JSON parsing library with a known buffer overflow vulnerability, which could be exploited by providing a specially crafted JSON payload.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update NuGet packages to their latest stable versions.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
    *   Carefully evaluate the security posture of third-party libraries before including them in the project.
    *   Consider using Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Local Data Storage](./attack_surfaces/insecure_local_data_storage.md)

*   **Description:** Improper storage of sensitive data on the device's local storage without adequate protection.
*   **How MAUI Contributes:** MAUI provides access to platform-specific storage mechanisms. Developers need to use these mechanisms securely.
*   **Example:** Storing user credentials or API keys in plain text in shared preferences or local files, making them accessible to malicious apps or attackers with physical access.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, potential for account compromise or unauthorized access to services.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid storing sensitive data locally if possible.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data before storing it locally using platform-specific secure storage mechanisms (e.g., KeyStore on Android, Keychain on iOS).
    *   Implement proper access controls for local storage.
    *   Consider using MAUI's secure storage APIs if available.
