# Threat Model Analysis for dotnet/maui

## Threat: [Exploitation of Platform-Specific API Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_platform-specific_api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could leverage vulnerabilities in the underlying native platform APIs (Android, iOS, macOS, Windows) that are *exposed through MAUI's abstraction layer*. This might involve crafting specific inputs or calls that exploit weaknesses in how these APIs handle data or requests. For example, on Android, a malicious application could craft a specific Intent to trigger unintended actions in the MAUI application. On iOS, a specially crafted URL scheme could be used to bypass security checks. *This threat is directly related to MAUI because MAUI provides the bridge to these native APIs.*
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to device resources, data leakage, application crashes, or even arbitrary code execution on the device, depending on the severity of the underlying platform vulnerability.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Platform Services (e.g., `Microsoft.Maui.ApplicationModel.Platform`, specific platform implementations of MAUI interfaces).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with platform-specific security advisories and ensure the development environment uses the latest SDKs and tools.
        *   Carefully validate and sanitize all data received from platform APIs.
        *   Implement robust error handling to prevent unexpected behavior when interacting with platform APIs.
        *   Follow platform-specific secure coding guidelines.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in WebView](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_webview.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a WebView component by exploiting insufficient input sanitization. This could involve injecting scripts through user-generated content, compromised external data sources, or manipulated URLs. Upon rendering, the injected script executes within the user's context, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, redirecting the user to malicious sites, or performing actions on their behalf. *This threat is directly related to MAUI because MAUI provides the `WebView` control for embedding web content.*
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of user accounts, data theft, redirection to phishing sites, unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user, defacement of the application's UI within the WebView.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Microsoft.Maui.Controls.WebView` control.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and output encoding/escaping for all data displayed within the WebView.
        *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the WebView can load resources and execute scripts.
        *   Avoid using `WebView.EvaluateJavaScript` with unsanitized user input.
        *   Keep the underlying WebView engine (platform-specific) updated to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exploitation of .NET Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of__net_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides maliciously crafted serialized data that, when deserialized by the MAUI application, leads to unintended consequences, such as arbitrary code execution. This can occur if the application deserializes data from untrusted sources without proper validation. *While not exclusive to MAUI, the framework's reliance on .NET makes it a relevant concern.*
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the device, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application and the user's data.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Any part of the application that uses .NET serialization/deserialization, including data storage mechanisms, network communication, and inter-process communication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources.
        *   If deserialization from untrusted sources is necessary, use secure deserialization techniques and carefully validate the data before and after deserialization.
        *   Consider using alternative data formats like JSON, which are generally less prone to deserialization vulnerabilities.
        *   Keep the .NET runtime updated with the latest security patches.

## Threat: [Insecure Local Data Storage](./threats/insecure_local_data_storage.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to sensitive data stored locally by the MAUI application due to inadequate security measures. This could involve accessing unencrypted files, shared preferences, or other storage mechanisms. On rooted or jailbroken devices, this risk is amplified. *This is directly relevant to MAUI as it provides APIs for local storage, and developers need to use them securely across platforms.*
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive user data, including credentials, personal information, and application-specific data.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `Microsoft.Maui.Storage` and platform-specific storage implementations (e.g., Android SharedPreferences, iOS Keychain).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Encrypt sensitive data before storing it locally. Utilize platform-specific secure storage mechanisms like the Android Keystore or iOS Keychain.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive data unnecessarily.
        *   Implement appropriate file permissions to restrict access to local data.
        *   Consider using data protection APIs provided by the operating system.
