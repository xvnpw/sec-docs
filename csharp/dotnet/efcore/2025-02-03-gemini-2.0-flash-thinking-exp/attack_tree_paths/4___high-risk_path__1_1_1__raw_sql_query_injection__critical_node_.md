### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.1.1. Execute Malicious SQL via `FromSqlRaw`, `ExecuteSqlRaw`

#### 4.1. Description of Vulnerability

The core vulnerability lies in the misuse of EF Core's raw SQL query execution methods (`FromSqlRaw`, `ExecuteSqlRaw`, and `SqlQuery`) when developers directly embed user-supplied input into the SQL query string without proper sanitization or parameterization.

EF Core provides these methods to allow developers to execute SQL queries that are not directly translatable by EF Core's LINQ provider. While powerful, they bypass EF Core's built-in protection against SQL injection if not used carefully.

When user input is concatenated directly into a raw SQL query string, an attacker can manipulate this input to inject malicious SQL code. This injected code can then be executed by the database server with the same privileges as the application's database connection.

#### 4.2. Attack Vectors & Exploitation

**Attack Vector:** User-controlled input fields that are used to construct raw SQL queries via `FromSqlRaw`, `ExecuteSqlRaw`, or `SqlQuery`. Common examples include:

*   **Input Fields in Web Forms or APIs:** Text boxes, dropdowns, search bars, API parameters, etc., that are used to filter, sort, or query data.
*   **URL Parameters:** Data passed in the URL query string that is then used to build SQL queries.
*   **Cookies:** Less common, but if cookie data is used to construct SQL queries, it can also be an attack vector.
*   **Headers:** Similarly, HTTP headers could be exploited if their values are incorporated into raw SQL queries.

**Exploitation Steps:**

1.  **Identify Vulnerable Input:** The attacker first identifies input fields or data sources that are used to construct raw SQL queries within the application. This often involves analyzing the application's code or observing its behavior.
2.  **Craft Malicious SQL Payload:** The attacker crafts a malicious SQL payload designed to exploit the vulnerability. This payload is typically injected into the identified input field. Common SQL injection techniques include:
    *   **SQL Injection Payloads for Authentication Bypass:**  Modifying `WHERE` clauses to always evaluate to true, bypassing authentication checks.
    *   **Data Exfiltration Payloads:**  Using `UNION SELECT` statements to retrieve data from other tables or columns that the application is not intended to access.
    *   **Data Manipulation Payloads:**  Using `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statements to modify or delete data in the database.
    *   **Database Structure Manipulation Payloads:**  Using `CREATE`, `ALTER`, or `DROP` statements (if permissions allow) to modify the database schema.
    *   **Denial of Service Payloads:**  Executing resource-intensive queries or commands to overload the database server.
3.  **Inject Payload:** The attacker submits the crafted payload through the vulnerable input field.
4.  **Execute Malicious SQL:** The application, without proper sanitization or parameterization, concatenates the malicious payload into the raw SQL query and executes it against the database.
5.  **Achieve Malicious Objective:** The injected SQL code is executed, allowing the attacker to achieve their objective, such as data theft, data manipulation, or system compromise.

#### 4.3. Example Scenario: Authentication Bypass

Consider a login functionality that uses `FromSqlRaw` to authenticate users based on username:

```csharp
public async Task<User> AuthenticateUserRawSql(string username)
{
    using (var context = _contextFactory.CreateDbContext())
    {
        var sql = $"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '{username}'"; // Vulnerable!
        var user = await context.Users.FromSqlRaw(sql).FirstOrDefaultAsync();
        return user;
    }
}
```

**Vulnerable Code:** The `username` variable is directly concatenated into the SQL query string.

**Attack:** An attacker could provide the following username:

```
' OR '1'='1
```

**Resulting SQL Query (after concatenation):**

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '' OR '1'='1'
```

**Explanation:** The injected payload `' OR '1'='1` modifies the `WHERE` clause. `'1'='1'` is always true.  Therefore, the query effectively becomes `SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '' OR TRUE`, which will return the first user in the `Users` table (or potentially all users depending on the database and data). This bypasses the intended username-based authentication.

A more sophisticated attacker could use `UNION SELECT` to retrieve sensitive data or `DROP TABLE` (if permissions allow) for more severe attacks.

#### 4.4. Impact

The impact of successful Raw SQL Injection via `FromSqlRaw`, `ExecuteSqlRaw` is **Critical**. It can lead to:

*   **Full Database Compromise:** Attackers can gain complete control over the database server, potentially accessing all data, including sensitive information like passwords, financial records, and personal data.
*   **Data Breach and Data Exfiltration:**  Attackers can steal sensitive data, leading to significant financial and reputational damage, as well as legal repercussions (e.g., GDPR violations).
*   **Data Manipulation and Integrity Loss:** Attackers can modify or delete data, leading to incorrect application behavior, data corruption, and loss of trust in the system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can execute resource-intensive queries that overload the database server, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, attackers might be able to escalate their privileges within the database or even the operating system if the database server is misconfigured.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Compromised databases can sometimes be used as a pivot point to attack other systems within the network.

#### 4.5. Technical Details & Code Examples

**Vulnerable Code Pattern:**

```csharp
// Vulnerable pattern - Direct string concatenation of user input into raw SQL
string userInput = GetUserInput();
string sqlQuery = $"SELECT * FROM Table WHERE Column = '{userInput}'";
context.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw(sqlQuery); // Or FromSqlRaw, SqlQuery
```

**Secure Code Pattern - Parameterization:**

```csharp
// Secure pattern - Using parameterized queries
string userInput = GetUserInput();
string sqlQuery = "SELECT * FROM Table WHERE Column = {0}";
context.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw(sqlQuery, userInput); // Or FromSqlRaw, SqlQuery
```

**EF Core Parameterization Methods:**

*   **`FromSqlRaw(string sql, params object[] parameters)`:**  For queries that return entities.
*   **`ExecuteSqlRaw(string sql, params object[] parameters)`:** For executing non-query SQL commands (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DDL).
*   **`SqlQuery<T>(string sql, params object[] parameters)`:** For queries that return scalar or complex types that are not entities.

**Benefits of Parameterization:**

*   **Prevents SQL Injection:** Parameters are treated as data, not as executable SQL code. The database driver handles escaping and quoting, ensuring that user input cannot alter the query structure.
*   **Improved Performance:** Parameterized queries can be cached and reused by the database, potentially improving performance, especially for frequently executed queries.
*   **Code Readability and Maintainability:** Parameterized queries are generally easier to read and understand compared to complex string concatenation.

#### 4.6. Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate Raw SQL Injection vulnerabilities when using EF Core's raw SQL methods, implement the following strategies:

1.  **Always Use Parameterized Queries:**  **This is the primary and most effective mitigation.**  Whenever using `FromSqlRaw`, `ExecuteSqlRaw`, or `SqlQuery`, always use parameterized queries. Pass user input as parameters instead of concatenating them directly into the SQL string. EF Core handles parameterization securely.

2.  **Input Validation and Sanitization (Defense in Depth, but not sufficient alone):** While parameterization is crucial, input validation and sanitization can provide an additional layer of defense.
    *   **Validate Input Data Type and Format:** Ensure that user input conforms to the expected data type and format (e.g., integer, email, date).
    *   **Sanitize Input (Carefully):**  If absolutely necessary to use string concatenation for dynamic query building (which should be avoided if possible), carefully sanitize user input by escaping special characters that could be used for SQL injection. **However, relying solely on sanitization is risky and error-prone. Parameterization is always preferred.**

3.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Database Accounts:**  Grant database accounts used by the application only the minimum necessary privileges required for its functionality. Avoid using database accounts with `db_owner` or similar overly permissive roles. This limits the potential damage if SQL injection occurs.

4.  **Code Review and Security Audits:**  Conduct regular code reviews and security audits to identify potential instances of raw SQL usage and ensure that parameterized queries are being used correctly. Use static analysis tools to help identify potential vulnerabilities.

5.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF can help detect and block common SQL injection attempts by analyzing HTTP requests and responses. However, WAFs are not a substitute for secure coding practices and should be considered a supplementary security measure.

6.  **Regular Security Testing (Penetration Testing):**  Perform regular penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify vulnerabilities, including SQL injection flaws, in your application.

7.  **Educate Developers:** Train developers on secure coding practices, specifically regarding SQL injection prevention and the proper use of EF Core's raw SQL methods and parameterization.

#### 4.7. Detection Methods

Detecting Raw SQL Injection attempts can be challenging, but several methods can be employed:

1.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Logs and Alerts:** WAFs can often detect and log suspicious SQL injection patterns in HTTP requests. Monitor WAF logs for alerts related to SQL injection.

2.  **Database Audit Logs:** Enable database audit logging to track database activity, including SQL queries executed by the application. Analyze audit logs for unusual or malicious SQL queries. Look for patterns like:
    *   Queries containing suspicious keywords (e.g., `UNION`, `SELECT * FROM`, `DROP TABLE`, `;`).
    *   Queries originating from unexpected sources or with unusual parameters.
    *   Failed login attempts followed by database queries.

3.  **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Network-based IDS/IPS systems can monitor network traffic for malicious patterns, including SQL injection attempts.

4.  **Application Logging:** Implement comprehensive application logging to record details about user requests, database queries, and application behavior. Analyze application logs for anomalies that might indicate SQL injection attempts.

5.  **Error Monitoring:** Monitor application error logs for database errors that might be caused by invalid SQL syntax or attempts to inject malicious code.

6.  **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems:**  SIEM systems can aggregate logs and security events from various sources (WAFs, databases, applications, IDS/IPS) and provide centralized monitoring and alerting for potential SQL injection attacks.

7.  **Code Analysis Tools (Static and Dynamic):**
    *   **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) tools:** Can analyze source code to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities by detecting patterns of insecure raw SQL usage.
    *   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools:** Can perform black-box testing of the application to identify SQL injection vulnerabilities by sending malicious payloads and observing the application's response.

#### 4.8. Risk Assessment

*   **Likelihood:**  **Medium to High** - If developers are unaware of the risks or best practices when using raw SQL in EF Core, or if code reviews are not thorough, the likelihood of introducing this vulnerability is significant.  The ease of use of raw SQL methods can sometimes lead developers to choose them over safer alternatives without fully understanding the security implications.
*   **Severity:** **Critical** - As detailed in the Impact section, the potential consequences of successful exploitation are severe, ranging from data breaches to complete system compromise.

**Overall Risk Level:** **High to Critical** - Due to the potentially devastating impact and the moderate to high likelihood of occurrence if secure coding practices are not strictly followed, the overall risk associated with Raw SQL Injection via `FromSqlRaw`, `ExecuteSqlRaw` is considered **High to Critical**.

#### 4.9. Conclusion

Raw SQL Injection via `FromSqlRaw`, `ExecuteSqlRaw`, and `SqlQuery` in EF Core applications represents a critical security vulnerability.  The misuse of these powerful methods by directly concatenating user input into SQL query strings can have catastrophic consequences.

**The key takeaway is that developers must absolutely avoid string concatenation when building raw SQL queries in EF Core and instead consistently utilize parameterized queries.**  Combined with other security best practices like input validation, least privilege, and regular security testing, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of this dangerous vulnerability and protect their applications and data.  Education and awareness among developers are paramount to prevent this common and high-impact attack vector.
