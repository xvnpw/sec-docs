# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Entity Framework Core (EF Core) project is an open-source, lightweight, extensible, and cross-platform version of the popular Entity Framework data access technology. EF Core serves as an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), enabling .NET developers to work with databases using .NET objects, eliminating the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write.

Business priorities and goals for EF Core are:
- Provide a robust and performant ORM solution for .NET developers.
- Enable efficient and productive database interactions within .NET applications.
- Support a wide range of database systems and platforms.
- Maintain a high level of code quality, stability, and reliability.
- Foster a strong community and encourage contributions to the project.
- Ensure long-term maintainability and evolution of the framework.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Data integrity and consistency: Incorrect mappings or bugs in EF Core could lead to data corruption or inconsistencies in the database.
- Performance bottlenecks: Inefficient queries generated by EF Core or performance issues within the framework itself could negatively impact application performance.
- Security vulnerabilities: Security flaws in EF Core could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to data or compromise the application.
- Compatibility issues: Incompatibility with certain database systems, .NET versions, or other libraries could limit the usability of EF Core.
- Community dependency risk: Over-reliance on community contributions without sufficient maintainer oversight could lead to instability or lack of direction.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Open-source development model with public code repository on GitHub. This allows for community review and identification of potential vulnerabilities. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
- security control: Code reviews are performed for pull requests. Implemented in: GitHub pull request process.
- security control: Automated testing including unit tests and integration tests. Implemented in: GitHub Actions workflows.
- security control: Static analysis tools and code linters are likely used during development (though not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it's a common practice for .NET projects). Implemented in: Development environment and potentially CI pipelines.
- security control: Dependency scanning to identify vulnerable dependencies (common practice in modern development). Implemented in: Potentially CI pipelines or dependency management tools.

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: As an open-source project, the project relies on community contributions, which may introduce vulnerabilities if not properly vetted.
- accepted risk: Bugs and vulnerabilities may exist in the code despite testing and code reviews, as with any software project.
- accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities in underlying database providers or database systems are outside the scope of EF Core's direct control.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement a formal security vulnerability disclosure and response process.
- security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of EF Core, especially before major releases.
- security control: Integrate SAST (Static Application Security Testing) and DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) tools into the CI/CD pipeline.
- security control: Implement dependency vulnerability scanning and automated updates of dependencies.
- security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for developers using EF Core to build secure applications.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: EF Core itself does not handle application-level authentication. Authentication is the responsibility of the application using EF Core and the underlying database system. EF Core should be designed to seamlessly integrate with various authentication mechanisms provided by databases.
- Authorization: EF Core should facilitate the implementation of authorization logic within applications. It should not bypass database-level authorization. Developers should be able to use EF Core to query and manipulate data in accordance with application-specific authorization rules and database permissions.
- Input validation: EF Core should encourage and facilitate input validation to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection). This includes parameterized queries, input sanitization, and validation of data types and formats. EF Core should not introduce vulnerabilities through its query building or data handling mechanisms.
- Cryptography: EF Core should support the use of cryptography for sensitive data at rest and in transit. This includes features for data encryption at the database level and secure communication protocols. EF Core itself might not implement cryptographic algorithms, but it should be compatible with and encourage the use of secure cryptographic practices in applications.

- On-premises servers (Windows/Linux)
- Cloud platforms (Azure, AWS, GCP)
- Containerized environments (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Serverless environments (Azure Functions, AWS Lambda)

Let's consider a common cloud deployment scenario using Azure App Service and Azure SQL Database.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:
- Secure and reliable data access for .NET applications. EF Core is fundamental for many .NET applications that interact with databases. Its reliability and security directly impact the functionality and security of those applications.
- Efficient .NET application development. EF Core aims to simplify and speed up data access development. Issues with EF Core can hinder developer productivity and project timelines.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Application data stored in databases. The sensitivity of this data varies greatly depending on the application domain. It can range from publicly available information to highly sensitive personal or financial data. EF Core is used to access and manipulate this data, so its security is crucial for protecting data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Intellectual property in the EF Core codebase itself. While open-source, the EF Core codebase represents significant development effort and expertise. Protecting its integrity and preventing unauthorized modifications is important for the project's long-term health and trustworthiness.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- What specific SAST and DAST tools are currently used in the EF Core build process, if any?
- Is there a formal security vulnerability disclosure and response process in place for EF Core?
- Are regular security audits or penetration testing conducted for EF Core?
- What dependency scanning tools and processes are used to manage dependencies and identify vulnerabilities?
- Are there specific security guidelines or best practices documented for developers using EF Core?

Assumptions:
- The EF Core project follows secure coding practices during development.
- Code reviews are conducted with security considerations in mind.
- Automated testing includes some level of security testing (e.g., testing for common injection vulnerabilities).
