# Deep Analysis: Untrusted Input to String.Format() in EF Core (SQL Injection)

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the attack vector represented by using untrusted input within `String.Format()` (or string interpolation) when constructing SQL queries in an EF Core application.  We aim to:

*   Understand the precise mechanisms by which this vulnerability can be exploited.
*   Identify common coding patterns that introduce this vulnerability.
*   Assess the potential impact of a successful exploit.
*   Provide concrete examples of vulnerable and secure code.
*   Recommend robust mitigation strategies and best practices.
*   Discuss detection methods for identifying this vulnerability in existing code.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Target Framework:** .NET applications using Entity Framework Core (EF Core).

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.2

### 2.1 Vulnerability Explanation

The core issue lies in the misuse of `String.Format()` (or its equivalent, string interpolation, which compiles down to `String.Format()`) to construct SQL queries that incorporate untrusted user input.  `FromSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlRaw` in EF Core allow developers to execute raw SQL queries against the database.  When untrusted input is directly concatenated into the SQL string, it creates an opportunity for SQL injection.

**Example (Vulnerable):**

```csharp
public IActionResult GetProductsByName(string productName)
{
    using var context = new MyDbContext();
    // VULNERABLE: productName is directly embedded in the SQL string.
    var products = context.Products.FromSqlRaw($"SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name = '{productName}'").ToList();
    return Ok(products);
}
```

In this example, the `productName` parameter, which is likely sourced from user input (e.g., a search box), is directly inserted into the SQL query string.  This is *extremely dangerous*.

### 2.2 Exploit Mechanics

An attacker can manipulate the `productName` input to inject malicious SQL code.  Here's a breakdown of how this works:

1.  **Attacker Input:** The attacker provides a crafted input string instead of a legitimate product name.

2.  **String Concatenation:** The application uses `String.Format()` (or string interpolation) to combine the attacker's input with the base SQL query.

3.  **Modified SQL Query:** The resulting SQL query is no longer what the developer intended.  It now contains the attacker's injected code.

4.  **Database Execution:** EF Core sends the modified SQL query to the database server.

5.  **Malicious Code Execution:** The database server executes the entire query, including the attacker's injected code.

**Example Exploits:**

*   **Data Extraction (UNION-based injection):**

    ```
    productName = "'; SELECT * FROM Users; --"
    ```

    Resulting SQL: `SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name = ''; SELECT * FROM Users; --'`

    This would return *all* products (because `Name = ''` is likely false for most products) *and* all users from the `Users` table.  The `--` comments out the rest of the original query.

*   **Data Modification (UPDATE):**

    ```
    productName = "'; UPDATE Products SET Price = 0; --"
    ```

    Resulting SQL: `SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name = ''; UPDATE Products SET Price = 0; --'`

    This would set the price of *all* products to 0.

*   **Data Deletion (DELETE):**

    ```
    productName = "'; DROP TABLE Products; --"
    ```
    Resulting SQL: `SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name = ''; DROP TABLE Products; --'`
    This would delete the entire `Products` table.

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    ```
    productName = "'; WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10'; --"
    ```
    Resulting SQL: `SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name = ''; WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10'; --'`
    This would cause a 10-second delay, potentially making the application unresponsive.

*  **Bypass Authentication**
    ```
    productName = "' OR '1'='1"
    ```
    Resulting SQL: `SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name = '' OR '1'='1'`
    This would return all products.

### 2.3 Code Examples

**Vulnerable (String Interpolation):**

```csharp
public IActionResult GetProductsByName(string productName)
{
    using var context = new MyDbContext();
    // VULNERABLE: productName is directly embedded in the SQL string.
    var products = context.Products.FromSqlRaw($"SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name = '{productName}'").ToList();
    return Ok(products);
}
```

**Secure (Parameterized Query):**

```csharp
public IActionResult GetProductsByName(string productName)
{
    using var context = new MyDbContext();
    // SECURE: productName is passed as a parameter.
    var products = context.Products.FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name = {0}", productName).ToList();
    return Ok(products);
}
```
Or using `FormattableString`:
```csharp
public IActionResult GetProductsByName(string productName)
{
    using var context = new MyDbContext();
    // SECURE: productName is passed as a parameter.
    FormattableString query = $"SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name = {productName}";
    var products = context.Products.FromSqlInterpolated(query).ToList();
    return Ok(products);
}
```

**Explanation of Secure Code:**

In the secure example, `{0}` acts as a placeholder.  The `productName` variable is passed as a *separate argument* to `FromSqlRaw`.  EF Core then handles the proper escaping and parameterization of the value, preventing SQL injection.  The database driver treats `productName` as a *value*, not as part of the SQL code itself. The `FromSqlInterpolated` method is specifically designed to handle string interpolation securely by treating interpolated values as parameters.

### 2.4 Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful SQL injection attack can be catastrophic:

*   **Data Breach:**  Attackers can steal sensitive data, including user credentials, personal information, financial data, and intellectual property.
*   **Data Modification:**  Attackers can alter data, leading to financial losses, reputational damage, and legal liabilities.
*   **Data Deletion:**  Attackers can delete entire databases or specific records, causing significant disruption and data loss.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers can make the application unavailable by injecting queries that consume excessive resources or cause errors.
*   **System Compromise:**  In some cases, SQL injection can be used to gain access to the underlying operating system, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands.
*   **Regulatory Violations:**  Data breaches can lead to violations of regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA, resulting in hefty fines and legal consequences.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the reputation of the organization, leading to loss of customer trust and business.

### 2.5 Mitigation Strategies

The primary mitigation strategy is to **never directly embed untrusted input into SQL queries**.  Here are the recommended approaches:

1.  **Parameterized Queries (Primary Defense):**  Use parameterized queries with `FromSqlRaw` or `FromSqlInterpolated`, as shown in the secure code example above.  This is the most effective and recommended approach.

2.  **Input Validation (Defense in Depth):**  While *not* a substitute for parameterized queries, input validation can provide an additional layer of defense.  Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and lengths.  However, *never* rely solely on input validation to prevent SQL injection.  It's too easy to miss edge cases or for validation logic to be bypassed.

3.  **Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the database user account used by the application has the minimum necessary privileges.  This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause even if they successfully inject SQL code.  For example, the application user should not have `DROP TABLE` privileges unless absolutely necessary.

4.  **Stored Procedures (Alternative):**  Consider using stored procedures for complex queries.  Stored procedures can also be parameterized, providing a secure way to execute SQL logic. However, be cautious: stored procedures *can* be vulnerable to SQL injection if they themselves dynamically construct SQL queries using untrusted input.

5.  **ORM (Object-Relational Mapper):** Using the standard LINQ to Entities queries provided by EF Core is generally safe, as EF Core automatically parameterizes these queries. Avoid `FromSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlRaw` unless absolutely necessary.

6. **Escaping (Last Resort, Not Recommended):** Manually escaping user input is *highly discouraged*. It's error-prone and difficult to get right. If you *must* use string formatting and cannot use parameters for some reason, ensure you are using the database-specific escaping functions correctly. However, this is a fragile approach and should be avoided.

### 2.6 Detection Techniques

Several techniques can be used to detect this vulnerability:

1.  **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube, Roslyn analyzers, .NET security analyzers) to scan the codebase for potentially vulnerable code patterns.  These tools can identify instances where `String.Format()` or string interpolation is used with `FromSqlRaw` or `ExecuteSqlRaw`.

2.  **Code Reviews:**  Conduct thorough code reviews, paying close attention to how SQL queries are constructed.  Look for any instances where user input is directly concatenated into SQL strings.

3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Penetration Testing):**  Perform penetration testing, including attempts to inject malicious SQL code through user input fields.  This can help identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by static analysis or code reviews.

4.  **Database Query Monitoring:**  Monitor database queries for suspicious patterns or unexpected SQL code.  This can help detect ongoing attacks or identify vulnerabilities that have been exploited.

5. **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block SQL injection attempts by analyzing incoming HTTP requests.

### 2.7 Edge Cases and Considerations

*   **Database-Specific Syntax:**  The specific SQL injection payloads may vary depending on the database system being used (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL).  Attackers may need to tailor their payloads to the specific database syntax.

*   **Second-Order SQL Injection:**  This occurs when user input is stored in the database and later used in a vulnerable SQL query.  Even if the initial input is validated or escaped, it can still be vulnerable if it's later used in a query without proper parameterization.

*   **Blind SQL Injection:**  In blind SQL injection, the attacker doesn't directly see the results of their injected queries.  Instead, they infer information based on the application's behavior (e.g., response times, error messages).  This makes detection more challenging.

* **ORM Limitations:** While using LINQ to Entities is generally safe, complex queries or custom SQL functions might still introduce vulnerabilities. Always review the generated SQL to ensure it's properly parameterized.

## 3. Conclusion

The use of `String.Format()` or string interpolation with untrusted input in EF Core's `FromSqlRaw` or `ExecuteSqlRaw` methods creates a high-risk SQL injection vulnerability.  This vulnerability can have severe consequences, including data breaches, data modification, and system compromise.  The most effective mitigation strategy is to use parameterized queries consistently.  A combination of static analysis, code reviews, dynamic testing, and least privilege principles can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection in EF Core applications. Developers must prioritize secure coding practices and be vigilant in identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities.
