# Deep Analysis of EF Core SQL Injection Attack Path: `FromSqlRaw/ExecuteSqlRaw` with Untrusted Input

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the vulnerabilities associated with using `FromSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlRaw` methods in Entity Framework Core (EF Core) with untrusted input.  We aim to identify the specific risks, potential attack vectors, and effective mitigation strategies to prevent SQL injection attacks through this pathway.  This analysis will provide actionable recommendations for the development team to secure the application.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following:

*   **Target:**  Applications using the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` library (EF Core) for database interaction.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.1 FromSqlRaw/ExecuteSqlRaw with Untrusted Input

### 2.1 Threat Modeling and Attack Scenarios

The attack tree path highlights the core vulnerability: directly incorporating unsanitized user input into SQL queries executed via `FromSqlRaw` or `ExecuteSqlRaw`.  Here are some specific attack scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1: Data Exfiltration (Reading Sensitive Data)**

    *   **User Input:**  `'; SELECT * FROM Users; --`
    *   **Vulnerable Code:**
        ```csharp
        string userInput = Request.Query["search"]; // Untrusted input
        string query = $"SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name LIKE '%{userInput}%'";
        var products = _context.Products.FromSqlRaw(query).ToList();
        ```
    *   **Result:** The attacker bypasses the intended `LIKE` clause and retrieves all data from the `Users` table (or any other table they choose).

*   **Scenario 2: Data Modification (Unauthorized Updates)**

    *   **User Input:**  `'; UPDATE Users SET IsAdmin = 1 WHERE Username = 'attacker'; --`
    *   **Vulnerable Code:**
        ```csharp
        string userInput = Request.Form["productId"]; // Untrusted input
        string query = $"DELETE FROM Products WHERE ProductId = {userInput}";
        _context.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw(query);
        ```
    *   **Result:** The attacker gains administrative privileges by modifying the `Users` table.

*   **Scenario 3: Data Deletion (Denial of Service)**

    *   **User Input:**  `'; DROP TABLE Products; --`
    *   **Vulnerable Code:** (Same as Scenario 2)
    *   **Result:** The attacker deletes the entire `Products` table, causing a denial of service.

*   **Scenario 4: Command Execution (If Database Permissions Allow)**

    *   **User Input:** (Database-specific, e.g., for SQL Server) `'; EXEC xp_cmdshell 'net user attacker password123 /add'; --`
    *   **Vulnerable Code:** (Similar to previous examples)
    *   **Result:** The attacker executes arbitrary operating system commands on the database server, potentially compromising the entire system.  This is less common due to database permission restrictions, but still a critical risk if misconfigured.

*   **Scenario 5: Second-Order SQL Injection**
    * **User Input:** `' OR 1=1; --`
    * **Vulnerable Code (First Interaction - Storing the malicious input):**
        ```csharp
        string userInput = Request.Form["comment"];
        string query = $"INSERT INTO Comments (Text) VALUES ('{userInput}')";
        _context.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw(query);
        ```
    *   **Vulnerable Code (Second Interaction - Retrieving and using the malicious input):**
        ```csharp
        string query = "SELECT * FROM Comments WHERE Text LIKE '%" + commentText + "%'"; // commentText comes from the database
        var comments = _context.Comments.FromSqlRaw(query).ToList();
        ```
    * **Result:** The attacker's malicious input is stored in the database.  Later, when that data is retrieved and used in *another* `FromSqlRaw` or `ExecuteSqlRaw` call, the injection occurs. This highlights the importance of validating data *both* on input and output.

### 2.2 Code Review (Conceptual)

**Vulnerable Code (Illustrative):**

```csharp
public IActionResult SearchProducts(string searchTerm)
{
    // searchTerm is directly from user input (e.g., a query string parameter)
    string sql = $"SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name LIKE '%{searchTerm}%'";
    var products = _context.Products.FromSqlRaw(sql).ToList();
    return View(products);
}
```

**Secure Code (Using Parameterized Queries with `FormattableString`):**

```csharp
public IActionResult SearchProducts(string searchTerm)
{
    // Use FormattableString to automatically parameterize the query
    FormattableString sql = $"SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name LIKE '%{searchTerm}%'";
    var products = _context.Products.FromSqlInterpolated(sql).ToList();
    return View(products);
}
```

**Secure Code (Using Explicit `DbParameter` Objects):**

```csharp
public IActionResult SearchProducts(string searchTerm)
{
    var parameter = new SqlParameter("@searchTerm", "%" + searchTerm + "%");
    string sql = "SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name LIKE @searchTerm";
    var products = _context.Products.FromSqlRaw(sql, parameter).ToList();
    return View(products);
}
```

**Secure Code (Using `ExecuteSqlRaw` with Parameters):**

```csharp
public IActionResult DeleteProduct(int productId)
{
    // productId is assumed to come from user input (e.g., a route parameter)
    var parameter = new SqlParameter("@productId", productId);
    _context.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw("DELETE FROM Products WHERE ProductId = @productId", parameter);
    return RedirectToAction("Index");
}
```

### 2.3 Vulnerability Analysis

The core vulnerability lies in the way `FromSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlRaw` handle string input.  When a raw string containing user input is passed, EF Core *does not* automatically treat the user-provided portions as parameters.  Instead, it treats the entire string as a literal SQL command.  This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code by manipulating the input string.

The database server then executes the *entire* modified SQL command, including the attacker's injected code.  This is because the database server has no way of distinguishing between the intended SQL code and the attacker's injected code when it's all presented as a single string.

### 2.4 Mitigation Analysis

The primary and most effective mitigation is to **always use parameterized queries**.  Parameterized queries separate the SQL command structure from the data values.  The database driver (and EF Core) handle the proper escaping and quoting of the parameter values, preventing them from being interpreted as SQL code.

*   **`FormattableString` (Recommended):**  The `FromSqlInterpolated` method, used with a `FormattableString`, provides the most convenient and readable way to create parameterized queries in EF Core.  It leverages C# string interpolation, but under the hood, it generates `DbParameter` objects. This is the preferred approach.

*   **Explicit `DbParameter` Objects:**  This approach gives you the most control over the parameter creation, allowing you to specify data types, sizes, and other properties.  It's slightly more verbose but can be useful in specific scenarios.

*   **Input Validation (Defense in Depth):** While parameterized queries are the *primary* defense, input validation is a crucial *secondary* defense.  Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats, lengths, and character sets.  This can help prevent unexpected data from reaching the database, even if a vulnerability exists elsewhere.  However, *never* rely on input validation *alone* to prevent SQL injection.

*   **Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user account used by the application has only the necessary permissions.  Avoid using accounts with `db_owner` or other highly privileged roles.  This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause, even if they successfully exploit a SQL injection vulnerability.

*   **Stored Procedures (with Parameterized Calls):**  Using stored procedures *can* help, but *only* if the calls to the stored procedures are also parameterized.  If you concatenate user input into the stored procedure call, you're still vulnerable.

*   **Escaping/Encoding (Not Recommended):**  Manually escaping or encoding user input is *strongly discouraged*.  It's error-prone and difficult to get right.  Parameterized queries are a much more robust and reliable solution.

### 2.5 Recommendations

1.  **Mandatory Parameterized Queries:**  Enforce a strict policy that *all* uses of `FromSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlRaw` *must* use parameterized queries, either via `FormattableString` (preferred) or explicit `DbParameter` objects.  Code reviews should specifically check for this.

2.  **Code Analysis Tools:**  Integrate static code analysis tools (e.g., Roslyn analyzers, SonarQube) into the development pipeline to automatically detect and flag any instances of string concatenation within `FromSqlRaw` or `ExecuteSqlRaw` calls.

3.  **Security Training:**  Provide regular security training to developers, focusing on SQL injection vulnerabilities and the proper use of EF Core.

4.  **Input Validation:**  Implement robust input validation for all user-supplied data, ensuring it conforms to expected formats and constraints.

5.  **Least Privilege:**  Configure the database user account with the minimum necessary permissions.

6.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities.

7.  **Dependency Updates:** Keep EF Core and all related libraries up to date to benefit from the latest security patches.

8.  **Error Handling:** Avoid displaying raw database error messages to the user.  These messages can leak sensitive information about the database schema.

### 2.6 OWASP Top 10 Mapping

This vulnerability falls squarely under **A03:2021 – Injection**.  SQL injection is a classic and prevalent type of injection attack.

### 2.7 CWE Mapping

The relevant CWE entry is **CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')**.

## 3. Conclusion

The use of `FromSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlRaw` with untrusted input in EF Core presents a significant SQL injection risk.  By strictly adhering to parameterized queries and implementing the other recommended mitigations, developers can effectively eliminate this vulnerability and protect their applications from data breaches and other security incidents.  Continuous vigilance, code reviews, and security testing are essential to maintain a strong security posture.
