# Deep Analysis of EF Core Attack Tree Path: Raw SQL Queries

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly examine the vulnerability associated with using raw SQL queries (`FromSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlRaw`) in Entity Framework Core (EF Core) applications without proper sanitization or parameterization.  The objective is to understand the attack vectors, potential impact, mitigation strategies, and detection methods related to this specific vulnerability.  We will identify common coding patterns that lead to this vulnerability and provide concrete examples of both vulnerable and secure code.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following:

*   **Target:** Applications built using the .NET Entity Framework Core ORM (Object-Relational Mapper).  The analysis is relevant to all versions of EF Core where `FromSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlRaw` are available.
*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection vulnerabilities arising from the misuse of `FromSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlRaw` methods.  This includes both direct injection and second-order injection scenarios (where injected data is stored and later retrieved and used in another raw SQL query).
*   **Exclusions:**  This analysis *does not* cover other potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in EF Core (e.g., those arising from extremely unusual custom providers or highly unconventional usage).  It also does not cover other types of injection attacks (e.g., command injection, XSS).

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Definition:**  Clearly define the SQL injection vulnerability in the context of EF Core's raw SQL methods.
2.  **Attack Vector Analysis:**  Describe how an attacker can exploit this vulnerability, including specific examples of malicious input.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  Detail the potential consequences of a successful SQL injection attack, considering data breaches, data modification, denial of service, and other impacts.
4.  **Code Examples:** Provide both vulnerable and secure code snippets demonstrating the misuse and proper use of `FromSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlRaw`.
5.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  Outline best practices and recommended techniques to prevent SQL injection when using raw SQL queries in EF Core. This includes parameterization, input validation, and least privilege principles.
6.  **Detection Methods:**  Describe how to identify this vulnerability in existing code, including static analysis, dynamic analysis, and code review techniques.
7.  **Remediation Guidance:** Provide clear steps for developers to fix vulnerable code.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1 Raw SQL Queries

### 4.1 Vulnerability Definition

SQL Injection is a code injection technique where an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server through a vulnerable application.  In the context of EF Core, this vulnerability arises when user-supplied data is directly concatenated into a raw SQL query string passed to `FromSqlRaw` (for queries that return entities) or `ExecuteSqlRaw` (for commands that don't return entities, like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).  EF Core, by design, protects against SQL injection when using LINQ-to-Entities.  However, `FromSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlRaw` bypass this protection *unless used correctly*.

### 4.2 Attack Vector Analysis

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing malicious input to any application input field that is ultimately used, unsanitized, within a raw SQL query.  Common attack vectors include:

*   **Web Forms:**  Input fields in web forms (search boxes, login forms, comment sections, etc.).
*   **API Endpoints:**  Parameters passed to API endpoints (query parameters, request bodies).
*   **File Uploads:**  Data extracted from uploaded files (e.g., filenames, CSV data).
*   **Database Data (Second-Order Injection):**  Data previously stored in the database (potentially from a prior injection) that is later retrieved and used in another raw SQL query.

**Example (Vulnerable Code):**

```csharp
// Vulnerable code - DO NOT USE
public IActionResult SearchProducts(string searchTerm)
{
    using var context = new MyDbContext();
    var products = context.Products.FromSqlRaw($"SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name LIKE '%{searchTerm}%'").ToList();
    return View(products);
}
```

In this example, the `searchTerm` is directly embedded into the SQL query string.  An attacker could provide a `searchTerm` like:

`'; DROP TABLE Products; --`

This would result in the following SQL query being executed:

`SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name LIKE '%'; DROP TABLE Products; --%'`

This would first select all products (likely returning nothing due to the empty string match), then *drop the entire Products table*, and finally comment out the rest of the original query.

**Example (Second-Order Injection):**

Imagine a scenario where a user's profile description is stored in the database.  An attacker injects malicious SQL into their profile description.  Later, an administrator's page uses `FromSqlRaw` to retrieve user profiles, including the description, without proper parameterization:

```csharp
// Vulnerable code - DO NOT USE (Second-Order Injection)
public IActionResult GetUserProfile(int userId)
{
    using var context = new MyDbContext();
    var user = context.Users.FromSqlRaw($"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Id = {userId}").FirstOrDefault();

    // ... later, the user.Description (which might contain injected SQL) is used in another raw query ...
    var logs = context.Logs.FromSqlRaw($"SELECT * FROM Logs WHERE Description LIKE '%{user.Description}%'").ToList();

    return View(user, logs);
}
```

Even if the initial `FromSqlRaw` call to get the user is parameterized, the *subsequent* call using the potentially tainted `user.Description` is vulnerable.

### 4.3 Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful SQL injection attack via raw SQL queries in EF Core can be severe:

*   **Data Breach:**  Attackers can read sensitive data from the database (user credentials, personal information, financial data).
*   **Data Modification:**  Attackers can alter or delete data in the database, leading to data corruption or loss.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers can execute queries that consume excessive resources, making the database unavailable to legitimate users.  Dropping tables is a simple DoS.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  In some cases, attackers might be able to gain higher privileges within the database or even on the database server itself.
*   **Code Execution (Rare but Possible):**  Depending on the database system and its configuration, attackers might be able to execute operating system commands through SQL injection (e.g., using `xp_cmdshell` in SQL Server, if enabled).
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Data breaches and service disruptions can severely damage the reputation of the organization.
*   **Legal and Financial Consequences:**  Organizations may face legal penalties and financial losses due to data breaches and non-compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

### 4.4 Code Examples (Secure)

**Secure Code (Parameterized Query):**

```csharp
// Secure code - using parameterization
public IActionResult SearchProducts(string searchTerm)
{
    using var context = new MyDbContext();
    var products = context.Products.FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name LIKE {0}", "%" + searchTerm + "%").ToList();
    return View(products);
}
```

This is the *correct* way to use `FromSqlRaw`.  The `{0}` is a placeholder that is replaced by the value of the second argument to `FromSqlRaw`.  EF Core handles the proper escaping and quoting of the parameter, preventing SQL injection.  The database treats the parameter as *data*, not as part of the SQL command itself.

**Secure Code (Using `FormattableString` - .NET 6 and later):**

```csharp
// Secure code - using FormattableString (.NET 6+)
public IActionResult SearchProducts(string searchTerm)
{
    using var context = new MyDbContext();
    FormattableString query = $"SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name LIKE '%{searchTerm}%'";
    var products = context.Products.FromSqlInterpolated(query).ToList();
    return View(products);
}
```
Or even shorter:
```csharp
// Secure code - using FormattableString (.NET 6+)
public IActionResult SearchProducts(string searchTerm)
{
    using var context = new MyDbContext();
    var products = context.Products.FromSqlInterpolated($"SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name LIKE '%{searchTerm}%'").ToList();
    return View(products);
}
```

.NET 6 introduced `FromSqlInterpolated`, which leverages C#'s string interpolation feature in a safe way.  The interpolated string is converted to a `FormattableString`, and EF Core uses this to create a parameterized query. This approach is generally preferred for its readability.

**Secure Code (Using `ExecuteSqlRaw` with Parameters):**

```csharp
// Secure code - using ExecuteSqlRaw with parameters
public IActionResult DeleteProduct(int productId)
{
    using var context = new MyDbContext();
    context.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw("DELETE FROM Products WHERE Id = {0}", productId);
    return RedirectToAction("Index");
}
```

Similar to `FromSqlRaw`, `ExecuteSqlRaw` should *always* be used with parameters when incorporating user-supplied data.

### 4.5 Mitigation Strategies

1.  **Parameterization (Primary Defense):**  Always use parameterized queries (as shown in the secure code examples) when using `FromSqlRaw` or `ExecuteSqlRaw`.  Never directly concatenate user input into the SQL query string.

2.  **Input Validation (Defense in Depth):**  While parameterization is the primary defense, input validation adds an extra layer of security.  Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected data types, lengths, and formats.  This can help prevent unexpected input from causing issues, even if parameterization is used correctly.  However, *never* rely on input validation *alone* to prevent SQL injection.

3.  **Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the database user account used by the application has only the minimum necessary privileges.  For example, if the application only needs to read data from certain tables, grant it only `SELECT` permissions on those tables, not `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `DROP`.  This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they successfully exploit a SQL injection vulnerability.

4.  **Avoid Raw SQL When Possible:**  Whenever possible, use EF Core's LINQ-to-Entities capabilities instead of raw SQL.  LINQ-to-Entities automatically generates parameterized queries, eliminating the risk of SQL injection.  Reserve `FromSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlRaw` for situations where LINQ-to-Entities cannot express the desired query or command.

5.  **Stored Procedures (with Caution):**  Stored procedures *can* be used to mitigate SQL injection, but *only if they are written securely*.  If a stored procedure itself concatenates user input into a dynamic SQL query, it is still vulnerable.  Ensure that stored procedures also use parameterization.

6. **Whitelisting, Not Blacklisting:** When validating input, use whitelisting (allowing only known-good characters or patterns) rather than blacklisting (disallowing known-bad characters). Blacklisting is often incomplete and can be bypassed.

### 4.6 Detection Methods

1.  **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools (e.g., Roslyn analyzers, SonarQube, commercial tools) to scan the codebase for potentially vulnerable uses of `FromSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlRaw`.  These tools can identify instances where string concatenation is used with these methods, flagging them as potential vulnerabilities.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis:**  Use dynamic analysis tools (e.g., web application scanners, penetration testing tools) to test the application for SQL injection vulnerabilities.  These tools can send malicious input to the application and observe the responses to identify potential vulnerabilities.

3.  **Code Review:**  Conduct thorough code reviews, paying close attention to any use of `FromSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlRaw`.  Manually inspect the code to ensure that parameterization is used correctly and that user input is not directly concatenated into SQL query strings.

4.  **Database Auditing:**  Enable database auditing to log all SQL queries executed against the database.  This can help identify suspicious queries that might indicate a SQL injection attack.

5.  **SQL Profiler (SQL Server):** Use SQL Server Profiler (or similar tools for other database systems) to monitor the SQL queries executed by the application in real-time. This can help identify vulnerable queries during testing or even in production (with caution, as profiling can impact performance).

### 4.7 Remediation Guidance

1.  **Replace String Concatenation with Parameterization:**  The most important step is to replace any instances of string concatenation with proper parameterization, using either the `{0}` placeholder syntax or the `FromSqlInterpolated` method (for .NET 6+).

2.  **Review and Refactor:**  Thoroughly review the code surrounding the vulnerable `FromSqlRaw` or `ExecuteSqlRaw` call to understand how user input flows into the query.  Refactor the code as needed to ensure that all user-supplied data is treated as parameters.

3.  **Add Input Validation:**  Implement input validation to ensure that user input conforms to expected data types and formats.

4.  **Test Thoroughly:**  After fixing the vulnerability, test the application thoroughly using both valid and invalid input to ensure that the fix is effective and that no new issues have been introduced.  Use a combination of manual testing and automated testing (unit tests, integration tests).

5. **Consider LINQ:** If possible refactor code to use LINQ instead of raw SQL.

By following these steps, developers can effectively remediate SQL injection vulnerabilities related to raw SQL queries in EF Core applications, significantly improving the security of their applications.
