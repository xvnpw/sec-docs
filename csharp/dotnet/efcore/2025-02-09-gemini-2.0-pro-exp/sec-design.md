# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a robust and efficient Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for .NET developers.
*   Support a wide range of database providers.
*   Enable developers to interact with databases using .NET objects, reducing boilerplate code.
*   Facilitate efficient data access and manipulation.
*   Maintain high performance and scalability.
*   Provide a consistent and well-documented API.
*   Foster a strong community and ecosystem.
*   Ensure compatibility with various .NET versions and platforms.
*   Continuously improve and evolve the framework based on user feedback and industry trends.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Data breaches or unauthorized access to sensitive data managed by applications using EF Core.
*   Performance bottlenecks or scalability issues impacting application responsiveness.
*   Compatibility issues with different database providers or .NET versions, leading to application failures.
*   Vulnerabilities in EF Core that could be exploited by attackers to compromise applications.
*   Inability to adapt to new database technologies or evolving developer needs.
*   Lack of sufficient documentation or community support, hindering developer adoption and productivity.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Input validation: EF Core performs some level of input validation to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. (Implemented in the core library and provider-specific implementations).
*   security control: Parameterized queries: EF Core uses parameterized queries to protect against SQL injection. (Implemented in the core library and provider-specific implementations).
*   security control: Secure coding practices: The EF Core codebase is developed following secure coding guidelines to minimize vulnerabilities. (Described in contribution guidelines and internal development processes).
*   security control: Regular security audits and penetration testing: Microsoft conducts regular security reviews and penetration tests on its products, including EF Core. (Described in Microsoft's security development lifecycle documentation).
*   security control: Vulnerability disclosure program: Microsoft has a vulnerability disclosure program that encourages responsible reporting of security issues. (Described on Microsoft's security website).
*   security control: Code reviews: All code changes undergo code reviews to identify potential security flaws. (Described in contribution guidelines).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Third-party database provider vulnerabilities: EF Core relies on third-party database providers, and vulnerabilities in these providers could impact applications using EF Core.
*   accepted risk: Developer misuse: Developers can misuse EF Core features, leading to security vulnerabilities (e.g., disabling input validation or using raw SQL queries insecurely).
*   accepted risk: Configuration errors: Incorrect configuration of database connections or security settings can expose applications to risks.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Enhanced input validation: Implement additional input validation mechanisms beyond what EF Core provides by default, especially for applications handling sensitive data.
*   security control: Least privilege principle: Ensure that database users and roles have only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
*   security control: Encryption at rest and in transit: Encrypt sensitive data both at rest (in the database) and in transit (between the application and the database).
*   security control: Auditing: Enable database auditing to track data access and modifications.
*   security control: Regular security training for developers: Educate developers on secure coding practices and how to use EF Core securely.
*   security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Integrate SAST tools into the build process to identify potential vulnerabilities in the EF Core codebase.
*   security control: Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Perform regular DAST scans on applications using EF Core to identify runtime vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Use SCA tools to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by EF Core.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Applications using EF Core should authenticate users securely, using strong authentication mechanisms.
    *   Database connections should use strong authentication credentials.
*   Authorization:
    *   Applications should implement appropriate authorization controls to restrict access to sensitive data based on user roles and permissions.
    *   Database users and roles should be granted only the necessary privileges.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Applications should validate all user inputs thoroughly to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
    *   EF Core's built-in input validation should be supplemented with application-specific validation logic.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Sensitive data should be encrypted both at rest and in transit.
    *   Strong cryptographic algorithms and key management practices should be used.
