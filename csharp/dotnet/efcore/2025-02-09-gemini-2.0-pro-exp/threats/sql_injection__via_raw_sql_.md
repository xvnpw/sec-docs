# Deep Analysis: SQL Injection (via Raw SQL) in EF Core

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the SQL Injection vulnerability arising from the misuse of raw SQL queries in Entity Framework Core (EF Core).  We aim to:

*   Understand the precise mechanisms by which this vulnerability can be exploited.
*   Identify specific EF Core methods susceptible to this attack.
*   Evaluate the potential impact on application security and data integrity.
*   Provide concrete, actionable recommendations for developers to prevent and mitigate this threat.
*   Illustrate the vulnerability with code examples and demonstrate secure coding practices.
*   Analyze edge cases and potential bypasses of common mitigations.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on SQL Injection vulnerabilities introduced through the use of raw SQL query methods within EF Core, specifically:

*   `FromSqlRaw`
*   `ExecuteSqlRaw`
*   `DbSet.FromSqlInterpolated`
*   `Database.ExecuteSqlInterpolated`

The analysis will *not* cover:

*   SQL Injection vulnerabilities in other parts of the application (e.g., direct database connections outside of EF Core).
*   Other types of injection attacks (e.g., command injection, LDAP injection).
*   Vulnerabilities inherent to the underlying database system itself (these are assumed to be patched and configured securely).

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Modeling Review:**  We'll start with the provided threat model entry as a foundation.
2.  **Code Analysis:** We'll examine EF Core's source code (if necessary for deeper understanding) and construct vulnerable and secure code examples.
3.  **Vulnerability Demonstration:** We'll create practical examples demonstrating how an attacker could exploit this vulnerability.
4.  **Mitigation Analysis:** We'll evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, including their limitations.
5.  **Best Practices Definition:** We'll define clear, concise best practices for developers to follow.
6.  **Edge Case Exploration:** We'll consider scenarios where common mitigations might be insufficient or bypassed.
7.  **Documentation:**  The findings will be documented in this comprehensive report.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Threat: SQL Injection (via Raw SQL)

### 4.1. Vulnerability Mechanism

The core vulnerability lies in the improper handling of user-supplied input when constructing raw SQL queries.  EF Core's `FromSqlRaw`, `ExecuteSqlRaw`, `FromSqlInterpolated`, and `ExecuteSqlInterpolated` methods allow developers to execute arbitrary SQL strings against the database.  If user input is directly concatenated into these SQL strings without proper parameterization or escaping, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code.

**Example (Vulnerable):**

```csharp
// Vulnerable Code - DO NOT USE
string userInput = Request.Query["username"]; // Assume this comes from an untrusted source
string query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '" + userInput + "'";
var users = context.Users.FromSqlRaw(query).ToList();
```

If `userInput` is set to `' OR '1'='1`, the resulting query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '' OR '1'='1'
```

This query will return *all* users, bypassing the intended username filter.  This is a classic SQL Injection, allowing the attacker to read data they shouldn't have access to.  More sophisticated injections could modify or delete data, or even execute operating system commands (depending on database permissions and configuration).

**Example (Slightly Less Vulnerable, Still Bad - String Interpolation without Parameters):**

```csharp
// Vulnerable Code - DO NOT USE
string userInput = Request.Query["username"];
string query = $"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '{userInput}'"; //Still vulnerable!
var users = context.Users.FromSqlRaw(query).ToList();
```

Even though string interpolation *looks* safer, it's still vulnerable.  The interpolated string is ultimately concatenated before being sent to the database.

### 4.2. Exploitation Scenarios

*   **Data Exfiltration:**  An attacker could use `UNION` statements to retrieve data from other tables.  For example: `' UNION SELECT CreditCardNumber, ExpiryDate FROM CreditCards --`
*   **Data Modification:**  An attacker could inject `UPDATE` statements to change data.  For example: `' ; UPDATE Users SET IsAdmin = 1 WHERE Username = 'attacker' --`
*   **Data Deletion:**  An attacker could inject `DELETE` or `TRUNCATE` statements.  For example: `' ; DELETE FROM Users --`
*   **Database Enumeration:**  An attacker could use information schema queries to discover table and column names.
*   **Command Execution (Advanced):**  In some database systems (e.g., SQL Server with `xp_cmdshell` enabled), an attacker could potentially execute operating system commands.  This is a high-impact, but less common, scenario.
* **Bypassing Authentication:** Injecting SQL to modify WHERE clauses to always evaluate to true, allowing login without valid credentials.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Injecting queries designed to consume excessive resources or cause database errors.

### 4.3. Impact Analysis

As outlined in the threat model, the impact is critical:

*   **Confidentiality:**  Complete loss of data confidentiality.  Attackers can read any data accessible to the database user.
*   **Integrity:**  Data can be modified or deleted, leading to incorrect application behavior, financial losses, or reputational damage.
*   **Availability:**  While less direct, SQL Injection can lead to denial-of-service by deleting data or causing database errors.
*   **System Compromise:**  In the worst-case scenario, the entire database server, and potentially the application server, could be compromised.

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies and Analysis

**4.4.1. Primary Mitigation: Avoid Raw SQL (Use LINQ to Entities)**

The most effective mitigation is to avoid raw SQL queries entirely.  EF Core's LINQ to Entities provider translates LINQ expressions into parameterized SQL queries, automatically protecting against SQL Injection.

**Example (Secure - LINQ to Entities):**

```csharp
// Secure Code - Use LINQ
string userInput = Request.Query["username"];
var users = context.Users.Where(u => u.Username == userInput).ToList();
```

EF Core will generate a parameterized query, ensuring that `userInput` is treated as a data value, not as part of the SQL command.

**4.4.2. Parameterized Queries (If Raw SQL is Unavoidable)**

If raw SQL is absolutely necessary, *always* use parameterized queries.  This involves using placeholders in the SQL string and providing the actual values as separate parameters.

**Example (Secure - Parameterized `FromSqlRaw`):**

```csharp
// Secure Code - Parameterized FromSqlRaw
string userInput = Request.Query["username"];
var users = context.Users.FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = @username", new SqlParameter("@username", userInput)).ToList();
```

**Example (Secure - Parameterized `ExecuteSqlRaw`):**

```csharp
// Secure Code - Parameterized ExecuteSqlRaw
string userInput = Request.Query["username"];
int rowsAffected = context.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw("UPDATE Users SET IsActive = 0 WHERE Username = @username", new SqlParameter("@username", userInput));
```
**Example (Secure - `FromSqlInterpolated`):**

```csharp
// Secure Code - FromSqlInterpolated
string userInput = Request.Query["username"];
var users = context.Users.FromSqlInterpolated($"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = {userInput}").ToList();
```
EF Core recognizes the interpolated string and automatically converts it to a parameterized query. This is generally preferred over `FromSqlRaw` when using string interpolation.

**Example (Secure - `ExecuteSqlInterpolated`):**

```csharp
// Secure Code - ExecuteSqlInterpolated
string userInput = Request.Query["username"];
int rowsAffected = context.Database.ExecuteSqlInterpolated($"UPDATE Users SET IsActive = 0 WHERE Username = {userInput}");
```
Similar to `FromSqlInterpolated`, this is the preferred way to use string interpolation with raw SQL execution.

**4.4.3. Input Validation and Sanitization (Defense-in-Depth)**

While parameterization is the primary defense, input validation and sanitization provide an additional layer of security.

*   **Validation:**  Check that user input conforms to expected data types, lengths, and formats.  Reject invalid input.  For example, if a username is expected to be alphanumeric, reject input containing special characters.
*   **Sanitization:**  This is generally *not recommended* as a primary defense against SQL Injection, as it's easy to miss edge cases.  However, it can be used as a defense-in-depth measure.  If used, it should involve escaping or removing potentially dangerous characters.  *Crucially*, sanitization must be done *before* the input is used in any SQL query, even a parameterized one.  Sanitization is database-specific.

**4.4.4. Principle of Least Privilege**

The database user account used by the application should have the minimum necessary privileges.  It should *not* be a database administrator or owner.  This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they successfully exploit a SQL Injection vulnerability.  For example, if the application only needs to read data from certain tables, the database user should only have `SELECT` permissions on those tables.

**4.4.5. Stored Procedures (with Caution)**

Stored procedures *can* be used to mitigate SQL Injection, but *only if they are written securely*.  If a stored procedure itself concatenates user input into dynamic SQL, it's still vulnerable.  Stored procedures should use parameterized queries internally.

**4.4.6. Web Application Firewall (WAF)**

A WAF can help detect and block SQL Injection attempts, but it's not a foolproof solution.  It should be considered a supplementary defense, not a replacement for secure coding practices.

**4.4.7. Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing**

Regular security audits and penetration testing can help identify SQL Injection vulnerabilities before they are exploited by attackers.

### 4.5. Edge Cases and Potential Bypasses

*   **Second-Order SQL Injection:**  This occurs when user input is stored in the database and later used in a raw SQL query without proper parameterization.  Even if the initial input is validated or sanitized, it can still be dangerous if it's later used in an unsafe way.  The solution is to *always* use parameterized queries, even when retrieving data from the database.
*   **Database-Specific Escaping Issues:**  If sanitization is used (which, again, is not recommended as a primary defense), it must be done correctly for the specific database system.  Different databases have different escaping rules.
*   **ORM Limitations:** While rare, there might be extremely complex queries that cannot be expressed using LINQ to Entities.  In these cases, extreme caution is required, and parameterized queries are mandatory.
* **Bypassing Input Validation:** Attackers may find ways to craft input that bypasses validation rules, especially if the rules are not comprehensive or are poorly implemented.

### 4.6. Best Practices Summary

1.  **Prefer LINQ to Entities:**  Use LINQ to Entities whenever possible.  This is the most secure and recommended approach.
2.  **Always Use Parameterized Queries (if raw SQL is unavoidable):**  Never concatenate user input directly into SQL strings.  Use `FromSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlRaw` with parameters, or `FromSqlInterpolated` and `ExecuteSqlInterpolated`.
3.  **Validate Input (Defense-in-Depth):**  Implement strict input validation to reject unexpected or potentially malicious input.
4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure the database user account has the minimum necessary permissions.
5.  **Avoid Dynamic SQL in Stored Procedures:**  If using stored procedures, ensure they also use parameterized queries internally.
6.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address vulnerabilities.
7.  **Stay Updated:** Keep EF Core and the database system updated with the latest security patches.
8. **Use a secure coding linter:** Use a linter that can detect raw SQL usage and warn about potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## 5. Conclusion

SQL Injection via raw SQL in EF Core is a critical vulnerability that can have severe consequences.  By understanding the mechanisms of this attack and consistently applying the recommended mitigation strategies, developers can effectively protect their applications and data from this threat.  The primary defense is to avoid raw SQL whenever possible and to use parameterized queries diligently when raw SQL is unavoidable.  A layered approach, combining secure coding practices with input validation, least privilege principles, and regular security assessments, provides the strongest protection.
