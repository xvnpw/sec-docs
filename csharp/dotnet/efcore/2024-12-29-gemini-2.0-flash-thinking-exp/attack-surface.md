### Key Attack Surfaces Introduced by EF Core (High & Critical)

*   **Attack Surface:** SQL Injection via Raw SQL or String Interpolation
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code through application inputs that are directly incorporated into raw SQL queries executed by EF Core.
    *   **How EF Core Contributes:**  EF Core provides methods like `FromSqlRaw` and `ExecuteSqlRaw` that allow developers to execute raw SQL. If user input is directly concatenated or interpolated into these strings without proper sanitization or parameterization, it creates a direct pathway for SQL injection.
    *   **Example:**
        ```csharp
        // Vulnerable code
        var userId = GetUserInput();
        var query = $"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Id = {userId}";
        var user = context.Users.FromSqlRaw(query).FirstOrDefault();
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential denial of service against the database.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use parameterized queries:** Utilize `FromSql` with parameters or LINQ's built-in parameterization.
            ```csharp
            // Secure code
            var userId = GetUserInput();
            var user = context.Users.FromSql("SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Id = {0}", userId).FirstOrDefault();
            ```
        *   **Avoid string concatenation or interpolation for dynamic query construction:**  Prefer using LINQ or parameterized raw SQL.

*   **Attack Surface:** LINQ Injection
    *   **Description:** Attackers manipulate the structure of LINQ queries through user-controlled input, leading to unintended data access or modification.
    *   **How EF Core Contributes:**  If application logic dynamically builds LINQ expressions based on user input without careful validation, attackers can influence the query logic that EF Core translates into SQL.
    *   **Example:**
        ```csharp
        // Potentially vulnerable code
        var filterColumn = GetUserColumnPreference(); // User input
        var users = context.Users.OrderBy(filterColumn).ToList(); // If filterColumn is not validated
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized data access, potential data manipulation depending on the manipulated query.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Validate and sanitize user input used in dynamic LINQ query construction:**  Ensure that user-provided values are within expected ranges and formats.
        *   **Use pre-defined query patterns or a query builder with built-in security measures:** Avoid directly constructing LINQ expressions from raw user input.

*   **Attack Surface:** Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Attackers can modify entity properties they shouldn't have access to by manipulating the data sent during entity updates or creations.
    *   **How EF Core Contributes:** If the application directly binds user input to entity properties without proper filtering, EF Core will attempt to update those properties in the database based on the provided values.
    *   **Example:**
        ```csharp
        // Vulnerable code (assuming direct binding of request data to User entity)
        public IActionResult UpdateUser(User user)
        {
            _context.Users.Update(user);
            _context.SaveChanges();
            return Ok();
        }
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation if sensitive properties like roles or permissions can be modified.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) or View Models:** Define specific classes that represent the data that can be modified, and map user input to these DTOs instead of directly to entities.
        *   **Use the `[Bind]` attribute or explicit property mapping:** Control which properties can be bound during model binding.

*   **Attack Surface:** Connection String Exposure
    *   **Description:** Sensitive database connection strings required by EF Core are exposed, allowing unauthorized access to the database.
    *   **How EF Core Contributes:** EF Core relies on a connection string to establish a connection with the database. The security of this connection string directly impacts the security of the application's data access layer.
    *   **Example:**
        *   Hardcoding the connection string in code where EF Core's `DbContext` is configured.
        *   Storing the connection string in a plain text configuration file accessible to unauthorized users.
    *   **Impact:** Full database compromise, including data breaches, data manipulation, and potential denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Store connection strings securely:** Use environment variables, Azure Key Vault, or other secure configuration management solutions.
        *   **Avoid hardcoding connection strings:** Never embed connection strings directly in the application code where EF Core is initialized.
