**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **`**Compromise Application via EF Core`**`** (Critical Node):**
    *   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a successful breach of the application's security.

*   **`**Exploit Coding Errors in EF Core Usage`**`** (Critical Node):**
    *   This category represents vulnerabilities arising from mistakes made by developers when using EF Core. Successful exploitation here can lead to various attacks, including SQL injection and data manipulation.

*   **`**SQL Injection via FromSqlRaw/Interpolation`**`** (Critical Node, Part of High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Developers use `FromSqlRaw` or string interpolation to construct SQL queries, directly embedding user input without proper sanitization.
    *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.

*   Identify vulnerable FromSqlRaw/Interpolation usage:
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker needs to find instances in the codebase where `FromSqlRaw` or string interpolation is used with user-controlled input.
    *   **Impact:**  A necessary step for exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.

*   **`**Inject malicious SQL through user-controlled input`**`** (Critical Node, Part of High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts malicious SQL code within the user input that is then executed by the application due to the insecure query construction.
    *   **Impact:**  Direct execution of attacker-controlled SQL, leading to significant compromise.

*   **`**Exploit EF Core's Internal Mechanisms`**`** (Critical Node):**
    *   This category involves exploiting inherent features or potential weaknesses within the EF Core library itself or its interaction with the underlying database.

*   **`**Exploiting Raw SQL Execution Features`**`** (Critical Node, Part of High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Developers use methods like `ExecuteSqlRaw` to execute raw SQL commands. If user input is directly incorporated without sanitization, it creates a direct SQL injection vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database.

*   Identify usage of `ExecuteSqlRaw` or similar raw SQL execution methods:
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker needs to locate instances in the codebase where raw SQL execution methods are used.
    *   **Impact:** A necessary step for exploiting the raw SQL injection vulnerability.

*   **`**Inject malicious SQL commands directly`**`** (Critical Node, Part of High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts malicious SQL code that is directly passed to the database through the raw SQL execution method.
    *   **Impact:** Direct execution of attacker-controlled SQL, leading to significant compromise.

*   **`**Exploit Configuration Weaknesses`**`** (Critical Node):**
    *   This category involves exploiting misconfigurations or insecure settings related to EF Core or the database connection.

*   **`**Insecure Connection String Management`**`** (Critical Node, Part of High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The database connection string, which contains credentials, is stored insecurely (e.g., in code, unencrypted configuration files).
    *   **Impact:** If the attacker gains access to the connection string, they can directly access the database, bypassing application security.

*   Locate connection string stored insecurely (e.g., in code, config files without encryption):
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker searches the application's codebase or configuration files for the database connection string.
    *   **Impact:** A necessary step to gain direct database access.

*   **`**Gain access to the database directly, bypassing application logic`**`** (Critical Node, Part of High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Using the compromised connection string, the attacker connects directly to the database, bypassing all application-level security measures.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the database, allowing for data breaches, manipulation, or deletion.
