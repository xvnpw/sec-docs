## Deep Analysis: SQL Injection via Raw SQL or Interpolated Strings in EF Core

This document provides a deep analysis of the SQL Injection threat when using raw SQL or interpolated strings within Entity Framework Core (EF Core), specifically targeting applications utilizing the `dotnet/efcore` library.

**1. Threat Breakdown:**

* **Threat Name:** SQL Injection via Raw SQL or Interpolated Strings
* **Threat Category:** Input Validation Failure, Code Injection
* **Attack Vector:** Exploitation of insecurely constructed SQL queries where user-controlled data is directly embedded.
* **Target:** Database layer of the application.
* **Prerequisites:** The application must utilize `FromSqlRaw`, `ExecuteSqlRaw`, or string interpolation within LINQ queries in a way that incorporates unsanitized user input.

**2. Detailed Explanation:**

This threat leverages the inherent capability of EF Core to execute raw SQL queries. While powerful for complex scenarios, this feature becomes a significant vulnerability when user-provided data is directly inserted into these queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**How it works:**

* **Raw SQL (`FromSqlRaw`, `ExecuteSqlRaw`):** These methods allow developers to write SQL queries directly. If user input is concatenated into the SQL string before execution, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code. For example:

   ```csharp
   string userInput = GetUserInput(); // Imagine this returns "'; DROP TABLE Users; --"
   var users = context.Users.FromSqlRaw($"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '{userInput}'").ToList();
   ```

   The resulting SQL query would be:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = ''; DROP TABLE Users; --'
   ```

   This executes the intended query, followed by a command to drop the `Users` table. The `--` comments out the remaining part of the original query.

* **Interpolated Strings in LINQ:** While LINQ generally offers protection against SQL injection through parameterization, directly embedding user input within interpolated strings can bypass this protection.

   ```csharp
   string userInput = GetUserInput(); // Imagine this returns "'; DELETE FROM Orders; --"
   var orders = context.Orders.Where(o => EF.Functions.Like(o.CustomerName, $"{userInput}%")).ToList();
   ```

   Depending on the database provider and how the query is translated, this *could* potentially lead to SQL injection if the interpolation is not handled securely at the provider level. While EF Core tries to parameterize, relying on string interpolation for dynamic values is risky.

**3. Technical Deep Dive:**

* **Vulnerable Code Patterns:**
    * Direct concatenation of user input into SQL strings used with `FromSqlRaw` or `ExecuteSqlRaw`.
    * Using string interpolation with user input within `FromSqlRaw` or `ExecuteSqlRaw`.
    * Relying on string interpolation for dynamic values within LINQ queries without explicit parameterization.

* **Attack Payloads:** Attackers can craft various SQL injection payloads depending on the database system and desired outcome. Common examples include:
    * **Data Exfiltration:** `'; SELECT CreditCard FROM SensitiveData WHERE UserID = 1; --`
    * **Data Modification:** `'; UPDATE Users SET IsAdmin = 1 WHERE Username = 'attacker'; --`
    * **Data Deletion:** `'; DROP TABLE Users; --`
    * **Privilege Escalation:**  (Database-specific commands) potentially granting the attacker higher privileges within the database.
    * **Command Execution:**  (Database-specific features like `xp_cmdshell` in SQL Server) allowing the attacker to execute operating system commands on the database server.

* **Impact Amplification:** The severity of SQL injection can be amplified if:
    * The application uses a database account with excessive privileges.
    * The database server is not properly secured.
    * The application handles sensitive data.

**4. Impact Assessment (Expanded):**

The potential impact of successful SQL injection in this context is severe and can lead to:

* **Confidentiality Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data like user credentials, financial information, personal details, and proprietary business data. This can lead to significant financial losses, reputational damage, and legal repercussions due to data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
* **Integrity Violation:**  Modification or deletion of critical data, leading to data corruption, business disruption, and inaccurate reporting. This can impact decision-making and operational efficiency.
* **Availability Disruption:**  Denial of service by dropping tables, locking resources, or causing database errors, rendering the application unusable.
* **Account Takeover:**  Gaining access to user accounts, potentially with administrative privileges, allowing attackers to perform malicious actions on behalf of legitimate users.
* **Lateral Movement:**  If the database server is connected to other systems, a successful SQL injection could be a stepping stone for further attacks within the network.
* **Compliance Failures:**  Organizations subject to regulatory compliance (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA) could face significant penalties for failing to protect against SQL injection.
* **Reputational Damage:**  Public disclosure of a successful SQL injection attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.

**5. Attack Vectors (Elaborated):**

Attackers can exploit this vulnerability through various entry points:

* **User Input Fields:**  Forms, search bars, and any other input fields that accept data from users are primary targets.
* **URL Parameters:**  Data passed through the URL can be manipulated to inject malicious SQL.
* **API Endpoints:**  Data submitted through API requests can be vulnerable if not properly handled.
* **Cookies:**  While less common, if application logic incorporates cookie data into raw SQL queries, it can be exploited.
* **Indirect Injection:**  In some cases, attackers might inject malicious data into other parts of the system that are later used to construct SQL queries.

**6. Vulnerable Code Examples (More Concrete):**

```csharp
// Vulnerable: Using FromSqlRaw with string concatenation
public List<User> FindUsersByUsername(string username)
{
    return _context.Users.FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '" + username + "'").ToList();
}

// Vulnerable: Using ExecuteSqlRaw with string interpolation
public int UpdateUserStatus(int userId, string status)
{
    return _context.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw($"UPDATE Users SET Status = '{status}' WHERE Id = {userId}");
}

// Potentially Vulnerable: Interpolated string in LINQ (depending on provider)
public List<Order> FindOrdersByCustomerName(string customerName)
{
    return _context.Orders.Where(o => EF.Functions.Like(o.CustomerName, $"{customerName}%")).ToList();
}
```

**7. Secure Coding Practices (Reinforced):**

* **Mandatory Parameterized Queries:**  **Always** use parameterized queries with `FromSqlInterpolated` or `ExecuteSqlInterpolated`. This is the most effective defense against SQL injection.

   ```csharp
   // Secure: Using FromSqlInterpolated
   public List<User> FindUsersByUsername(string username)
   {
       return _context.Users.FromSqlInterpolated($"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = {username}").ToList();
   }

   // Secure: Using ExecuteSqlInterpolated
   public int UpdateUserStatus(int userId, string status)
   {
       return _context.Database.ExecuteSqlInterpolated($"UPDATE Users SET Status = {status} WHERE Id = {userId}");
   }

   // Secure: Using parameters in LINQ (generally safe but avoid direct interpolation)
   public List<Order> FindOrdersByCustomerName(string customerName)
   {
       return _context.Orders.Where(o => EF.Functions.Like(o.CustomerName, customerName + "%")).ToList();
   }
   ```

* **Avoid String Concatenation:**  Never concatenate user input directly into SQL strings.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  While not a primary defense against SQL injection, validating and sanitizing user input can help prevent other types of attacks and reduce the attack surface. However, **do not rely on sanitization as the sole defense against SQL injection.**
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure the database user used by the application has only the necessary permissions to perform its intended operations. Avoid using overly privileged accounts.
* **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular reviews of the codebase to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Utilize SAST tools to automatically scan the code for SQL injection flaws.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Employ DAST tools to simulate real-world attacks and identify vulnerabilities in the running application.
* **Penetration Testing:**  Engage security experts to perform penetration testing to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.
* **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):**  WAFs can help detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts.
* **Keep EF Core and Database Drivers Up-to-Date:**  Ensure you are using the latest versions of EF Core and database drivers, as they often include security fixes.

**8. Detection Strategies:**

Identifying SQL injection vulnerabilities during development and testing is crucial:

* **Code Reviews:**  Manually inspect code for instances of raw SQL usage and string concatenation with user input. Pay close attention to `FromSqlRaw`, `ExecuteSqlRaw`, and string interpolation within LINQ queries.
* **Static Analysis Tools:**  Utilize SAST tools configured to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities. These tools can identify potential flaws based on code patterns.
* **Unit and Integration Tests:**  Write tests that specifically target potential SQL injection points by providing malicious input.
* **Penetration Testing:**  Simulate real-world attacks to identify exploitable SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* **Database Activity Monitoring:**  Monitor database logs for suspicious activity that might indicate a SQL injection attempt.

**9. Prevention Best Practices:**

* **Adopt a Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL):** Integrate security considerations into every stage of the development process.
* **Security Training for Developers:**  Educate developers about common web application vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, and secure coding practices.
* **Establish Secure Coding Guidelines:**  Define and enforce coding standards that prohibit the use of insecure practices like string concatenation for building SQL queries.
* **Regular Vulnerability Scanning:**  Perform regular vulnerability scans of the application and its dependencies.

**10. Conclusion:**

SQL Injection via raw SQL or interpolated strings in EF Core is a critical threat that can have severe consequences for the application and the organization. The primary mitigation strategy is the consistent use of parameterized queries through `FromSqlInterpolated` and `ExecuteSqlInterpolated`. Development teams must prioritize secure coding practices, rigorous testing, and ongoing security assessments to prevent this vulnerability from being exploited. Failing to do so can lead to significant financial losses, reputational damage, and legal liabilities. By understanding the mechanics of this threat and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of successful SQL injection attacks.
