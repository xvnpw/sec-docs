### 4. Deep Analysis of Raw SQL Injection via `FromSqlRaw`

#### 4.1. Vulnerability Details: Unparameterized Raw SQL Execution

The `FromSqlRaw()` method in EF Core allows developers to execute raw SQL queries directly against the database. This method is designed for scenarios where LINQ queries are insufficient to express complex database operations, such as utilizing database-specific functions or optimizing performance with hand-tuned SQL.

**The core vulnerability lies in the fact that `FromSqlRaw()` by default does not automatically parameterize the SQL query.**  If user-provided input is directly concatenated into the SQL query string passed to `FromSqlRaw()`, without proper sanitization or parameterization, it creates a direct pathway for SQL injection.

**Example of Vulnerable Code:**

```csharp
public async Task<List<Blog>> GetBlogsBySearchTermVulnerable(string searchTerm)
{
    using (var context = new BloggingContext())
    {
        var sqlQuery = $"SELECT * FROM Blogs WHERE Title LIKE '%{searchTerm}%'"; // Vulnerable concatenation
        return await context.Blogs.FromSqlRaw(sqlQuery).ToListAsync();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `searchTerm` is directly embedded into the SQL query string. If an attacker provides a malicious input for `searchTerm`, such as:

```
searchTerm = "'; DROP TABLE Blogs; --"
```

The resulting SQL query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Blogs WHERE Title LIKE '%'; DROP TABLE Blogs; --%'
```

This injected SQL code will execute after the intended `SELECT` statement, leading to the deletion of the `Blogs` table. The `--` comment then comments out the rest of the original query, preventing syntax errors.

#### 4.2. Attack Vector: User-Controlled Input

The attack vector for this vulnerability is any user-controlled input that is incorporated into the raw SQL query passed to `FromSqlRaw()`. This input can originate from various sources, including:

*   **HTTP Request Parameters:** Query string parameters, form data, request body.
*   **Cookies:** Data stored in browser cookies.
*   **External Data Sources:** Data retrieved from external APIs or files that are not properly validated.
*   **Database Input (in some scenarios):**  While less direct, if data from one part of the database is used to construct raw SQL queries without validation, it could still be an attack vector if that initial data is compromised.

An attacker exploits this vulnerability by crafting malicious input that, when embedded into the SQL query, alters the intended query logic or injects entirely new SQL commands.

#### 4.3. Impact Analysis: Severe Consequences

A successful SQL injection attack via `FromSqlRaw()` can have severe consequences, potentially leading to:

*   **Full Database Compromise:** Attackers can gain complete control over the database server, allowing them to read, modify, and delete any data.
*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Sensitive data, including user credentials, personal information, financial records, and proprietary business data, can be exposed to unauthorized individuals.
*   **Data Modification and Corruption:** Attackers can modify existing data, leading to data integrity issues and potentially disrupting business operations.
*   **Data Deletion:** Critical data can be permanently deleted, causing significant data loss and business disruption.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can execute resource-intensive queries that overload the database server, leading to performance degradation or complete service outage.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, attackers might be able to escalate their privileges within the database system, gaining access to administrative functions.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Compromised databases can be used as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the network.

The impact of this vulnerability is classified as **Critical** due to the potential for complete database compromise and the wide range of severe consequences.

#### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

The following mitigation strategies are crucial for preventing Raw SQL Injection via `FromSqlRaw()`:

**4.4.1. Minimize the Use of `FromSqlRaw` and Prefer LINQ:**

*   **Rationale:** The most effective way to avoid raw SQL injection vulnerabilities is to minimize or eliminate the use of `FromSqlRaw()` altogether. EF Core's LINQ provider is designed to generate parameterized SQL queries automatically, significantly reducing the risk of injection.
*   **Implementation:**  Whenever possible, refactor code to use LINQ queries instead of `FromSqlRaw()`.  EF Core's LINQ capabilities are extensive and can handle a wide range of query scenarios. Explore if complex queries can be broken down into smaller, LINQ-compatible operations or if alternative LINQ constructs can achieve the desired result.

**4.4.2. Parameterize Raw SQL Queries:**

*   **Rationale:** Parameterization is the primary defense against SQL injection. It separates the SQL query structure from the user-provided data. Parameters are treated as data values, not as executable SQL code, preventing malicious injection.
*   **Implementation:**  Use parameterized versions of `FromSqlRaw()` and `FromSqlInterpolated()`.

    *   **`FromSqlRaw(string sql, params object[] parameters)`:**  Use placeholders like `{0}`, `{1}`, etc., in the SQL string and pass parameters as an `object[]`.

        ```csharp
        public async Task<List<Blog>> GetBlogsBySearchTermParameterizedRaw(string searchTerm)
        {
            using (var context = new BloggingContext())
            {
                var sqlQuery = "SELECT * FROM Blogs WHERE Title LIKE '%' + {0} + '%'"; // Parameterized query
                return await context.Blogs.FromSqlRaw(sqlQuery, searchTerm).ToListAsync();
            }
        }
        ```

    *   **`FromSqlInterpolated($"...")`:**  Use string interpolation with `$` and `{}` to embed parameters directly into the SQL string. EF Core automatically parameterizes these interpolated values. **This is the recommended approach for parameterized raw SQL in modern EF Core versions.**

        ```csharp
        public async Task<List<Blog>> GetBlogsBySearchTermInterpolated(string searchTerm)
        {
            using (var context = new BloggingContext())
            {
                var sqlQuery = $"SELECT * FROM Blogs WHERE Title LIKE '%{searchTerm}%'"; // Interpolated and parameterized
                return await context.Blogs.FromSqlInterpolated($"SELECT * FROM Blogs WHERE Title LIKE '%{searchTerm}%'").ToListAsync();
            }
        }
        ```

    **Important Note:**  Ensure you are using the correct overload of `FromSqlRaw` or `FromSqlInterpolated` that accepts parameters.  Simply using string interpolation without `FromSqlInterpolated` will **not** automatically parameterize the query and will still be vulnerable.

**4.4.3. Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (Secondary Defense):**

*   **Rationale:** While parameterization is the primary defense, input validation and sanitization provide an additional layer of security.  Validate user inputs to ensure they conform to expected formats and lengths. Sanitize inputs by removing or encoding potentially harmful characters.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Whitelisting:** Define allowed characters and patterns for input fields. Reject inputs that do not conform to the whitelist.
    *   **Blacklisting (Less Recommended):**  Identify and remove or encode known malicious characters or patterns. Blacklisting is less robust than whitelisting as it's difficult to anticipate all possible attack patterns.
    *   **Encoding:**  Encode special characters that have meaning in SQL (e.g., single quotes, double quotes, semicolons) to prevent them from being interpreted as SQL syntax.  However, **encoding alone is not sufficient and should not be used as a primary defense instead of parameterization.**
    *   **Context-Specific Validation:**  Validate inputs based on the context in which they are used. For example, if an input is expected to be an integer, validate that it is indeed an integer.

    **Example of Input Validation (Illustrative - should be combined with parameterization):**

    ```csharp
    public async Task<List<Blog>> GetBlogsBySearchTermValidated(string searchTerm)
    {
        using (var context = new BloggingContext())
        {
            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(searchTerm) || searchTerm.Length > 100) // Example validation
            {
                return new List<Blog>(); // Or throw an exception
            }

            // Still use parameterization even with validation!
            var sqlQuery = $"SELECT * FROM Blogs WHERE Title LIKE '%{searchTerm}%'";
            return await context.Blogs.FromSqlInterpolated($"SELECT * FROM Blogs WHERE Title LIKE '%{searchTerm}%'").ToListAsync();
        }
    }
    ```

    **Important Note:** Input validation and sanitization should be considered a **defense-in-depth measure** and **not a replacement for parameterization**.  Parameterization is the fundamental and most effective mitigation.

**4.4.4. Principle of Least Privilege for Database Accounts:**

*   **Rationale:** Limit the permissions granted to the database user account used by the application.  If an attacker successfully injects SQL, the damage they can inflict is limited by the privileges of the compromised database account.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Create dedicated database accounts for the application.** Avoid using administrative or highly privileged accounts.
    *   **Grant only the necessary permissions.**  Typically, applications need `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` permissions on specific tables and views.  Avoid granting `DROP`, `CREATE`, or other administrative privileges unless absolutely necessary.
    *   **Regularly review and audit database user permissions.** Ensure that permissions are still appropriate and remove any unnecessary privileges.

#### 4.5. Detection and Prevention

*   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews, specifically focusing on areas where `FromSqlRaw()` is used. Verify that all raw SQL queries are properly parameterized and that input validation is implemented where necessary.
*   **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Utilize SAST tools that can analyze code for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities, including those related to `FromSqlRaw()`. These tools can identify instances where user input is directly incorporated into raw SQL queries without parameterization.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Employ DAST tools to test the running application for SQL injection vulnerabilities. DAST tools simulate attacks by injecting malicious payloads and observing the application's response.
*   **Penetration Testing:** Engage security professionals to conduct penetration testing to identify and exploit vulnerabilities, including SQL injection flaws.
*   **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** WAFs can help detect and block common SQL injection attacks by inspecting HTTP requests and responses for malicious patterns. However, WAFs are not a substitute for secure coding practices and parameterization.
*   **Database Activity Monitoring (DAM):** DAM tools can monitor database activity for suspicious queries and access patterns, potentially detecting SQL injection attacks in real-time.
*   **Security Awareness Training:** Educate developers about SQL injection vulnerabilities, secure coding practices, and the importance of parameterization when using `FromSqlRaw()`.
