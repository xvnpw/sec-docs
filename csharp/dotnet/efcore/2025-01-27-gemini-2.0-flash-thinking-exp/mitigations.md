# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for dotnet/efcore

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Queries](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_queries.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Enforce the use of parameterized queries for all database interactions within EF Core applications.
    *   **Step-by-step:**
        *   **1. Utilize LINQ:** Primarily use LINQ queries as EF Core inherently parameterizes LINQ expressions.
        *   **2. Parameterized Raw SQL:** When using raw SQL (via `FromSqlInterpolated` or `FromSqlRaw`), always use parameters (`@p0`, `@p1`, or named parameters) for user-provided inputs. Pass input values as arguments to these methods, *not* by embedding them directly into the SQL string.
        *   **3. Code Review Focus:** During code reviews, specifically check for any instances of string interpolation or concatenation used to build SQL queries, especially within `FromSqlRaw` or `FromSqlInterpolated`. Flag and refactor these immediately.
        *   **4. Static Analysis (Optional):** Consider using static code analysis tools that can detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities by identifying unsafe string manipulation patterns in query construction.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (Severity: High) - Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through user inputs if queries are not parameterized, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.

*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: High Reduction - Parameterized queries effectively eliminate SQL injection vulnerabilities by treating user inputs as data, not executable SQL code, within EF Core interactions.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented in:  Largely implemented by default due to the prevalent use of LINQ in the application for data access.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing in:  Potentially in less common scenarios where raw SQL queries (`FromSqlRaw`, `FromSqlInterpolated`) might be used without proper parameterization. Requires targeted code review to ensure 100% coverage, especially in older or less frequently modified code sections.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation Before EF Core Interaction](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_before_ef_core_interaction.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement robust input validation *before* data is used in EF Core queries or to update entities.
    *   **Step-by-step:**
        *   **1. Validate at Input Points:** Validate all user inputs at the application's entry points (e.g., controllers, API endpoints) *before* they are passed to services or data access layers that use EF Core.
        *   **2. Define Validation Rules:** Establish clear validation rules for each input field based on expected data type, format, length, range, and allowed characters.
        *   **3. Validation Mechanisms:** Utilize validation attributes on ViewModels/DTOs, FluentValidation, or manual validation logic in your application services *before* interacting with EF Core context.
        *   **4. Error Handling:** If validation fails, return informative error messages to the user and prevent the invalid data from reaching EF Core and the database.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Integrity Issues (Severity: Medium) - Invalid data reaching EF Core can lead to database corruption, application errors, and inconsistent data states.
    *   Application Logic Errors (Severity: Medium) - Unexpected data formats or values can cause EF Core queries or entity updates to fail or behave unpredictably.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Integrity Issues: High Reduction - Prevents invalid data from being persisted in the database via EF Core, maintaining data consistency and reliability.
    *   Application Logic Errors: High Reduction - Ensures EF Core operations receive data in the expected format, reducing errors and improving application stability.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented in:  Basic validation using Data Annotations on ViewModels is likely in place for common input fields in web forms and APIs.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing in:  More comprehensive and consistent validation is needed across all input points.  Validation logic should be enforced rigorously *before* any EF Core operations are performed. Consider expanding validation to service layer to ensure validation occurs regardless of the entry point.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) or ViewModels for EF Core Entities](./mitigation_strategies/data_transfer_objects__dtos__or_viewmodels_for_ef_core_entities.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) or ViewModels to mediate data exchange between application layers and EF Core entities. Avoid directly binding request data to EF Core entities.
    *   **Step-by-step:**
        *   **1. Create DTO/ViewModel Classes:** Define DTOs/ViewModels that represent the data to be transferred, separate from your EF Core entity classes.
        *   **2. Map Data:** In controllers or services, map data from requests to DTOs/ViewModels. Then, map data from DTOs/ViewModels to EF Core entities only for necessary properties when updating or creating entities. Libraries like AutoMapper can assist with this.
        *   **3. Use DTOs/ViewModels in APIs and Views:** Ensure APIs and views interact with DTOs/ViewModels, not directly with EF Core entities.
        *   **4. Limit Properties in DTOs/ViewModels:** DTOs/ViewModels should only contain properties relevant to the specific use case, preventing over-exposure of entity properties.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities (Severity: Medium) - Attackers might attempt to modify entity properties they shouldn't have access to by sending extra data in requests if directly bound to entities.
    *   Over-posting (Severity: Medium) - Similar to mass assignment, attackers could try to update more entity properties than intended through form submissions or API requests if directly bound to entities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities: High Reduction - DTOs/ViewModels act as a protective layer, preventing direct manipulation of EF Core entities and limiting the properties that can be modified via external requests.
    *   Over-posting: High Reduction - By controlling the properties exposed in DTOs/ViewModels and mapped to entities, you prevent unintended updates and over-posting vulnerabilities when using EF Core.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented in:  Partially implemented in API controllers where DTOs are often used for request and response bodies. ViewModels are used for some views.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing in:  Consistent use of DTOs/ViewModels is needed across all API endpoints, views, and data transfer operations involving EF Core entities. Ensure backend services also operate on DTOs/ViewModels rather than directly on entities for data transfer.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Optimize EF Core Queries for Performance](./mitigation_strategies/optimize_ef_core_queries_for_performance.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Optimize EF Core queries to prevent performance bottlenecks that could lead to denial-of-service (DoS) scenarios.
    *   **Step-by-step:**
        *   **1. Profile EF Core Queries:** Use database profiling tools or EF Core's built-in logging to identify slow-performing queries.
        *   **2. Analyze Query Plans:** Examine the execution plans of slow EF Core queries to understand performance bottlenecks (e.g., full table scans, inefficient joins).
        *   **3. Apply EF Core Optimization Techniques:**
            *   **Eager Loading (`.Include()`):** Use `.Include()` and `.ThenInclude()` to load related data efficiently when needed, reducing round trips.
            *   **Projection (`.Select()`):** Use `.Select()` to retrieve only necessary columns, minimizing data transfer.
            *   **Filtering (`.Where()`):** Apply filters as early as possible in the query to reduce data processing.
            *   **AsNoTracking():** Use `.AsNoTracking()` for read-only queries to disable change tracking overhead.
            *   **Raw SQL (Parameterized):** For complex scenarios, consider parameterized raw SQL (`FromSqlInterpolated`, `FromSqlRaw`) if LINQ generates inefficient SQL.
        *   **4. Regular Performance Monitoring:** Continuously monitor EF Core query performance and re-optimize queries as application usage patterns change.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High) - Inefficient EF Core queries can consume excessive database resources, leading to slow response times and potential application unavailability.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): High Reduction - Optimized EF Core queries reduce database load and improve response times, making the application more resilient to DoS attacks related to query performance.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented in:  Basic query optimization is considered during development, with some use of eager loading and projection.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing in:  Systematic EF Core query performance profiling and monitoring are needed. Establish a process for analyzing slow queries and applying EF Core-specific optimization techniques. Integrate performance testing into the development lifecycle.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Database Indexing for EF Core Queries](./mitigation_strategies/database_indexing_for_ef_core_queries.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Ensure appropriate database indexes are in place to support efficient execution of EF Core queries.
    *   **Step-by-step:**
        *   **1. Analyze EF Core Query Patterns:** Identify columns frequently used in `WHERE` clauses, `JOIN` conditions, and `ORDER BY` clauses within your EF Core LINQ queries.
        *   **2. Review Query Execution Plans:** Examine query execution plans to identify missing index recommendations from the database system for EF Core generated SQL.
        *   **3. Create Indexes:** Create indexes on relevant database columns based on query analysis and execution plan recommendations. Consider composite indexes for multi-column filtering or sorting in EF Core queries.
        *   **4. EF Core Migrations for Index Management:** Use EF Core Migrations to manage index creation and updates as part of your database schema, ensuring indexes are consistently deployed.
        *   **5. Regular Index Review:** Periodically review database indexes to ensure they remain effective as EF Core query patterns and data volumes evolve.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High) - Missing indexes can cause EF Core queries to perform full table scans, drastically slowing down queries and contributing to DoS vulnerabilities.
    *   Performance Degradation (Severity: Medium) - Lack of proper indexing results in slow EF Core query performance, impacting user experience and application responsiveness.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): High Reduction - Indexes significantly improve EF Core query performance, reducing the risk of DoS attacks caused by slow database interactions.
    *   Performance Degradation: High Reduction - Indexes dramatically speed up EF Core query execution, enhancing application performance and user experience when using EF Core.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented in:  Basic indexes are likely created by EF Core Migrations based on primary and foreign key relationships.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing in:  Systematic index analysis and optimization specifically tailored to EF Core query patterns are not regularly performed. Need to conduct a database index audit focused on EF Core query performance and create missing indexes using EF Core Migrations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Caching Strategies for EF Core Data](./mitigation_strategies/caching_strategies_for_ef_core_data.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement caching mechanisms to reduce database load from EF Core queries and improve application responsiveness, mitigating potential DoS risks.
    *   **Step-by-step:**
        *   **1. Identify Caching Opportunities:** Analyze EF Core data access patterns to identify frequently accessed, relatively static data that can be cached.
        *   **2. Implement Caching Layers:**
            *   **Application-Level Caching (IMemoryCache):** Use `IMemoryCache` for caching data retrieved by EF Core in application memory for short durations.
            *   **Distributed Caching (Redis, Memcached):** Consider a distributed cache for shared data across multiple application instances, especially for session data or frequently accessed lookup data retrieved via EF Core.
            *   **Database Query Caching (Database Dependent):** Explore database-level query caching if supported by your database system, to cache results of frequently executed EF Core queries at the database level.
        *   **3. Cache Expiration:** Set appropriate cache expiration times (TTL) based on data volatility and consistency requirements for data accessed through EF Core.
        *   **4. Cache Invalidation:** Implement strategies to invalidate or update the cache when underlying data managed by EF Core changes to maintain data consistency.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High) - Caching reduces database load from EF Core queries, making the application more resilient to DoS attacks by serving data from the cache instead of repeatedly querying the database.
    *   Performance Degradation (Severity: Medium) - Caching significantly improves response times for data retrieved via EF Core, enhancing user experience.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): High Reduction - Caching drastically reduces database load from EF Core operations, improving resilience against DoS attacks.
    *   Performance Degradation: High Reduction - Caching significantly improves response times for data accessed through EF Core, leading to a faster and more responsive application.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented in:  Basic HTTP caching for static assets might be in place. `IMemoryCache` might be used in limited scenarios for short-term caching of some data.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing in:  A comprehensive caching strategy specifically for EF Core data is not implemented. Need to identify caching opportunities for EF Core entities and implement application-level and potentially distributed caching. Develop a cache invalidation strategy for EF Core data updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Custom Error Handling for EF Core Exceptions](./mitigation_strategies/custom_error_handling_for_ef_core_exceptions.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement custom error handling to prevent exposing detailed EF Core exception messages to users, which could reveal sensitive information.
    *   **Step-by-step:**
        *   **1. Global Exception Handler:** Implement global exception handling in your ASP.NET Core application.
        *   **2. Catch EF Core Exceptions:** Specifically catch exceptions thrown by EF Core operations (e.g., `DbUpdateException`, `DbConcurrencyException`, `SqlException`) within your exception handler.
        *   **3. Secure Logging:** Log detailed EF Core exception information (including stack traces and inner exceptions) to a secure logging system for debugging and analysis by authorized personnel only.
        *   **4. Generic Error Responses:** Return generic, user-friendly error messages to clients in API responses or web pages when EF Core exceptions occur. Avoid exposing specific details from EF Core exceptions.
        *   **5. Environment-Specific Handling:** Configure different error handling behavior for development and production environments. Show more detailed EF Core error information in development for debugging, but only generic messages in production.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium) - Exposing detailed EF Core exception messages can reveal sensitive information about database schema, connection strings, or internal application logic, aiding attackers in reconnaissance.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: High Reduction - Custom error handling prevents the exposure of detailed EF Core exception messages to users, significantly reducing the risk of information leakage related to EF Core operations.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented in:  Basic exception handling middleware is likely configured in ASP.NET Core. Default error pages might be in use.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing in:  Need to implement custom exception handling specifically tailored to EF Core exceptions. Ensure detailed EF Core error logging is in place and secure. Configure environment-specific error handling to show generic messages in production and more details in development for EF Core related errors.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Updates of EF Core and Provider Libraries](./mitigation_strategies/regular_updates_of_ef_core_and_provider_libraries.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Maintain up-to-date versions of EF Core and its database provider libraries to patch known security vulnerabilities and benefit from security improvements.
    *   **Step-by-step:**
        *   **1. Monitor Security Advisories:** Regularly monitor security advisories and release notes specifically for EF Core and your chosen EF Core database provider (e.g., `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`, `Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL`).
        *   **2. Update Schedule:** Establish a schedule for regularly updating EF Core and provider libraries. Prioritize applying security patches and updates promptly.
        *   **3. Testing Updates:** Thoroughly test updates in a staging or testing environment before deploying to production to ensure compatibility and prevent regressions in EF Core functionality.
        *   **4. Dependency Management:** Use NuGet Package Manager or similar tools to easily update and manage EF Core and provider library dependencies in your project.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known EF Core Vulnerabilities (Severity: High) - Outdated EF Core or provider libraries may contain known security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to compromise the application or database.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known EF Core Vulnerabilities: High Reduction - Regular updates patch known vulnerabilities in EF Core and provider libraries, significantly reducing the risk of exploitation of these specific vulnerabilities.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented in:  Updates are applied periodically, but might not be on a strict schedule or proactively monitored for EF Core specific security advisories.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing in:  Need to establish a formal process for monitoring security advisories specifically for EF Core and its providers. Implement a regular update schedule and testing process for EF Core library updates. Consider automated dependency scanning tools to detect outdated EF Core packages.
