## Attack Tree Path: [1. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__sql_injection_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how the application constructs SQL queries using EF Core, allowing them to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Critical Nodes within this Path:**
    *   **Inject Malicious SQL into Raw Query Parameters [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** When developers use raw SQL queries (e.g., `FromSqlRaw`, `ExecuteSqlRaw`) and fail to properly parameterize user-controlled input, attackers can inject SQL code through these parameters.
        *   **Impact: Critical (Data Breach, System Compromise) [CRITICAL NODE]:** Successful SQL injection can lead to complete database compromise, including data theft, modification, or deletion, and potentially even system-level access depending on database permissions and features.
    *   **Inject Malicious SQL via Unsanitized Interpolated Values [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:**  While `FromSqlInterpolated` offers some parameterization, if developers use it with unsanitized user input, or misunderstand its limitations, it can still be vulnerable to SQL injection.
        *   **Impact: Critical (Data Breach, System Compromise) [CRITICAL NODE]:** Similar to raw SQL injection, exploiting interpolated strings can have severe consequences, leading to data breaches and system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Data Exposure/Information Disclosure [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__data_exposureinformation_disclosure__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit inefficient queries or insecure logging practices to gain access to sensitive data that should not be exposed.
*   **Critical Nodes within this Path:**
    *   **Observe Sensitive Data in Over-fetched Results [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:**  Poorly optimized LINQ queries or eager loading can cause the application to fetch more data than necessary from the database. This over-fetched data might include sensitive information that is then processed or inadvertently exposed by the application.
        *   **Impact: Medium (Sensitive Data Exposure) [CRITICAL NODE]:**  While not a full system compromise, exposure of sensitive data can lead to privacy violations, regulatory breaches, and reputational damage.
    *   **Access Logs to Extract Sensitive Data [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:**  Verbose logging configurations might log sensitive data contained within EF Core queries or query results. If attackers gain access to these logs, they can extract sensitive information.
        *   **Impact: Medium (Sensitive Data Exposure) [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Similar to over-fetching, exposure of sensitive data through logs can have significant privacy and security implications.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Data Integrity Issues - Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities via Entity Binding [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__data_integrity_issues_-_mass_assignment_vulnerabilities_via_entity_binding__critical_node___high__4bf3ec42.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit mass assignment vulnerabilities to modify entity properties they should not have access to, leading to data corruption or unauthorized changes.
*   **Critical Nodes within this Path:**
    *   **Manipulate Request Data to Modify Unintended Entity Properties [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** If application endpoints directly bind request data to EF Core entities without proper input validation and property whitelisting, attackers can manipulate request parameters to modify entity properties that were not intended to be updated, potentially including sensitive or critical fields.
        *   **Impact: Medium (Data Corruption, Unauthorized Modification) [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Successful mass assignment attacks can lead to data corruption, unauthorized modification of critical data, and potentially business logic bypass.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Configuration Vulnerabilities Related to EF Core - Connection String Exposure [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__configuration_vulnerabilities_related_to_ef_core_-_connection_string_exposure__critical_node___hi_0cb66c33.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain access to database connection strings that are stored insecurely, allowing them to directly access the database.
*   **Critical Nodes within this Path:**
    *   **Access Connection String to Gain Database Access [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** If database connection strings are stored in easily accessible locations (e.g., code, unencrypted configuration files, public repositories), attackers can retrieve these credentials and directly connect to the database, bypassing application security layers.
        *   **Impact: Critical (Full Database Compromise) [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Exposure of connection strings grants attackers direct access to the database, allowing them to perform any operation, including data theft, modification, deletion, and potentially gaining further access to the underlying infrastructure.
