# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for dotnet/efcore

## Mitigation Strategy: [Always Use Parameterized Queries](./mitigation_strategies/always_use_parameterized_queries.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Primarily utilize LINQ queries or Entity SQL when interacting with the database through EF Core. These methods inherently generate parameterized queries.
    2.  Avoid constructing SQL queries by concatenating strings with user-provided input. This practice bypasses EF Core's parameterization and opens doors to SQL injection.
    3.  If raw SQL queries are absolutely necessary (for specific performance optimizations or database features), use EF Core's parameterization mechanisms. Employ `SqlParameter` objects or string interpolation with parameter placeholders that EF Core correctly processes. Example: `context.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = {0}", username);`
    4.  Educate development teams on the critical importance of parameterized queries in preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities within EF Core applications.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (High Severity) - Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through input fields, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion within the database managed by EF Core.
*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: High Risk Reduction - Consistently using parameterized queries effectively eliminates the primary attack vector for SQL injection when using EF Core.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Globally implemented in the data access layer for all new features and modules that utilize LINQ for data interactions.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Legacy modules or areas using older data access patterns might require review and refactoring to fully adopt parameterized queries within their EF Core interactions. Dynamic reporting features that construct queries dynamically need careful examination to ensure parameterization is correctly applied.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Raw SQL Queries and Prefer LINQ/Entity SQL](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_raw_sql_queries_and_prefer_linqentity_sql.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Establish a development guideline that prioritizes LINQ and Entity SQL as the primary methods for database interactions within EF Core applications.
    2.  Restrict the use of raw SQL queries to exceptional scenarios where LINQ or Entity SQL are demonstrably insufficient for the required database operations (e.g., accessing highly database-specific features or performance-critical paths after thorough profiling).
    3.  Implement mandatory code review processes that specifically scrutinize and require justification for any use of raw SQL queries. Ensure that if raw SQL is used, it is correctly parameterized and secure within the EF Core context.
    4.  Provide ongoing training to developers on advanced LINQ and Entity SQL techniques to reduce the perceived need for resorting to raw SQL queries when working with EF Core.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (High Severity) - Reduces the overall attack surface for SQL injection vulnerabilities by minimizing the places where developers might manually construct SQL, increasing the risk of errors.
    *   Maintainability Issues (Medium Severity) - Raw SQL queries embedded within EF Core code can be harder to maintain, refactor, and understand compared to LINQ, potentially leading to security oversights during code modifications.
*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: Medium Risk Reduction - While parameterized raw SQL can be secure, minimizing its use reduces the probability of human error and oversight in parameterization, especially in complex scenarios.
    *   Maintainability Issues: Medium Risk Reduction - Improves code readability and maintainability within EF Core data access logic, indirectly contributing to security by reducing complexity and potential for errors.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. New development strongly favors LINQ and Entity SQL. Guidelines are in place, but consistent enforcement through code review needs strengthening.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Consistent enforcement across all development teams and projects. Legacy modules might still contain unreviewed raw SQL queries. Formal integration of this guideline into developer onboarding and training programs is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for Input Validation and Mass Assignment Prevention with EF Core Entities](./mitigation_strategies/data_transfer_objects__dtos__for_input_validation_and_mass_assignment_prevention_with_ef_core_entiti_51060946.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Design and utilize DTO classes specifically tailored for receiving data from external requests (e.g., API endpoints, web forms) that are intended to update EF Core entities. These DTOs should only include properties that are meant to be updatable.
    2.  In controller actions or data processing layers that interact with EF Core, map incoming request data to these DTOs instead of directly binding request data to EF Core entities.
    3.  Implement robust validation logic on the DTOs. Use validation attributes or manual validation code to ensure that the incoming data conforms to expected formats and business rules *before* mapping to EF Core entities.
    4.  After successful DTO validation, explicitly map properties from the validated DTO to the corresponding properties of the EF Core entity that are intended to be updated. Avoid directly assigning the entire DTO to the entity, which could bypass intended update controls.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Mass Assignment (Over-posting) (High Severity) - Prevents attackers from manipulating entity properties they should not be able to modify by sending unexpected or malicious data in requests intended for EF Core entity updates.
    *   Input Validation Bypass (Medium Severity) - DTOs provide a dedicated layer for input validation *before* data reaches EF Core entities, making it easier to enforce validation rules and prevent bypassing entity-level validation that might be less robust.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Mass Assignment: High Risk Reduction - Effectively eliminates mass assignment vulnerabilities by providing strict control over data flow and property updates to EF Core entities.
    *   Input Validation Bypass: Medium Risk Reduction - Improves the consistency and robustness of input validation for data intended to update EF Core entities, reducing the risk of overlooking validation requirements.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented for all new API endpoints and data modification operations in the web application that interact with EF Core entities.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Some older parts of the application, particularly internal administrative panels or legacy data update workflows, might still directly bind to EF Core entities. Refactoring these areas to use DTOs for data input and validation is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicit Property Update Logic for EF Core Entities](./mitigation_strategies/explicit_property_update_logic_for_ef_core_entities.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When updating EF Core entities, always begin by retrieving the existing entity from the database using its primary key through EF Core context.
    2.  Instead of relying solely on model binding or automatic update mechanisms, explicitly set only the specific properties of the retrieved EF Core entity that are intended to be modified based on business logic and user permissions.
    3.  Use conditional statements or mapping logic to precisely determine which entity properties should be updated based on the incoming data and the current application state. This ensures only authorized and intended changes are applied to the EF Core entity.
    4.  After explicitly setting the desired properties on the retrieved EF Core entity, call `SaveChanges()` on the EF Core context to persist these controlled changes to the database.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Mass Assignment (Over-posting) (High Severity) - Provides fine-grained, explicit control over entity updates, effectively preventing unintended property modifications through EF Core's update mechanisms.
    *   Business Logic Bypass (Medium Severity) - Enforces business rules and authorization checks during entity updates by explicitly controlling which properties are changed and how within the EF Core update process.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Mass Assignment: High Risk Reduction - Offers robust protection against mass assignment vulnerabilities by enforcing explicit and deliberate control over EF Core entity property updates.
    *   Business Logic Bypass: Medium Risk Reduction - Strengthens the enforcement of business logic and authorization rules during data modification operations involving EF Core entities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in critical data modification workflows, especially those involving sensitive data or complex business rules managed by EF Core entities.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to expand the use of explicit property updates to *all* data modification operations across the application that involve EF Core entities to ensure consistent security. Some simpler update operations might still rely on less explicit methods, which should be reviewed and potentially refactored.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Sensitive Data Logging in Production for EF Core](./mitigation_strategies/disable_sensitive_data_logging_in_production_for_ef_core.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Configure logging settings specifically for production environments to minimize information exposure.
    2.  Set the logging level to a less verbose level (e.g., `Warning`, `Error`, `Critical`) in production to exclude detailed debugging information and potentially sensitive data that EF Core might log.
    3.  Explicitly disable sensitive data logging features within EF Core configuration. This is crucial and can be achieved by configuring the `DbContextOptionsBuilder` during context setup to prevent EF Core from including sensitive data in exception messages, query logs, or other diagnostic outputs. Use the configuration: `.EnableSensitiveDataLogging(false)`.
    4.  Regularly audit production logging configurations to verify that sensitive data logging remains disabled for EF Core and the application as a whole.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure through Logs (Medium Severity) - Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data (e.g., query parameters containing personal information, database schema details) in production logs generated by EF Core.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure through Logs: Medium Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of sensitive data leakage through production logs generated by EF Core and related application components.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in production environment configurations. `EnableSensitiveDataLogging(false)` is explicitly set in the `DbContext` setup for production profiles to control EF Core's logging behavior.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to ensure consistent configuration across *all* production deployments and environments. Periodic automated audits of logging configurations are needed to maintain this mitigation and prevent accidental re-enabling of sensitive data logging in EF Core.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Updates of EF Core and Related NuGet Packages](./mitigation_strategies/regular_updates_of_ef_core_and_related_nuget_packages.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Establish a formal process for regularly monitoring for updates to the EF Core NuGet package and all other related NuGet packages used in the project that are part of the EF Core ecosystem or interact with it.
    2.  Actively subscribe to security advisories, release notes, and vulnerability databases specifically related to EF Core and its dependencies.
    3.  Implement a defined schedule for reviewing and applying updates to EF Core and related packages. Prioritize security patches and bug fixes to address known vulnerabilities in the EF Core framework and its dependencies.
    4.  Thoroughly test all updates in a dedicated staging environment that mirrors production before deploying them to production. This ensures compatibility and prevents regressions introduced by EF Core or package updates.
    5.  Integrate dependency scanning tools into the development pipeline to automatically identify outdated EF Core packages and known vulnerabilities in project dependencies, providing proactive alerts for necessary updates.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity) - Reduces the risk of attackers exploiting publicly known security vulnerabilities that might exist in outdated versions of EF Core or its dependent NuGet packages.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities: High Risk Reduction -  Keeps the application secure against known vulnerabilities within EF Core and its ecosystem by ensuring timely patching and updates are applied.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Partially implemented. A process exists for reviewing NuGet package updates, including EF Core, but it is not consistently enforced or fully automated. Dependency scanning for vulnerabilities in EF Core packages is not yet fully integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to fully automate dependency scanning and vulnerability alerts specifically for EF Core and its related packages. Formalize and strictly enforce the update process for EF Core and dependencies, ensuring consistent application of updates across all projects and environments.
