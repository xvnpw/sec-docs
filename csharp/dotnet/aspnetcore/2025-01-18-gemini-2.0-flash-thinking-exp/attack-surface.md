# Attack Surface Analysis for dotnet/aspnetcore

## Attack Surface: [Model Binding Vulnerabilities (Mass Assignment)](./attack_surfaces/model_binding_vulnerabilities__mass_assignment_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate request data to bind to properties that should not be directly accessible, potentially modifying sensitive data or application state.
    *   **How ASP.NET Core Contributes:** The model binding feature automatically maps incoming request data to model properties based on naming conventions. If not carefully controlled, this can lead to over-posting.
    *   **Example:** A user submitting a form with an extra field like `IsAdmin=true`, which gets bound to the corresponding property in the model if it exists and is not protected.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, data manipulation, unauthorized access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) or View Models that only contain the properties intended for binding.
        *   Utilize the `[Bind]` attribute with `Include` or `Exclude` to explicitly control which properties can be bound.
        *   Employ the `[FromBody]`, `[FromRoute]`, `[FromQuery]` attributes to be explicit about where data is expected from.
        *   Implement authorization checks before saving data to ensure the user has the right to modify the affected properties.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass due to Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass_due_to_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in the configuration or implementation of authentication middleware allow attackers to bypass authentication checks and gain unauthorized access.
    *   **How ASP.NET Core Contributes:** ASP.NET Core's flexible middleware pipeline allows for various authentication schemes. Misconfiguration of these schemes or custom authentication logic can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** Incorrectly configured cookie authentication where the `HttpOnly` or `Secure` flags are missing, or a custom authentication handler with a logical flaw.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application, access to sensitive data, ability to perform actions as other users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly understand and correctly configure authentication middleware (e.g., Cookie, JWT, OAuth 2.0).
        *   Enforce HTTPS to protect authentication cookies and tokens.
        *   Use strong and unique signing keys for JWTs.
        *   Implement robust validation of authentication credentials.
        *   Regularly review and audit authentication configurations.

## Attack Surface: [JWT (JSON Web Token) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/jwt__json_web_token__vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting weaknesses in the implementation or configuration of JWT-based authentication, leading to unauthorized access.
    *   **How ASP.NET Core Contributes:** ASP.NET Core provides libraries and middleware for handling JWT authentication. Improper use or configuration can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** Using weak or no signing algorithms (e.g., `alg: none`), insecure key storage, or failing to properly validate the token signature.
    *   **Impact:** Authentication bypass, impersonation of users, access to protected resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong and secure signing algorithms (e.g., RS256, ES256).
        *   Securely store and manage the signing keys.
        *   Always verify the token signature before trusting its claims.
        *   Implement token expiration and refresh mechanisms.
        *   Consider using established JWT libraries and follow security best practices.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) without Anti-Forgery Tokens](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf__without_anti-forgery_tokens.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions on the application.
    *   **How ASP.NET Core Contributes:** ASP.NET Core provides built-in support for anti-forgery tokens, but developers need to explicitly implement them in forms and AJAX requests. Failure to do so creates a vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafting a malicious link or embedding a form on a different website that, when clicked by an authenticated user, performs an action on the vulnerable ASP.NET Core application (e.g., changing their password).
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized state changes, data manipulation, financial loss.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use anti-forgery tokens (`@Html.AntiForgeryToken()` in Razor views or sending the token in headers for AJAX requests) for state-changing requests.
        *   Validate the anti-forgery token on the server-side using the `[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]` attribute.
        *   Ensure the `SameSite` cookie attribute is set to `Strict` or `Lax` to further mitigate CSRF.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration and Secrets Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_and_secrets_management.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information like database connection strings, API keys, or encryption keys are stored insecurely, making them vulnerable to exposure.
    *   **How ASP.NET Core Contributes:** ASP.NET Core uses configuration providers to manage settings. If not configured securely, secrets can be exposed.
    *   **Example:** Storing database connection strings directly in `appsettings.json` without encryption or using environment variables without proper access controls.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and associated resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing secrets directly in configuration files.
        *   Use secure secret management solutions like Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, or environment variables with restricted access.
        *   Encrypt sensitive configuration sections.
        *   Avoid committing secrets to version control systems.
