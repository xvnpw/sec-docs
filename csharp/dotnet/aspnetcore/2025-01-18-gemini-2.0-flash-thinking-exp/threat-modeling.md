# Threat Model Analysis for dotnet/aspnetcore

## Threat: [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) via Route Parameters](./threats/insecure_direct_object_references__idor__via_route_parameters.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might manipulate route parameters (e.g., `/items/{id}`) to access resources belonging to other users or entities by changing the `id` value. They could iterate through possible IDs or guess valid ones to gain unauthorized access. This directly involves ASP.NET Core's routing mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of resources belonging to other users, or deletion of data.
    *   **Affected Component:** ASP.NET Core Routing, specifically route parameter binding.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authorization checks to verify if the current user has permission to access the requested resource based on the provided ID.
        *   Avoid directly exposing internal database IDs in route parameters. Consider using GUIDs or other non-sequential identifiers.
        *   Implement indirect object references where a user-specific identifier is used to retrieve the actual resource ID.

## Threat: [Bypassing Security Middleware due to Incorrect Ordering](./threats/bypassing_security_middleware_due_to_incorrect_ordering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might craft requests that bypass security middleware (e.g., authentication, authorization) if the middleware pipeline, a core feature of ASP.NET Core, is not configured correctly. For example, if authentication middleware is placed after authorization middleware, authorization checks might be performed on unauthenticated requests.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, bypassing authentication and authorization controls.
    *   **Affected Component:** ASP.NET Core Middleware Pipeline.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that security middleware components are registered in the correct order in the `Startup.cs` file. Typically, authentication and authorization middleware should be placed early in the pipeline.
        *   Thoroughly review the middleware pipeline configuration to understand the order of execution.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities through Model Binding](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities_through_model_binding.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might send unexpected or malicious data in a request that gets bound to a model, potentially modifying properties that should not be directly settable by the user. This is a direct consequence of ASP.NET Core's model binding feature.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized modification of application state, potential privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected Component:** ASP.NET Core Model Binding.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) or View Models that only contain the properties that are intended to be bound from the request.
        *   Use the `[Bind]` attribute with specific property inclusions to explicitly define which properties can be bound.
        *   Avoid directly binding request data to domain entities.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might gain access to sensitive configuration data (e.g., database connection strings, API keys) if it is stored insecurely. While not solely an ASP.NET Core issue, the framework's configuration system is the mechanism involved.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the application and associated resources, data breaches, unauthorized access to external services.
    *   **Affected Component:** ASP.NET Core Configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files or environment variables.
        *   Use secure configuration providers like Azure Key Vault or HashiCorp Vault, which are often integrated with ASP.NET Core.
        *   Encrypt sensitive configuration values at rest.
        *   Restrict access to configuration files and environment variables.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Kestrel Web Server](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_kestrel_web_server.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the Kestrel web server itself to compromise the application. Kestrel is the default web server provided by ASP.NET Core.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, remote code execution, or other forms of application compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Kestrel Web Server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the ASP.NET Core framework and Kestrel package updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow security best practices for configuring Kestrel, such as setting appropriate timeouts and limits.
        *   Consider using a reverse proxy like IIS or Nginx in front of Kestrel for added security.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to SignalR Hubs or Methods](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_signalr_hubs_or_methods.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might attempt to connect to SignalR hubs or invoke methods without proper authentication or authorization. This directly involves the security features (or lack thereof) implemented within ASP.NET Core SignalR.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to real-time communication, data breaches, manipulation of application state.
    *   **Affected Component:** ASP.NET Core SignalR.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement authentication and authorization for SignalR hubs using mechanisms like JWT tokens or cookies.
        *   Use authorization attributes (e.g., `[Authorize]`) on hub classes and methods to restrict access.
        *   Validate user input received through SignalR connections.

## Threat: [Compromise of the Data Protection Key Ring](./threats/compromise_of_the_data_protection_key_ring.md)

*   **Description:** If the key ring used by the ASP.NET Core Data Protection API is compromised, an attacker can decrypt data protected by it, such as authentication cookies or other sensitive information. This is a direct vulnerability related to the ASP.NET Core Data Protection API.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected data, session hijacking, potential full application compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** ASP.NET Core Data Protection API.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use a persistent and secure key storage provider for production environments (e.g., Azure Key Vault, file system with restricted permissions).
        *   Regularly rotate the data protection keys.
        *   Protect the key storage location with appropriate access controls.
