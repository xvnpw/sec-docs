## Attack Tree Path: [Steal or Predict Anti-Forgery Tokens -> Cookie Theft (e.g., via XSS)](./attack_tree_paths/steal_or_predict_anti-forgery_tokens_-_cookie_theft__e_g___via_xss_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker first attempts to obtain a valid anti-forgery token. This could be achieved through various methods, such as:
    *   Exploiting a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability to inject malicious JavaScript that steals the token from the user's browser.
    *   In less common scenarios, attempting to predict the token if the generation mechanism is weak (though ASP.NET Core's default implementation is generally strong against this).
    *   Once the anti-forgery token is obtained, the attacker then focuses on stealing the user's authentication or session cookies. This is most commonly done through:
        *   Exploiting an XSS vulnerability to inject JavaScript that retrieves the cookie values and sends them to the attacker's server.
    *   **Impact:** By combining these steps, the attacker can perform actions on behalf of the legitimate user (using the stolen anti-forgery token) after successfully authenticating as that user (using the stolen cookies), leading to full account takeover and the ability to perform any action the user can.

## Attack Tree Path: [Session Hijacking -> Cookie Theft (e.g., via XSS)](./attack_tree_paths/session_hijacking_-_cookie_theft__e_g___via_xss_.md)

**Attack Vector:**
    *   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker aims to obtain a valid session identifier. This can be done through various means:
        *   Sniffing network traffic if the connection is not secured with HTTPS.
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities that reveal session IDs in URLs or error messages.
        *   Using malware on the user's machine.
    *   **Cookie Theft (e.g., via XSS):**  Similar to the previous path, the attacker exploits an XSS vulnerability to steal the session cookie directly from the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:** If the session identifier is stored in a cookie and that cookie is stolen (often via XSS), the attacker can directly use that cookie to impersonate the user without needing their credentials. This grants immediate access to the user's account and all associated privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Mass Assignment Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/mass_assignment_exploitation.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate HTTP request parameters to modify internal object properties that were not intended to be directly bound from user input.
    *   **Impact:** This can lead to:
        *   Modifying sensitive user data (e.g., changing email addresses, passwords).
        *   Elevating user privileges by setting administrative flags.
        *   Bypassing security checks by manipulating internal state.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/authentication_bypass.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers find flaws in the authentication middleware or custom authentication logic that allow them to gain access without providing valid credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Complete circumvention of the application's security, granting unauthorized access to all functionalities and data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Credential Storage](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_credential_storage.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application stores user credentials (passwords) in a way that is not sufficiently secure (e.g., plain text, weak hashing algorithms without salting).
    *   **Impact:** If the storage mechanism is compromised, attackers can easily retrieve user passwords, leading to mass account compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authorization Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/authorization_bypass.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers find ways to access resources or functionalities without having the necessary permissions or roles. This can be due to flaws in the authorization middleware, incorrect policy definitions, or logic errors in authorization checks.
    *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive data or functionalities that should be restricted, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized actions, or privilege escalation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposed Secrets in Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/exposed_secrets_in_configuration_files.md)

**Attack Vector:** Sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or encryption keys are stored directly in configuration files (e.g., `appsettings.json`) without proper protection.
    *   **Impact:** If an attacker gains access to these configuration files (e.g., through insecure deployment practices or directory traversal vulnerabilities), they can obtain critical secrets that can be used to compromise backend systems, access databases, or impersonate the application with external services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Key Material Compromise](./attack_tree_paths/key_material_compromise.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers gain access to the data protection keys used by ASP.NET Core's Data Protection API. These keys are used to encrypt sensitive data like anti-forgery tokens, authentication cookies, and other protected payloads.
    *   **Impact:** If the key material is compromised, attackers can decrypt this sensitive data, leading to:
        *   Bypassing anti-forgery protection.
        *   Forging authentication cookies and impersonating users.
        *   Accessing other data protected by the Data Protection API.
