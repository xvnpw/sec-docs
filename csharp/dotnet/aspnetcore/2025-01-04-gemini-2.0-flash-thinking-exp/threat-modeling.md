# Threat Model Analysis for dotnet/aspnetcore

## Threat: [Misconfigured Middleware Order](./threats/misconfigured_middleware_order.md)

**Description:** An attacker can exploit the incorrect ordering of middleware components in the ASP.NET Core pipeline. For example, if authentication middleware runs *after* authorization middleware, an attacker might be able to bypass authentication checks and access protected resources. They would craft a request that targets a protected endpoint expecting the authorization middleware to be executed first.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, functionality, or resources. Potential for privilege escalation if authorization checks are skipped.

**Affected Component:** Middleware Pipeline (specifically the `app.Use...` and `app.Run...` methods in `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs`)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- Carefully review and order middleware components in the `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs` file.
- Ensure authentication and authorization middleware are placed early in the pipeline.
- Thoroughly test the middleware pipeline with different request scenarios.
- Utilize framework features like endpoint routing to define authorization requirements at the endpoint level.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Custom Middleware](./threats/vulnerable_custom_middleware.md)

**Description:** An attacker can exploit security flaws within custom middleware components developed for the ASP.NET Core application. This could involve vulnerabilities like information leaks, authentication bypasses within the custom logic, or denial-of-service conditions due to inefficient processing. They would craft requests that trigger the vulnerable code path within the custom middleware.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized access, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution depending on the vulnerability.

**Affected Component:** Custom Middleware (any class implementing `IMiddleware` or using the `Use` extension method with a delegate)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- Apply secure coding practices when developing custom middleware.
- Conduct thorough code reviews and security testing of custom middleware.
- Be cautious when handling user input and external data within custom middleware.
- Avoid storing sensitive information in middleware state unless absolutely necessary and properly secured.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities via Model Binding](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities_via_model_binding.md)

**Description:** An attacker can send extra data in a request that gets automatically bound to model properties that were not intended to be set directly. This can lead to unintended modifications of data, including sensitive information or application state. The attacker crafts a request with additional parameters corresponding to model properties.

**Impact:** Data manipulation, privilege escalation (if sensitive properties like roles can be modified), unexpected application behavior.

**Affected Component:** Model Binding (specifically the automatic binding of request data to action parameters or model properties)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- Use the `[Bind]` attribute to explicitly specify which properties should be bound during model binding.
- Utilize view models (Data Transfer Objects - DTOs) that only contain the properties intended for binding.
- Employ the `ExplicitBindProperty` attribute or similar mechanisms for fine-grained control over binding.
- Avoid directly binding request data to entity framework entities in write operations.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Input Formatters](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_input_formatters.md)

**Description:** An attacker can exploit vulnerabilities in the deserialization process used by ASP.NET Core's input formatters (e.g., JSON, XML). By sending maliciously crafted input data, they might be able to trigger arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other unexpected behavior.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, or other application-level vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** Input Formatters (e.g., `Newtonsoft.Json`, `System.Text.Json`, XML formatters)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- Keep the JSON and XML serialization libraries updated to the latest versions.
- Be cautious when deserializing data from untrusted sources.
- Implement custom deserialization logic with proper validation and sanitization.
- Consider using safer serialization options or avoiding deserialization of complex objects from untrusted sources if possible.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass due to Insecure Authentication Schemes](./threats/authentication_bypass_due_to_insecure_authentication_schemes.md)

**Description:** An attacker can exploit weaknesses in the chosen authentication scheme configured within ASP.NET Core. This could involve vulnerabilities in cookie handling, token validation, or the underlying authentication protocol itself. They would attempt to forge credentials or manipulate the authentication process to gain unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the application and its resources, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.

**Affected Component:** Authentication Middleware and Authentication Handlers (e.g., Cookie Authentication, JWT Bearer Authentication, etc.)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- Use strong and well-vetted authentication schemes (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect).
- Properly configure authentication middleware with secure settings (e.g., `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags for cookies).
- Keep authentication libraries updated.
- Implement robust token validation and revocation mechanisms.
- Avoid using custom or home-grown authentication schemes unless absolutely necessary and rigorously tested.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass due to Misconfigured Authorization Policies](./threats/authorization_bypass_due_to_misconfigured_authorization_policies.md)

**Description:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to resources or functionalities due to flaws in the defined authorization policies within ASP.NET Core. This could involve overly permissive policies, incorrect role assignments, or logic errors in custom authorization handlers. They would craft requests that should be denied but are incorrectly authorized.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.

**Affected Component:** Authorization Middleware and Authorization Handlers (`IAuthorizationPolicyProvider`, `IAuthorizationHandler`)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- Define granular and specific authorization policies.
- Regularly review and test authorization policies to ensure they are correctly implemented.
- Use role-based or claim-based authorization where appropriate.
- Implement custom authorization handlers carefully and thoroughly test their logic.
- Avoid relying solely on client-side checks for authorization.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive configuration data (e.g., database connection strings, API keys) if it is stored insecurely. This could involve storing secrets in plain text in configuration files or environment variables without proper protection. They might exploit vulnerabilities in the hosting environment or gain unauthorized access to the server's file system or environment variables.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and potentially related systems if sensitive credentials are exposed.

**Affected Component:** Configuration System (`IConfiguration`, `appsettings.json`, environment variables)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files or environment variables.
- Utilize secure configuration providers like Azure Key Vault or HashiCorp Vault for storing secrets.
- Encrypt sensitive configuration data at rest.
- Implement access controls to restrict who can access configuration data.

## Threat: [Insecure Data Protection Key Management](./threats/insecure_data_protection_key_management.md)

**Description:** An attacker can compromise data protected by the ASP.NET Core Data Protection API if the encryption keys are not properly managed or protected. This could involve storing keys in insecure locations or using weak key derivation methods. If keys are compromised, they can decrypt sensitive data.

**Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive data that was intended to be protected by encryption.

**Affected Component:** Data Protection API (`IDataProtectionProvider`, key storage mechanisms)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- Store Data Protection keys in a secure location, such as the file system with appropriate permissions or Azure Key Vault.
- Use strong key derivation functions.
- Consider rotating Data Protection keys periodically.
- Ensure the key storage location is backed up and protected against unauthorized access.
