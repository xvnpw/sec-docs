# Attack Surface Analysis for dotnet/aspnetcore

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment via Model Binding](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_via_model_binding.md)

**Description:** Attackers can manipulate HTTP request parameters to bind unexpected values to model properties, potentially modifying data they shouldn't have access to.

**How ASP.NET Core Contributes:** ASP.NET Core's model binding automatically maps request data to model properties based on naming conventions. Without proper safeguards, this can be exploited.

**Example:** A user updating their profile sends a request with an additional parameter like `IsAdmin=true`, which gets bound to the `IsAdmin` property of the user model if not explicitly protected.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) or View Models that only contain the properties intended for binding.
*   Utilize the `[Bind]` attribute with `Include` or `Exclude` to explicitly control which properties can be bound.
*   Implement robust authorization checks before saving changes based on bound data.
*   Consider using immutable models where appropriate.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Middleware Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/authentication_middleware_misconfiguration.md)

**Description:** Incorrectly configured authentication middleware can lead to authentication bypasses or vulnerabilities.

**How ASP.NET Core Contributes:** ASP.NET Core's flexible authentication pipeline relies on developers correctly configuring and ordering authentication middleware.

**Example:**  A JWT bearer authentication scheme is configured without proper audience validation, allowing tokens intended for other applications to be used.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the application and its resources.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly understand the configuration options for each authentication middleware used (e.g., JWT, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect).
*   Validate issuer, audience, and signing keys for JWT tokens.
*   Use strong, randomly generated secrets and keys.
*   Enforce HTTPS to protect against credential theft.
*   Regularly review and update authentication middleware configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Policy Flaws](./attack_surfaces/authorization_policy_flaws.md)

**Description:** Insufficiently restrictive or flawed authorization policies can allow users to access resources or perform actions they shouldn't.

**How ASP.NET Core Contributes:** ASP.NET Core's authorization framework allows defining policies based on roles, claims, and custom requirements. Errors in defining or applying these policies create vulnerabilities.

**Example:** An authorization policy checks for a specific role but doesn't account for edge cases or alternative ways a user might gain that role.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Design authorization policies with a "least privilege" principle.
*   Thoroughly test authorization logic with various user roles and permissions.
*   Use attribute-based authorization (`[Authorize]`) on controllers and actions.
*   Consider using policy-based authorization for more complex scenarios.
*   Regularly review and update authorization policies as application requirements change.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Middleware](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_middleware.md)

**Description:** Security flaws within custom middleware components added to the ASP.NET Core pipeline.

**How ASP.NET Core Contributes:** ASP.NET Core's middleware pipeline allows developers to add custom logic for request processing, which can introduce vulnerabilities if not implemented securely.

**Example:** Custom middleware designed to sanitize input has a bypass vulnerability, allowing malicious data to pass through.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the flaw)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Apply secure coding practices when developing custom middleware.
*   Perform thorough security testing and code reviews of custom middleware.
*   Avoid implementing security-sensitive logic in custom middleware if possible; leverage built-in ASP.NET Core features.
*   Keep custom middleware focused and well-defined to reduce complexity.

## Attack Surface: [SignalR Message Injection](./attack_surfaces/signalr_message_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers can craft and send malicious messages through SignalR hubs, potentially affecting other connected clients or the server.

**How ASP.NET Core Contributes:** ASP.NET Core SignalR facilitates real-time communication. If input validation and authorization are not properly implemented in hub methods, it can be exploited.

**Example:** A malicious client sends a message containing JavaScript code that gets executed on other clients' browsers.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), denial of service, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Sanitize and validate all input received through SignalR hub methods.
*   Implement proper authorization checks to ensure only authorized users can send specific messages.
*   Avoid directly rendering user-provided content without encoding it properly.
*   Consider using message signing or encryption for sensitive communications.
