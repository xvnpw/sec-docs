## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Model Binding (HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_model_binding__high_risk__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector: Mass Assignment Vulnerability**
    * **Attacker crafts malicious input data:** The attacker crafts HTTP requests (e.g., POST, PUT) with JSON or form data containing extra properties that are not intended to be bound to the model.
    * **ASP.NET Core binds unintended properties:** Due to missing or insufficient use of the `[Bind]` attribute or global configuration issues, ASP.NET Core's model binding mechanism inadvertently assigns values to model properties that should not be accessible for external modification.
    * **CRITICAL NODE: Modification of sensitive data:** This leads to the attacker being able to modify sensitive application state, database records, or other critical data through the unintended binding of properties.

* **Attack Vector: Injection through Model Binding (CRITICAL NODE)**
    * **Attacker provides malicious input interpreted as code:** The attacker crafts input data that, when processed by a custom model binder or during type conversion, is interpreted as executable code (e.g., through expression injection or other code injection techniques).
    * **CRITICAL NODE: ASP.NET Core executes injected code:** The ASP.NET Core application executes the attacker-controlled code, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.

* **Attack Vector: Type Confusion/Coercion Exploits (CRITICAL NODE)**
    * **Attacker provides input of unexpected type:** The attacker provides input data with a data type that is different from the expected type for a model property.
    * **ASP.NET Core attempts to coerce:** ASP.NET Core's model binding attempts to automatically convert the provided type to the expected type.
    * **CRITICAL NODE: Unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities:** This type coercion can lead to unexpected behavior, such as integer overflows, buffer overflows (if interacting with native code), or other vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Insecure Configuration and Secrets Management (HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_insecure_configuration_and_secrets_management__high_risk__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector: Exposed Configuration Secrets (HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE)**
    * **Sensitive info in config files/env vars:** Sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, or encryption keys are stored directly in configuration files (e.g., `appsettings.json`) or environment variables without proper encryption or secure storage.
    * **Attacker gains access to config:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to these configuration files or environment variables through various means (e.g., directory traversal vulnerabilities, server compromise, insider threat).
    * **CRITICAL NODE: Unauthorized access or control:** With access to the secrets, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to databases, external services, or decrypt sensitive data, leading to a full compromise of the application and potentially other systems.

* **Attack Vector: Manipulation of Configuration Sources**
    * **Attacker modifies configuration sources:** The attacker finds a way to modify the configuration sources used by the ASP.NET Core application (e.g., by writing to configuration files on disk, manipulating environment variables if the application has insufficient permissions).
    * **CRITICAL NODE: Malicious configuration values injected:** The attacker injects malicious configuration values that can alter the application's behavior. This could include changing database connection strings, paths to loaded assemblies, or other critical settings.
    * **CRITICAL NODE: Altered application behavior, code execution:** By injecting malicious configuration, the attacker can potentially force the application to load malicious code or connect to attacker-controlled resources, leading to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Vulnerabilities in SignalR Hubs (HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_signalr_hubs__high_risk__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector: Insecure Hub Methods (HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE)**
    * **Unsanitized user input in hub methods:** SignalR hub methods accept user input from connected clients without proper sanitization or validation.
    * **CRITICAL NODE: Code execution or data manipulation:** Malicious input sent through hub methods can be processed by the server without adequate security checks, potentially leading to code execution on the server (e.g., through command injection or other vulnerabilities) or the manipulation of application data.

* **Attack Vector: Authorization Bypass in Hub Methods**
    * **Flawed/missing authorization in hub methods:** Authorization logic is either missing or implemented incorrectly in SignalR hub methods, allowing unauthorized users to invoke sensitive methods.
    * **CRITICAL NODE: Unauthorized access to hub methods:** Attackers can bypass intended access controls and invoke hub methods they should not have access to, potentially leading to data breaches or the execution of privileged actions.
