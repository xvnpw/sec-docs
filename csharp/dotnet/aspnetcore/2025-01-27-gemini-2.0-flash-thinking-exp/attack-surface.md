# Attack Surface Analysis for dotnet/aspnetcore

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Pipeline Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/middleware_pipeline_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured or missing middleware in the ASP.NET Core pipeline can lead to security vulnerabilities by bypassing security checks or exposing unintended functionality.
*   **ASP.NET Core Contribution:** ASP.NET Core's middleware pipeline architecture is central to request processing and security. Developers are responsible for ordering and configuring middleware correctly.
*   **Example:** Placing authentication middleware *after* authorization middleware.
    *   **How it works:** Requests reach authorization middleware without prior authentication, potentially allowing unauthorized access to protected resources if authorization is not correctly implemented independently.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Review Middleware Order:** Carefully review the order of middleware in `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs` to ensure security middleware (authentication, authorization, CORS, security headers) is placed appropriately *before* request handling middleware.
        *   **Use Security Headers Middleware:** Include and properly configure middleware like `UseHsts()`, `UseCsp()`, `UseXContentTypeOptions()`, `UseReferrerPolicy()`, and `UseXXssProtection()` to enable security headers.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for CORS:** Configure CORS middleware (`UseCors()`) to allow requests only from explicitly trusted origins, avoiding wildcard (`*`) origins.

## Attack Surface: [Routing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/routing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in route definitions or handling can allow attackers to access unintended endpoints, bypass security checks, or inject malicious data through route parameters.
*   **ASP.NET Core Contribution:** ASP.NET Core's routing system defines how requests are mapped to controllers and actions. Incorrect route definitions or parameter handling can create vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** SQL Injection via Route Parameter.
    *   **How it works:** A route like `/products/{id}` is defined, and the `id` parameter is directly used in a database query without sanitization. An attacker can inject SQL code in the `id` parameter (e.g., `/products/1; DROP TABLE Products;--`).
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Always sanitize and validate route parameters before using them in backend operations (database queries, file system access, etc.). Use parameterized queries or ORM features to prevent SQL injection.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Routes:** Define routes as narrowly as possible, only exposing necessary endpoints. Avoid overly broad or ambiguous route patterns.
        *   **Remove Debug Endpoints in Production:** Ensure debug endpoints (e.g., those enabled during development) are disabled or removed in production deployments.

## Attack Surface: [Model Binding and Validation Issues](./attack_surfaces/model_binding_and_validation_issues.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arise from improper handling of data binding from requests to models and insufficient validation of user input.
*   **ASP.NET Core Contribution:** ASP.NET Core's model binding automatically maps request data to action parameters and models.  Developers are responsible for configuring validation rules and handling binding securely.
*   **Example:** Mass Assignment (Over-posting).
    *   **How it works:** A model has properties that should not be directly modified by users (e.g., `IsAdmin`). If model binding is not restricted, an attacker can send a request with extra data including `IsAdmin=true`, potentially elevating their privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** Use DTOs specifically designed for request payloads, containing only properties that are intended to be modified by users. Map DTOs to domain models in the application logic.
        *   **Server-Side Validation (Mandatory):** Always perform server-side validation, even if client-side validation is implemented. Client-side validation can be easily bypassed.
        *   **Whitelist Approach for Model Binding:** Explicitly define which properties are allowed to be bound from requests, instead of relying on a blacklist approach.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Flaws](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Weak or improperly implemented authentication and authorization mechanisms allow unauthorized users to access protected resources or perform actions they should not be allowed to.
*   **ASP.NET Core Contribution:** ASP.NET Core provides a flexible authentication and authorization framework. Developers must choose appropriate schemes and implement them correctly.
*   **Example:** Insecure Cookie Authentication Configuration.
    *   **How it works:** Cookie authentication is used, but the cookie is not marked as `HttpOnly` or `Secure`, or is transmitted over HTTP instead of HTTPS. This makes the cookie vulnerable to XSS attacks or network sniffing.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, unauthorized access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Strong Authentication Schemes:** Choose robust authentication methods like OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, or JWT Bearer Authentication, depending on the application requirements.
        *   **Secure Cookie Configuration:** Configure cookie-based authentication to use `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` attributes. Enforce HTTPS for all communication.
        *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Policy-Based Authorization:** Implement a robust authorization system using roles or policies to control access to resources based on user permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Razor Pages and MVC View Engine Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/razor_pages_and_mvc_view_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Improper handling of user input within Razor views can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
*   **ASP.NET Core Contribution:** Razor Pages and MVC views are used to render dynamic content. Developers must ensure proper encoding and sanitization of data displayed in views.
*   **Example:** XSS in Razor View.
    *   **How it works:** User-provided data is displayed in a Razor view using `@Model.UserName` without proper HTML encoding. If `Model.UserName` contains malicious JavaScript code (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`), it will be executed in the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, website defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **HTML Encoding by Default:** Razor views automatically HTML-encode output by default using `@`. Rely on this default encoding for most scenarios.
        *   **Avoid `Html.Raw()` (or use with extreme caution):**  `Html.Raw()` bypasses HTML encoding. Only use it when you are absolutely certain that the data is already safe HTML and you explicitly need to render HTML markup. Sanitize data before using `Html.Raw()` if necessary.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers to further mitigate XSS risks by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.

## Attack Surface: [SignalR Specific Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/signalr_specific_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  SignalR applications can be vulnerable to injection attacks through hub methods, denial of service, and authorization bypass if not properly secured.
*   **ASP.NET Core Contribution:** ASP.NET Core SignalR provides real-time communication capabilities. Developers need to secure hub methods and connections.
*   **Example:** Injection Attack via SignalR Hub Method.
    *   **How it works:** A SignalR hub method receives user input and directly uses it in a database query without sanitization. An attacker can inject malicious code through the hub method parameters.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization and Validation in Hub Methods:**  Sanitize and validate all input received by SignalR hub methods before using it in backend operations.
        *   **Authorization for Hub Methods:** Implement authorization checks within hub methods to ensure only authorized users can invoke them. Use `[Authorize]` attribute or custom authorization logic.

## Attack Surface: [Blazor Specific Vulnerabilities (Server-Side Blazor)](./attack_surfaces/blazor_specific_vulnerabilities__server-side_blazor_.md)

*   **Description:** Server-Side Blazor applications introduce state management vulnerabilities.
*   **ASP.NET Core Contribution:** Server-Side Blazor relies on SignalR for communication and maintains state on the server. Developers must manage state securely.
*   **Example:** State Injection.
    *   **How it works:**  A Blazor component stores user-specific state on the server. If this state is not properly isolated or validated, an attacker might be able to manipulate or inject state belonging to another user.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized access, session hijacking.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure State Management:** Implement secure state management practices, ensuring state is properly scoped to user sessions and protected from unauthorized access or modification.
        *   **Input Validation in Components:** Validate all user input within Blazor components, both on the client-side and server-side.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Security](./attack_surfaces/configuration_security.md)

*   **Description:**  Insecure configuration settings, especially within ASP.NET Core configuration files, can expose sensitive information.
*   **ASP.NET Core Contribution:** ASP.NET Core applications rely on configuration files like `appsettings.json` and `secrets.json`. Developers must ensure secure configuration practices.
*   **Example:** Exposure of `appsettings.json` in Production.
    *   **How it works:**  The `appsettings.json` file, containing connection strings and API keys, is accidentally deployed to a publicly accessible location in the production environment.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to external services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Storage for Secrets:** Use secure configuration providers like Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, or environment variables to store sensitive information (connection strings, API keys, etc.) instead of plain text configuration files.
        *   **Separate Development and Production Configurations:** Maintain separate configuration files for development and production environments. Ensure production configurations are hardened and do not contain debug settings.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for File System Permissions:**  Restrict file system permissions on configuration files and application directories to prevent unauthorized access.
