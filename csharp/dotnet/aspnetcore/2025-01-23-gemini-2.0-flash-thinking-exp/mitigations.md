# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for dotnet/aspnetcore

## Mitigation Strategy: [Leverage ASP.NET Core's Model Validation](./mitigation_strategies/leverage_asp_net_core's_model_validation.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Leverage ASP.NET Core's Model Validation
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Validation Attributes in Models:** In your C# models (e.g., classes used for data transfer objects or view models), decorate properties with data annotation attributes from the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace. Examples include `[Required]`, `[StringLength]`, `[EmailAddress]`, `[Range]`, `[RegularExpression]`.
    2.  **Check `ModelState.IsValid` in Controllers/Razor Pages:** In your controller actions or Razor Page handlers, after receiving data (e.g., from model binding), check the `ModelState.IsValid` property. This property is automatically populated by ASP.NET Core based on the validation attributes.
    3.  **Return Validation Errors to Client:** If `ModelState.IsValid` is `false`, return a `BadRequest` (HTTP 400) response to the client, including the validation errors from `ModelState`. These errors can be displayed to the user to guide them in correcting their input.
    4.  **Implement Custom Validation (Optional):** For more complex validation logic, create custom validation attributes by inheriting from `ValidationAttribute` or implement `IValidatableObject` in your models.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity)
    *   Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity)
    *   SQL Injection (Low Severity - Indirect Mitigation)
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Low Severity - Indirect Mitigation)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities: High Risk Reduction
    *   Data Integrity Issues: High Risk Reduction
    *   SQL Injection: Low Risk Reduction
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Low Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in most controllers and Razor Pages handling user input, particularly in registration and data update functionalities. Data annotation attributes are used in most models.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Some internal API endpoints used for background tasks might lack robust model validation. Validation could be strengthened in areas handling file uploads and complex data structures.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Employ Anti-XSS Encoding](./mitigation_strategies/employ_anti-xss_encoding.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Employ Anti-XSS Encoding
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use Razor's Default Encoding:**  When displaying dynamic data in Razor views (`.cshtml` files), use standard Razor syntax like `@Model.PropertyName` or `@variable`. Razor automatically HTML-encodes output by default.
    2.  **Utilize HTML Helpers:** For more control, use HTML helpers like `@Html.Encode(Model.PropertyName)` or tag helpers which also provide context-aware encoding.
    3.  **Avoid `@Html.Raw` and `IHtmlContentBuilder` (Unless Absolutely Necessary):**  Minimize the use of `@Html.Raw` and `IHtmlContentBuilder` as they bypass encoding. If you must use them, ensure the content is already safely encoded or sanitized.
    4.  **JSON Serialization for APIs:** For Web APIs returning JSON responses, ensure you are using standard JSON serialization (e.g., `JsonResult`, `Ok(object)`) which inherently handles encoding for JSON format.
    5.  **Context-Aware Encoding:** Understand that encoding should be context-aware. HTML encoding is for HTML context, URL encoding for URLs, JavaScript encoding for JavaScript strings, etc. ASP.NET Core helpers generally handle this context awareness.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): High Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Razor views extensively use default encoding and HTML helpers. JSON serialization is used for API responses.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Review all instances of `@Html.Raw` and `IHtmlContentBuilder` to ensure they are absolutely necessary and the content is properly sanitized before rendering.  Potentially missing in custom JavaScript code that dynamically renders content on the client-side (client-side encoding might be needed in such cases).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize ASP.NET Core Identity](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_asp_net_core_identity.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize ASP.NET Core Identity
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Include Identity Packages:** Add the necessary NuGet packages for ASP.NET Core Identity (e.g., `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore`, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.UI`).
    2.  **Configure Identity in `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs`:** In your application's startup, configure Identity services using `services.AddIdentity<ApplicationUser, IdentityRole>()` and related methods. Specify the user and role types, and the data store (e.g., Entity Framework Core context).
    3.  **Use Identity Managers:** In your controllers and services, inject and use Identity managers like `UserManager<ApplicationUser>` and `SignInManager<ApplicationUser>` for user management tasks (registration, login, password management, etc.).
    4.  **Implement Authentication and Authorization:** Use Identity's features for authentication (e.g., `SignInManager.PasswordSignInAsync`) and authorization (e.g., `[Authorize]` attribute, policy-based authorization).
    5.  **Customize Identity (Optional):** Customize Identity by extending `IdentityUser`, `IdentityRole`, or creating custom stores if needed for specific application requirements.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Authentication Bypass (High Severity)
    *   Password Storage Vulnerabilities (High Severity)
    *   Account Enumeration (Medium Severity)
    *   Session Fixation (Medium Severity)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Authentication Bypass: High Risk Reduction
    *   Password Storage Vulnerabilities: High Risk Reduction
    *   Account Enumeration: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Session Fixation: Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** ASP.NET Core Identity is used for user registration, login, password management, and basic role-based authorization throughout the application.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Advanced features of Identity like multi-factor authentication (MFA) are not yet enabled.  More granular claims-based authorization could be implemented for specific features.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure API Endpoints with JWT Bearer Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/secure_api_endpoints_with_jwt_bearer_authentication.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure API Endpoints with JWT Bearer Authentication
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Install JWT Packages:** Add necessary NuGet packages for JWT authentication (e.g., `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`).
    2.  **Configure JWT Authentication in `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs`:** Configure JWT Bearer authentication in your application startup using `services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme).AddJwtBearer(...)`. Specify the JWT issuer, audience, signing key, and token validation parameters.
    3.  **Generate JWTs on Login:** Upon successful user authentication (e.g., using ASP.NET Core Identity), generate a JWT containing user claims (e.g., user ID, roles). Use a library like `System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt` to create and sign JWTs.
    4.  **Protect API Endpoints with `[Authorize]`:** Apply the `[Authorize]` attribute to your API controllers or actions that require authentication.
    5.  **Client-Side JWT Handling:** On the client-side (e.g., JavaScript application, mobile app), store the JWT securely (e.g., in local storage or cookies). Include the JWT in the `Authorization` header (Bearer scheme) of subsequent API requests.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized API Access (High Severity)
    *   API Key Leakage (Medium Severity - if API keys were used instead)
    *   Replay Attacks (Medium Severity)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized API Access: High Risk Reduction
    *   API Key Leakage: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Replay Attacks: Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** JWT Bearer authentication is implemented for the primary Web API used by the front-end application.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Some internal APIs used for administrative tasks might still rely on less secure authentication methods or lack proper authorization checks.  Consider implementing refresh tokens for JWTs to improve security and user experience.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) Headers](./mitigation_strategies/implement_content_security_policy__csp__headers.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) Headers
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a CSP Middleware or Custom Implementation:** Use a CSP middleware package (e.g., `NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders`) or implement custom middleware to add CSP headers to HTTP responses within your ASP.NET Core application.
    2.  **Define CSP Directives:** Define a strict CSP policy that specifies allowed sources for different types of resources (scripts, styles, images, fonts, etc.). Start with a restrictive policy and gradually relax it as needed. Examples of directives include `default-src`, `script-src`, `style-src`, `img-src`, `font-src`, `connect-src`, `frame-ancestors`.
    3.  **Report-Only Mode (Initially):**  Start by deploying CSP in report-only mode (`Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header). This allows you to monitor violations without blocking resources, helping you refine your policy.
    4.  **Enforce CSP Policy:** Once you are confident in your CSP policy, switch to enforcing mode by using the `Content-Security-Policy` header.
    5.  **Refine and Maintain CSP:** Regularly review and refine your CSP policy as your application evolves and new resources are added. Monitor CSP reports to identify and address violations.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity)
    *   Clickjacking (Medium Severity - Indirect Mitigation)
    *   Data Injection Attacks (Medium Severity - Indirect Mitigation)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): High Risk Reduction
    *   Clickjacking: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Data Injection Attacks: Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Basic security headers middleware is implemented, but CSP is currently not enabled or is in report-only mode with a very permissive policy.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  A strict and well-defined CSP policy needs to be developed and enforced.  CSP reporting needs to be configured to monitor violations and refine the policy.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Rate Limiting Middleware](./mitigation_strategies/implement_rate_limiting_middleware.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Rate Limiting Middleware
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Install Rate Limiting Package:** Add a rate limiting middleware package (e.g., `AspNetCoreRateLimit`, `NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders`) to your ASP.NET Core project.
    2.  **Configure Rate Limiting in `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs`:** Configure the rate limiting middleware in your application startup. Define rate limiting rules based on factors like IP address, client ID, or user ID. Specify limits for different time windows (e.g., requests per minute, requests per hour).
    3.  **Apply Rate Limiting Globally or Selectively:** Configure the middleware to apply rate limiting globally to all requests or selectively to specific endpoints or controllers within your ASP.NET Core application.
    4.  **Customize Rate Limiting Rules:** Customize rate limiting rules based on your application's needs and traffic patterns. Consider different limits for different types of requests or user roles.
    5.  **Handle Rate Limit Exceeded Responses:** Configure how the application should respond when rate limits are exceeded (e.g., return a `429 Too Many Requests` status code with a retry-after header) using ASP.NET Core's response handling mechanisms.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Brute-Force Attacks (High Severity)
    *   Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks (Medium Severity)
    *   API Abuse (Medium Severity)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Brute-Force Attacks: High Risk Reduction
    *   Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   API Abuse: Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Basic rate limiting is implemented globally based on IP address, with a relatively high limit.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  More granular rate limiting rules are needed, especially for sensitive endpoints like login and API endpoints.  Consider implementing different rate limits for authenticated and unauthenticated users.  Rate limiting based on user ID or client ID should be explored.
