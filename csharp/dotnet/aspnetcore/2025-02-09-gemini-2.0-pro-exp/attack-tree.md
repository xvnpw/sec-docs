## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit ASP.NET Core Vulnerabilities -> Deserialization Vulnerabilities -> Unsafe Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_asp_net_core_vulnerabilities_-_deserialization_vulnerabilities_-_unsafe_confi_af087841.md)

*   **Description:** This path involves an attacker exploiting a vulnerability in how the ASP.NET Core application handles deserialization of data.  Specifically, it targets misconfigurations that allow for unsafe deserialization, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Identify Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker identifies an endpoint that accepts serialized data (e.g., JSON, XML).
    2.  **Craft Malicious Payload:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload that, when deserialized, will execute arbitrary code on the server. This often involves using known "gadget chains" or exploiting type confusion vulnerabilities.
    3.  **Send Payload:** The attacker sends the malicious payload to the vulnerable endpoint.
    4.  **Achieve RCE:** If the application is misconfigured to use an unsafe deserializer (like `BinaryFormatter` without proper restrictions, or `System.Text.Json` with overly permissive type handling), the payload will be deserialized, and the attacker's code will be executed.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Avoid using `BinaryFormatter`.
    *   Use `System.Text.Json` with strong type validation and a whitelist of allowed types for polymorphic deserialization.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization *before* deserialization.
    *   Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for model binding and avoid binding directly to domain models.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Abuse ASP.NET Core Misconfiguration -> Kestrel Configuration -> [CRITICAL] Leaked Secrets in Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_abuse_asp_net_core_misconfiguration_-_kestrel_configuration_-__critical__leaked_secre_b8d5bda5.md)

*   **Description:** This path focuses on the attacker gaining access to sensitive information (secrets) due to misconfiguration of the Kestrel web server or the application's configuration system.  Leaked secrets can then be used to compromise other parts of the system.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Identify Exposure:** The attacker identifies a way to access configuration information. This could be through:
        *   A misconfigured Kestrel endpoint that exposes configuration files.
        *   Source code repositories (e.g., GitHub) where secrets have been accidentally committed.
        *   Error messages that leak configuration details.
        *   Unprotected configuration endpoints (e.g., `/config`).
    2.  **Extract Secrets:** The attacker extracts sensitive information, such as database connection strings, API keys, encryption keys, or authentication credentials.
    3.  **Leverage Secrets:** The attacker uses the extracted secrets to gain unauthorized access to other resources, such as databases, cloud services, or other applications.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   *Never* store secrets in source control.
    *   Use a secure configuration provider (e.g., Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, environment variables).
    *   Implement strict access controls to secrets.
    *   Rotate secrets regularly.
    *   Use the `IConfiguration` abstraction in ASP.NET Core and avoid hardcoding configuration values.
    *   Secure Kestrel configuration to prevent unintended exposure of configuration files or endpoints.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Target ASP.NET Core Infrastructure -> Kestrel DoS -> Resource Exhaustion (CPU/Mem)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_target_asp_net_core_infrastructure_-_kestrel_dos_-_resource_exhaustion__cpumem_.md)

*   **Description:** This path involves an attacker launching a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack against the Kestrel web server by consuming excessive CPU or memory resources.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Identify Attack Vector:** The attacker identifies a way to consume excessive resources. This could involve:
        *   Sending a large number of complex requests.
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in request parsing or handling.
        *   Uploading large files.
        *   Triggering computationally expensive operations.
    2.  **Launch Attack:** The attacker sends a flood of requests or data designed to overwhelm the server's CPU or memory.
    3.  **Denial of Service:** The server becomes unresponsive or crashes, preventing legitimate users from accessing the application.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Configure Kestrel's request limits (e.g., `MaxRequestBodySize`, `MaxConcurrentConnections`).
    *   Implement rate limiting to prevent individual clients from sending too many requests.
    *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious traffic.
    *   Monitor server resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity.
    *   Use a reverse proxy (e.g., IIS, Nginx) in front of Kestrel to provide additional protection.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Target ASP.NET Core Infrastructure -> Kestrel DoS -> Resource Exhaustion (Connections)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_target_asp_net_core_infrastructure_-_kestrel_dos_-_resource_exhaustion__connections_.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to the previous path, but this focuses on exhausting the number of available connections to the Kestrel web server.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Identify Connection Limits:** The attacker may attempt to determine the server's connection limits.
    2.  **Open Many Connections:** The attacker opens a large number of connections to the server, potentially using techniques like "slowloris" attacks (keeping connections open for a long time).
    3.  **Exhaust Connections:** The server reaches its connection limit and can no longer accept new connections from legitimate users.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Configure Kestrel's connection limits (`MaxConcurrentConnections`, `MaxConcurrentUpgradedConnections`).
    *   Implement connection timeouts to prevent connections from being held open indefinitely.
    *   Use a reverse proxy to handle a larger number of connections and offload some of the burden from Kestrel.
    *   Monitor connection counts and set up alerts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: [CRITICAL] Third-Party Libraries (NuGet Packages)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node__critical__third-party_libraries__nuget_packages_.md)

*   **Description:** This node represents the risk of vulnerabilities within third-party libraries (NuGet packages) used by the ASP.NET Core application.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  **Identify Vulnerable Package:** An attacker identifies a vulnerable NuGet package used by the application. This information is often publicly available through vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD) or security advisories.
    2.  **Exploit Vulnerability:** The attacker exploits the known vulnerability in the package. The specific exploit will depend on the nature of the vulnerability (e.g., RCE, SQL injection, XSS). Publicly available exploit code is often available.
    3.  **Compromise Application:** The attacker gains unauthorized access or control over the application through the exploited vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Use dependency checking tools (e.g., `dotnet list package --vulnerable`, OWASP Dependency-Check) to identify vulnerable packages.
    *   Implement a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) process.
    *   Keep all NuGet packages up-to-date.
    *   Have a process for rapidly patching vulnerable packages, especially those with known exploits.
    *   Consider using a private NuGet feed to control the packages used in your organization.
    *   Review the security of third-party libraries before including them in your project.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Overly Permissive Kestrel Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_overly_permissive_kestrel_configuration.md)

* **Description:** Kestrel, if not configured securely, can expose internal endpoints or allow for resource exhaustion.
* **Attack Vector:**
    1. **Scanning:** Attacker scans the network for open ports and exposed services.
    2. **Identification:** Attacker identifies a misconfigured Kestrel instance, potentially exposing management endpoints, internal APIs, or diagnostic information.
    3. **Exploitation:** Attacker leverages the exposed functionality to gain unauthorized access, gather information, or cause a denial of service.
* **Mitigation:**
    *   Review Kestrel configuration documentation thoroughly.
    *   Minimize exposed surface area.  Only expose necessary endpoints.
    *   Use a reverse proxy (IIS, Nginx) for additional security and to handle TLS termination.
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for all exposed endpoints.
    *   Configure appropriate request limits and timeouts.
    *   Regularly audit the Kestrel configuration.
