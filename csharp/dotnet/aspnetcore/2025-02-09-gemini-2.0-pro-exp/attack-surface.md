# Attack Surface Analysis for dotnet/aspnetcore

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/middleware_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect ordering, omission, or overly permissive configuration of ASP.NET Core *middleware* components, leading to security bypass.
*   **ASP.NET Core Contribution:** The *middleware pipeline is a core architectural feature of ASP.NET Core*. Its flexibility, while powerful, is a direct source of this risk if mismanaged.
*   **Example:** Placing authentication middleware *after* authorization, allowing unauthenticated access.  A CORS middleware allowing all origins (`AllowAnyOrigin = true`).
*   **Impact:** Bypass of security controls, unauthorized access, data breaches, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Correct Ordering:**  Prioritize security middleware (authentication, authorization, rate limiting) early in the pipeline.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Configure middleware with the *strictest* necessary settings. Avoid wildcards.
    *   **Regular Review:** Audit the middleware pipeline configuration frequently.
    *   **Secure Defaults:** Use built-in middleware with secure defaults when possible.
    *   **Thorough Testing:** Include negative test cases to verify security controls.
    *   **Robust Exception Handling:** Prevent information leaks or DoS through proper exception handling in *all* middleware.

## Attack Surface: [Model Binding and Mass Assignment](./attack_surfaces/model_binding_and_mass_assignment.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit ASP.NET Core's *model binding* to modify properties they shouldn't have access to.
*   **ASP.NET Core Contribution:** ASP.NET Core's *model binding mechanism*, while convenient, is the direct vector for this attack if not properly secured.
*   **Example:** An attacker adds `IsAdmin=true` to a form submission, leveraging model binding to gain admin privileges.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, data corruption, unauthorized access.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **ViewModels/DTOs:** Use dedicated ViewModels/DTOs, binding *only* to the necessary properties.  Avoid binding directly to domain models.
    *   **`[Bind]` Attribute (Strictly):** Use `[Bind]` to *explicitly* whitelist allowed properties for binding. Be extremely precise.
    *   **Server-Side Input Validation:**  Always validate input on the server, regardless of client-side checks.

## Attack Surface: [Unintended Endpoint Exposure](./attack_surfaces/unintended_endpoint_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Exposing internal APIs or administrative endpoints due to misconfiguration of ASP.NET Core's *routing*.
*   **ASP.NET Core Contribution:** ASP.NET Core's *flexible routing system* is the direct enabler of this vulnerability if not carefully managed.
*   **Example:** A controller action without an `[Authorize]` attribute, intended for internal use, becomes publicly accessible.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **`[Authorize]` Attribute:**  Apply `[Authorize]` to *all* controllers/actions requiring authentication/authorization.
    *   **Route Constraints:** Use constraints to restrict access based on HTTP verb, parameters, etc.
    *   **API Versioning:** Clearly separate public and internal APIs using versioning.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Regularly review code for unintentionally exposed endpoints.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Input Validation (within ASP.NET Core Context)](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_input_validation__within_asp_net_core_context_.md)

*   **Description:** Failing to properly validate input *within the context of ASP.NET Core's features*, such as model binding, routing, or SignalR hubs.
*   **ASP.NET Core Contribution:** While input validation is a general concept, ASP.NET Core provides specific mechanisms (Data Annotations, Fluent Validation, `IValidatableObject`) that, if misused or neglected, create this vulnerability. This also includes validation within SignalR hubs and gRPC services.
*   **Example:** Relying solely on client-side validation for data bound to a model, or failing to sanitize user input before broadcasting it via SignalR.
*   **Impact:** XSS (especially in SignalR), data corruption, potential for other injection attacks depending on how the data is used.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Validation (Always):** Never trust client-side validation alone.
    *   **Data Annotations/Fluent Validation:** Use these ASP.NET Core features effectively for model validation.
    *   **SignalR Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user input *before* broadcasting it in SignalR hubs.
    *   **gRPC Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation within gRPC service methods.
    * **Context-Aware Validation:** Validate data in the context of how it will be used within the ASP.NET Core application (e.g., encoding for Razor views).

## Attack Surface: [Secrets Management Failures (within ASP.NET Core Configuration)](./attack_surfaces/secrets_management_failures__within_asp_net_core_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:** Insecurely storing secrets, particularly within the context of ASP.NET Core's *configuration system*.
*   **ASP.NET Core Contribution:** ASP.NET Core's configuration system (e.g., `appsettings.json`, environment variables) is where secrets are *typically* managed.  Misusing this system is the direct cause.
*   **Example:** Storing a database connection string in `appsettings.json` and committing it to source control.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables for secrets.
    *   **Azure Key Vault (or similar):** Use a dedicated secrets management service.
    *   **User Secrets (Development ONLY):** Use User Secrets *only* for local development.
    *   **Never Commit Secrets:** Absolutely *never* commit secrets to source control.
    * **Configuration Builders:** Load secrets dynamically at runtime.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Weaknesses (ASP.NET Core Identity & Features)](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_weaknesses__asp_net_core_identity_&_features_.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in the implementation of authentication and authorization, specifically leveraging *ASP.NET Core Identity* or related features.
*   **ASP.NET Core Contribution:** ASP.NET Core Identity is a *core framework component* for managing users, roles, and claims. Misconfiguration or misuse of this framework is the direct source of the vulnerability.
*   **Example:** Weak password policies in ASP.NET Core Identity, improper session management, or failing to use `[Authorize]` correctly.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, privilege escalation, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Password Policies (Identity):** Enforce strong password requirements within ASP.NET Core Identity.
    *   **Secure Session Management:** Use secure cookies, short timeouts, and proper session invalidation.
    *   **`[Authorize]` Attribute (Consistent Use):** Apply `[Authorize]` to all protected resources.
    *   **RBAC (Identity Roles):** Use ASP.NET Core Identity's role-based access control effectively.
    *   **MFA:** Implement multi-factor authentication.
    *   **Account Lockout:** Prevent brute-force attacks with account lockout.
    *   **Token Validation (Strict):** If using JWTs, rigorously validate all aspects (signature, expiration, audience, issuer).

## Attack Surface: [Outdated ASP.NET Core Framework/Packages](./attack_surfaces/outdated_asp_net_core_frameworkpackages.md)

*   **Description:** Running an outdated version of the *ASP.NET Core framework itself* or its *direct dependencies*, containing known vulnerabilities.
*   **ASP.NET Core Contribution:** This is a direct vulnerability stemming from not keeping the *core ASP.NET Core framework and its components* up-to-date.
*   **Example:** Using an unpatched version of ASP.NET Core with a known remote code execution vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Update ASP.NET Core and its *direct* dependencies to the latest stable versions.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use tools to identify outdated or vulnerable packages.
    *   **Automated Updates:** Consider tools like Dependabot for automated updates.
    * **Monitor Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories specifically for ASP.NET Core.
