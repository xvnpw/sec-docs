# Threat Model Analysis for dotnet/aspnetcore

## Threat: [Middleware Ordering Bypass](./threats/middleware_ordering_bypass.md)

*   **Threat:** Middleware Ordering Bypass

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a request that bypasses authentication or authorization middleware due to incorrect ordering in the ASP.NET Core request pipeline. For example, static file serving middleware placed *before* authentication could expose protected files.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, data leakage, potential for privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected Component:** ASP.NET Core Request Pipeline (Middleware configuration in `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Carefully review and document the middleware order. Place security-critical middleware (authentication, authorization) early. Use tests to verify correct order and behavior.

## Threat: [Custom Middleware Logic Flaw](./threats/custom_middleware_logic_flaw.md)

*   **Threat:** Custom Middleware Logic Flaw

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability (logic error, improper input validation, etc.) within a *custom-built* ASP.NET Core middleware component. This allows them to bypass security controls, leak data, or potentially gain control.
    *   **Impact:** Varies; could include authentication/authorization bypass, data leakage, denial of service, or code execution (depending on the flaw).
    *   **Affected Component:** Custom Middleware Components (classes implementing `IMiddleware` or using `Use...` extensions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the flaw)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Rigorous code review and testing of custom middleware. Apply secure coding principles. Consider using established middleware if possible.

## Threat: [Configuration Secret Exposure](./threats/configuration_secret_exposure.md)

*   **Threat:** Configuration Secret Exposure

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to sensitive configuration data (API keys, database credentials) because they are stored insecurely (e.g., in `appsettings.json` committed to source control, or in plain text on a server). This is a direct threat because ASP.NET Core's configuration system is how these secrets are managed.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of connected services, data breaches, potential for full system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** ASP.NET Core Configuration System (`appsettings.json`, environment variables, other providers).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Never store secrets in source control. Use environment variables, a secure configuration provider (Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), or the .NET Secret Manager (for development only).

## Threat: [SignalR Hub Unauthorized Access](./threats/signalr_hub_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Threat:** SignalR Hub Unauthorized Access

    *   **Description:** An attacker connects to an ASP.NET Core SignalR hub without authentication/authorization. They can send malicious messages, receive sensitive data, or cause a denial-of-service. This is specific to the SignalR component of ASP.NET Core.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to real-time data, message spoofing, denial of service, data manipulation.
    *   **Affected Component:** ASP.NET Core SignalR Hubs (classes inheriting from `Hub`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement authentication and authorization for SignalR hubs. Validate all messages. Use secure protocols (WebSockets over HTTPS). Implement rate limiting.

## Threat: [Blazor Server-Side State Manipulation](./threats/blazor_server-side_state_manipulation.md)

*   **Threat:** Blazor Server-Side State Manipulation

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits the persistent connection in a Blazor Server application (an ASP.NET Core feature) to hijack a connection, manipulate application state, or send crafted events.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, data manipulation, denial of service, potential privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected Component:** ASP.NET Core Blazor Server-Side Applications (components and server-side logic).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Strong authentication/authorization. Protect against XSS/CSRF. Validate input on the server. Limit circuit lifetime. Monitor connections. Consider Blazor WebAssembly with a secure API.

## Threat: [gRPC Service Data Interception](./threats/grpc_service_data_interception.md)

*   **Threat:** gRPC Service Data Interception

    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts gRPC communication (an ASP.NET Core supported framework) because TLS encryption is not enforced, allowing them to eavesdrop on sensitive data or perform man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Data leakage, man-in-the-middle attacks, data manipulation.
    *   **Affected Component:** ASP.NET Core gRPC Services (service implementations and client configurations).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Enforce TLS encryption for all gRPC communication. Use strong authentication and authorization. Validate input.

## Threat: [Minimal API Missing Authorization](./threats/minimal_api_missing_authorization.md)

*   **Threat:** Minimal API Missing Authorization

    *   **Description:**  An attacker accesses a Minimal API endpoint (a specific ASP.NET Core feature) that lacks proper authorization checks. The simplified structure of Minimal APIs can make it easier to overlook these checks.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to data or functionality, potential for data manipulation or privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected Component:**  ASP.NET Core Minimal API Endpoints (defined using `MapGet`, `MapPost`, etc.).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**  Explicitly implement authorization using middleware (`app.UseAuthorization()`) or endpoint filters. Use attributes like `[Authorize]`.
