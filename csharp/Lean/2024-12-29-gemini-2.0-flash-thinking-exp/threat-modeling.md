Here is the updated threat list, including only high and critical threats that directly involve the QuantConnect/Lean engine:

*   **Threat:** Algorithm Code Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code into a user-defined algorithm. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application allows users to input or manage their algorithms (e.g., through a web interface, file uploads). The injected code would then be executed by the Lean engine.
    *   **Impact:**  The attacker could gain unauthorized access to the underlying system, exfiltrate sensitive data (API keys, brokerage account details, trading strategies), manipulate trading decisions leading to financial losses, or cause a denial of service by consuming excessive resources.
    *   **Affected Lean Component:** Lean's Algorithm Execution Engine, specifically the components responsible for loading, compiling, and executing user-defined algorithms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for algorithm inputs.
        *   Enforce strict code review processes for user-defined algorithms.
        *   Utilize a secure coding environment and restrict access to the underlying system.
        *   Consider sandboxing or containerization for algorithm execution to limit the impact of malicious code.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) if algorithms are managed through a web interface.

*   **Threat:** Data Poisoning via Malicious Data Feeds
    *   **Description:** An attacker could compromise external data feeds that Lean consumes. By injecting false or manipulated data into these feeds, the attacker could influence the trading decisions made by algorithms running on Lean.
    *   **Impact:**  Algorithms could make incorrect trading decisions based on flawed data, leading to financial losses. Backtesting results could be skewed, leading to inaccurate strategy evaluation and potentially flawed future trading decisions.
    *   **Affected Lean Component:** Lean's Data Feed Handling module, specifically the components responsible for fetching, parsing, and storing data from external sources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Verify the integrity and authenticity of data feeds using digital signatures or other cryptographic methods.
        *   Implement anomaly detection mechanisms to identify unusual data patterns.
        *   Use reputable and trusted data feed providers with strong security measures.
        *   Implement data validation and sanitization on incoming data feeds before they are used by algorithms.
        *   Allow users to configure and select trusted data sources.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Custom Indicators and Libraries
    *   **Description:** If the application allows users to integrate custom indicators or external libraries within their Lean algorithms, vulnerabilities in these components could be exploited. This could be due to insecure coding practices in the custom code or known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to algorithm code injection, this could lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or manipulation of trading decisions.
    *   **Affected Lean Component:** Lean's Algorithm Execution Engine and the mechanisms for loading and interacting with external libraries and custom indicators.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a vetting process for custom indicators and libraries before allowing their use.
        *   Encourage or enforce the use of well-established and reputable libraries.
        *   Implement security scanning and vulnerability analysis for custom code and dependencies.
        *   Isolate the execution of custom code to limit the impact of vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Storage of API Keys and Credentials
    *   **Description:** Lean often requires API keys for connecting to brokerages and data feeds. If these credentials are not stored securely (e.g., in plain text in configuration files or databases), they could be compromised.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to brokerage accounts, potentially leading to financial losses. Unauthorized access to data feeds.
    *   **Affected Lean Component:** Lean's Credential Management and Storage mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store API keys and other sensitive credentials securely using encryption or dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault).
        *   Avoid storing credentials directly in code or configuration files.
        *   Implement proper access controls for accessing stored credentials.
