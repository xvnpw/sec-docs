### High and Critical EF Core Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the use of EF Core:

**I. Data Access and Querying Threats:**

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection through Raw SQL or LINQ
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate user input fields that are directly incorporated into raw SQL queries executed by EF Core (using methods like `DbContext.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw`) or by crafting malicious input that influences dynamically built LINQ queries. This allows them to inject arbitrary SQL commands.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification or deletion of data, potential execution of arbitrary commands on the database server, leading to a full compromise of the database.
    *   **Affected EF Core Component:**
        *   `DbContext.Database.ExecuteSqlRaw`
        *   `DbContext.Database.SqlQuery<T>`
        *   LINQ query translation and execution when dynamic predicates are used.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use parameterized queries when executing raw SQL using `ExecuteSqlRaw` or similar methods.
        *   Avoid dynamic construction of LINQ queries based on untrusted input. If necessary, use safe filtering and validation techniques or consider using a query builder library that handles sanitization.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all user-provided data before using it in queries.
        *   Utilize EF Core's features to prevent SQL injection, such as ensuring that LINQ to Entities translates to parameterized SQL.

*   **Threat:** Mass Assignment Vulnerability
    *   **Description:** An attacker could send unexpected or malicious data in a request, targeting entity properties that are not intended to be directly modified by users. If the application binds request data directly to entity properties without proper filtering, attackers can modify sensitive fields.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, privilege escalation (e.g., modifying an `IsAdmin` flag), unauthorized modification of application state, bypassing business logic.
    *   **Affected EF Core Component:**
        *   Model binding mechanisms when creating or updating entities.
        *   Entity property setters as configured by EF Core.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) or View Models to explicitly define the properties that can be bound from user input.
        *   Utilize EF Core's `[Bind]` attribute or fluent API configurations to restrict property binding to specific properties.
        *   Carefully review and control which properties are exposed for modification through data binding.
        *   Implement authorization checks before saving changes to ensure the user has the right to modify the affected properties.

**II. Database Schema and Migration Threats:**

*   **Threat:** Malicious Migrations
    *   **Description:** If the development environment or deployment pipeline is compromised, an attacker could introduce malicious migrations that alter the database schema in harmful ways. This could involve adding backdoors (e.g., new tables or columns with vulnerabilities), dropping tables, or modifying data directly.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, data corruption, application malfunction, potential security breaches through newly introduced vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected EF Core Component:**
        *   Migration generation and application (`Database.Migrate()`, `Add-Migration`, `Update-Database`).
        *   Model snapshot used by migrations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls and code review processes for migrations. Only authorized personnel should be able to create and apply migrations.
        *   Use a secure deployment pipeline with automated testing and validation of migrations in a non-production environment before applying them to production.
        *   Maintain backups of the database to facilitate recovery from malicious changes.
        *   Consider using signed migrations or other mechanisms to ensure their integrity (though this is not a built-in EF Core feature).
        *   Implement infrastructure as code (IaC) to manage database schema changes in a controlled and auditable manner.

**III. Configuration and Operational Threats:**

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Database Connection Strings
    *   **Description:** If the database connection string, which often contains sensitive credentials, is stored insecurely (e.g., in plain text configuration files, hardcoded in the application code), it can be exposed to attackers who gain access to the application's codebase or configuration. This directly impacts EF Core's ability to connect to the database.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected EF Core Component:**
        *   `DbContext` configuration and connection string handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store connection strings securely using environment variables, Azure Key Vault, or other secure configuration management solutions.
        *   Avoid hardcoding connection strings in the application code.
        *   Encrypt connection strings if they must be stored in configuration files.
        *   Implement proper access controls to configuration files and deployment environments.
