## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Misconfigured Authentication Flows:](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__critical_node__exploit_misconfigured_authentication_flows.md)

* **[HIGH-RISK] Bypass MFA due to Misconfiguration:**
    * Attackers exploit weaknesses in the multi-factor authentication setup, such as not enforcing MFA for all critical operations, weak recovery mechanisms, or bypass vulnerabilities.
    * This allows them to gain access to accounts even without knowing the password, directly leading to account compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Client Credential Vulnerabilities:](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__critical_node__exploit_client_credential_vulnerabilities.md)

* **[HIGH-RISK] Client Secret Exposure:**
    * Attackers obtain client secrets through various means, such as finding them hardcoded in code, exposed in configuration files, or through compromised developer machines.
    * With the client secret, they can impersonate the client application and request access tokens on behalf of users or themselves, bypassing normal authorization flows.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Token Vulnerabilities:](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__critical_node__exploit_token_vulnerabilities.md)

* **[HIGH-RISK] Token Theft/Leakage:**
    * Attackers steal or intercept valid access or refresh tokens.
        * **[HIGH-RISK] Through Network Interception (if HTTPS is not enforced or misconfigured):** If communication with IdentityServer4 is not properly secured with HTTPS, attackers can intercept tokens transmitted over the network.
    * Once a token is stolen, the attacker can use it to access protected resources as the legitimate user.
* **[CRITICAL NODE] Token Manipulation (if signature verification is weak or bypassed):**
    * If the signature verification of JWT tokens is weak or can be bypassed, attackers can modify the token's claims (e.g., user ID, roles, permissions) and forge a valid-looking token.
    * This allows them to escalate privileges or bypass authorization checks, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK] Account Takeover via Password Reset:](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__account_takeover_via_password_reset.md)

* Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the password reset process, such as predictable reset codes, lack of proper email/phone verification, or insecure handling of reset links.
    * This allows them to initiate a password reset for a legitimate user's account and gain control of it.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Configuration Weaknesses:](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__critical_node__exploit_configuration_weaknesses.md)

* **[HIGH-RISK] Insecure Default Configurations:**
    * Attackers exploit default settings in IdentityServer4 that are not secure for production environments, such as open endpoints, default credentials, or overly permissive settings.
    * This can provide an easy entry point for attackers to gain information or control.
* **[HIGH-RISK] Exposed Configuration Files/Secrets:**
    * Attackers gain access to configuration files or environment variables that contain sensitive information like database credentials, signing keys, or client secrets.
    * This provides them with the necessary credentials to compromise the entire IdentityServer4 instance or the applications it protects.
* **[HIGH-RISK] Misconfigured CORS Policies:**
    * Attackers leverage overly permissive Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies to make requests to IdentityServer4 from malicious websites.
    * This can allow them to steal tokens or perform actions on behalf of authenticated users.
* **[CRITICAL NODE] Insecure Key Management:**
    * **[HIGH-RISK] Compromised Signing Keys:** If the signing keys used to sign JWT tokens are compromised (e.g., stored insecurely, weak generation), attackers can forge valid tokens.
    * This is a critical vulnerability as it allows attackers to bypass the entire authentication and authorization mechanism.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK] Injection Attacks (e.g., SQL Injection if custom stores are used without proper sanitization):](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__injection_attacks__e_g___sql_injection_if_custom_stores_are_used_without_proper_sanitiza_7a7ddac7.md)

* If custom user stores or other data stores are used without proper input validation and sanitization, attackers can inject malicious code (e.g., SQL queries) into input fields.
    * This can allow them to read, modify, or delete sensitive data, including user credentials or configuration information.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK] Vulnerabilities in Custom User Stores:](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__vulnerabilities_in_custom_user_stores.md)

* If the development team has implemented a custom user store, it might contain security vulnerabilities such as insecure password hashing, lack of proper input validation, or logic flaws.
    * Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to the compromise of user credentials or the ability to bypass authentication.
