# Threat Model Analysis for identityserver/identityserver4

## Threat: [Weak or Default Signing Keys](./threats/weak_or_default_signing_keys.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker obtains the signing key used by IdentityServer4 to sign tokens. They can then forge valid tokens, impersonate users, and gain unauthorized access to protected resources. This could happen through insecure storage, accidental exposure, or exploiting vulnerabilities in key management *within IdentityServer4's configuration or key provider implementation*.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the authentication and authorization system, allowing attackers to access any resource protected by IdentityServer4. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized actions, and reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Key Management`, `Token Generation` module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Generate strong, cryptographically secure signing keys.
        *   Store signing keys securely using Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) or managed key vaults *integrated with IdentityServer4*.
        *   Implement key rotation policies to periodically change signing keys *within IdentityServer4's key management configuration*.
        *   Restrict access to the key store configuration within IdentityServer4 to authorized personnel and systems only.

## Threat: [Insecure Client Secrets](./threats/insecure_client_secrets.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers or guesses a weak or default client secret configured within IdentityServer4. They can then impersonate the legitimate client application and obtain access tokens on its behalf, potentially accessing resources they shouldn't. This can occur through exposed configuration files *of IdentityServer4*, insecure storage *within IdentityServer4's client configuration*, or weak secret generation practices *when defining clients in IdentityServer4*.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources intended for the compromised client application. This can lead to data breaches, manipulation of data on behalf of the client, and potential abuse of the client's privileges.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Client Configuration` data store, `Token Endpoint`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong client secret generation policies *when creating clients in IdentityServer4*.
        *   Store client secrets securely *within IdentityServer4's configuration* and avoid embedding them directly in client-side code or publicly accessible repositories.
