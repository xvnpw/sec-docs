# Attack Surface Analysis for identityserver/identityserver4

## Attack Surface: [Client Misconfiguration (Overly Permissive Settings)](./attack_surfaces/client_misconfiguration__overly_permissive_settings_.md)

*   **Description:** Clients are applications that request tokens from IdentityServer4. Misconfigured clients, especially those with excessive permissions, are a major attack vector *directly* managed within IS4.
*   **How IdentityServer4 Contributes:** IS4 provides the *entire* framework for defining client configurations (grant types, scopes, redirect URIs, secrets). This inherent flexibility is where the risk originates.
*   **Example:** A client configured with `AllowedGrantTypes = { GrantType.ResourceOwnerPassword, GrantType.AuthorizationCode }` when it only needs `GrantType.AuthorizationCode` with PKCE.  An attacker could brute-force credentials via the `ResourceOwnerPassword` grant – a grant type *enabled by IS4*.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, data breaches, account takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depends on exposed resources).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant clients only the *absolute minimum* necessary permissions within IS4's configuration.
    *   **Mandatory PKCE:** For public clients, *enforce* PKCE through IS4's settings.  *Never* allow the Implicit flow (disable it in IS4).
    *   **Strict `RedirectUri` Validation:** Avoid wildcards in IS4's `RedirectUris` configuration. Use exact matching. IS4 *must* validate the `redirect_uri` on every request.
    *   **Strong Client Secrets:** Use strong, random secrets for confidential clients, managed securely *outside* of IS4 but configured *within* IS4.
    *   **Regular Configuration Audits:** Regularly audit client configurations *within IS4* to ensure they remain appropriate.
    *   **Secure Client Credentials Flow:** If using this IS4-provided flow, ensure proper client authentication and authorization within IS4's settings.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default Cryptographic Keys](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_cryptographic_keys.md)

*   **Description:** IdentityServer4 uses cryptographic keys for signing tokens (JWTs). Weak or default keys allow attackers to forge tokens, a vulnerability *directly* tied to IS4's key management.
*   **How IdentityServer4 Contributes:** IS4 provides the mechanisms for managing signing keys. The vulnerability stems from *how* these mechanisms are used (or misused).
*   **Example:** Using the default development signing key (`"idsrv3test"`) in production. An attacker can use this publicly known key to create valid JWTs, granting access – a direct consequence of IS4's configuration.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise; attackers can impersonate any user/client.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Generate Strong Keys:** Use strong, random keys with appropriate lengths, configured *within* IS4.
    *   **Secure Key Storage:** Store keys securely, *outside* of the application, but the *configuration to use those keys* resides within IS4.
    *   **Regular Key Rotation:** Implement and *enforce* key rotation through IS4's configuration.
    *   **Asymmetric Keys for Signing:** Use asymmetric keys (RSA, ECDSA) for signing, configured *within* IS4.
    *   **X.509 Certificates:** Use X.509 certificates for signing keys, managed and configured *within* IS4.

## Attack Surface: [Open Redirect Vulnerabilities (via `redirect_uri` and `post_logout_redirect_uri`)](./attack_surfaces/open_redirect_vulnerabilities__via__redirect_uri__and__post_logout_redirect_uri__.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate `redirect_uri` (post-authorization) or `post_logout_redirect_uri` (post-logout) to redirect users to malicious sites – a vulnerability *directly* within IS4's handling of these parameters.
*   **How IdentityServer4 Contributes:** IS4 *uses* these parameters as part of the OAuth/OIDC flows. The vulnerability is in IS4's *validation* (or lack thereof) of these parameters.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a login URL with a malicious `redirect_uri`: `https://your-is4.com/connect/authorize?client_id=...&redirect_uri=https://evil.com`. IS4, if misconfigured, redirects the user after authentication.
*   **Impact:** Phishing, credential theft, session hijacking.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict `RedirectUri` Validation:** Avoid wildcards; use exact matching in IS4's configuration. IS4 *must* validate against a whitelist.
    *   **Whitelist `post_logout_redirect_uri`:** Maintain and enforce a whitelist *within IS4* for allowed `post_logout_redirect_uri` values.
    *   **User Confirmation (Optional):** While not a direct IS4 feature, consider a confirmation page *before* IS4 performs the redirect.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Grant Type Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/custom_grant_type_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Custom grant types, if insecurely implemented, introduce vulnerabilities *directly* within the IdentityServer4 framework.
*   **How IdentityServer4 Contributes:** IS4 *allows* developers to implement custom grant types, extending its core functionality. This extensibility point is the source of the risk.
*   **Example:** A custom grant type that bypasses proper authentication, allowing attackers to obtain tokens without credentials – a flaw *within* the IS4 extension.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breaches, account takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depends on the specific flaw).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rigorous Security Review:** Thoroughly review and test custom grant type code *within the IS4 context*.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Adhere to secure coding and OAuth/OIDC best practices *within the IS4 extension*.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate all input *within the custom grant type handler*.
    *   **Proper Authentication/Authorization:** Ensure the custom grant type *correctly* authenticates and authorizes within IS4's framework.
    *   **Prefer Standard Grant Types:** Avoid custom grant types if standard IS4 grant types suffice.
