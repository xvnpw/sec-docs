## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise IS4 Configuration (HIGH)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_is4_configuration__high_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit misconfigurations in the IdentityServer4 setup to gain unauthorized access or manipulate the authentication/authorization flow.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Misconfigured Redirect URIs (HIGH):**
        *   **Description:**  The attacker crafts a malicious authorization request with a redirect URI pointing to their controlled server.  If IS4 doesn't strictly validate the redirect URI, the attacker receives authorization codes or tokens.
        *   **Whitelist too Broad (HIGH):** Using wildcards or overly permissive patterns in the redirect URI whitelist.  Example: `https://*.example.com` instead of `https://app.example.com`.
        *   **Allows Phishing (Critical Node):**  Successful redirection to a malicious site allows the attacker to steal user credentials.
    *   **Insecure Client Secrets (HIGH):**
        *   **Description:**  Client secrets are weak, predictable, or stored insecurely, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate clients.
        *   **Hardcoded/Default Secrets (HIGH):** Using default or easily guessable secrets, or embedding secrets directly in client application code (especially mobile or JavaScript apps).
        *   **Compromise Client App (Critical Node):** If the attacker gains control of the client application (e.g., through reverse engineering, malware), they can extract the secret and impersonate the client.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise IS4 Token Handling (HIGH)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_is4_token_handling__high_.md)

* **Description:** Attackers intercept or manipulate tokens to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Token Leakage (HIGH):**
        *   **Description:** Tokens are exposed through insecure channels, allowing attackers to intercept them.
        *   **Exposure via Logs/URLs (HIGH):**  Logging sensitive information, including tokens, or including tokens in URL parameters (which can be logged by proxies or browsers).
        *   **Information Disclosure (Critical Node):** Leaked tokens provide direct access or can be used in further attacks.
        *   **Compromise Client App (Critical Node):** If the client app is compromised, the attacker may be able to steal tokens stored or used by the app.
        *   **Steal Refresh Token (Critical Node):** Obtaining a refresh token allows the attacker to obtain new access tokens, maintaining long-term unauthorized access.
        *   **Obtain New Access Tokens (Critical Node):**  The ability to obtain new access tokens is a key step in maintaining unauthorized access.
        *   **Gain Unauthorized Access (Critical Node):** The ultimate goal of the attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise IS4 Database](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_is4_database.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the database used by IS4 to gain access to user data, client data, or modify the database.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection:**
        *   **Description:**  If IS4's database interactions are vulnerable to SQL injection, an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands.
        *   **Access/Modify User Data (Critical Node):**  The attacker can read, modify, or delete user data, including credentials.
        *   **Impersonate Users (Critical Node):**  By accessing or modifying user data, the attacker can impersonate legitimate users.
    * **Weak Password Hashing:**
        * **Description:** If IS4 uses weak password hashing algorithms or doesn't salt passwords properly, an attacker who gains access to the database can crack user passwords.
        * **Brute-Force Accounts:** Weak password lead to easier brute-force attacks.
        * **Gain Admin Access (Critical Node):** By cracking admin password attacker can gain admin access.
