# Threat Model Analysis for identityserver/identityserver4

## Threat: [Insecure Client Secret Storage](./threats/insecure_client_secret_storage.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the client secret for a registered application within IdentityServer4. This could happen through various means, such as finding it in IdentityServer4's configuration store if not properly secured. The attacker can then impersonate the legitimate client.

**Impact:** The attacker can obtain access tokens and potentially refresh tokens on behalf of the legitimate application, allowing them to access protected resources that the application is authorized for. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized actions, and reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** Client Configuration Store (within IdentityServer4).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store client secrets securely using dedicated secret management solutions integrated with IdentityServer4 (e.g., using `IClientStore` implementations that fetch secrets from secure storage).
* Avoid storing secrets directly in IdentityServer4's configuration database in plain text.
* Implement proper access controls to the secret store used by IdentityServer4.
* Regularly rotate client secrets within IdentityServer4.
* Consider using certificate-based authentication for clients registered in IdentityServer4 where appropriate.

## Threat: [Open Redirect Vulnerability in Authorization Endpoint](./threats/open_redirect_vulnerability_in_authorization_endpoint.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious authorization request targeting IdentityServer4's authorization endpoint with a manipulated `redirect_uri` parameter. If IdentityServer4's authorization endpoint doesn't sufficiently validate the `redirect_uri`, it could redirect the user to an attacker-controlled website after successful authentication by IdentityServer4. The attacker can then intercept the authorization code or access token (in implicit flow scenarios).

**Impact:** The attacker can steal authorization codes or access tokens issued by IdentityServer4, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the user's account or resources protected by applications relying on IdentityServer4. This can be used for phishing attacks or to compromise user data.

**Affected Component:** Authorization Endpoint (within IdentityServer4).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Strictly validate the `redirect_uri` against a pre-registered list of allowed URIs for each client configured within IdentityServer4.
* Avoid using wildcards in `redirect_uri` configurations in IdentityServer4 unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all parameters in the authorization request processed by IdentityServer4.

## Threat: [Refresh Token Theft and Reuse](./threats/refresh_token_theft_and_reuse.md)

**Description:** An attacker obtains a valid refresh token issued by IdentityServer4, potentially through network interception, malware on the user's device, or a compromised client application that interacted with IdentityServer4. The attacker can then use this refresh token against IdentityServer4's token endpoint to obtain new access tokens without needing to re-authenticate the user with IdentityServer4.

**Impact:** The attacker can maintain persistent access to the user's resources protected by applications relying on IdentityServer4, even after the user's session has expired or they have changed their password within IdentityServer4. This can lead to long-term unauthorized access and data breaches.

**Affected Component:** Token Endpoint (within IdentityServer4).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement refresh token rotation within IdentityServer4, invalidating the old refresh token upon issuing a new one.
* Store refresh tokens securely within IdentityServer4's token storage and consider encrypting them at rest.
* Implement detection mechanisms within IdentityServer4 for unusual refresh token usage patterns.
* Consider implementing refresh token revocation mechanisms within IdentityServer4.

## Threat: [Weak or Default Signing Keys](./threats/weak_or_default_signing_keys.md)

**Description:** IdentityServer4 is configured to use weak or default cryptographic keys for signing tokens (e.g., JWTs). An attacker who obtains these keys from IdentityServer4's configuration can forge valid tokens, impersonating users or applications authenticated by IdentityServer4.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the authentication and authorization system managed by IdentityServer4. Attackers can gain unauthorized access to any protected resource relying on IdentityServer4 for authentication and authorization.

**Affected Component:** Key Management (within IdentityServer4).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Generate strong, unique cryptographic keys for signing tokens within IdentityServer4.
* Securely store and manage signing keys used by IdentityServer4, protecting them from unauthorized access.
* Regularly rotate signing keys used by IdentityServer4.
* Consider using Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for enhanced key protection within the IdentityServer4 deployment.

## Threat: [User Impersonation via Compromised User Credentials](./threats/user_impersonation_via_compromised_user_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker obtains valid user credentials (username and password) stored within IdentityServer4's user store. This could happen through a data breach of the user store, phishing attacks targeting users managed by IdentityServer4, or brute-force attacks against IdentityServer4's login endpoint if password policies are weak. The attacker can then log in to IdentityServer4 as the legitimate user.

**Impact:** The attacker gains full access to the compromised user's account within IdentityServer4 and any resources they are authorized to access through applications relying on IdentityServer4.

**Affected Component:** User Store (within IdentityServer4).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strong password policies (complexity, length, expiration) within IdentityServer4.
* Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for users managed by IdentityServer4.
* Securely store user credentials within IdentityServer4's user store using strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
* Implement account lockout policies within IdentityServer4 to prevent brute-force attacks against its login endpoint.
* Monitor for suspicious login activity within IdentityServer4.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Extension Grants](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_extension_grants.md)

**Description:** Developers implement custom grant types within IdentityServer4 that contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., improper input validation, logic flaws). An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities in IdentityServer4's custom grant processing to obtain unauthorized tokens.

**Impact:** Bypassing standard authentication and authorization mechanisms within IdentityServer4, leading to unauthorized access to resources protected by applications relying on it.

**Affected Component:** Custom Grant Validators and related code within IdentityServer4.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly review and test custom grant implementations within IdentityServer4 for security vulnerabilities.
* Follow secure coding practices when developing custom extensions for IdentityServer4.
* Consider security audits or penetration testing of custom extensions integrated with IdentityServer4.
