### High and Critical Attack Surfaces Directly Involving gui.cs

*   **Attack Surface:** Terminal Input Injection
    *   **Description:**  Maliciously crafted terminal input sequences can be used to manipulate the terminal's behavior or potentially execute commands if the application doesn't properly sanitize or handle terminal input.
    *   **How gui.cs Contributes:** `gui.cs` relies on reading and displaying terminal input. If it doesn't sanitize ANSI escape codes or other terminal control sequences within user input, it can pass these directly to the terminal emulator.
    *   **Example:** A user enters a specially crafted string containing ANSI escape codes that, when processed by the terminal emulator due to `gui.cs` displaying it, changes the terminal prompt to mimic a legitimate application, tricking the user into entering sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:**  Spoofed UI elements, potential for arbitrary command execution if the application processes unsanitized input as commands, denial of service by manipulating terminal settings.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Sanitize or strip potentially dangerous terminal control sequences from user input before displaying it using `gui.cs`. Avoid directly executing user-provided input as commands. Implement input validation to restrict allowed characters and patterns.

*   **Attack Surface:** Resource Exhaustion through Rendering
    *   **Description:**  Maliciously crafted or excessively complex UI elements or rapid UI updates can consume excessive system resources (CPU, memory), leading to a denial-of-service.
    *   **How gui.cs Contributes:** `gui.cs` is responsible for rendering the UI in the terminal. Inefficient rendering logic or the ability to create a large number of UI elements could be exploited to overload the system.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends input that causes the application to create a very large number of nested views or rapidly update the UI, consuming all available CPU and memory, making the application unresponsive.
    *   **Impact:** Application unresponsiveness, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement rate limiting for UI updates. Avoid creating excessively complex UI elements. Optimize rendering logic. Implement mechanisms to prevent the creation of an unbounded number of UI elements. Monitor resource usage.
