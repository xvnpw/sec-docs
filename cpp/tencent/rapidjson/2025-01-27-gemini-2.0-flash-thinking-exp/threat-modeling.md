# Threat Model Analysis for tencent/rapidjson

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow during Parsing](./threats/buffer_overflow_during_parsing.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload with excessively long strings or deeply nested structures. When RapidJSON parses this payload, it attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions. This can be triggered by sending this malicious JSON as input to an application using RapidJSON for parsing.
**Impact:**
    - Denial of Service (DoS): Application crashes due to memory corruption.
    - Code Execution: In severe cases, attackers might gain arbitrary code execution by overwriting critical program data or code pointers.
    - Data Corruption: Memory corruption can lead to unpredictable application behavior and data integrity issues.
**RapidJSON Component Affected:** Parser (specifically string and array/object parsing logic)
**Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical if code execution is possible)
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Use the latest stable version of RapidJSON.
    - Implement input size limits for JSON documents.
    - Utilize memory safety tools (ASan, MSan) during development and testing.
    - Conduct thorough code reviews focusing on JSON data handling.
    - Employ fuzzing to test against malformed JSON inputs.
