# Threat Model Analysis for tencent/rapidjson

## Threat: [Excessive Memory Consumption during Parsing (DoS)](./threats/excessive_memory_consumption_during_parsing__dos_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted JSON payload with extremely deep nesting or an excessive number of members/elements. RapidJSON attempts to parse this, leading to excessive memory allocation within the library's memory management. The application's memory usage spikes, potentially leading to an out-of-memory error and application crash or unresponsiveness.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, application crash, resource exhaustion on the server.
    * **Affected Component:** `rapidjson::Document`, `rapidjson::GenericValue`, `rapidjson::MemoryPoolAllocator`
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement limits on the maximum depth of JSON objects and arrays allowed *before* parsing with RapidJSON.
        * Set limits on the maximum size of the incoming JSON payload *before* parsing with RapidJSON.
        * Implement timeouts for JSON parsing operations.
        * Monitor application memory usage and set up alerts for unusual spikes.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in RapidJSON Library Itself (Code Execution, DoS, Information Disclosure)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_rapidjson_library_itself__code_execution__dos__information_disclosure_.md)

* **Description:** Like any software library, RapidJSON might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, use-after-free) within its own code. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted JSON payloads that trigger the vulnerable code paths within the RapidJSON library, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
    * **Impact:** Critical - potential for full system compromise, denial of service, or exposure of sensitive data.
    * **Affected Component:** Any part of the RapidJSON library depending on the specific vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Crucially, keep RapidJSON updated to the latest stable version.** Security vulnerabilities are often patched in newer releases.
        * Subscribe to security advisories related to RapidJSON or its dependencies.
        * Consider using static analysis tools that can detect known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
