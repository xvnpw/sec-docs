# Threat Model Analysis for tencent/rapidjson

## Threat: [Deeply Nested Object DoS](./threats/deeply_nested_object_dos.md)

*   **Threat:** Deeply Nested Object DoS

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a JSON payload with excessively deep nesting (e.g., `[[[[[[[[...]]]]]]]]]`). The attacker crafts this payload specifically to exhaust stack space during recursive parsing by RapidJSON's internal parsing functions.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash due to stack overflow, leading to denial of service. The entire application becomes unavailable.
    *   **Affected RapidJSON Component:** The core parsing engine, specifically the recursive descent parser used by default (functions related to `ParseObject` and `ParseArray` internally). The `Reader` class and its associated parsing methods are central.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **`kParseMaxDepthFlag`:** Use the `kParseMaxDepthFlag` option during parsing to set a strict limit on the maximum nesting depth. Choose a reasonable depth based on your application's needs (e.g., 16, 32, or 64). This is the *primary* defense. Example:
            ```c++
            rapidjson::Document doc;
            rapidjson::ParseResult ok = doc.Parse<rapidjson::kParseMaxDepthFlag>(json_string, max_depth);
            ```
        *   **Iterative Parsing (SAX-style):** If possible, use RapidJSON's SAX-style API. SAX parsers are event-driven and don't use recursion, making them inherently resistant to stack overflow attacks. This requires a different approach to processing the JSON data.
        *   **Input Size Limits:** Implement limits on the overall size of the incoming JSON payload *before* it reaches RapidJSON.

## Threat: [Large String/Array Memory Exhaustion](./threats/large_stringarray_memory_exhaustion.md)

*   **Threat:** Large String/Array Memory Exhaustion

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a JSON payload containing extremely large strings or arrays (e.g., a string with millions of characters, or an array with millions of elements). The attacker aims to cause RapidJSON to consume all available memory during allocation.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash due to out-of-memory error, leading to denial of service. Potentially affects other processes on the same system.
    *   **Affected RapidJSON Component:** Memory allocation functions within RapidJSON (e.g., those used by `String`, `Value::SetString`, `Value::PushBack`, etc.). The `Allocator` used by the `Document` is directly involved.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Schema Validation (with Limits):** Use a JSON Schema validator that allows you to specify `maxLength` for strings and `maxItems` for arrays. This is the *best* approach.
        *   **Custom Allocator:** Implement a custom allocator for RapidJSON that tracks memory usage and throws an exception or returns an error if a predefined limit is exceeded.
        *   **Input Size Limits:** Limit the overall size of the incoming JSON payload *before* parsing.
        *   **Streaming (SAX-style):** If you don't need the entire JSON document in memory at once, use the SAX-style API.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow/Underflow via *RapidJSON's Number Parsing* (Less Common, but Possible)](./threats/integer_overflowunderflow_via_rapidjson's_number_parsing__less_common__but_possible_.md)

*   **Threat:** Integer Overflow/Underflow via *RapidJSON's Number Parsing* (Less Common, but Possible)

    *   **Description:** While most integer overflow issues are due to application misuse, there *could* be edge cases where RapidJSON's internal number parsing logic, *before* returning the value to the application, might encounter an overflow during its internal calculations. This is less likely with well-tested libraries like RapidJSON, but still theoretically possible. For example, an extremely large number represented in scientific notation might cause an intermediate overflow *within* RapidJSON's parsing routines.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially incorrect parsing results, leading to undefined behavior within RapidJSON itself. This could manifest as a crash, incorrect data being returned, or other unexpected behavior.
    *   **Affected RapidJSON Component:**  The internal number parsing logic within `ParseNumber` and related functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (because it's a bug within RapidJSON itself, if it exists)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Stay Updated:** Keep RapidJSON updated to the latest version.  Such bugs, if they exist, are likely to be fixed in newer releases.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:**  If you are extremely concerned about this edge case, consider performing fuzz testing specifically targeting RapidJSON's number parsing with extremely large or unusual numeric inputs.
        *   **Schema Validation (with Numeric Limits):**  Using a schema validator with `minimum` and `maximum` values for numeric types can help prevent extremely large numbers from even reaching RapidJSON's parsing logic. This is a preventative measure.
