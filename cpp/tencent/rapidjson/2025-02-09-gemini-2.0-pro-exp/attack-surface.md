# Attack Surface Analysis for tencent/rapidjson

## Attack Surface: [1. Malformed JSON Input (Denial of Service)](./attack_surfaces/1__malformed_json_input__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft specially designed JSON payloads to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) during parsing.
*   **RapidJSON Contribution:** RapidJSON's parser, while optimized, is still susceptible to resource exhaustion if presented with overly complex or deeply nested structures or extremely long strings. This is a *direct* consequence of how RapidJSON parses input.
*   **Example:** A JSON document with thousands of nested arrays: `[[[[[[[[...]]]]]]]]]`.  Or, a very long string: `{"key": "a" * 1000000}`.
*   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive, leading to denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical if easily triggered and no resource limits are in place).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Resource Limits:** Configure RapidJSON's `kParseMaxDepthFlag` to limit nesting depth. Implement application-level limits on input size and string lengths *before* parsing (although this is a pre-emptive measure, the core vulnerability is in RapidJSON's handling of complex input).
    *   **Schema Validation:** Use a JSON Schema validator to enforce structural constraints *before* passing data to RapidJSON (again, pre-emptive, but helps).
    *   **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for parsing operations.

## Attack Surface: [2.  `kParseInsituFlag` Misuse (Buffer Overflow/Use-After-Free)](./attack_surfaces/2____kparseinsituflag__misuse__buffer_overflowuse-after-free_.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect use of the `kParseInsituFlag`, which modifies the input buffer in place, leads to memory corruption.
*   **RapidJSON Contribution:**  `kParseInsituFlag` is inherently risky *because* it's a feature of RapidJSON that directly modifies the provided buffer.  The vulnerability is a direct consequence of using this specific RapidJSON feature.
*   **Example:** Parsing a JSON string in a read-only buffer, or parsing a string that expands when parsed (e.g., due to escaped characters), or freeing the buffer before RapidJSON is finished with it.
*   **Impact:** Buffer overflows (if the parsed JSON is larger than the original), use-after-free errors (if the buffer is deallocated prematurely), leading to crashes or potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid `kParseInsituFlag`:**  This is the best mitigation. Use the default parsing mode.
    *   **If Necessary, Extreme Caution:** If `kParseInsituFlag` *must* be used:
        *   Ensure the input buffer is writable and large enough.
        *   Carefully manage the buffer's lifetime.
        *   Thoroughly test and review.

## Attack Surface: [3. Ignoring Parsing Errors](./attack_surfaces/3__ignoring_parsing_errors.md)

*   **Description:** Application is not checking errors returned by RapidJSON.
*   **RapidJSON Contribution:** RapidJSON is returning error codes and information about parsing errors that are being ignored. This is a direct misuse of the RapidJSON API.
*   **Example:** Calling `Parse()` method and not checking `HasParseError()` or not checking result of other methods.
*   **Impact:** Processing of incomplete or malformed JSON, leading to unexpected behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Check Errors:** Always check the return values and error codes from RapidJSON functions (e.g., `HasParseError()`, `GetParseError()`, `GetErrorOffset()`).
    *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle parsing failures (e.g., logging the error, rejecting the input, returning an error response).
