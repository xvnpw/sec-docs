## Attack Tree Path: [Attacker's Goal: Execute Arbitrary Code OR Cause DoS via RapidJSON [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/attacker's_goal_execute_arbitrary_code_or_cause_dos_via_rapidjson__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker is to either gain control of the system by executing arbitrary code (RCE) or to disrupt the service by causing a denial of service (DoS). This is achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses within the RapidJSON library.
*   **Criticality:** This is the root node and represents the overall threat.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Denial of Service (DoS) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__denial_of_service__dos___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker aims to make the application unavailable to legitimate users. This is typically achieved by exhausting system resources or triggering a crash.
*   **Criticality:** This is a major outcome and a direct path to achieving the attacker's goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Stack Exhaustion [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_stack_exhaustion__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits RapidJSON's recursive parsing by providing deeply nested JSON structures. This can lead to a stack overflow, crashing the application.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Application crash, DoS)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:** Limit the maximum nesting depth of JSON objects.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Deeply Nested JSON Objects [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_deeply_nested_json_objects__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts a JSON document with many levels of nested objects (e.g., `{"a":{"b":{"c":{"d":...}}}}`). This is the specific technique used to trigger stack exhaustion.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Application crash, DoS)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:** Enforce a strict limit on the maximum nesting depth allowed in the JSON input.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Heap Exhaustion [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_heap_exhaustion__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides a JSON document that consumes an excessive amount of memory, causing the application to run out of memory and crash.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Application crash, DoS)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:** Set limits on the total size of the JSON document and the size of individual strings.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Large Number of JSON Objects [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_large_number_of_json_objects__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker creates a JSON document containing a massive number of objects, even if the individual objects are small.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Application crash, DoS)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:** Enforce a strict limit on the total size of the JSON document.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Large String Values [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_large_string_values__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker includes very long strings within the JSON document.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Application crash, DoS)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:** Enforce strict maximum lengths for all JSON strings.
