## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via RapidJSON Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_rapidjson_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the successful compromise of the application through vulnerabilities in the RapidJSON library. Achieving this could lead to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or complete control over the application and its underlying system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE & Beginning of High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_parsing_vulnerabilities__critical_node_&_beginning_of_high-risk_path_.md)

This category of attacks targets weaknesses in RapidJSON's core parsing logic when it processes untrusted JSON input. It's a critical entry point for many high-risk attacks, as the parser is the first point of contact with potentially malicious data. Successful exploitation here can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or other unexpected behaviors that can be further leveraged.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Buffer Overflow (CRITICAL NODE & Part of High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_buffer_overflow__critical_node_&_part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

Buffer overflows occur when RapidJSON attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer in memory. This is a critical vulnerability because it can allow attackers to overwrite adjacent memory regions, potentially including code or critical data structures. Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution, where the attacker can run their own malicious code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send excessively long JSON strings (CRITICAL NODE & Part of High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/send_excessively_long_json_strings__critical_node_&_part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a JSON payload where the value of one or more string fields (keys or values) is extremely long, exceeding the buffer allocated by RapidJSON to store it during parsing.
* **Likelihood:** Medium - Relatively easy to attempt, and many applications might not have strict limits on string lengths in JSON.
* **Impact:** High - Can lead to buffer overflows, potentially allowing for code execution.
* **Effort:** Medium - Requires crafting a JSON payload with a very long string.
* **Skill Level:** Medium - Requires understanding of buffer overflows and basic JSON structure.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Long strings might be flagged by some security tools, but distinguishing malicious from legitimate long strings can be challenging.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send deeply nested JSON objects/arrays (CRITICAL NODE & Part of High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/send_deeply_nested_json_objectsarrays__critical_node_&_part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker creates a JSON payload with an excessive number of nested objects or arrays. This can exhaust the stack or heap memory used by RapidJSON during parsing, leading to a crash or, in some cases, a stack overflow that can be exploited.
* **Likelihood:** Medium -  Relatively easy to generate deeply nested JSON.
* **Impact:** High - Can lead to stack overflows, potentially allowing for controlled overwrites and code execution.
* **Effort:** Medium - Requires generating a deeply nested JSON structure.
* **Skill Level:** Medium - Requires understanding of stack overflows and JSON structure.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Deeply nested structures can be detected, but legitimate use cases might also exist.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit integer overflows during size calculations (CRITICAL NODE & Part of High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_integer_overflows_during_size_calculations__critical_node_&_part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a JSON payload that causes RapidJSON to perform calculations (e.g., for buffer sizes) that result in an integer overflow. This can lead to allocating a smaller buffer than needed, which can then be overflowed when data is written into it.
* **Likelihood:** Low - Requires specific conditions and a deeper understanding of RapidJSON's internal workings.
* **Impact:** High - Can lead to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution.
* **Effort:** High - Requires reverse engineering or in-depth knowledge of RapidJSON's implementation.
* **Skill Level:** High - Requires advanced knowledge of integer overflows and memory management in C++.
* **Detection Difficulty:** High - These vulnerabilities are often subtle and difficult to detect without careful code analysis or specific testing.
