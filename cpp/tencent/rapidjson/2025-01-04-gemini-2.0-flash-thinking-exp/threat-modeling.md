# Threat Model Analysis for tencent/rapidjson

## Threat: [Malformed JSON Parsing Vulnerability](./threats/malformed_json_parsing_vulnerability.md)

**Threat:** Malformed JSON Parsing Vulnerability

**Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted, malformed JSON payload to the application. RapidJSON's parser encounters an unexpected structure or invalid syntax that its internal logic fails to handle correctly. This can lead to the parser crashing due to an unhandled exception or entering an undefined state, potentially exploitable for further attacks.

**Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential for exploitation if the parser's undefined state leads to memory corruption or other vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** Parser (specifically the functions responsible for tokenizing and interpreting JSON structure).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Implement robust error handling around RapidJSON parsing calls to catch and prevent crashes due to parsing errors.
* Keep the RapidJSON library updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that address parsing vulnerabilities.
* Employ fuzz testing with various malformed JSON inputs to proactively identify potential parsing vulnerabilities within RapidJSON.

## Threat: [String Handling Vulnerabilities (Memory Exhaustion due to Excessive String Length)](./threats/string_handling_vulnerabilities__memory_exhaustion_due_to_excessive_string_length_.md)

**Threat:** String Handling Vulnerabilities (Memory Exhaustion due to Excessive String Length)

**Description:** An attacker sends a JSON payload containing extremely long string values. RapidJSON's internal string handling mechanisms might allocate excessive memory to store these strings during parsing. This can lead to memory exhaustion within the application process, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact:** Memory exhaustion, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** StringStream, Reader (components within RapidJSON responsible for reading and storing string data).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Configure RapidJSON's parse options (if available) to set limits on the maximum length of strings allowed during parsing.
* Implement application-level checks to limit the size of incoming JSON payloads, indirectly mitigating the risk of excessively long strings.
* Monitor memory usage during JSON parsing to detect potential memory exhaustion issues caused by large strings.

## Threat: [Deeply Nested JSON Causing Stack Overflow or Resource Exhaustion within RapidJSON](./threats/deeply_nested_json_causing_stack_overflow_or_resource_exhaustion_within_rapidjson.md)

**Threat:** Deeply Nested JSON Causing Stack Overflow or Resource Exhaustion within RapidJSON

**Description:** An attacker sends a JSON payload with an excessively deep level of nesting (e.g., many nested objects or arrays). RapidJSON's recursive parsing logic can consume significant stack space or other internal resources when processing such deeply nested structures. This can lead to stack overflow errors or resource exhaustion directly within the RapidJSON library, causing the application to crash.

**Impact:** Application crash due to stack overflow, denial of service due to internal resource exhaustion within RapidJSON.

**Affected Component:** Parser (recursive descent parsing logic).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Configure RapidJSON's parse options (if available) to set limits on the maximum depth of nesting allowed during parsing.
* Implement application-level checks to reject JSON payloads with excessive nesting depth before passing them to RapidJSON.
* Consider alternative parsing strategies if dealing with potentially deeply nested data is a common use case.
