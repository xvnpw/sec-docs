# Attack Surface Analysis for tencent/rapidjson

## Attack Surface: [Malformed JSON Input](./attack_surfaces/malformed_json_input.md)

*   **Description:** Submitting JSON data that violates the JSON syntax specification.
*   **How RapidJSON Contributes to the Attack Surface:** RapidJSON's parsing engine attempts to process the input, and vulnerabilities in this process can be triggered by malformed input.
*   **Example:**  Providing JSON with missing commas, unclosed brackets, or invalid escape sequences.
*   **Impact:** Parsing errors, potential crashes, unexpected program behavior, denial-of-service if error handling is poor.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize RapidJSON's error reporting mechanisms to gracefully handle parsing failures and prevent crashes.
    *   Consider using a schema validation library in conjunction with RapidJSON to enforce stricter data formats (as a supplementary measure).

## Attack Surface: [Deeply Nested JSON Objects/Arrays](./attack_surfaces/deeply_nested_json_objectsarrays.md)

*   **Description:** Providing JSON data with an excessive level of nesting of objects or arrays.
*   **How RapidJSON Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The recursive nature of parsing deeply nested structures can consume significant stack space, potentially leading to stack overflow vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:**  A JSON object containing another object, which contains another, and so on, for hundreds or thousands of levels.
*   **Impact:** Stack overflow, leading to program crashes or potentially arbitrary code execution (though less likely with modern memory protection).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure RapidJSON's parser (if possible, though direct configuration for max depth might be limited) or the application's environment to have sufficient stack space (use with caution).

## Attack Surface: [Extremely Large JSON Documents](./attack_surfaces/extremely_large_json_documents.md)

*   **Description:** Providing JSON data with a very large overall size.
*   **How RapidJSON Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Parsing and storing large JSON documents can consume significant memory, potentially leading to memory exhaustion and denial-of-service.
*   **Example:**  A JSON file containing millions of entries in an array or a very large string value.
*   **Impact:** Memory exhaustion, denial-of-service, potential slowdown or instability of the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Consider using streaming JSON parsers (if the application's requirements allow) instead of DOM-based parsers like RapidJSON for very large inputs.

## Attack Surface: [JSON with Large Strings or Numbers](./attack_surfaces/json_with_large_strings_or_numbers.md)

*   **Description:** Providing JSON data containing extremely long string values or very large numerical values.
*   **How RapidJSON Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  Allocating memory for and processing very large strings can lead to memory exhaustion or integer overflow vulnerabilities if size calculations are not handled carefully within RapidJSON. Similarly, handling extremely large numbers might exceed the limits of standard integer types used internally.
*   **Example:** A JSON object with a string value containing gigabytes of data, or a numerical value exceeding the maximum value of a 64-bit integer.
*   **Impact:** Memory exhaustion, integer overflows, potential crashes, unexpected behavior.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully consider the data types used to store values parsed by RapidJSON and ensure they can accommodate the expected range.
