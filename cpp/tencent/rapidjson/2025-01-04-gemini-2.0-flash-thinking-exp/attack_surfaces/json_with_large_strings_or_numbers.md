        print("* **String Allocation:** RapidJSON dynamically allocates memory to store string values. For extremely long strings, this can lead to excessive memory allocation, potentially exhausting available memory (RAM) and causing a denial of service (DoS).")
        print("* **Integer Parsing:** RapidJSON uses standard integer types (e.g., `int`, `uint64_t`) to parse numerical values. If a JSON number exceeds the maximum value representable by these types, an integer overflow can occur. This can lead to unexpected behavior, incorrect calculations, or even security vulnerabilities if the overflowed value is used in security-sensitive contexts (e.g., size calculations, array indexing).")
        print("* **No Built-in Limits (by Default):**  RapidJSON, by default, doesn't impose strict limits on the size of strings or the magnitude of numbers it will parse. This makes it vulnerable if the application doesn't implement its own input validation.")
