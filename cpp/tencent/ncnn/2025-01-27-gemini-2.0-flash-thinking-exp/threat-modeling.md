# Threat Model Analysis for tencent/ncnn

## Threat: [Malicious Model Files](./threats/malicious_model_files.md)

Description: An attacker provides a crafted `.param` or `.bin` model file designed to exploit vulnerabilities in `ncnn`'s model parsing logic. Upon loading, `ncnn` attempts to parse the malicious model, triggering the vulnerability.
    *   Impact:
        *   Denial of Service (DoS): Application crashes or hangs.
        *   Remote Code Execution (RCE): Exploitation of parsing vulnerabilities allows arbitrary code execution.
        *   Information Disclosure: Leakage of sensitive data due to unexpected behavior.
    *   Affected ncnn Component: Model Loader (parsing logic for `.param` and `.bin` files).
    *   Risk Severity: Critical
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Model Source Validation: Only load models from trusted and verified sources.
        *   Checksum/Signature Verification: Verify model file integrity before loading.
        *   Sandboxing: Run `ncnn` in a sandboxed environment.
        *   Regular Updates: Keep `ncnn` library updated.

## Threat: [Malicious Input Data for Inference](./threats/malicious_input_data_for_inference.md)

Description: An attacker provides carefully crafted input data to trigger vulnerabilities during `ncnn` inference. This could exploit edge cases or bugs in `ncnn`'s processing layers.
    *   Impact:
        *   Denial of Service (DoS): `ncnn` crashes or hangs due to unexpected input.
        *   Unexpected Application Behavior: Incorrect inference results or application malfunctions.
        *   Potentially Remote Code Execution: If input can trigger memory corruption in inference engine.
    *   Affected ncnn Component: Inference Engine (layers and operators processing input data).
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Input Validation (Data): Thoroughly validate and sanitize input data before inference.
        *   Error Handling: Implement robust error handling around `ncnn` inference calls.
        *   Resource Limits: Set resource limits for `ncnn` inference.
        *   Fuzzing: Consider fuzzing `ncnn` with varied input data.

## Threat: [Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities](./threats/memory_corruption_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: `ncnn` (C++ codebase) is susceptible to memory safety issues (buffer overflows, use-after-free, etc.). Exploitation can be triggered by malicious models or input data.
    *   Impact:
        *   Remote Code Execution (RCE): Arbitrary code execution with application privileges.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS): Application crashes and instability.
        *   Information Disclosure: Potential leakage of sensitive data from memory.
    *   Affected ncnn Component: Core ncnn library code (memory management, data processing functions).
    *   Risk Severity: Critical
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Regular ncnn Updates: Keep `ncnn` updated for security patches.
        *   Static/Dynamic Analysis: Use analysis tools to identify memory safety issues.
        *   Memory Sanitizers (Development/Testing): Use sanitizers to detect memory errors early.
        *   Operating System Security Features: Leverage ASLR and DEP.

## Threat: [Compromised ncnn Library/Build Artifacts](./threats/compromised_ncnn_librarybuild_artifacts.md)

Description: Malicious code injected into `ncnn` library source or pre-built binaries if obtained from untrusted sources or build process is compromised.
    *   Impact:
        *   Remote Code Execution (RCE): Malicious code execution on systems using compromised library.
        *   Complete Application Compromise: Full control over applications using compromised `ncnn`.
        *   Data Exfiltration: Stealing sensitive data processed by the application.
    *   Affected ncnn Component: Entire `ncnn` library.
    *   Risk Severity: Critical
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Official Sources: Download `ncnn` from official and trusted sources only.
        *   Build Process Security: Secure build environment and process.
        *   Checksum/Signature Verification (Binaries): Verify integrity of downloaded binaries.
        *   Supply Chain Security: Implement supply chain security best practices.
        *   Build from Source (if feasible): Build `ncnn` from source in a controlled environment.
