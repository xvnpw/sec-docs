# Attack Surface Analysis for tencent/ncnn

## Attack Surface: [Malformed Model Files](./attack_surfaces/malformed_model_files.md)

**Description:**  The application loads and parses model files (typically `.param` and `.bin`) that define the neural network structure and weights. Maliciously crafted model files can exploit vulnerabilities in `ncnn`'s parsing logic.

**How ncnn Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `ncnn` is responsible for parsing these model files. If its parsing implementation has vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, integer overflows, format string bugs), a malformed file can trigger them.

**Example:** An attacker provides a `.param` file with an excessively large value for a layer dimension, causing `ncnn` to allocate an unexpectedly large buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (application crash), potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the vulnerability allows overwriting critical memory regions.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Validate Model File Structure and Contents:** Implement checks before and during `ncnn` model loading to verify the integrity and expected structure of the model files.
* **Use the Latest ncnn Version:** Keep `ncnn` updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in the parsing logic.
* **Source Model Files from Trusted Sources:** Only load model files from reliable and verified sources.
* **Consider Model File Signing:** Implement a mechanism to verify the authenticity and integrity of model files using digital signatures.
* **Resource Limits:** Configure `ncnn` or the application environment to impose limits on memory allocation during model loading.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Build Process of ncnn](./attack_surfaces/insecure_build_process_of_ncnn.md)

**Description:** If the `ncnn` library itself is built in a compromised environment, malicious code could be injected into the library.

**How ncnn Contributes to the Attack Surface:** A compromised `ncnn` library directly introduces malicious functionality into the application.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the build environment used to compile `ncnn` and injects a backdoor into the library's code. Applications using this compromised `ncnn` will unknowingly include the backdoor.

**Impact:**  Remote Code Execution, data exfiltration, complete compromise of the application and potentially the host system.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Use Official Releases:** Prefer using pre-built, official releases of `ncnn` from trusted sources.
* **Verify Build Integrity:** If building `ncnn` from source, ensure the build environment is secure and the source code hasn't been tampered with (e.g., verify checksums).
* **Secure Build Pipeline:** Implement security best practices for the build pipeline, including access controls, regular security scans, and integrity checks.
