## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Model Handling](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__critical_node__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_model_handling.md)

**Attack Vector:** This represents the overarching goal of exploiting weaknesses in how the application handles ncnn models. This includes the processes of loading, parsing, and storing model files.
    * **Likelihood:**  Medium to High (depending on the security measures in place for model handling).
    * **Impact:** Critical (potential for arbitrary code execution).
    * **Effort:** Medium to High (depending on the specific vulnerability).
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate to Difficult.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Load Malicious Model](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__critical_node__load_malicious_model.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker's objective is to get the application to load a neural network model that has been intentionally crafted to exploit vulnerabilities within ncnn. This malicious model acts as the payload for the attack.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium (if model sources are not well-secured).
    * **Impact:** Critical (direct path to code execution).
    * **Effort:** Low to High (depending on the method of delivery and the complexity of the exploit).
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner to Advanced (depending on the delivery method and exploit).
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate to Difficult.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Supply Malicious Model via Network](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__supply_malicious_model_via_network.md)

**Attack Vector:**  If the application downloads ncnn models from a remote source, an attacker can attempt to inject a malicious model during this download process.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium (if network security is weak or the download source is compromised).
    * **Impact:** Critical (leads to loading a malicious model).
    * **Effort:** Low to Medium (depending on the network security and download process).
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Model Download Source](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_model_download_source.md)

**Attack Vector:**  The attacker gains control over the server or repository from which the application downloads ncnn models. This allows them to replace legitimate models with malicious ones.
    * **Likelihood:** Low (requires significant effort to compromise a server).
    * **Impact:** Critical (allows for widespread and persistent compromise).
    * **Effort:** Medium to High (depending on the security of the download source).
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate to Difficult.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Download API](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_download_api.md)

**Attack Vector:**  The attacker exploits weaknesses in the API used to download models (e.g., authentication bypass, injection flaws) to upload or replace legitimate models with malicious ones.
    * **Likelihood:** Low.
    * **Impact:** Critical.
    * **Effort:** Medium.
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Download](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle_attack_on_download.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker intercepts the network traffic between the application and the model download server, replacing the legitimate model with a malicious one.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium (if no HTTPS or certificate pinning) / Low (with HTTPS and pinning).
    * **Impact:** Critical.
    * **Effort:** Low (on unsecured networks) / Medium (with network access).
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner/Intermediate.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate/Difficult.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Model Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_model_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a malicious ncnn model file that exploits bugs in ncnn's code responsible for parsing and interpreting the model file format. This can lead to buffer overflows, integer overflows, or other memory corruption issues, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution.
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (requires specific vulnerabilities in ncnn).
    * **Impact:** Critical (direct path to code execution).
    * **Effort:** Medium to High (requires reverse engineering and exploit development).
    * **Skill Level:** Advanced.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Buffer Overflow in Parser](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_buffer_overflow_in_parser.md)

**Attack Vector:**  A specially crafted model file contains excessively long fields or unexpected data that overflows a buffer in ncnn's model parsing code, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and allowing for code execution.
    * **Likelihood:** Low/Medium (requires finding specific vulnerabilities).
    * **Impact:** Critical.
    * **Effort:** Medium/High (requires reverse engineering and exploit development).
    * **Skill Level:** Advanced.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Integer Overflow in Parser](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_integer_overflow_in_parser.md)

**Attack Vector:** The malicious model file contains numerical values that, when processed by ncnn's parser, cause integer overflows. This can lead to incorrect memory allocation or access, potentially resulting in code execution.
    * **Likelihood:** Low/Medium (requires finding specific vulnerabilities).
    * **Impact:** Critical.
    * **Effort:** Medium/High (requires reverse engineering and exploit development).
    * **Skill Level:** Advanced.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the ncnn model format involves deserialization of data, vulnerabilities in the deserialization process can be exploited. A malicious model could contain crafted data that, when deserialized, leads to arbitrary code execution.
    * **Likelihood:** Low (depends on model format and ncnn's handling).
    * **Impact:** Critical.
    * **Effort:** Medium/High (requires understanding the serialization format and finding vulnerabilities).
    * **Skill Level:** Advanced.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult.
