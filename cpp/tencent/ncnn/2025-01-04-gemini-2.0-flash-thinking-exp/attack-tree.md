## Attack Tree Path: [1. Achieve Arbitrary Code Execution on Server (via ncnn) [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/1__achieve_arbitrary_code_execution_on_server__via_ncnn___cn_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This is the ultimate goal, achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities within the ncnn library or the application's interaction with it.
**Vulnerability:**  Various vulnerabilities within ncnn's model parsing, input processing, or potentially through insecure model handling practices.
**Potential Outcome:** Complete control over the server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, steal sensitive data, or disrupt services.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Model Loading Vulnerabilities [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_model_loading_vulnerabilities__cn_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Manipulating the model loading process to introduce malicious code or cause unexpected behavior.
**Vulnerability:**  Weaknesses in ncnn's model parsing logic, lack of proper input validation for model files, or insecure handling of model sources.
**Potential Outcome:** Remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Supply Malicious Model File [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/3__supply_malicious_model_file__cn_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Providing a specially crafted model file to the application that exploits vulnerabilities within ncnn when the model is loaded.
**Vulnerability:**  Lack of integrity checks on model files, vulnerabilities in the model file format parsing, or the ability to embed executable code within the model.
**Potential Outcome:** Remote code execution, denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Inject Malicious Code into Model File](./attack_tree_paths/4__inject_malicious_code_into_model_file.md)

**Attack Vector:** Embedding malicious code within the model file that will be executed when the model is loaded by ncnn.
**Vulnerability:**
    * **Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Model Format:**  If the model format uses serialization, vulnerabilities in the deserialization process can allow the execution of arbitrary code embedded within the serialized data.
    * **Exploit Code Execution During Model Loading:**  Certain model formats or ncnn's parsing logic might allow for the execution of embedded scripts or code during the loading or initialization phase.
**Potential Outcome:** Remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Craft Model with Malicious Serialized Objects [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/5__craft_model_with_malicious_serialized_objects__cn_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Creating a model file that contains specially crafted serialized objects that, when deserialized by ncnn, trigger the execution of malicious code.
**Vulnerability:** Insecure deserialization practices within ncnn's model loading process.
**Potential Outcome:** Remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Craft Model that Triggers Execution of Embedded Code [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/6__craft_model_that_triggers_execution_of_embedded_code__cn_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Creating a model file that leverages specific features or vulnerabilities in ncnn's parsing logic to execute embedded code during the loading process.
**Vulnerability:**  Design flaws or bugs in ncnn that allow for the execution of code embedded within the model file.
**Potential Outcome:** Remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Trigger Buffer Overflow in Model Parsing [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/7__trigger_buffer_overflow_in_model_parsing__cn_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Providing a model file with oversized or unexpected data fields that exceed the buffer allocated by ncnn during parsing, leading to memory corruption.
**Vulnerability:**  Lack of proper bounds checking and input validation during model file parsing in ncnn.
**Potential Outcome:** Denial of service (crash) or, in more severe cases, remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Craft Model with Oversized or Unexpected Data Fields [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/8__craft_model_with_oversized_or_unexpected_data_fields__cn_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Creating a model file with data fields that are larger than expected or contain unexpected values, specifically targeting potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities in ncnn's parsing logic.
**Vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation and bounds checking in ncnn's model parsing routines.
**Potential Outcome:** Denial of service or remote code execution.
