# Threat Model Analysis for tencent/ncnn

## Threat: [Malicious Model Injection](./threats/malicious_model_injection.md)

- **Description:** An attacker provides a crafted ncnn model file (`.param` or `.bin`) designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the ncnn model loading or execution process. This could involve tricking the application into loading a model from an untrusted source or manipulating a model in transit.
- **Impact:**  Remote code execution on the server or client, denial of service due to crashes or resource exhaustion, or manipulation of the application's behavior based on the attacker's model.
- **Affected ncnn Component:** ncnn model loader (parsing `.param` and `.bin` files), ncnn execution engine.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement strict validation and sanitization of model files before loading.
    - Only load models from trusted and verified sources.
    - Use digital signatures or checksums to verify the integrity of model files.
    - Isolate the ncnn execution environment with sandboxing or containerization.

## Threat: [Model Structure Exploitation](./threats/model_structure_exploitation.md)

- **Description:** An attacker crafts a seemingly valid ncnn model with specific layer configurations or parameters that trigger vulnerabilities within ncnn's execution engine during inference. This could exploit edge cases or unhandled scenarios in specific layers.
- **Impact:** Crashes, unexpected behavior, or information leakage during model inference. In some cases, it might lead to denial of service.
- **Affected ncnn Component:** ncnn execution engine (specific layers or operations within the network).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Keep ncnn updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    - Implement input validation on data passed to the model to prevent triggering vulnerable code paths.
    - Consider running ncnn in a controlled environment with resource limits.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Large Models](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_large_models.md)

- **Description:** An attacker provides an excessively large or computationally complex ncnn model that, when loaded or executed, consumes excessive CPU, memory, or other system resources, leading to a denial of service.
- **Impact:** Application slowdown, instability, or complete unavailability.
- **Affected ncnn Component:** ncnn model loader, ncnn execution engine, memory management within ncnn.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement limits on the size and complexity of models that can be loaded.
    - Monitor resource usage during model loading and inference.
    - Implement timeouts for model loading and inference operations.
    - Pre-process or analyze models before deployment to assess their resource requirements.

## Threat: [Bugs in ncnn Native Code](./threats/bugs_in_ncnn_native_code.md)

- **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist within the core C++ codebase of the ncnn library itself, such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, use-after-free errors, or other memory safety issues. An attacker could trigger these bugs through carefully crafted inputs or model files.
- **Impact:** Crashes, denial of service, arbitrary code execution on the system running ncnn.
- **Affected ncnn Component:** Core ncnn library code (various modules and functions).
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Regularly update to the latest stable version of ncnn.
    - Monitor ncnn's issue tracker and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities.
    - Consider using static and dynamic analysis tools on the ncnn library itself (if feasible).
