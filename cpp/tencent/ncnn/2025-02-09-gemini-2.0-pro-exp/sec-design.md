# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Code reviews are performed to identify and address potential security issues. (Mentioned in contribution guidelines and observed in pull requests).
*   security control: Static analysis tools are used to detect potential vulnerabilities. (Implied by the project's focus on performance and reliability, and common practice in C++ development).
*   security control: Fuzzing is employed to test the robustness of the framework against unexpected inputs. (Mentioned in the documentation and observed in the repository).
*   security control: The framework is designed to minimize external dependencies, reducing the attack surface. (Observed in the project structure and build system).
*   security control: Regular updates and bug fixes are released to address identified vulnerabilities. (Observed in the release history).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The framework relies on the security of the underlying operating system and hardware platform.
*   accepted risk: The framework does not provide built-in encryption for models or data. Users are responsible for implementing appropriate security measures if needed.
*   accepted risk: The framework is primarily designed for inference, not training. Security considerations related to model training are outside the scope of the project.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a comprehensive security testing program, including penetration testing and dynamic analysis.
*   security control: Develop a security vulnerability disclosure policy and establish a process for handling reported vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Provide clear documentation on security best practices for using the framework, including input validation and data sanitization.
*   security control: Consider adding support for secure enclaves or trusted execution environments (TEEs) to protect sensitive models and data.
*   security control: Integrate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation to improve supply chain security.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable, as ncnn is an inference framework, not a service requiring authentication.
*   Authorization: Not directly applicable, as ncnn is an inference framework. Access control is managed by the application using ncnn.
*   Input Validation:
    *   The framework should validate the input tensor data to ensure it conforms to the expected format and range.
    *   The framework should handle invalid or malicious input gracefully, without crashing or exposing vulnerabilities.
    *   The framework should validate model parameters and structure to prevent loading of corrupted or malicious models.
*   Cryptography:
    *   While ncnn itself doesn't handle encryption, it should be compatible with applications that use encryption for model and data protection.
    *   If model or data encryption is used, ncnn should be able to work with decrypted data without introducing vulnerabilities.
*   General:
    *   The framework should follow secure coding practices to minimize the risk of vulnerabilities.
    *   The framework should be regularly tested for security vulnerabilities.
    *   The framework should have a secure supply chain.
