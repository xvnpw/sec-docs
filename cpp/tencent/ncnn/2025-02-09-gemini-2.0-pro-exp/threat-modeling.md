# Threat Model Analysis for tencent/ncnn

## Threat: [Malicious Model Substitution](./threats/malicious_model_substitution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker replaces a legitimate ncnn model file (`.param` and/or `.bin`) with a crafted malicious model.  While the *attack vector* might be external (e.g., compromising a server), the vulnerability lies in ncnn *loading and trusting* the malicious file without sufficient verification. The malicious model could be designed to produce incorrect outputs, leak information, or even contain embedded code to exploit vulnerabilities during inference.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of application integrity, incorrect results, potential data leakage, and potential for arbitrary code execution (if combined with other vulnerabilities within ncnn's parsing or execution logic).
    *   **Affected ncnn Component:** `Net::load_param`, `Net::load_model`, model loading and parsing logic in general.  Specifically, the lack of built-in, robust integrity checks within these functions is the core issue.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Cryptographic Hashing (Mandatory):**  The application *must* calculate and verify SHA-256 (or stronger) hashes of the `.param` and `.bin` files before passing them to `Net::load_param` or `Net::load_model`.  Compare against a securely stored, trusted hash.  This is *not* optional; ncnn does not do this automatically.
        *   **Digital Signatures (Strongly Recommended):** Digitally sign the model files and verify the signature within the application before loading. This provides stronger protection than hashing alone.
        *   **Do NOT rely solely on file size or other weak checks.**

## Threat: [ncnn Library Tampering](./threats/ncnn_library_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker modifies the compiled ncnn library (e.g., `.so`, `.dll`, `.a`) on the target system.  Again, the *attack vector* might be external, but the vulnerability is the lack of built-in self-integrity checks within the ncnn library.  A modified library could introduce arbitrary malicious behavior during inference.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of application integrity, arbitrary control over inference, potential for code execution, and data leakage.
    *   **Affected ncnn Component:** The entire ncnn library (all compiled components).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Library Integrity Verification (Mandatory):** The application *must* calculate and verify cryptographic hashes of the ncnn library files before loading (or linking). This is crucial to detect tampering.
        *   **Secure Build Environment (If compiling from source):** If compiling ncnn from source, ensure a secure and isolated build environment, free from malware.
        *   **Use Official Releases (and verify):** Prefer official, pre-built releases from Tencent and verify their authenticity (e.g., check digital signatures *if* provided by Tencent; if not, strongly consider compiling from source with integrity checks).

## Threat: [Input Data Manipulation (Buffer Overflow)](./threats/input_data_manipulation__buffer_overflow_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input data (e.g., an image with excessively large dimensions or specially crafted pixel values) that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability *within* ncnn's input processing or layer implementations. This is a direct vulnerability in ncnn's code.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (crash), potential for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Affected ncnn Component:** Input layers (e.g., `ncnn::Mat`), image processing functions (if used), and potentially any layer that handles input data directly. Specific vulnerable functions would depend on the discovered vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical if code execution is possible)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation (Application-Level, but crucial):** Enforce strict size and type checks on all input data *before* passing it to ncnn. This is the first line of defense.
        *   **Fuzz Testing (of ncnn):** Perform extensive fuzz testing of ncnn's input handling, focusing on edge cases and boundary conditions. This should target ncnn's code directly.
        *   **Memory Safety Audits (of ncnn):** Regularly audit ncnn's C++ code for potential buffer overflows and other memory safety issues. This requires expertise in C++ security.

## Threat: [Input Data Manipulation (Integer Overflow)](./threats/input_data_manipulation__integer_overflow_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides input data that causes integer overflows or underflows *within* ncnn's calculations, leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. This is a direct vulnerability in ncnn's code.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, incorrect results, potential for exploitation (depending on how the overflow is handled).
    *   **Affected ncnn Component:** Any layer or function that performs arithmetic operations on input data or intermediate results. Potentially vulnerable areas include convolution layers, pooling layers, and custom layers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation (Application-Level, but crucial):** Validate input data to ensure it falls within expected ranges and does not cause integer overflows *within ncnn's expected operational parameters*.
        *   **Checked Arithmetic (within ncnn - requires code modification):** Ideally, ncnn should use checked arithmetic operations (e.g., detecting overflows) where possible. This would require modifying ncnn's source code.
        *   **Fuzz Testing (of ncnn):** Fuzz test ncnn with inputs designed to trigger integer overflows.

## Threat: [Use-After-Free Vulnerability in ncnn](./threats/use-after-free_vulnerability_in_ncnn.md)

*   **Description:** A bug *within* ncnn causes memory to be accessed after it has been freed. This is a direct vulnerability in ncnn's code.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, potential for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Affected ncnn Component:** Any component that manages memory dynamically. Specific layers or operations that allocate and deallocate memory are potential targets.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical if code execution is possible)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Memory Analysis Tools (on ncnn):** Use memory analysis tools (e.g., Valgrind, AddressSanitizer) to detect use-after-free errors *during ncnn's development and testing*.
        *   **Code Reviews (of ncnn):** Carefully review ncnn's code for potential use-after-free vulnerabilities. This requires C++ security expertise.
        *   **Fuzz Testing (of ncnn):** Fuzz test ncnn to try to trigger use-after-free errors.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep ncnn updated to the latest version to benefit from any bug fixes related to memory management.
