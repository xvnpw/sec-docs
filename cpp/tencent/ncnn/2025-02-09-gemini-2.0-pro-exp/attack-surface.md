# Attack Surface Analysis for tencent/ncnn

## Attack Surface: [1. Malicious Model Loading](./attack_surfaces/1__malicious_model_loading.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers provide crafted `.param` and `.bin` files designed to exploit vulnerabilities in `ncnn`'s model loading or parsing process, leading to code execution or denial of service.  This is the primary attack vector.
    *   **How ncnn Contributes:** `ncnn`'s core functionality is loading and executing these model files. The `.param` and `.bin` file formats and the parsing logic are specific to `ncnn`.  Vulnerabilities in this process are directly attributable to `ncnn`.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a `.param` file with an invalid layer configuration that triggers a buffer overflow or integer overflow during parsing within `ncnn`, leading to arbitrary code execution.  Alternatively, a `.param` file with extremely large layer sizes could cause a denial-of-service due to memory exhaustion when `ncnn` attempts to allocate memory.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE), Denial of Service (DoS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Model Source Control:** *Only* load models from trusted, verified sources. Implement strong integrity checks (cryptographic signatures, checksums, and a chain of trust) for model files. Never load models directly from untrusted input.
        *   **Robust Model Validation:** Implement a pre-loading validator that parses the `.param` file *before* passing it to `ncnn`. This validator *must*:
            *   Enforce strict, *hard-coded* limits on layer sizes, the number of layers, supported operation types, and other model parameters. Reject any model exceeding these limits.  This is the most important mitigation.
            *   Use a whitelist of allowed layer types and configurations, rejecting anything not on the whitelist.
            *   Consider static analysis techniques to identify potentially dangerous patterns in the model structure, if feasible.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Execute `ncnn`'s model loading and inference within a sandboxed environment (e.g., a container) with restricted privileges and resource quotas (CPU, memory). This limits the impact of a successful exploit.

## Attack Surface: [2. Inference Engine Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/2__inference_engine_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities within `ncnn`'s inference engine (the code that executes the loaded model) using carefully crafted input data, potentially in combination with a specifically designed (but not necessarily overtly malicious) model. This exploits bugs in `ncnn`'s runtime.
    *   **How ncnn Contributes:** The inference engine is entirely `ncnn` code. Any vulnerabilities in this code are directly attributable to `ncnn`'s implementation.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides input data that, when processed by a specific layer type within a seemingly legitimate model, triggers a use-after-free error or a buffer overflow in `ncnn`'s memory management during inference, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE), Denial of Service (DoS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Conduct *extensive* fuzz testing of the `ncnn` inference engine. Use a wide variety of models (including those with unusual or edge-case configurations) and a diverse range of input data. This is crucial for finding subtle bugs.
        *   **Code Auditing:** Regularly audit the `ncnn` codebase, with a particular focus on the inference engine, memory management routines, and any code that handles input data or interacts with model parameters.
        *   **Sandboxing:** As with model loading, sandboxing the inference process is essential to contain the impact of any successful exploit. Use containers or other sandboxing technologies.
        *   **Stay Updated:** Apply `ncnn` updates promptly. Security patches are often included in new releases.
