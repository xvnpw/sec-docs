## Attack Tree Path: [Attacker's Goal: Compromise MMKV Data/Functionality [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/attacker's_goal_compromise_mmkv_datafunctionality__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker is to gain unauthorized access to, modify, or delete sensitive data stored within MMKV, or to cause a denial-of-service condition specific to the MMKV component.
*   **Criticality:** This is the root of the entire threat model and, by definition, a critical node.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Data Exfiltration [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1__data_exfiltration__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker aims to steal sensitive data stored in MMKV.
*   **High Risk:** This is a primary attack vector due to the potential for significant data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Shared MMKV Access [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_shared_mmkv_access__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities related to how MMKV handles shared access between processes. This is a high-risk path because MMKV is designed for inter-process communication, and improper configuration can expose data.
*   **High Risk:** The combination of shared access and potential lack of encryption or access control makes this a highly exploitable path.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2 Lack of Data Encryption [HR] [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_lack_of_data_encryption__hr___cn_.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data is stored in MMKV *without* encryption. This is a critical vulnerability because any access to the MMKV instance, regardless of the method, will expose the data.
*   **High Risk:** This is a common and easily exploitable vulnerability.
*   **Criticality:** This is a single point of failure. If data is unencrypted, any other security measures are significantly weakened.
*  **Likelihood:** High
*  **Impact:** High
*  **Effort:** Low
*  **Skill Level:** Novice
*  **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.1 No MMKV Encryption [HR] [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_1_no_mmkv_encryption__hr___cn_.md)

*   **Description:** The application simply doesn't use MMKV's encryption features, leaving all data in plain text.
*   **High Risk:** This is the most severe and easily exploitable form of the "Lack of Data Encryption" vulnerability.
*   **Criticality:** This represents the worst-case scenario for data protection within MMKV.
*  **Likelihood:** High
*  **Impact:** High
*  **Effort:** Very Low
*  **Skill Level:** Novice
*  **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Data Modification [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2__data_modification__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker aims to alter sensitive data stored in MMKV without authorization.
*   **High Risk:** This is a primary attack vector, as unauthorized modification can be as damaging as data theft.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Shared MMKV Access [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_shared_mmkv_access__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to 1.2, but the attacker's goal is to modify data. Exploits vulnerabilities related to how MMKV handles shared access between processes.
*   **High Risk:** The combination of shared access and potential lack of encryption or access control makes this a highly exploitable path.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.2 Lack of Data Encryption [HR] [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_2_lack_of_data_encryption__hr___cn_.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data is stored in MMKV *without* encryption, making it vulnerable to unauthorized modification if an attacker gains access.
*   **High Risk:** This is a common and easily exploitable vulnerability.
*   **Criticality:** This is a single point of failure. If data is unencrypted, any other security measures are significantly weakened.
*  **Likelihood:** High
*  **Impact:** High
*  **Effort:** Low
*  **Skill Level:** Novice
*  **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
