# Attack Surface Analysis for tencent/mmkv

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Sensitive Data Storage](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_sensitive_data_storage.md)

*   **Description:** Storing sensitive information (passwords, tokens, PII) in MMKV without proper encryption.
*   **How MMKV Contributes:** MMKV provides a convenient storage mechanism, but it doesn't enforce encryption by default (although it offers an optional encryption feature). Developers might mistakenly assume it's secure without taking additional steps.
*   **Example:** An application stores a user's API key directly in MMKV without any encryption.
*   **Impact:** Complete exposure of the sensitive data if an attacker gains access to the device's storage or intercepts backups. This can lead to account compromise, data breaches, and identity theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Always encrypt sensitive data *before* storing it in MMKV, using strong, industry-standard algorithms (e.g., AES-256-GCM) and robust key management (e.g., Android Keystore, iOS Keychain). Never hardcode encryption keys.
    *   **Developer:** Utilize MMKV's built-in encryption *and* securely manage the encryption key. Do not rely solely on the built-in encryption without proper key protection.
    *   **Developer:** Minimize the amount of sensitive data stored. Only store what is absolutely necessary. Implement data retention policies to delete data when no longer needed.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Mismanaged Encryption Keys (for MMKV's built-in encryption)](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_mismanaged_encryption_keys__for_mmkv's_built-in_encryption_.md)

*   **Description:** Using MMKV's built-in encryption, but with a weak, predictable, or improperly stored key.
*   **How MMKV Contributes:** MMKV provides the *option* for encryption, but the security of this feature depends entirely on the key management practices of the application.
*   **Example:** An application uses MMKV's encryption but stores the encryption key in plain text within the application's code or in a shared preference file.
*   **Impact:**  The encryption is rendered useless, and the data is effectively stored in plain text.  An attacker who finds the key can decrypt all data.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Use a strong key derivation function (KDF) like PBKDF2, scrypt, or Argon2 to derive the encryption key from a user-provided password or other secret.
    *   **Developer:** Store the encryption key securely using platform-specific secure storage (Android Keystore, iOS Keychain).
    *   **Developer:** Implement key rotation policies to periodically change the encryption key.

## Attack Surface: [Data Tampering](./attack_surfaces/data_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker modifying the data stored in MMKV without detection.
*   **How MMKV Contributes:** MMKV uses CRC32 for integrity checks, which is *not* cryptographically secure and only detects accidental corruption, not malicious modification.
*   **Example:** An attacker modifies a configuration value stored in MMKV to disable a security feature within the application.
*   **Impact:** Application malfunction, denial of service, potential for arbitrary code execution (if the tampered data is used in a security-sensitive context), or bypassing security controls.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Use a cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) or a Message Authentication Code (MAC) like HMAC-SHA256 to verify the integrity of the data *before* using it. Store the hash/MAC securely.
    *   **Developer:** If using MMKV's encryption with an authenticated encryption mode (like GCM), this provides inherent integrity protection. However, this relies on the security of the encryption key.

## Attack Surface: [Data Leakage Through Backups](./attack_surfaces/data_leakage_through_backups.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data stored in MMKV being included in unencrypted or weakly protected device backups.
*   **How MMKV Contributes:** MMKV stores data in files that can be included in standard device backups unless explicitly excluded.
*   **Example:** An application stores user session tokens in MMKV, and these tokens are included in an unencrypted cloud backup.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potentially leading to account compromise, even if the application itself uses encryption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Carefully configure backup settings to exclude sensitive data. On Android, use `android:allowBackup` and `android:fullBackupContent` in the manifest.
    *   **Developer:** Consider using a separate, more secure storage mechanism for highly sensitive data that should never be backed up.
