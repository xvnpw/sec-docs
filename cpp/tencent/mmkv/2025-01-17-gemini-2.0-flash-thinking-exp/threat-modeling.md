# Threat Model Analysis for tencent/mmkv

## Threat: [Unencrypted Data Exposure](./threats/unencrypted_data_exposure.md)

**Description:** An attacker with physical access to the device or through malware exploiting file system vulnerabilities could directly access and read the MMKV data files stored on disk, as the default configuration does not encrypt the data.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of sensitive data stored by the application using MMKV, potentially leading to identity theft, financial loss, privacy violations, or other security breaches depending on the nature of the data.

**Affected Component:** MMKV Core (file storage mechanism)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enable MMKV's built-in encryption feature using `MMKV.initialize(rootDir, MMKV.MULTI_PROCESS_MODE, cryptoKey)`.
*   Ensure the `cryptoKey` is generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator and is stored securely (e.g., using Android Keystore or iOS Keychain).
*   Avoid storing highly sensitive data in MMKV if encryption cannot be guaranteed or is not implemented correctly.

## Threat: [Weak Encryption or Key Management](./threats/weak_encryption_or_key_management.md)

**Description:** If encryption is enabled, but a weak encryption algorithm or a poorly managed encryption key is used *within MMKV's encryption implementation*, an attacker with sufficient resources and expertise could potentially break the encryption and access the stored data. This could involve exploiting weaknesses in the algorithm or key derivation process used by MMKV.

**Impact:**  Compromise of sensitive data, similar to the unencrypted data exposure threat, although potentially requiring more effort from the attacker.

**Affected Component:** MMKV Encryption Module

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize strong and well-vetted encryption algorithms supported by MMKV.
*   Ensure the encryption key is sufficiently long and complex.
*   Employ secure key generation and storage mechanisms provided by the operating system (e.g., Android Keystore, iOS Keychain).
*   Regularly review and update encryption practices as new vulnerabilities are discovered.

## Threat: [File Tampering](./threats/file_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker with physical access to the device or through malware exploiting file system vulnerabilities could modify the MMKV data files directly. While encryption helps, if MMKV doesn't implement robust integrity checks, tampered encrypted data might still cause issues or be partially exploitable.

**Impact:** Data integrity compromise, leading to incorrect application behavior, potential security vulnerabilities if the tampered data is used in security-sensitive operations, or denial of service if critical data is deleted.

**Affected Component:** MMKV Core (file storage mechanism)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enable MMKV's encryption feature, which provides a degree of protection against tampering as modifications would require knowledge of the encryption key.
*   Implement application-level integrity checks (e.g., checksums or digital signatures) for critical data stored in MMKV.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in MMKV Library](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_mmkv_library.md)

**Description:**  Security vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, memory corruption issues) might exist within the MMKV library itself. If discovered and exploited, these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the application's context or cause other severe security breaches.

**Impact:**  Complete compromise of the application, potentially leading to data theft, remote code execution, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Various MMKV Modules (depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the MMKV library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
*   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues in MMKV.
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization practices in the application to prevent exploitation of potential vulnerabilities in MMKV.
