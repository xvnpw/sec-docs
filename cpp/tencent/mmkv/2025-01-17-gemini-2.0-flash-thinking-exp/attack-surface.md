# Attack Surface Analysis for tencent/mmkv

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized File System Access to MMKV Data](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_file_system_access_to_mmkv_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the device's file system and directly reads or modifies the MMKV data files.

**How MMKV Contributes:** MMKV stores data unencrypted by default in files within the application's data directory. The location and format of these files are generally predictable.

**Example:** An attacker uses a rooted device or exploits a file system vulnerability to browse the application's data directory and open the MMKV files to view sensitive user information or application settings.

**Impact:** Data breach, exposure of sensitive user information, modification of application settings leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Enable MMKV Encryption:** Utilize MMKV's built-in encryption feature to encrypt data at rest. This requires managing an encryption key securely.
* **Secure File System Permissions:** Ensure the application's data directory has appropriate file system permissions to restrict access to authorized users and processes only.

## Attack Surface: [Symbolic Link Attacks Targeting MMKV Files](./attack_surfaces/symbolic_link_attacks_targeting_mmkv_files.md)

**Description:** An attacker creates symbolic links that redirect MMKV file operations to unintended locations on the file system.

**How MMKV Contributes:** MMKV interacts with the file system based on the provided paths. If these paths are manipulated through symbolic links, MMKV might unknowingly operate on different files.

**Example:** An attacker creates a symbolic link that makes MMKV write its data to a sensitive system file instead of its intended location.

**Impact:** Overwriting critical system files, data breaches by redirecting data storage, denial of service by filling up unintended storage locations.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Canonicalize File Paths:** Before performing file operations, the application should canonicalize the paths used by MMKV to resolve any symbolic links.
* **Restrict File System Permissions:** Implement strict file system permissions to prevent unauthorized creation of symbolic links in the application's data directory.

## Attack Surface: [API Misuse Leading to Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/api_misuse_leading_to_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Developers misuse MMKV's API in a way that introduces security vulnerabilities.

**How MMKV Contributes:** MMKV provides an API for storing and retrieving data. Incorrect usage can lead to security flaws.

**Example:** Developers store sensitive data in MMKV without encryption, relying solely on file system permissions, which can be bypassed.

**Impact:** Data breaches, exposure of sensitive information.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Follow Security Best Practices:** Adhere to security best practices when using MMKV, such as always encrypting sensitive data.
* **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify potential misuse of the MMKV API.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in the MMKV Library Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_the_mmkv_library_itself.md)

**Description:** Security vulnerabilities exist within the MMKV library code.

**How MMKV Contributes:** As a third-party library, MMKV itself might contain bugs or vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

**Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability is discovered in MMKV's data parsing logic, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code by crafting malicious data.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep MMKV Updated:** Regularly update the MMKV library to the latest version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
* **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories and vulnerability disclosures related to MMKV.
