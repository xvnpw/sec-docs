# Attack Tree Analysis for tencent/mmkv

Objective: Gain unauthorized access to sensitive application data stored in MMKV, manipulate this data, or disrupt the application's functionality by exploiting MMKV's characteristics through high-risk pathways.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
Compromise Application Using MMKV
* Exploit MMKV's File-Based Storage
    * Gain Unauthorized File System Access to MMKV Files **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        * **Exploit Weak File Permissions on MMKV Files [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    * Modify MMKV Files Directly **[HIGH-RISK PATH START]**
        * **Write Malicious Data to MMKV Files [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
* Exploit Application Logic Interacting with MMKV **[HIGH-RISK PATH START]**
    * Abuse Application Logic Based on MMKV Data **[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        * **Manipulate Data in MMKV to Alter Application Behavior [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak File Permissions on MMKV Files [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_file_permissions_on_mmkv_files__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The application or the deployment process creates MMKV files with overly permissive file system permissions (e.g., world-readable or world-writable).
* **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends heavily on the development and deployment security practices).
* **Impact:** High (Direct access to sensitive data stored in MMKV, potential for data breaches).
* **Effort:** Low (Easily exploitable once identified).
* **Skill Level:** Low (Requires basic understanding of file system permissions).
* **Detection Difficulty:** Low (If actively monitored for file permission changes) / High (If not).

## Attack Tree Path: [Write Malicious Data to MMKV Files [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/write_malicious_data_to_mmkv_files__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker, having gained unauthorized file system access (e.g., through exploiting weak permissions or other vulnerabilities), directly modifies the content of MMKV files to inject malicious data.
* **Likelihood:** Medium (Dependent on successfully gaining unauthorized file system access).
* **Impact:** High (Data manipulation leading to application logic bypass, privilege escalation, or other malicious behavior).
* **Effort:** Low (Once file access is achieved, writing data is straightforward).
* **Skill Level:** Low (Requires basic understanding of file writing).
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium/High (Without robust integrity checks on MMKV file content).

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Data in MMKV to Alter Application Behavior [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_data_in_mmkv_to_alter_application_behavior__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The application logic relies on data stored in MMKV without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker, having gained the ability to modify MMKV data (either through direct file access or potentially through application vulnerabilities), alters this data to influence the application's behavior in unintended and malicious ways.
* **Likelihood:** Medium (If the application logic heavily depends on MMKV data without sufficient validation).
* **Impact:** High (Privilege escalation, bypassing security checks, altering application workflows, potentially leading to further compromise).
* **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding of the application's logic and how it uses MMKV data).
* **Skill Level:** Medium (Requires some understanding of application architecture and data flow).
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium/High (Depends on the effectiveness of logging and monitoring of application behavior and data changes).
