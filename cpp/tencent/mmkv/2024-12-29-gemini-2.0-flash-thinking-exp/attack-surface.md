**Key Attack Surface List (High & Critical, Directly Involving MMKV):**

*   **Attack Surface:** Unauthorized Access to MMKV Files
    *   **Description:**  Malicious actors or other applications gaining unauthorized read or write access to the MMKV files stored by the application.
    *   **How MMKV Contributes:** MMKV stores data in local files on the device's file system. If these files are not properly protected by the operating system's file permissions, they can be accessed by other applications or malicious actors.
    *   **Example:** A malicious app installed on the same device could potentially read the MMKV files if the application's data directory has overly permissive access rights.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data stored within MMKV, such as user credentials, personal information, or application secrets. This can lead to identity theft, account compromise, or other security breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the application's data directory and MMKV files have the most restrictive permissions possible, typically accessible only by the application's user ID.
        *   Utilize MMKV's built-in encryption feature for sensitive data to protect it even if unauthorized access occurs.
        *   Consider storing MMKV files in secure application-specific directories that are less likely to be accessible by other applications.

*   **Attack Surface:** Data Corruption through External Modification
    *   **Description:**  Malicious actors or other applications modifying the MMKV files, leading to data corruption and potential application malfunction.
    *   **How MMKV Contributes:** MMKV directly interacts with the file system. If an attacker gains write access to the MMKV files, they can arbitrarily modify the data, potentially breaking the application's logic or causing crashes.
    *   **Example:** A rooted device with a compromised application could modify the MMKV files, injecting malicious data or corrupting critical application settings.
    *   **Impact:** Application instability, crashes, unexpected behavior, data loss, or even the introduction of vulnerabilities if the corrupted data is later processed by the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Prevent unauthorized write access to the MMKV files by ensuring restrictive file permissions.
        *   Implement mechanisms within the application to verify the integrity of data read from MMKV, such as checksums or signatures.
        *   Implement backup strategies for critical data stored in MMKV to allow for recovery in case of corruption.

*   **Attack Surface:** Weak Encryption or Key Management (If Encryption is Enabled)
    *   **Description:**  Using a weak encryption algorithm or insecurely managing the encryption key when utilizing MMKV's encryption feature.
    *   **How MMKV Contributes:** MMKV provides an encryption option, but the security of the encrypted data depends entirely on the strength of the chosen algorithm and the secure management of the encryption key by the application.
    *   **Example:**  Using a simple or easily guessable password as the encryption key, or storing the key insecurely within the application's code or shared preferences.
    *   **Impact:**  The encryption can be easily broken, exposing the sensitive data stored within MMKV. This negates the intended security benefit of encryption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use a robust and well-vetted encryption algorithm supported by MMKV.
        *   Generate strong, cryptographically secure encryption keys.
        *   Store the encryption key securely, utilizing platform-specific secure storage mechanisms (e.g., Android Keystore, iOS Keychain). Avoid hardcoding keys or storing them in easily accessible locations.
        *   Implement a key rotation strategy to periodically change the encryption key.
