# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for tencent/mmkv

## Mitigation Strategy: [Encryption at Rest](./mitigation_strategies/encryption_at_rest.md)

### 1. Encryption at Rest

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Encryption at Rest for MMKV Data
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Encryption Method:** Select an appropriate encryption method to protect sensitive data *before* it is stored using `mmkv`.  `mmkv` itself does not encrypt data.
    2.  **Implement Encryption Wrappers:** Create wrapper functions or classes around your `mmkv` read and write operations.
    3.  **Encryption on Write:** In the write wrapper, encrypt the data using a secure encryption algorithm (like AES) and a securely managed encryption key *before* calling `mmkv`'s `set` methods to store the encrypted data.
    4.  **Decryption on Read:** In the read wrapper, retrieve the encrypted data from `mmkv` using `mmkv`'s `get` methods. *After* retrieving the data, decrypt it using the corresponding decryption key and algorithm before returning it to the application.
    5.  **Key Management:** Securely manage encryption keys using platform-specific key storage mechanisms (like Android Keystore or iOS Keychain) and avoid hardcoding keys in the application.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):** Mitigates the threat of unauthorized access to sensitive data stored by `mmkv` if an attacker gains physical access to the device or compromises the file system. Without decryption keys, the `mmkv` files will contain only encrypted, unusable data.
    *   **Data Breaches from Device Loss/Theft (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of data breaches if a device is lost or stolen, as the sensitive data within `mmkv` is encrypted and protected.
    *   **Malware Data Exfiltration (Medium Severity):** Makes it significantly harder for malware to extract and use sensitive data from `mmkv` as the data is encrypted.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Breaches from Device Loss/Theft:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Malware Data Exfiltration:** Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Encryption is used for user credentials stored in `mmkv` using Android Keystore on the Android platform. Wrappers are in place for credential storage.
    *   Location: `com.example.myapp.security.CredentialStorage` (Android), `MyApp.Security.CredentialManager` (iOS - placeholder, not fully implemented).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Encryption wrappers are not consistently applied to all sensitive data stored in `mmkv`. User profile information and application settings are currently stored unencrypted directly using `mmkv` methods.
    *   iOS implementation for encryption at rest wrappers is a placeholder and needs to be fully developed using iOS Keychain and proper wrapper implementation around `mmkv` usage.
    *   No centralized or enforced policy to use encryption wrappers for all sensitive data interacting with `mmkv`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure File Permissions for MMKV Storage](./mitigation_strategies/secure_file_permissions_for_mmkv_storage.md)

### 2. Secure File Permissions for MMKV Storage Directory

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure File Permissions for MMKV Storage Directory
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use Default MMKV Storage:** Utilize the default storage location provided by `mmkv`. By default, `mmkv` stores files in application-private storage, which inherently has restricted permissions enforced by the operating system.
    2.  **Verify Default Permissions:** Confirm that the default `mmkv` storage directory (e.g., within the app's private files directory on Android, or app sandbox on iOS) has appropriate permissions set by the OS, restricting access to only the application's user ID.
    3.  **Avoid Custom Storage (Unless Necessary & Secure):**  Avoid customizing the `mmkv` storage location to a publicly accessible directory (like external storage) unless absolutely necessary. If custom storage is required, ensure you manually set restrictive permissions on the directory using platform-specific APIs to mimic the security of default app-private storage.
    4.  **Regular Permission Checks (Optional):**  Implement checks during application startup or periodically to verify the permissions of the `mmkv` storage directory, especially if custom storage is used, to detect any unintended permission changes.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of other applications or malicious processes on the same device gaining unauthorized access to `mmkv` files by ensuring they are stored in locations with restricted file system permissions.
    *   **Data Tampering (Medium Severity):** Limits the ability of other applications or processes to tamper with data stored in `mmkv` by restricting write access to the storage directory.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Tampering:** Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented by default by the operating system's application sandboxing and private storage mechanisms on both Android and iOS when using default `mmkv` storage. The application currently uses the default `mmkv` storage location.
    *   Location: Operating System level file system permissions enforced on default app storage.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No explicit application-level checks or audits are currently in place to actively verify the security of file permissions for the `mmkv` storage directory during application runtime.
    *   No clear guidelines or warnings for developers against using insecure custom storage locations for `mmkv`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit MMKV Data Exposure in Backups](./mitigation_strategies/limit_mmkv_data_exposure_in_backups.md)

### 3. Limit MMKV Data Exposure in Device Backups

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Limit MMKV Data Exposure in Device Backups
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive MMKV Data:** Determine which specific data stored in `mmkv` is considered sensitive and should *not* be included in device backups (like iCloud, Google Drive, local backups).
    2.  **Selective Backup Exclusion for MMKV Directory:** Configure your application to selectively exclude the directory where `mmkv` stores its files from device backups.
        *   **Android:** Use `android:fullBackupContent` in `AndroidManifest.xml` to define a backup configuration file. Within this file, use `<exclude>` tags to specify the path to the `mmkv` storage directory.
        *   **iOS:** Set the "do not back up" attribute (`NSURLIsExcludedFromBackupKey`) for the directory where `mmkv` files are stored.
    3.  **Avoid Backing Up Entire MMKV Instance (If Possible):** If a significant portion of data in a specific `mmkv` instance is sensitive, consider excluding the entire `mmkv` instance's storage directory from backups rather than trying to selectively exclude individual data items within it.
    4.  **Document Backup Policy:** Clearly document your application's backup policy regarding `mmkv` data for developers to understand and maintain.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breaches via Backup Exploitation (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of attackers gaining access to sensitive data by compromising device backups. If backups are breached, the excluded `mmkv` data will not be present in the backup.
    *   **Privacy Violations (Medium Severity):** Protects user privacy by preventing sensitive personal information stored in `mmkv` from being inadvertently backed up and potentially exposed in less secure backup environments.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breaches via Backup Exploitation:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Privacy Violations:** Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented on Android. `android:allowBackup="false"` is set in the `AndroidManifest.xml` for the debug build variant, effectively excluding all app data (including `mmkv`) from backups in debug builds.
    *   Location: `AndroidManifest.xml` (debug build variant).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Selective backup exclusion of the `mmkv` storage directory is not implemented for production builds on Android. Production builds currently allow backups, potentially including sensitive data from `mmkv`.
    *   Backup exclusion for the `mmkv` directory is not implemented at all on iOS. iOS backups are enabled by default and likely include `mmkv` data.
    *   No clear guidelines on how to configure selective backup exclusion for `mmkv` data in production builds for either platform.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Integrity Checks for MMKV Data (HMAC)](./mitigation_strategies/data_integrity_checks_for_mmkv_data__hmac_.md)

### 4. Data Integrity Checks for MMKV Data (HMAC)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement HMAC-based Data Integrity Checks for Sensitive MMKV Data
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose HMAC Algorithm:** Select a robust HMAC algorithm (e.g., HMAC-SHA256).
    2.  **Secret Key for HMAC:** Generate and securely store a secret key specifically for HMAC calculation, separate from encryption keys if encryption is also used. Use secure key storage (Android Keystore/iOS Keychain).
    3.  **HMAC Generation on Write to MMKV:** When storing sensitive data in `mmkv`, calculate the HMAC of the data using the secret key and the chosen algorithm *before* storing it. Store both the data and its generated HMAC in `mmkv`.
    4.  **HMAC Verification on Read from MMKV:** When retrieving sensitive data from `mmkv`, retrieve both the data and the stored HMAC. Recalculate the HMAC of the retrieved data using the same secret key and algorithm.
    5.  **Compare HMACs:** Compare the recalculated HMAC with the stored HMAC. If they match, the data is considered to be intact. If they do not match, it indicates potential data tampering or corruption.
    6.  **Handle Integrity Failure:** Implement error handling for HMAC verification failures. This could involve logging the error, discarding the potentially tampered data, or triggering a re-synchronization of data from a trusted source.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Tampering (Medium Severity):** Detects unauthorized modifications to sensitive data stored in `mmkv`. If an attacker gains file system access and alters `mmkv` files, the HMAC verification will likely fail upon reading, alerting the application to the tampering.
    *   **Data Corruption (Low Severity):** Can help detect accidental data corruption during storage or retrieval from `mmkv`, although this is a secondary benefit.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Tampering:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Corruption:** Low Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. No HMAC or other data integrity checks are currently used for data stored in `mmkv`. Data is read directly from `mmkv` without integrity verification.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implementation of HMAC integrity checks is needed for all sensitive data stored in `mmkv` where data integrity is critical.
    *   Secret key generation and secure storage for HMAC keys need to be implemented, ideally using the same secure key storage mechanisms as encryption keys.
    *   Wrapper functions or classes around `mmkv` read/write operations should be created to automatically handle HMAC generation and verification.
    *   Error handling logic for HMAC verification failures needs to be defined and implemented to ensure the application reacts appropriately to potential data tampering.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep MMKV Library Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_mmkv_library_updated.md)

### 5. Keep MMKV Library Updated

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update the MMKV Library
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor MMKV Releases:** Regularly check the official `mmkv` GitHub repository for new releases, bug fixes, and security updates. Subscribe to release notifications if available.
    2.  **Include MMKV Updates in Dependency Management:** Incorporate `mmkv` library updates into your regular dependency update process for your project (e.g., using Gradle for Android, CocoaPods/Swift Package Manager for iOS).
    3.  **Prioritize Security Updates:** Treat security-related updates for the `mmkv` library as high priority. Apply these updates promptly to patch any known vulnerabilities.
    4.  **Test Updates:** Before deploying updates to production, thoroughly test the application with the updated `mmkv` library in a staging or testing environment to ensure compatibility and prevent regressions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known MMKV Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Directly mitigates the risk of attackers exploiting known security vulnerabilities that may be discovered in the `mmkv` library itself. Updates often include patches for these vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known MMKV Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. The development team generally updates project dependencies periodically, including `mmkv`, but there is no formal, scheduled process specifically for checking and applying `mmkv` updates, especially security updates.
    *   Location: Ad-hoc dependency update process during development cycles.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No formal process for actively monitoring `mmkv` releases and security advisories.
    *   No automated checks or alerts for new `mmkv` updates, particularly security-related ones.
    *   No defined schedule or policy for applying `mmkv` updates, especially security updates, in a timely manner.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Scanning for MMKV Vulnerabilities](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_scanning_for_mmkv_vulnerabilities.md)

### 6. Dependency Scanning for MMKV Vulnerabilities

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Dependency Scanning to Detect MMKV Vulnerabilities
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Integrate Dependency Scanning Tool:** Integrate a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) or dependency scanning tool into your project's development pipeline (CI/CD). Choose a tool that supports scanning dependencies for your project's build system (Gradle, CocoaPods, Swift Package Manager).
    2.  **Configure Scanning for MMKV:** Ensure the dependency scanning tool is configured to specifically scan for known vulnerabilities in the `mmkv` library and its transitive dependencies.
    3.  **Automate Scanning in CI/CD:** Automate the dependency scanning process to run regularly as part of your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., on every commit, pull request, or nightly build).
    4.  **Vulnerability Reporting and Remediation Process:** Configure the scanning tool to generate reports of any identified vulnerabilities in `mmkv` or its dependencies. Establish a clear process for reviewing these reports, prioritizing vulnerabilities based on severity, and promptly remediating them by updating the `mmkv` library or applying other recommended mitigations.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known MMKV Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Proactively identifies known security vulnerabilities in the `mmkv` library and its dependencies before they can be exploited.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Medium Severity):** Helps detect potentially compromised or malicious versions of the `mmkv` library or its dependencies if they are introduced into the project's dependency chain.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known MMKV Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. No dependency scanning tools are currently integrated into the project's development pipeline to specifically scan for vulnerabilities in `mmkv` or other dependencies.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Integration of a dependency scanning tool into the CI/CD pipeline is required.
    *   Configuration of the tool to specifically scan for vulnerabilities related to the `mmkv` library.
    *   Establishment of a vulnerability reporting and remediation workflow to address any vulnerabilities detected in `mmkv` by the scanning tool.
