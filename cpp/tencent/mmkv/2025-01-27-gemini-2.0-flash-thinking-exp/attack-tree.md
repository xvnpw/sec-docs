## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via MMKV Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE - ROOT GOAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_mmkv_exploitation__critical_node_-_root_goal_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** Any successful exploitation of vulnerabilities in MMKV usage leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of application data and functionality.
*   **Breakdown:** This is the overarching objective. Attackers aim to undermine application security by targeting weaknesses related to MMKV data storage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File System Access Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_system_access_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** Gaining unauthorized access to the file system where MMKV stores its data files.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Physical Device Access [CRITICAL NODE - HIGH LIKELIHOOD & IMPACT]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Device theft or loss.
            *   Insider threats with physical access.
            *   Compromised device security allowing physical access.
        *   **Breakdown:** Direct physical access allows bypassing application-level security and accessing files directly, including MMKV data.
    *   **External Storage World-Readable/Writable [CRITICAL NODE - MISCONFIGURATION]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Developer misconfiguration storing MMKV data on external storage.
            *   Incorrect file permission settings on external storage.
        *   **Breakdown:** Storing MMKV data on external storage with weak permissions makes it easily accessible to other applications or users, bypassing application sandboxing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Encryption (If Encryption Not Enabled) [CRITICAL NODE & HIGH-RISK PATH - MAJOR VULNERABILITY]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_encryption__if_encryption_not_enabled___critical_node_&_high-risk_path_-_major_vulne_6ab88ade.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** Storing sensitive data in MMKV without enabling encryption.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Sensitive Data Stored in MMKV [CRITICAL NODE - DATA AT RISK]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:** Application design decisions to store sensitive information in MMKV.
        *   **Breakdown:**  If sensitive data is placed in MMKV, it becomes a high-value target for attackers.
    *   **Encryption Not Enabled for MMKV Instance [CRITICAL NODE - DEVELOPER OVERSIGHT]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:** Developer oversight or intentional decision not to enable encryption.
        *   **Breakdown:** Failure to enable encryption leaves sensitive data vulnerable if file system access is compromised.
    *   **Read plaintext sensitive data from MMKV files [CRITICAL NODE - DATA BREACH]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:** Successful exploitation of file system access vulnerabilities.
        *   **Breakdown:** Once file system access is achieved, plaintext sensitive data in MMKV files can be directly read, resulting in a data breach.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak Encryption Implementation (If Encryption Enabled) [HIGH-RISK PATH if poorly implemented]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_encryption_implementation__if_encryption_enabled___high-risk_path_if_poorly_implemented_f1f79804.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**  Using weak key derivation methods or storing encryption keys insecurely.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Predictable Key Derivation Method [CRITICAL NODE - KEY COMPROMISE]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Using easily reversible algorithms for key derivation.
            *   Basing key derivation on predictable device or user information.
        *   **Breakdown:** Weak key derivation allows attackers to reverse engineer the process and reconstruct the encryption key.
    *   **Key Stored Insecurely [CRITICAL NODE - KEY COMPROMISE]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Hardcoding keys in application code.
            *   Storing keys in shared preferences or other easily accessible storage.
            *   Exposing keys in memory dumps.
        *   **Breakdown:** Insecure key storage makes it easy for attackers to extract the key and bypass encryption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application Logic Vulnerabilities via MMKV Data Manipulation [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application_logic_vulnerabilities_via_mmkv_data_manipulation__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** Manipulating MMKV data to exploit flaws in application logic, especially security-sensitive operations.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Application Logic Relies on MMKV Data for Security-Sensitive Operations [CRITICAL NODE - APPLICATION DESIGN FLAW]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**  Application design that directly uses MMKV data for critical security decisions without proper validation and security checks.
        *   **Breakdown:**  If application security logic depends on MMKV data, manipulating this data can directly compromise security.
    *   **Modify MMKV data to bypass authentication/authorization checks [CRITICAL NODE - AUTHENTICATION BYPASS]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Modifying user credentials stored in MMKV.
            *   Tampering with session tokens or authentication flags in MMKV.
        *   **Breakdown:** By altering authentication-related data in MMKV, attackers can bypass login procedures and gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Modify application configuration or control flow via MMKV data [CRITICAL NODE - CONFIGURATION TAMPERING]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Changing application settings or feature flags stored in MMKV.
            *   Modifying control flow parameters stored in MMKV.
        *   **Breakdown:** Tampering with configuration data in MMKV can allow attackers to unlock hidden features, bypass restrictions, or alter application behavior for malicious purposes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Backup/Restore Mechanisms (If MMKV data is included in backups) [HIGH-RISK PATH if backups are insecure]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_backuprestore_mechanisms__if_mmkv_data_is_included_in_backups___high-risk_path_if_backups_ar_13cf515c.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** Exploiting insecure backup mechanisms to extract MMKV data.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Backups Stored Insecurely [CRITICAL NODE - INSECURE BACKUPS]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   Unencrypted cloud backups.
            *   Weak passwords for backup accounts.
            *   Accessible local backups on compromised devices.
        *   **Breakdown:** If backups containing MMKV data are not properly secured, attackers can access and restore these backups to extract the data, even if the application itself has some security measures.
