        print("The core vulnerability lies in the application developer's responsibility for managing the encryption key used by MMKV. MMKV itself provides the mechanism for encryption, but it doesn't enforce secure key handling. This creates a critical dependency on the developer's security awareness and implementation practices. A weak or insecurely stored key effectively nullifies the encryption, exposing sensitive data as if it were stored in plaintext.")
        print("This issue isn't a flaw within MMKV's core functionality but rather a potential misuse or lack of secure implementation by the application developer. MMKV acts as a storage engine, offering the *option* for encryption, but the security of that encryption is entirely dependent on the key provided.")

        print("* **Reverse Engineering and Hardcoded Keys:** Attackers can decompile or disassemble the application's binary to find hardcoded keys within the code or resources. String analysis tools can easily identify such keys.")
        print("* **Insecure Storage:** Keys stored in easily accessible locations like SharedPreferences (without additional encryption), configuration files, or even in comments within the code are vulnerable.")
        print("* **Weak Key Derivation:** If the key is derived from a predictable source (e.g., a user's phone number without proper salting and hashing), attackers can easily guess or brute-force the key.")
        print("* **Memory Dumps:** In certain scenarios, attackers with root access or debugging capabilities might be able to dump the application's memory and potentially extract the encryption key if it resides there during runtime.")
        print("* **File System Access (Rooted Devices/Compromised Backups):** If keys are stored in files on the device's file system without proper protection, attackers with file system access (e.g., on rooted devices or through compromised backups) can retrieve them.")
