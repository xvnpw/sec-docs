# Attack Surface Analysis for tencent/mmkv

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Data Storage (Lack of Encryption)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_data_storage__lack_of_encryption_.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data is stored persistently in files without encryption, making it accessible to unauthorized parties.
    *   **How MMKV Contributes:** MMKV stores data in files within the application's data directory. While it offers optional encryption, if not enabled, the data remains in plaintext.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains root access to a device and can directly read the MMKV files containing user credentials or personal information.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive user data, potential identity theft or financial loss.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Always enable MMKV's encryption feature when storing sensitive data.
        *   **Developers:**  Educate developers on the importance of encryption for data at rest.

## Attack Surface: [Weak Encryption Key Management](./attack_surfaces/weak_encryption_key_management.md)

*   **Description:** Even with encryption enabled, the security relies on the strength and secure management of the encryption key. If the key is weak, easily guessable, hardcoded, or stored insecurely, the encryption can be bypassed.
    *   **How MMKV Contributes:** MMKV relies on the application developer to provide and manage the encryption key. It doesn't enforce strong key generation or secure storage.
    *   **Example:** A developer hardcodes the encryption key directly in the application code or stores it in SharedPreferences without additional protection. An attacker reverse engineers the application to extract the key.
    *   **Impact:** Encryption is rendered ineffective, leading to the exposure of sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Use secure key generation techniques (e.g., using Android Keystore or iOS Keychain).
        *   **Developers:** Avoid hardcoding keys in the application.
        *   **Developers:**  Implement robust key storage mechanisms, leveraging platform-specific secure storage options.

## Attack Surface: [Data Corruption and Tampering](./attack_surfaces/data_corruption_and_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** If an attacker gains write access to the MMKV files, they can modify or corrupt the stored data.
    *   **How MMKV Contributes:** MMKV stores data in files within the application's data directory. If file permissions are not properly configured or if the device is compromised, these files can be written to.
    *   **Example:** A malicious application or an attacker with local access modifies MMKV data to alter the application's behavior, potentially leading to privilege escalation or data manipulation.
    *   **Impact:** Application instability, unexpected behavior, data integrity issues, potential for exploiting application logic based on manipulated data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Ensure proper file permissions are set for MMKV data files, restricting write access to the application itself.
        *   **Developers:** Implement integrity checks on critical data stored in MMKV to detect tampering.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in MMKV Library Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_mmkv_library_itself.md)

*   **Description:** Like any software, MMKV could potentially contain undiscovered vulnerabilities in its native code.
    *   **How MMKV Contributes:** MMKV's codebase is the source of this potential attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability is discovered in MMKV's parsing logic, allowing an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code if they can control the data being read by MMKV.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, potential remote code execution, data corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Keep the MMKV library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   **Developers:** Monitor security advisories related to MMKV.
        *   **MMKV Maintainers:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the MMKV library.
