## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using MMKV [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_mmkv__critical_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a successful breach of the application's security. Achieving this can have catastrophic consequences, including data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Steal or Modify Sensitive Data Stored in MMKV [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/steal_or_modify_sensitive_data_stored_in_mmkv__critical_.md)

This attack vector focuses on accessing and potentially altering sensitive information stored within the MMKV library. The impact depends on the nature of the data, but can range from privacy violations to significant financial losses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access MMKV Files with Same User Privileges [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/access_mmkv_files_with_same_user_privileges__critical_.md)

This involves an attacker gaining access to the MMKV files on the file system with the same user privileges as the application. This is a critical step as it bypasses the need for privilege escalation and directly allows interaction with the data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File System Permissions Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_system_permissions_vulnerability.md)

This attack leverages misconfigured file system permissions on the MMKV files. If these files are readable or writable by users other than the application's intended user, an attacker can directly access or modify the data.

## Attack Tree Path: [MMKV files have overly permissive read/write access [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/mmkv_files_have_overly_permissive_readwrite_access__critical_.md)

This is a specific instance of the file system permissions vulnerability where the MMKV files are configured with overly permissive access rights (e.g., world-readable or world-writable). This makes it trivial for an attacker running with the same user to compromise the data.

## Attack Tree Path: [MMKV API Misuse [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/mmkv_api_misuse__critical_.md)

This broad category encompasses vulnerabilities arising from how the application interacts with the MMKV API. Insecure usage patterns can create significant security risks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Data Handling by the Application [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_data_handling_by_the_application__critical_.md)

This occurs when the application doesn't implement proper security measures when storing sensitive data in MMKV.

## Attack Tree Path: [Store sensitive data in MMKV without proper encryption [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/store_sensitive_data_in_mmkv_without_proper_encryption__critical_.md)

This is a critical security flaw where sensitive information is stored in MMKV in plaintext or with weak encryption. This makes the data easily accessible to an attacker who gains access to the files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Input Validation on Data Retrieved from MMKV [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_input_validation_on_data_retrieved_from_mmkv__critical_.md)

If the application doesn't validate and sanitize data retrieved from MMKV before using it, it can be vulnerable to injection attacks. For example, if data from MMKV is used in a SQL query without sanitization, it could lead to SQL injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Key Management [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_key_management__critical_.md)

If the application uses encryption with MMKV, but the encryption keys are stored insecurely (e.g., hardcoded, stored in the same MMKV instance, easily guessable), the encryption is effectively broken, and the data is vulnerable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access or Control [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_or_control__critical_.md)

This attack vector focuses on gaining access to the application's functionalities or data without proper authorization. This can have severe consequences depending on the application's purpose and the level of access gained.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Authentication/Authorization Data in MMKV [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_authenticationauthorization_data_in_mmkv__critical_.md)

This involves targeting the data within MMKV that is used to control user authentication and authorization. If this data can be modified, an attacker can potentially bypass security checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Steal or Modify User Credentials [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/steal_or_modify_user_credentials__critical_.md)

If the application stores user credentials (usernames, passwords, tokens) in MMKV without proper protection (e.g., encryption, hashing with salt), an attacker gaining access to this data can directly compromise user accounts.
