# Threat Model Analysis for tencent/mmkv

## Threat: [Unencrypted Data Exposure](./threats/unencrypted_data_exposure.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker with physical access to the device or the ability to perform a file system dump could access the MMKV data files and read their plain text contents.
    *   **How:** MMKV, by default, stores data in files without encryption on the device's storage.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Confidentiality Breach:** Sensitive user data, application settings, or other stored information could be exposed, leading to privacy violations, identity theft, or other malicious activities.
    *   **Affected MMKV Component:**
        *   Storage Files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable MMKV's built-in encryption feature by providing an encryption key during initialization.
        *   Employ secure key storage mechanisms provided by the operating system (e.g., Android Keystore, iOS Keychain).

## Threat: [Insecure Key Storage Leading to Encryption Bypass](./threats/insecure_key_storage_leading_to_encryption_bypass.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** If encryption is enabled, but the encryption key is stored insecurely, an attacker could retrieve this key.
    *   **How:** By reverse engineering the application, examining memory dumps, or exploiting vulnerabilities in other storage mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Confidentiality Breach:** Once the encryption key is obtained, the attacker can decrypt the MMKV data, bypassing encryption.
    *   **Affected MMKV Component:**
        *   Encryption Module (indirectly, through the compromised key).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize platform-specific secure storage mechanisms like Android Keystore or iOS Keychain for storing the encryption key.
        *   Avoid hardcoding keys in the application's source code.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Native Code Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_native_code_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** Vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or memory corruption bugs in the MMKV library's native code could be exploited.
    *   **How:** By crafting specific input data or exploiting weaknesses in MMKV's internal logic.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Application Crash:** The application could crash due to memory errors.
        *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In severe cases, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code on the device with the application's privileges.
    *   **Affected MMKV Component:**
        *   Core Native Library (C++ implementation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update the MMKV library to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   Encourage security researchers to report any discovered vulnerabilities to the MMKV developers.
