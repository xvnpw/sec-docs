## 8. Security Considerations (Detailed)

This section outlines key security considerations relevant to the Signal-Android application's design, which will be further analyzed during threat modeling:

* **End-to-End Encryption (Signal Protocol):**
    * Ensures that only the sender and recipient can decrypt message content.
    * Provides forward secrecy, meaning past communications remain secure even if keys are compromised in the future.
    * Provides future secrecy (or post-compromise security), meaning that even if a key is compromised, subsequent communications remain secure.
* **Cryptographic Key Management:**
    * Secure Generation: Ensuring the randomness and unpredictability of generated cryptographic keys.
    * Secure Storage: Protecting private keys from unauthorized access on the device (e.g., using Android Keystore).
    * Secure Exchange: Utilizing the Signal Protocol's key exchange mechanisms to establish secure communication channels.
    * Key Rotation: Regularly rotating cryptographic keys to limit the impact of potential compromises.
* **Local Data Security:**
    * Encryption at Rest: Encrypting the local database and media files to protect data when the device is at rest.
    * Secure File Handling: Implementing secure practices for storing and accessing files.
    * Protection against Rooting/Jailbreaking: Mitigating risks associated with compromised device operating systems.
* **Authentication and Authorization:**
    * User Authentication: Verifying the identity of users during registration and subsequent sessions.
    * Account Takeover Prevention: Implementing measures to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts.
    * Authorization: Controlling access to specific functionalities and data within the application.
* **Push Notification Security:**
    * Preventing Information Leakage: Ensuring that push notifications do not contain sensitive message content.
    * Protecting against Push Notification Spoofing: Verifying the authenticity of push notifications.
* **Code Security:**
    * Input Validation: Validating user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
    * Memory Safety: Avoiding memory-related vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows).
    * Secure Coding Practices: Adhering to secure coding guidelines to minimize vulnerabilities.
    * Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing: Identifying and addressing potential security flaws.
* **Dependency Management:**
    * Using Trusted Libraries: Relying on well-vetted and secure third-party libraries.
    * Vulnerability Scanning: Regularly scanning dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    * Keeping Dependencies Up-to-Date: Applying security patches and updates to dependencies.
* **Privacy:**
    * Minimizing Data Collection: Collecting only necessary user data.
    * Data Minimization: Storing data for the shortest possible time.
    * Transparency: Being transparent about data collection and usage practices.
* **Side-Channel Attack Mitigation:**
    * Considering potential information leaks through observable system behavior (e.g., timing attacks).
* **Physical Security:**
    * Encouraging users to secure their devices with strong passwords or biometric authentication.
    * Providing features like screen lock and remote wipe (through OS capabilities).
