## 5. Data Flow

### 5.1. Read Operation (Sharded Environment)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["'Client Application'"] --> B["'Network'"];
    B --> C["'mongos Router'"];
    C --> D["'Config Servers'"];
    D --> C;
    C --> E["'Target Shard Replica Set'"];
    E --> F["'Primary mongod'"];
    F --> C;
    C --> B;
    B --> A;
```

**Detailed Flow:**

1. The **Client Application** initiates a read request.
2. The request travels through the **Network** to a **`mongos` Router**.
3. The **`mongos` Router** consults the **Config Servers** to determine the location of the data based on the query and sharding key.
4. The **Config Servers** provide the necessary routing information back to the **`mongos` Router**.
5. The **`mongos` Router** forwards the query to the **Primary `mongod`** instance within the **Target Shard's Replica Set**.
6. The **Primary `mongod`** executes the query and returns the results to the **`mongos` Router**.
7. The **`mongos` Router** sends the results back through the **Network**.
8. The **Client Application** receives the requested data.

### 5.2. Write Operation (Sharded Environment)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["'Client Application'"] --> B["'Network'"];
    B --> C["'mongos Router'"];
    C --> D["'Config Servers'"];
    D --> C;
    C --> E["'Target Shard Replica Set'"];
    E --> F["'Primary mongod'"];
    F --> G["'Secondary mongod 1'"];
    F --> H["'Secondary mongod 2'"];
    F --> C;
    C --> B;
    B --> A;
```

**Detailed Flow:**

1. The **Client Application** initiates a write request.
2. The request travels through the **Network** to a **`mongos` Router**.
3. The **`mongos` Router** consults the **Config Servers** to identify the target shard for the write operation.
4. The **Config Servers** provide the routing information to the **`mongos` Router**.
5. The **`mongos` Router** forwards the write operation to the **Primary `mongod`** instance of the **Target Shard's Replica Set**.
6. The **Primary `mongod`** applies the write operation locally.
7. The **Primary `mongod`** then replicates the write operation to the **Secondary `mongod`** instances within the replica set.
8. Once a sufficient number of secondaries have acknowledged the write (based on the write concern), the **Primary `mongod`** acknowledges the write to the **`mongos` Router**.
9. The **`mongos` Router** sends the acknowledgement back through the **Network**.
10. The **Client Application** receives confirmation of the successful write operation.

## 6. Key Components and Their Functionality (Detailed)

*   **`mongod` (Database Process):**
