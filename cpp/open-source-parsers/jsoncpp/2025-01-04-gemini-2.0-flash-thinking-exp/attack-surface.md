# Attack Surface Analysis for open-source-parsers/jsoncpp

## Attack Surface: [Processing excessively large JSON payloads.](./attack_surfaces/processing_excessively_large_json_payloads.md)

*   **Description:** Processing excessively large JSON payloads.
    *   **How jsoncpp Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `jsoncpp` needs to allocate memory to store and parse the JSON data. Extremely large payloads directly lead to high memory consumption within the library's processing.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a JSON document several gigabytes in size to the application, overwhelming `jsoncpp`'s memory allocation.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to memory exhaustion, application crash directly caused by `jsoncpp`'s memory usage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict maximum size limits for incoming JSON payloads *before* they are passed to `jsoncpp`.
        *   Monitor the memory usage of the application, especially during JSON parsing operations.

## Attack Surface: [Processing deeply nested JSON objects or arrays.](./attack_surfaces/processing_deeply_nested_json_objects_or_arrays.md)

*   **Description:** Processing deeply nested JSON objects or arrays.
    *   **How jsoncpp Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `jsoncpp`'s parsing logic, which might involve recursion, can lead to excessive stack usage when handling deeply nested structures. This is a direct consequence of how `jsoncpp` traverses and interprets the JSON.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a JSON document with thousands of nested objects or arrays, causing `jsoncpp`'s parsing to consume excessive stack space.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to stack overflow, application crash directly within `jsoncpp`'s parsing execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Impose limits on the maximum depth of allowed JSON structures *before* parsing with `jsoncpp`. Validate the structure before passing it to the library.
        *   Consider architectural changes if extremely deep nesting is a frequent and legitimate requirement, potentially exploring alternative data structures or parsing approaches.
