An integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside the range of values that can be represented by the data type used for storage. In the context of JSON parsing, this means providing a numerical string in the JSON input that, when converted to an integer by {self.library_name}, exceeds the maximum (or minimum for signed integers) value that the underlying integer type can hold.")

Specifically, the functions that convert string representations of numbers into integer types (e.g., `int`, `long`, `long long`). Without proper bounds checking, these functions might not detect when a number is too large or too small.")

This can lead to unexpected and potentially dangerous behavior.")

Always validate the input or use safer conversion methods if available.")
        print("* **Utilize `Json::Value::isConvertibleTo()`:** Before attempting to convert a `Json::Value` to an integer type, use methods like `isConvertibleTo(Json::intValue)` to check if the conversion is safe and within the bounds of the target type.")

The potential for incorrect data handling, memory corruption, and denial of service due to integer overflows in number parsing makes this a **CRITICAL** vulnerability.")
