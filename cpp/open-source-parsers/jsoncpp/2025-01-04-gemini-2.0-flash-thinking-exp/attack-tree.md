## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via JSONCpp Exploitation [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_jsoncpp_exploitation__critical_.md)

This is the overarching goal, representing any successful exploitation of JSONCpp to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Parsing Logic [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_parsing_logic__critical_.md)

This category represents attacks that target flaws in how JSONCpp parses JSON data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Malformed JSON Parsing Error](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_malformed_json_parsing_error.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Send Invalid JSON Syntax](./attack_tree_paths/send_invalid_json_syntax.md)

Injecting JSON with syntax errors (missing commas, colons, brackets, etc.) can potentially crash the parser or lead to unexpected behavior if error handling is insufficient.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Unexpected Characters](./attack_tree_paths/inject_unexpected_characters.md)

Including characters outside the standard JSON specification can confuse the parser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send Incomplete JSON Structures](./attack_tree_paths/send_incomplete_json_structures.md)

Providing truncated or incomplete JSON data might lead to unexpected states or vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Integer Overflow in Number Parsing [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_integer_overflow_in_number_parsing__critical_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Send Extremely Large Integer Values](./attack_tree_paths/send_extremely_large_integer_values.md)

Sending integers exceeding the maximum representable value for the underlying data type used by JSONCpp could lead to overflows, potentially causing crashes or unexpected behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deeply Nested JSON Structures [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deeply_nested_json_structures__critical_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Stack Overflow [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/cause_stack_overflow__critical_.md)

Extremely deep nesting of objects or arrays can exhaust the call stack during parsing, leading to a stack overflow and application crash.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Excessive Memory Allocation [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_excessive_memory_allocation__critical_.md)

Deeply nested structures can lead to the allocation of a large number of objects in memory, potentially causing memory exhaustion and denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion__critical_.md)

This category represents attacks aimed at consuming excessive resources, leading to denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Excessive Memory Consumption [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/cause_excessive_memory_consumption__critical_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Send Extremely Large JSON Payloads [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/send_extremely_large_json_payloads__critical_.md)

Sending very large JSON files can consume significant memory during parsing, potentially leading to out-of-memory errors and denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send Deeply Nested JSON Structures [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/send_deeply_nested_json_structures__critical_.md)

As mentioned before, deep nesting can contribute to excessive memory allocation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger CPU Exhaustion [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_cpu_exhaustion__critical_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Send Complex JSON Structures Requiring Intensive Parsing](./attack_tree_paths/send_complex_json_structures_requiring_intensive_parsing.md)

Crafting JSON with a large number of complex objects and arrays can force the parser to perform a significant amount of work, potentially leading to CPU exhaustion and denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known JSONCpp Vulnerabilities (CVEs) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_jsoncpp_vulnerabilities__cves___critical_.md)

This category represents attacks that leverage publicly known security flaws in specific versions of JSONCpp.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify and Leverage Publicly Known Exploits [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/identify_and_leverage_publicly_known_exploits__critical_.md)

Attackers will actively search for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in specific versions of JSONCpp. If the application uses an outdated version with known vulnerabilities, it becomes a target.
