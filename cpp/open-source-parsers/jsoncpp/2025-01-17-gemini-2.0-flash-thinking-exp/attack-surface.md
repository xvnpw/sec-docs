# Attack Surface Analysis for open-source-parsers/jsoncpp

## Attack Surface: [Large JSON Payloads](./attack_surfaces/large_json_payloads.md)

*   **Description:** Sending extremely large JSON documents to be parsed.
*   **How jsoncpp contributes to the attack surface:** `jsoncpp` loads the entire JSON document into memory for parsing. Processing excessively large payloads can lead to significant memory consumption and potential memory exhaustion.
*   **Example:** A JSON file exceeding hundreds of megabytes or even gigabytes, containing a massive array or a deeply nested object with a large number of fields.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to memory exhaustion, potentially crashing the application or impacting other services on the same machine.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict size limits on incoming JSON payloads *before* attempting to parse them with `jsoncpp`.
    *   Consider alternative parsing strategies or libraries designed for handling very large datasets if this is a common use case (though `jsoncpp` is primarily a DOM-based parser).
    *   Monitor resource usage (memory) during JSON parsing and implement safeguards if consumption exceeds acceptable thresholds.

## Attack Surface: [Deeply Nested JSON Structures](./attack_surfaces/deeply_nested_json_structures.md)

*   **Description:** Submitting JSON data with an excessive level of nesting.
*   **How jsoncpp contributes to the attack surface:** The recursive nature of parsing deeply nested structures can lead to stack overflow errors within the `jsoncpp` library itself, especially in older versions or on systems with limited stack space.
*   **Example:** A JSON structure like `{"a": {"b": {"c": ... } } }` with hundreds or thousands of nested objects or arrays.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) through application crash due to stack exhaustion.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement limits on the maximum depth of allowed JSON structures *before* parsing with `jsoncpp`. This can be done by pre-processing the JSON or by configuring limits if the application framework allows.
    *   Keep `jsoncpp` updated to the latest version, as newer versions might have improved handling of deeply nested structures.
