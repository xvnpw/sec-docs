## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application Using jsoncpp [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_using_jsoncpp__cn_.md)

This is the root goal and a critical node as it represents the ultimate objective of the attacker. Success here means the attacker has achieved their goal of compromising the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_parsing_vulnerabilities__cn_.md)

This is a critical node representing the primary attack vector. Jsoncpp's core function is parsing, making parsing vulnerabilities a direct path to compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Buffer Overflow during Parsing [CN] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/3__buffer_overflow_during_parsing__cn___hr_.md)

This is a critical node and a high-risk path because buffer overflows are a classic vulnerability with potentially critical impact (code execution). It's a high-risk path due to the potential for code execution and the relative ease of triggering buffer overflows with crafted input.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1. Send overly long JSON strings [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1__send_overly_long_json_strings__hr_.md)

This is a high-risk path. Attackers send JSON payloads with extremely long string values. If jsoncpp doesn't properly limit string lengths during parsing, it could write beyond allocated buffers.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1. Cause buffer to overflow when reading string values [CN] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1__cause_buffer_to_overflow_when_reading_string_values__cn___hr_.md)

This is a critical node and high-risk path. This is the direct consequence of sending overly long strings, leading to memory corruption and potential code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2. Send deeply nested JSON structures [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2__send_deeply_nested_json_structures__hr_.md)

This is a high-risk path. Highly nested JSON objects or arrays can lead to stack or heap overflows during recursive parsing.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1. Cause stack or heap overflow during recursive parsing [CN] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_1__cause_stack_or_heap_overflow_during_recursive_parsing__cn___hr_.md)

This is a critical node and high-risk path. Deeply nested structures can exhaust stack space or heap memory, leading to crashes (DoS via stack overflow) or memory corruption (heap overflow, potentially code execution).

## Attack Tree Path: [3.3. Send JSON with large number of members/elements [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/3_3__send_json_with_large_number_of_memberselements__hr_.md)

This is a high-risk path. Objects or arrays with a huge number of members or elements can exhaust memory or cause buffer overflows in internal data structures.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.3.1. Exhaust memory or cause buffer overflows in internal data structures [CN] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/3_3_1__exhaust_memory_or_cause_buffer_overflows_in_internal_data_structures__cn___hr_.md)

This is a critical node and high-risk path. A large number of members/elements can overwhelm internal data structures, leading to memory exhaustion (DoS) or buffer overflows within these structures (potentially code execution).

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Denial of Service (DoS) via Malicious JSON [CN] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/4__denial_of_service__dos__via_malicious_json__cn___hr_.md)

This is a critical node and high-risk path because DoS attacks are relatively easy to execute and can significantly impact application availability.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1. CPU Exhaustion [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1__cpu_exhaustion__hr_.md)

This is a high-risk path leading to DoS by consuming excessive CPU resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.1. Send deeply nested JSON [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_1__send_deeply_nested_json__hr_.md)

This is a high-risk path. Parsing deeply nested JSON can lead to excessive recursion, consuming significant CPU resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.1.1. Cause excessive recursion and CPU usage during parsing [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_1_1__cause_excessive_recursion_and_cpu_usage_during_parsing__hr_.md)

This is a high-risk path. Excessive recursion directly leads to high CPU usage, potentially causing service degradation or outage.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.2. Send extremely large JSON payloads [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_2__send_extremely_large_json_payloads__hr_.md)

This is a high-risk path. Sending very large JSON payloads can overwhelm the parser with the sheer volume of data.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.2.1. Overwhelm parser with sheer volume of data [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_2_1__overwhelm_parser_with_sheer_volume_of_data__hr_.md)

This is a high-risk path. Overwhelming the parser with data directly leads to high CPU usage and potential DoS.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.2. Memory Exhaustion [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/4_2__memory_exhaustion__hr_.md)

This is a high-risk path leading to DoS by consuming excessive memory.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.2.1. Send JSON with extremely large arrays/objects [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/4_2_1__send_json_with_extremely_large_arraysobjects__hr_.md)

This is a high-risk path. Parsing JSON with very large arrays or objects forces jsoncpp to allocate significant memory.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.2.1.1. Force parser to allocate excessive memory, leading to OOM [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/4_2_1_1__force_parser_to_allocate_excessive_memory__leading_to_oom__hr_.md)

This is a high-risk path. Forcing excessive memory allocation directly leads to out-of-memory conditions and service outage.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Uncontrolled Resource Consumption during Parsing [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/5__uncontrolled_resource_consumption_during_parsing__hr_.md)

This is a high-risk path as it encompasses DoS attacks through resource exhaustion, which are generally easy to execute.

## Attack Tree Path: [5.1. Excessive Memory Allocation [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/5_1__excessive_memory_allocation__hr_.md)

This is a high-risk path. Sending large or complex JSON can lead to excessive memory allocation.

## Attack Tree Path: [5.1.1. Send large or complex JSON to exhaust server memory [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/5_1_1__send_large_or_complex_json_to_exhaust_server_memory__hr_.md)

This is a high-risk path. Sending large or complex JSON directly leads to excessive memory allocation and potential service outage due to memory exhaustion.
