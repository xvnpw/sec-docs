# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for duckdb/duckdb

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Queries](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_queries.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all locations in your application code where SQL queries are constructed dynamically for DuckDB, especially when incorporating user-provided input.
    2.  Utilize the parameterized query features of your chosen DuckDB driver or ORM. Pass parameters separately from the SQL query string.
    3.  Replace direct string concatenation of user input into SQL queries with parameter placeholders.
    4.  Pass user input as parameter values to the query execution function, *not* directly embedded in the SQL query string.
    5.  Test query paths to verify parameterized queries are correctly implemented in DuckDB interactions.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (High Severity) - Attackers inject malicious SQL code via user input, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion within DuckDB.
*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: High reduction - Parameterized queries are the primary defense against SQL injection in DuckDB.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No
*   **Missing Implementation:** Data access layer, specifically modules querying DuckDB based on user requests. All functions constructing and executing SQL queries against DuckDB.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Extension Security Management](./mitigation_strategies/extension_security_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Document all DuckDB extensions used by your application.
    2.  Load *only* essential extensions for core functionality. Avoid unnecessary or experimental extensions in DuckDB.
    3.  Implement a mechanism to control DuckDB extension loading, ideally via configuration. Use an allowlist of permitted extensions for DuckDB.
    4.  Disable automatic DuckDB extension loading if possible. Explicitly load required extensions in application initialization code interacting with DuckDB.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Vulnerabilities in Extensions (Medium to High Severity) - Untrusted or vulnerable DuckDB extensions introduce security flaws exploitable within the DuckDB environment.
    *   Supply Chain Attacks (Low to Medium Severity) - Compromised DuckDB extensions from untrusted sources introduce malicious code into your application's DuckDB usage.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Vulnerabilities in Extensions: Medium to High reduction - Limits attack surface by controlling code executed within DuckDB.
    *   Supply Chain Attacks: Low to Medium reduction - Reduces risk from external DuckDB extension dependencies.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No
*   **Missing Implementation:** Application initialization logic where DuckDB connections are established. Configuration management for allowed DuckDB extensions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [File System Access Control](./mitigation_strategies/file_system_access_control.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  If using DuckDB to access files, configure DuckDB to operate within a restricted directory or allowed directories.
    2.  Use OS-level file system permissions to limit directories/files accessible to the process running DuckDB.
    3.  Consider in-memory DuckDB databases if persistence is not needed, eliminating file system access for DuckDB.
    4.  For DuckDB file operations, use relative paths within allowed directories, not absolute paths.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Path Traversal (Medium to High Severity) - Prevents attackers from manipulating file paths in DuckDB operations to access unauthorized files, potentially leading to data breaches.
    *   Unauthorized File Access (Medium Severity) - Limits files DuckDB can interact with, reducing impact of vulnerabilities leading to file system access via DuckDB.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Path Traversal: High reduction - Restricting access is strong defense against path traversal in DuckDB file operations.
    *   Unauthorized File Access: Medium reduction - Limits potential damage from file access vulnerabilities within DuckDB context.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No
*   **Missing Implementation:** DuckDB configuration and deployment environment setup. File path handling logic in application interacting with DuckDB file operations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Query Timeouts](./mitigation_strategies/query_timeouts.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Implement query timeouts in your application when executing DuckDB queries.
    2.  Set timeout values based on expected DuckDB query execution times.
    3.  Use timeout mechanisms provided by your DuckDB driver or database connection library.
    4.  Handle timeout exceptions gracefully in your application when interacting with DuckDB, preventing crashes.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity) - Prevents long-running or malicious DuckDB queries from consuming excessive resources, causing application unavailability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Medium reduction - Mitigates resource exhaustion from runaway DuckDB queries.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No
*   **Missing Implementation:** Database query execution logic in data access layer interacting with DuckDB. Error handling for DuckDB query timeouts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [DuckDB Version Management and Updates](./mitigation_strategies/duckdb_version_management_and_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Establish a process for regularly updating DuckDB to the latest stable version.
    2.  Monitor DuckDB release notes and security advisories for new versions and security patches.
    3.  Incorporate DuckDB updates into application maintenance and patching cycle.
    4.  Test DuckDB updates in staging before production deployment to ensure compatibility and stability with your application.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Known Vulnerabilities in DuckDB (Medium to High Severity) - Outdated DuckDB versions may contain known, exploitable security vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Known Vulnerabilities in DuckDB: High reduction - Staying updated is crucial for patching known DuckDB vulnerabilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No
*   **Missing Implementation:** Dependency management and update processes for the project, specifically for DuckDB. Security monitoring and patching procedures for third-party libraries like DuckDB.
