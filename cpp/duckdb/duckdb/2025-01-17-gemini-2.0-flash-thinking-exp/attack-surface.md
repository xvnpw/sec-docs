# Attack Surface Analysis for duckdb/duckdb

## Attack Surface: [Loading Data from Untrusted Files](./attack_surfaces/loading_data_from_untrusted_files.md)

**Description:**  DuckDB allows loading data from various file formats (CSV, Parquet, JSON, etc.). If the application loads files from untrusted sources or allows users to upload arbitrary files that are then processed by DuckDB, malicious files can exploit parsing vulnerabilities.

**How DuckDB Contributes:** DuckDB's file reading functionality is the entry point for this attack surface. Vulnerabilities in the parsers for different file formats could be exploited.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted CSV file with malformed data that triggers a buffer overflow in DuckDB's CSV parser, potentially leading to a crash or even remote code execution.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential Remote Code Execution (RCE), Information Disclosure (if memory corruption allows reading sensitive data).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Validate File Sources:** Only load data from trusted and verified sources.
* **Input Sanitization:** If user uploads are necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization of file content before loading into DuckDB. Consider using separate, isolated processes for file parsing.
* **Limit File Types:** Restrict the types of files that can be loaded into DuckDB to only the necessary formats.
* **Regularly Update DuckDB:** Keep DuckDB updated to benefit from security patches that address parsing vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Vulnerable DuckDB Extensions](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_vulnerable_duckdb_extensions.md)

**Description:** DuckDB supports extensions that can extend its functionality. Loading and using untrusted or vulnerable extensions can introduce significant security risks.

**How DuckDB Contributes:** DuckDB's extension mechanism allows loading external code into its process.

**Example:** An attacker convinces a user to install a malicious DuckDB extension that contains code to execute arbitrary commands on the server or exfiltrate data from the database. A legitimate but vulnerable extension could also be exploited.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Data Exfiltration, System Compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Only Use Trusted Extensions:**  Only load extensions from reputable and trusted sources. Verify the integrity of the extension files.
* **Regularly Update Extensions:** Keep all used extensions updated to benefit from security patches.
* **Code Review of Extensions (If Possible):** If the source code of the extension is available, perform security code reviews.
* **Limit Extension Loading:** Restrict the ability to load extensions to authorized personnel or processes.
* **Consider Sandboxing (Advanced):** Explore if there are ways to sandbox or isolate the execution of extensions (this might be limited by DuckDB's current architecture).

## Attack Surface: [User-Defined Functions (UDFs) with Malicious Code](./attack_surfaces/user-defined_functions__udfs__with_malicious_code.md)

**Description:** DuckDB allows defining User-Defined Functions (UDFs) in languages like Python or C++. If the application allows users to define or load arbitrary UDFs, malicious code can be introduced and executed within the DuckDB process.

**How DuckDB Contributes:** DuckDB's UDF functionality allows the execution of user-provided code.

**Example:** A user defines a Python UDF that, when called, executes system commands to compromise the server or access sensitive files.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Data Exfiltration, System Compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Restrict UDF Creation:** Limit the ability to create or register UDFs to trusted developers or processes.
* **Code Review of UDFs:**  Thoroughly review the code of all UDFs before deployment.
* **Sandboxing UDF Execution (If Possible):** Explore if DuckDB or the surrounding environment offers mechanisms to sandbox the execution of UDFs.
* **Use Secure Languages/Libraries:** If UDFs are necessary, encourage the use of safer languages and libraries, and follow secure coding practices.
