### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit `COPY` command with malicious file paths

**Attack Tree Path:** Exploit DuckDB Specific Functions/Features [HIGH-RISK PATH] -> Exploit `COPY` command with malicious file paths [HIGH-RISK PATH]

**4.1. Attack Vector Breakdown:**

The core of this attack lies in the application's reliance on user-provided or externally influenced data to construct the file paths used within the DuckDB `COPY` command. If the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate these paths, an attacker can inject malicious values.

**Example Scenarios:**

* **User Input:** An application feature allows users to upload a CSV file for processing. The application uses the `COPY` command to import this data into DuckDB. If the application directly uses the user-provided filename in the `COPY` command without validation, an attacker could provide a path like `/etc/passwd` to attempt to read sensitive system files.
* **Configuration Files:** The application might read file paths from a configuration file. If this file is modifiable by an attacker (e.g., through a separate vulnerability), they could inject malicious paths.
* **Database Records:**  Less likely but possible, if the application retrieves file paths from a database table and doesn't validate them before using them in the `COPY` command.

**4.2. Technical Details of the `COPY` Command:**

The DuckDB `COPY` command is a powerful tool for data import and export. Its syntax typically involves specifying the target table, the file path, and optional format parameters.

**Import Example:**

```sql
COPY my_table FROM 'user_provided_path.csv' (DELIMITER ',', HEADER);
```

**Export Example:**

```sql
COPY my_table TO 'user_provided_path.csv' (DELIMITER ',', HEADER);
```

The vulnerability arises because DuckDB, by default, operates within the file system permissions of the process running it. If the application process has sufficient permissions, DuckDB can read from and write to various locations on the file system.

**4.3. Preconditions for Successful Exploitation:**

For this attack to be successful, the following conditions must be met:

* **File System Access Enabled:** DuckDB must have the necessary permissions to interact with the file system. This is generally the default behavior.
* **Lack of Input Validation:** The application must fail to adequately validate or sanitize the file paths used in the `COPY` command. This includes:
    * **Path Traversal:** Not preventing the use of `../` to navigate up the directory structure.
    * **Absolute Paths:** Allowing the use of absolute paths that point to sensitive system locations.
    * **Restricted File Types:** Not restricting the types of files that can be accessed (e.g., allowing access to executable files).
* **Attacker Control:** The attacker must have a way to influence the file path used in the `COPY` command. This could be through direct user input, manipulation of configuration files, or other vulnerabilities.

**4.4. Attack Steps:**

1. **Identify Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker identifies a part of the application that uses the DuckDB `COPY` command and allows some form of control over the file path.
2. **Craft Malicious Payload:** The attacker crafts a malicious file path designed to either read sensitive data or overwrite critical files.
    * **Data Breach Example:** `/etc/passwd`, `/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa`, application configuration files.
    * **Denial of Service Example:** Overwriting application executables, configuration files, or database files.
3. **Inject Malicious Path:** The attacker injects the malicious file path into the vulnerable parameter or configuration.
4. **Trigger the `COPY` Command:** The attacker triggers the application functionality that executes the `COPY` command with the injected path.
5. **Exploitation:**
    * **Read Operation:** If the attack targets reading files, DuckDB will attempt to read the specified file, and the application might inadvertently expose this data (e.g., in error messages, logs, or by further processing the read data).
    * **Write Operation:** If the attack targets writing files, DuckDB will attempt to write to the specified file, potentially overwriting existing data.

**4.5. Potential Impact (Detailed):**

* **Data Breach (High Impact):**
    * **Reading Sensitive System Files:** Accessing files like `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, SSH keys, or other system configuration files can provide the attacker with credentials and system information for further attacks.
    * **Reading Application Data:** Accessing application configuration files, database connection strings, or other sensitive application data can compromise the application's security.
    * **Reading User Data:** If the application stores user data in files accessible by the DuckDB process, this data could be exposed.
* **Denial of Service (High Impact):**
    * **Overwriting Critical Application Files:**  Overwriting executable files, configuration files, or database files can render the application unusable.
    * **Filling Disk Space:**  Repeatedly writing large amounts of data to arbitrary locations can lead to disk exhaustion and system instability.
* **Potential for Code Execution (Critical Impact):**
    * While less direct, if an attacker can overwrite files that are later executed by the system or application (e.g., scripts, libraries), this could lead to arbitrary code execution. This requires a specific application architecture and file execution flow.

**4.6. Likelihood:**

The likelihood of this attack depends heavily on the application's development practices:

* **Low Likelihood:** If the application implements robust input validation and sanitization for file paths used in the `COPY` command, the likelihood is low.
* **Medium Likelihood:** If some validation is present but incomplete or relies on blacklisting (which can be bypassed), the likelihood increases.
* **High Likelihood:** If the application directly uses user-provided or externally influenced file paths without any validation, the likelihood is high.

Given the potential for significant impact, even a medium likelihood warrants serious attention.

**4.7. Risk Level:**

Based on the potential for high to critical impact (data breach, denial of service, potential code execution) and the possibility of medium to high likelihood depending on development practices, this attack path is classified as **HIGH-RISK**.

**4.8. Detection Strategies:**

* **Input Validation Monitoring:** Monitor application logs for attempts to use unusual or suspicious file paths in the `COPY` command.
* **File System Monitoring:** Implement file integrity monitoring (FIM) to detect unauthorized access or modification of sensitive files.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Monitor DuckDB query logs for unusual `COPY` commands targeting unexpected file locations.
* **Security Audits:** Regularly review the application's code and configuration to identify potential vulnerabilities related to file path handling.

**4.9. Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Input Validation and Sanitization (Crucial):**
    * **Whitelisting:**  Define a strict set of allowed directories and file extensions for the `COPY` command. Only allow access to these predefined locations.
    * **Path Canonicalization:**  Convert user-provided paths to their canonical form to resolve symbolic links and prevent path traversal attacks.
    * **Blacklisting (Less Effective):**  While less robust than whitelisting, blacklisting known malicious patterns (e.g., `../`, absolute paths to sensitive directories) can provide some defense in depth.
    * **Regular Expression Matching:** Use regular expressions to enforce allowed path formats.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the DuckDB process (and the application process running it) operates with the minimum necessary file system permissions. Avoid running the process as a highly privileged user (e.g., root).
* **Sandboxing:** If feasible, run the DuckDB process within a sandbox or container with restricted file system access.
* **Secure Coding Practices:** Educate developers on the risks of using unsanitized input in file system operations.
* **Parameterization/Prepared Statements (Indirect):** While not directly applicable to file paths in the `COPY` command, using parameterized queries for other database interactions helps prevent SQL injection, which could potentially be used to manipulate data leading to malicious file paths.
* **Regular Security Assessments:** Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments to identify and address potential weaknesses.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP) (Limited Applicability):** While primarily for web applications, CSP can offer some indirect protection by limiting the resources the application can load, potentially hindering the exploitation of read data.

**4.10. Conclusion:**

The ability to exploit the DuckDB `COPY` command with malicious file paths presents a significant security risk. The potential for data breaches, denial of service, and even code execution necessitates a proactive approach to mitigation. Implementing robust input validation, adhering to the principle of least privilege, and employing secure coding practices are crucial steps in preventing this type of attack. Regular security assessments and monitoring are also essential for detecting and responding to potential exploitation attempts. By understanding the technical details of this attack path and implementing appropriate safeguards, development teams can significantly reduce the risk to their applications and underlying systems.
