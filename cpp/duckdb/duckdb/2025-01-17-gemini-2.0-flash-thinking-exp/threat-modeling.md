# Threat Model Analysis for duckdb/duckdb

## Threat: [Malicious SQL Injection Exploiting DuckDB Features](./threats/malicious_sql_injection_exploiting_duckdb_features.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects specially crafted SQL code that leverages DuckDB-specific functions or syntax to perform unauthorized actions. This goes beyond basic SQL injection by targeting features unique to DuckDB, such as its file system access functions (e.g., reading arbitrary files using `read_csv` with a manipulated path) or specific extension functionalities.
    *   **Impact:** Data exfiltration (reading sensitive data from the database or external files), data modification, denial of service (executing resource-intensive or crashing queries), potential for arbitrary code execution if vulnerable DuckDB extensions are enabled and targeted via SQL injection.
    *   **Affected DuckDB Component:** SQL Parser, Query Execution Engine, File Readers (CSV, Parquet, etc.), Extension Interface.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strictly Use Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:**  This is paramount to prevent SQL injection. Ensure *all* user-provided input is treated as data.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Database User:** If the application connects to DuckDB with a specific user, grant only the necessary permissions within the DuckDB instance itself (though this is less relevant for embedded usage).
        *   **Regularly Update DuckDB:** Keep DuckDB updated to patch vulnerabilities in the SQL parsing and execution engine.
        *   **Disable or Restrict Risky Functions (If Possible):** Explore DuckDB's configuration options to disable or restrict access to potentially dangerous built-in functions if they are not required.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Web Applications:** While not directly a DuckDB mitigation, if the application is web-based, a strong CSP can help mitigate the impact of successful SQL injection by limiting what malicious scripts can do.

## Threat: [Loading Malicious DuckDB Extensions](./threats/loading_malicious_duckdb_extensions.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with control over the application's environment or configuration can load malicious DuckDB extensions. These extensions, being native code loaded into the DuckDB process, can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution (full control over the application process and potentially the underlying system), data compromise, denial of service.
    *   **Affected DuckDB Component:** Extension Loading Mechanism, potentially the entire DuckDB runtime environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable Extensions if Unnecessary:** The most effective mitigation is to disable DuckDB extensions if they are not absolutely required.
        *   **Only Load Trusted Extensions:**  Load extensions only from highly trusted and verified sources. Implement a rigorous process for vetting and approving extensions.
        *   **Verify Extension Integrity:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity (e.g., using checksums or cryptographic signatures) of extension files before loading.
        *   **Restrict Extension Loading Locations:** Configure DuckDB to only load extensions from specific, protected directories with restricted write access.
        *   **Regularly Audit Loaded Extensions:** Maintain an inventory of loaded extensions and periodically review their purpose and security.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Queries Exploiting DuckDB Internals](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_malicious_queries_exploiting_duckdb_internals.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts specific SQL queries that exploit inefficiencies or vulnerabilities within DuckDB's query execution engine, memory management, or other internal components. This can lead to excessive resource consumption, causing a denial of service. This is distinct from general resource exhaustion by simply running very large queries; it targets specific weaknesses in DuckDB's implementation.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation, potential for system instability or crashes.
    *   **Affected DuckDB Component:** Query Execution Engine, Query Optimizer, Memory Management, potentially other internal components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Query Timeouts:** Set timeouts for query execution to prevent runaway queries.
        *   **Monitor Resource Usage:** Monitor DuckDB's resource consumption (CPU, memory) and set up alerts for unusual spikes.
        *   **Regularly Update DuckDB:** Keep DuckDB updated to benefit from performance improvements and fixes for resource exhaustion vulnerabilities.
        *   **Query Analysis and Optimization:** Analyze frequently executed or potentially problematic queries to identify and address performance bottlenecks.
        *   **Consider Resource Limits (If Available):** Explore if DuckDB offers any configuration options to limit resource usage per query or connection (this might be limited in embedded scenarios).
