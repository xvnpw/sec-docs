## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via DuckDB Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_duckdb_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a successful breach of the application's security through vulnerabilities related to its use of DuckDB.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Data Input to DuckDB [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_data_input_to_duckdb__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

This represents a broad category of attacks where the attacker manipulates data provided to DuckDB to achieve malicious outcomes. It's a critical node because it's a common entry point for several high-risk attack vectors.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

This is a classic database vulnerability where an attacker injects malicious SQL code into queries executed by the application.
    * **Inject Malicious SQL in User-Provided Data [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers provide malicious SQL code through input fields, API parameters, or other user-controlled data points. If the application doesn't properly sanitize or parameterize this input before incorporating it into SQL queries, the injected code will be executed by DuckDB.
        * **Potential Impact:**  Bypassing authentication, accessing unauthorized data, modifying or deleting data, and in some cases, even executing operating system commands (depending on DuckDB's configuration and extensions).
    * **Inject Malicious SQL in Application Logic:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Vulnerabilities in how the application constructs SQL queries, such as using string concatenation instead of parameterized queries, can allow attackers to inject malicious SQL by manipulating parts of the query logic.
        * **Potential Impact:** Similar to user-provided data injection, leading to data breaches, modification, or potentially code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit DuckDB Specific Functions/Features [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_duckdb_specific_functionsfeatures__high-risk_path_.md)

This focuses on leveraging specific functionalities within DuckDB for malicious purposes.
    * **Exploit `COPY` command with malicious file paths [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** The `COPY` command in DuckDB allows importing and exporting data to and from files. If file system access is enabled for DuckDB and the application doesn't restrict the file paths used with the `COPY` command, an attacker can inject malicious file paths.
        * **Potential Impact:** Reading sensitive files from the server (data breach) or overwriting critical application files (leading to denial of service or potential code execution if executables are overwritten).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File System Interaction [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_system_interaction__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

This category focuses on exploiting DuckDB's ability to interact with the underlying file system. It's a critical node because successful exploitation can lead to direct access to sensitive data or the ability to modify system files.
    * **Read Sensitive Files [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Exploit `COPY` command or other file reading functions [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:**  Attackers leverage DuckDB's functions that allow reading files (like `COPY` or external table functions) to access sensitive files on the server. This often involves manipulating file paths provided to these functions.
            * **Potential Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive application data, configuration files, or other confidential information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit DuckDB Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_duckdb_configuration__high-risk_path_.md)

This involves exploiting vulnerabilities related to how DuckDB is configured.
    * **Exploit Insecure Defaults [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Exploit Unrestricted File System Access (if default) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** If DuckDB is configured with unrestricted file system access (either by default or through misconfiguration), attackers can leverage file access functions like `COPY` to read or write any file the DuckDB process has permissions to access.
            * **Potential Impact:** Reading sensitive files, overwriting critical files, potentially leading to data breaches, denial of service, or code execution.
