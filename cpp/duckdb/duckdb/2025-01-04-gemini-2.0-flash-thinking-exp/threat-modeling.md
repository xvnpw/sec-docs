# Threat Model Analysis for duckdb/duckdb

## Threat: [SQL Injection Vulnerability within DuckDB](./threats/sql_injection_vulnerability_within_duckdb.md)

**Description:**  A vulnerability exists within DuckDB's query parsing, binding, or execution engine that allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary SQL code. This could occur if DuckDB fails to properly sanitize or parameterize certain inputs or if there are logical flaws in its SQL processing. An attacker could exploit this to bypass intended access controls, retrieve sensitive data directly from DuckDB, modify or delete data, or potentially trigger other unintended behaviors within the database.

**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized access to and exfiltration of sensitive data managed by DuckDB.
*   Manipulation or deletion of critical data, leading to data integrity breaches and application malfunction.
*   Potential for executing arbitrary SQL commands within the DuckDB context, potentially leading to further system compromise if DuckDB has access to sensitive resources.

**Affected DuckDB Component:** Query Parser, Binder, Executor

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Keep DuckDB Updated:** Regularly update DuckDB to the latest version to benefit from security patches that address known SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Report Potential Vulnerabilities:** Encourage security researchers and developers to report potential SQL injection vulnerabilities through responsible disclosure channels.
*   **Internal Security Audits:** Conduct regular internal security audits of DuckDB's codebase, especially the query processing components.

## Threat: [Data Corruption due to Bugs in DuckDB's Query Processing](./threats/data_corruption_due_to_bugs_in_duckdb's_query_processing.md)

**Description:**  Bugs or logical errors exist within DuckDB's query optimizer, executor, or storage engine that can be triggered by specific, potentially malicious, SQL queries. These bugs could lead to the corruption of data files managed by DuckDB, rendering the data unusable or unreliable. An attacker might craft specific queries targeting these known or unknown bugs.

**Impact:**
*   Loss of data integrity, making the data stored in DuckDB unreliable for the application.
*   Application malfunction or errors due to corrupted data retrieved from DuckDB.
*   Potential for irreversible data loss, requiring restoration from backups.

**Affected DuckDB Component:** Query Optimizer, Executor, Storage Engine

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Keep DuckDB Updated:** Regularly update DuckDB to the latest version, which includes bug fixes that might address data corruption issues.
*   **Thorough Testing of DuckDB:**  DuckDB developers should employ rigorous testing methodologies, including fuzzing and property-based testing, to identify and fix potential data corruption bugs.
*   **Implement Data Integrity Checks:**  While not a direct mitigation within DuckDB, applications using DuckDB can implement checks to detect data corruption after retrieval.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in DuckDB Extensions for Code Execution](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_duckdb_extensions_for_code_execution.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities exist within the code of DuckDB extensions that can be exploited by an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the system where DuckDB is running. This could involve memory corruption bugs, insecure handling of external data, or other flaws in the extension's implementation.

**Impact:**
*   Full compromise of the server or system running DuckDB.
*   Ability for the attacker to execute any command, install malware, access sensitive files, or pivot to other systems.
*   Data breaches, data manipulation, and denial of service are all possible outcomes.

**Affected DuckDB Component:** Extension System, Specific Vulnerable Extensions

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure Extension Development Practices:** DuckDB extension developers should follow secure coding practices and undergo security reviews.
*   **Sandboxing or Isolation of Extensions:** Implement mechanisms within DuckDB (if feasible) to sandbox or isolate extensions to limit the impact of vulnerabilities.
*   **Careful Review and Auditing of Extensions:** Users should carefully review the code and security posture of extensions before using them. Only use extensions from trusted and reputable sources.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Compromise of DuckDB Binaries or Critical Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_compromise_of_duckdb_binaries_or_critical_dependencies.md)

**Description:** The official DuckDB binaries or its critical dependencies are compromised during the build, distribution, or update process. This could involve malicious code being injected into the binaries, potentially giving attackers a backdoor into systems running DuckDB.

**Impact:**
*   Widespread compromise of systems using the affected DuckDB version.
*   Possibility of remote code execution, data breaches, and other severe security incidents.
*   Difficult to detect and remediate, as the compromise occurs at a fundamental level.

**Affected DuckDB Component:** All components (as the compromise is in the core software)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure Build and Release Processes:** DuckDB developers should implement robust and secure build and release pipelines with integrity checks and code signing.
*   **Dependency Management and Auditing:**  Maintain a strict control over dependencies and regularly audit them for known vulnerabilities.
*   **Binary Verification:** Users should verify the integrity of downloaded DuckDB binaries using checksums or digital signatures provided by the official DuckDB project.
*   **Monitor for Unusual Activity:** Implement monitoring systems to detect any unusual behavior in DuckDB processes that might indicate a compromise.
