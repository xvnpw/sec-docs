# Attack Surface Analysis for duckdb/duckdb

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into queries executed by DuckDB, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.

**How DuckDB Contributes:** DuckDB's SQL parsing and execution engine processes the provided SQL strings. If these strings are constructed by concatenating user-provided input without proper sanitization or parameterization, it becomes vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Example:** An application takes a user-provided product name and uses it directly in a query like `con.execute(f"SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = '{user_input}'")`. A malicious user could input `' OR 1=1; --`, potentially retrieving all product data.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, potential denial of service through resource-intensive injected queries.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Use Parameterized Queries:**  Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements where user input is treated as data, not executable code. DuckDB supports this.
* **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Validate and sanitize user inputs to ensure they conform to expected formats and do not contain potentially harmful characters.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the DuckDB connection used by the application has the minimum necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [File System Access Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/file_system_access_manipulation.md)

**Description:** Attackers manipulate file paths used in DuckDB functions to access or modify unintended files or directories.

**How DuckDB Contributes:** DuckDB allows reading and writing various file formats (CSV, Parquet, etc.) using functions like `read_csv()` or `COPY TO`. If the file paths used in these functions are derived from unsanitized user input, it creates an attack vector.

**Example:** An application allows users to specify a file to import using `con.execute(f"COPY data FROM '{user_provided_path}' (FORMAT CSV)")`. A malicious user could input `../../../../etc/passwd`, potentially gaining access to sensitive system files.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, data exfiltration, potential modification of critical application files, denial of service if system files are targeted.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Restrict File Path Inputs:**  Avoid allowing users to directly specify file paths. If necessary, provide a limited set of allowed paths or use file upload mechanisms with strict validation.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize any user-provided input that influences file paths.
* **Sandboxing:** Run the DuckDB process with restricted file system access permissions.
* **Use Relative Paths:** If possible, work with relative paths from a defined data directory.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Extension Loading](./attack_surfaces/malicious_extension_loading.md)

**Description:** Attackers load and execute malicious DuckDB extensions, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**How DuckDB Contributes:** DuckDB's extension mechanism allows loading shared libraries to extend its functionality. If the application allows loading extensions based on user input or insecure configuration, it becomes vulnerable.

**Example:** An application allows administrators to specify extensions to load via a configuration file. If this file is compromised, a malicious extension could be loaded using `LOAD 'malicious_extension.duckdb_extension'`. This extension could execute arbitrary system commands.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, complete system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Restrict Extension Loading:**  Strictly control which extensions can be loaded. Ideally, hardcode the allowed extensions in the application.
* **Verify Extension Integrity:**  Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of extensions before loading (e.g., using checksums or digital signatures).
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the DuckDB process with minimal necessary permissions to reduce the impact of a compromised extension.
* **Regularly Update Extensions:** Keep extensions up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Client/Server Mode Vulnerabilities (If Enabled)](./attack_surfaces/clientserver_mode_vulnerabilities__if_enabled_.md)

**Description:** If the application utilizes DuckDB's client/server functionality, vulnerabilities in authentication, authorization, or network communication can be exploited.

**How DuckDB Contributes:** DuckDB's client/server mode introduces network endpoints that need to be secured. Weak authentication or unencrypted communication can be exploited.

**Example:** If the DuckDB server is configured with a weak password or no authentication, an attacker on the network could connect and execute arbitrary queries. If communication is not encrypted, sensitive data could be intercepted.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, remote code execution (depending on server configuration), denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on configuration)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strong Authentication:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms for the DuckDB server.
* **Authorization Controls:**  Configure appropriate authorization rules to restrict access to specific databases and operations.
* **Encryption:**  Enable encryption for client-server communication (e.g., using TLS/SSL).
* **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the DuckDB server on a private network segment.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the client/server configuration.
