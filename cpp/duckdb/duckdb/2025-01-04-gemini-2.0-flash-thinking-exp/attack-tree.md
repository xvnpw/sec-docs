## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious SQL via User Input](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_sql_via_user_input.md)

**Unsanitized User Input in SQL Queries (Critical Node):**
* **Attack:** Injecting malicious SQL code into queries executed by DuckDB by exploiting the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided data.
* **Likelihood:** High
* **Impact:** Critical
* **Effort:** Low
* **Skill Level:** Beginner
* **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious SQL via External Data Sources](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_sql_via_external_data_sources.md)

**DuckDB Processes this Data without Sanitization (Critical Node):**
* **Attack:** Injecting malicious SQL code into queries executed by DuckDB by providing malicious data through external sources (e.g., CSV files, network streams) that are processed without proper validation.
* **Likelihood:** High (if Application Reads Data from Untrusted Sources is true)
* **Impact:** Critical
* **Effort:** N/A (dependent on Application Reads Data from Untrusted Sources)
* **Skill Level:** N/A (dependent on Application Reads Data from Untrusted Sources)
* **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Reads Data from Untrusted Sources (e.g., files, network)](./attack_tree_paths/application_reads_data_from_untrusted_sources__e_g___files__network_.md)

* **Attack:** The application fetches and uses data from sources that are not under its direct control and could be manipulated by an attacker.
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** Critical
* **Effort:** Medium
* **Skill Level:** Intermediate
* **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage DuckDB Extensions with Security Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_duckdb_extensions_with_security_flaws.md)

* **Attack:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within DuckDB extensions through crafted SQL queries or function calls.
* **Likelihood:** Low
* **Impact:** Critical
* **Effort:** Medium
* **Skill Level:** Advanced
* **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [Read Sensitive Files](./attack_tree_paths/read_sensitive_files.md)

**DuckDB Configuration Allows Access to Sensitive Directories (Critical Node):**
* **Attack:** Configuring DuckDB in a way that grants it access to directories containing sensitive files, allowing attackers to read these files using SQL functions.
* **Likelihood:** Low
* **Impact:** Significant
* **Effort:** Low
* **Skill Level:** Beginner
* **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [Write to Arbitrary Files](./attack_tree_paths/write_to_arbitrary_files.md)

**DuckDB Configuration Allows Write Access to Sensitive Directories (Critical Node):**
* **Attack:** Configuring DuckDB in a way that grants it write access to sensitive directories, allowing attackers to write malicious files (e.g., configuration files, scripts) using SQL functions.
* **Likelihood:** Very Low
* **Impact:** Critical
* **Effort:** Low
* **Skill Level:** Beginner
* **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [Load Malicious Extension](./attack_tree_paths/load_malicious_extension.md)

**Application Loads Extensions from Untrusted Sources (Critical Node):**
* **Attack:** The application loads DuckDB extensions from sources that are not trusted or verified, potentially allowing the loading of malicious extensions.
* **Likelihood:** Low
* **Impact:** Critical
* **Effort:** Medium
* **Skill Level:** Intermediate
* **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities within Loaded Extensions](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_within_loaded_extensions.md)

* **Attack:** Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities within DuckDB extensions that are already loaded by the application, leading to code execution or other malicious activities.
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** Critical
* **Effort:** Low (if vulnerability is known) to High (if 0-day)
* **Skill Level:** Beginner (for known exploits) to Expert (for 0-day)
* **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Handling of DuckDB Errors](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_handling_of_duckdb_errors.md)

**Application Exposes Sensitive Information in Error Messages (Critical Node):**
* **Attack:** The application displays detailed DuckDB error messages to users or logs them in an insecure manner, revealing sensitive information about the database structure, queries, or internal workings, which an attacker can use for reconnaissance.
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** Moderate
* **Effort:** Minimal
* **Skill Level:** Novice
* **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
