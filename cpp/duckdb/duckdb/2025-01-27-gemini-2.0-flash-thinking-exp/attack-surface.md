# Attack Surface Analysis for duckdb/duckdb

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Manipulation of SQL queries through user-controlled input to execute unintended database operations.
*   **DuckDB Contribution:** DuckDB executes SQL queries provided by the application. Insecure query construction in the application directly leads to exploitable SQL injection vulnerabilities when processed by DuckDB.
*   **Example:** An application constructs a SQL query by directly concatenating user input: `SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '` + user\_provided\_category + `'`. An attacker injects `' OR 1=1 --` as `user_provided_category`, resulting in `SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '' OR 1=1 --'`. This bypasses the category filter and returns all products.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (unauthorized data access, modification, deletion), potential for further system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:**  Employ parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by the DuckDB client library. This is the primary defense against SQL injection.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While parameterization is key, validate and sanitize user input to prevent unexpected data types or formats that could still cause issues or bypass application logic.

## Attack Surface: [File System Access Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/file_system_access_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to or manipulation of the file system due to DuckDB's file I/O capabilities.
*   **DuckDB Contribution:** DuckDB's functionality includes reading and writing files for database operations, data import/export, and extension loading.  If the application doesn't strictly control file paths used by DuckDB, it creates an attack surface.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to specify a file path for importing data. An attacker provides a path like `/sensitive/system/file.txt` hoping to read its contents. If the application directly passes this path to DuckDB's `read_csv` function without validation, DuckDB might attempt to read and potentially expose the file.
*   **Impact:** Reading sensitive files, writing malicious files, data corruption, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Path Validation and Whitelisting:**  Rigorous validation and sanitization of all file paths used in DuckDB operations. Implement a whitelist of allowed directories and file extensions.
    *   **Restrict File System Permissions:**  Run the application with minimal file system permissions. Use OS-level access controls to limit the application's file system access to only necessary directories.
    *   **Avoid User-Controlled File Paths:**  Minimize or eliminate direct user control over file paths. Use indirect references or predefined paths whenever possible.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Extension Loading](./attack_surfaces/malicious_extension_loading.md)

*   **Description:** Loading and execution of untrusted or malicious DuckDB extensions, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **DuckDB Contribution:** DuckDB's extension mechanism allows loading shared libraries to extend its functionality. If the application permits loading extensions from untrusted sources, it directly introduces a critical vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to specify a URL to download and load a DuckDB extension. An attacker provides a URL to a malicious extension. When the application loads this extension using DuckDB's extension loading mechanism, the malicious code within the extension executes within the application's process.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, complete application compromise, data breach, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable Extension Loading (If Not Needed):** If extension functionality is not essential, disable extension loading entirely in the application or DuckDB configuration.
    *   **Strict Extension Whitelisting:**  Implement a strict whitelist of allowed extensions and their trusted sources. Only load extensions from verified and reputable locations.
    *   **Verify Extension Integrity:**  Before loading any extension, verify its integrity using checksums or digital signatures to ensure it hasn't been tampered with.

## Attack Surface: [Data Type Handling and Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/data_type_handling_and_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in DuckDB's data type parsing and handling logic, potentially leading to memory corruption or unexpected behavior.
*   **DuckDB Contribution:** DuckDB is responsible for parsing and processing various data types, especially when importing data from external sources or handling complex queries. Vulnerabilities in these parsing routines are directly within DuckDB.
*   **Example:** Providing a specially crafted Parquet file with malformed data structures designed to trigger a buffer overflow or other memory safety issue in DuckDB's Parquet parsing code.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, potential for arbitrary code execution if memory corruption vulnerabilities are exploitable.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (potential for Critical depending on specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep DuckDB Updated:** Regularly update DuckDB to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes addressing parsing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Data):** Validate and sanitize data, especially from untrusted external sources, before loading it into DuckDB. Enforce data type constraints and limits at the application level before data reaches DuckDB.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via External Data Sources](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_external_data_sources.md)

*   **Description:** Abusing DuckDB's ability to access external data sources to make unauthorized requests to internal or external systems.
*   **DuckDB Contribution:** DuckDB's features for accessing external data sources (e.g., via HTTP for CSV/Parquet files, cloud storage integrations) can be exploited for SSRF if URLs are user-controlled and not properly validated. DuckDB itself makes the requests based on provided URLs.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to provide a URL for a CSV file to be loaded into DuckDB. An attacker provides a URL pointing to an internal service like `http://localhost:8080/admin/sensitive-data`. If the application uses DuckDB to load data from this URL without proper validation, DuckDB will make a request to the internal service, potentially exposing sensitive information or triggering unintended actions.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, data exfiltration from internal systems, potential for further exploitation of internal services.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict URL Validation and Whitelisting:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize URLs used for external data sources. Implement a strict whitelist of allowed domains or URL patterns.
    *   **Restrict Network Access:**  Configure network firewalls or access control lists to limit the application's outbound network access, restricting its ability to connect to arbitrary internal or external systems.
    *   **Avoid User-Controlled URLs:** Minimize or eliminate user control over URLs for external data sources. Use predefined, validated URLs or indirect references whenever possible.

## Attack Surface: [Memory Safety Issues in DuckDB Core (C++)](./attack_surfaces/memory_safety_issues_in_duckdb_core__c++_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting memory safety vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, use-after-free) within DuckDB's C++ codebase.
*   **DuckDB Contribution:** DuckDB is implemented in C++, which is susceptible to memory safety issues. Vulnerabilities in DuckDB's core code are directly exploitable.
*   **Example:** Triggering a specific code path in DuckDB through crafted SQL queries or data inputs that exposes an underlying buffer overflow vulnerability in its query processing engine.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (potential for Critical depending on exploitability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep DuckDB Updated:**  Regularly update DuckDB to the latest version to benefit from security patches that address memory safety issues.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories related to DuckDB and promptly apply recommended updates or mitigations.
    *   **Consider Memory-Safe Languages for Critical Components (Application Level):** While not directly mitigating DuckDB's internal issues, for extremely security-sensitive applications, consider isolating DuckDB operations or using memory-safe languages for application components interacting with DuckDB to reduce the overall attack surface. (This is a more strategic, long-term consideration).
