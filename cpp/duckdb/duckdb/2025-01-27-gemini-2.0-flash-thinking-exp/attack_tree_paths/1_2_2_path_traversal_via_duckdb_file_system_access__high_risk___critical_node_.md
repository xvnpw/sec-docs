### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.2.2: Path Traversal via DuckDB File System Access

#### 4.1. Understanding Path Traversal Vulnerabilities

Path traversal vulnerabilities, also known as directory traversal or "dot-dot-slash" vulnerabilities, arise when an application allows user-controlled input to be used in file path construction without proper validation and sanitization. Attackers can exploit this by injecting special characters, such as `../` (dot-dot-slash), into file paths to navigate outside the intended directory and access files or directories they should not have access to.

**In the context of DuckDB and file system access, this means:**

If an application using DuckDB allows user input to influence file paths used in DuckDB functions like `read_csv`, `read_parquet`, `COPY FROM`, or `ATTACH DATABASE`, an attacker might be able to manipulate these inputs to read or potentially write files outside the intended application directory or database scope.

#### 4.2. DuckDB File System Access Features and Potential Vulnerabilities

DuckDB provides several features that interact with the file system, making it potentially vulnerable to path traversal if not used securely within an application:

* **File Reading Functions (e.g., `read_csv`, `read_parquet`, `read_json`):** These functions take a file path as an argument. If this path is directly or indirectly influenced by user input without proper validation, an attacker could inject `../` sequences to read files from arbitrary locations on the server's file system.

    ```sql
    -- Example vulnerable scenario (if filename is user-controlled)
    SELECT * FROM read_csv('user_provided_filename.csv');
    ```

* **`COPY FROM` Statement:** Similar to file reading functions, `COPY FROM` allows importing data from files. If the file path in the `COPY FROM` statement is user-controlled, it can be exploited for path traversal.

    ```sql
    -- Example vulnerable scenario (if filepath is user-controlled)
    COPY my_table FROM 'user_provided_filepath.csv' (FORMAT CSV);
    ```

* **`ATTACH DATABASE` Statement:**  This statement allows attaching a DuckDB database file from a specified path. If the database path is user-controlled, an attacker could potentially attach databases from unexpected locations, although the direct path traversal risk might be less severe here compared to reading arbitrary files. However, it could still lead to unintended database access or manipulation if the attacker can control the database file path.

    ```sql
    -- Example vulnerable scenario (if db_path is user-controlled)
    ATTACH DATABASE 'user_provided_db_path' AS attached_db;
    ```

* **Potentially User-Defined Functions (UDFs):** If the application utilizes UDFs that interact with the file system (e.g., for custom file processing), and if the file paths within these UDFs are influenced by user input, path traversal vulnerabilities could also arise within the UDF logic.

#### 4.3. Attack Vectors and Exploit Scenarios

Attack vectors for path traversal in this context typically involve manipulating user-controlled input that is used to construct file paths passed to DuckDB file system access functions.

**Example Attack Scenarios:**

1. **Reading Sensitive Files:**
    * **Scenario:** An application allows users to upload CSV files for processing. The application uses `read_csv` to load the uploaded file into DuckDB. The filename is derived from the user-provided filename without proper sanitization.
    * **Attack:** An attacker uploads a file named `../../../../etc/passwd`. When the application uses `read_csv` with this filename, DuckDB attempts to read `/etc/passwd` instead of a file within the intended upload directory.
    * **Impact:** The attacker can read sensitive system files like `/etc/passwd`, potentially gaining user credentials or system configuration information.

2. **Accessing Application Configuration Files:**
    * **Scenario:** An application allows users to specify a configuration file for DuckDB to use. The application uses `ATTACH DATABASE` or `COPY FROM` with a path derived from user input.
    * **Attack:** An attacker provides a path like `../../config/app_secrets.json`. The application, without proper validation, uses this path in `ATTACH DATABASE` or `COPY FROM`.
    * **Impact:** The attacker can access application configuration files containing sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or other secrets.

3. **Database File Manipulation (Less Direct, but Potential):**
    * **Scenario:** An application allows users to specify a database file path for attachment.
    * **Attack:** An attacker provides a path pointing to a database file outside the intended directory, potentially even a system database file (though less likely to be directly exploitable via DuckDB).
    * **Impact:** While directly overwriting system files via `ATTACH DATABASE` is less probable, an attacker might be able to access or manipulate other databases if they can control the path. The impact here is more about unintended database access rather than direct file system compromise in the same way as reading arbitrary files.

#### 4.4. Impact Assessment (HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE)

The "HIGH RISK" and "CRITICAL NODE" designations for this attack path are justified due to the potentially severe consequences of successful path traversal exploitation:

* **Data Breach (Confidentiality Impact):**  Attackers can read sensitive files containing confidential data, including user credentials, application secrets, business data, and system configuration information. This directly violates data confidentiality.
* **System Compromise (Integrity and Availability Impact):** While less direct than other vulnerabilities, path traversal can be a stepping stone to system compromise. By reading configuration files, attackers can gain insights into system architecture and potentially identify further vulnerabilities. In some scenarios, if write access is also possible (though less common with typical DuckDB file read functions), it could lead to data modification or even system disruption.
* **Reputational Damage:** A successful path traversal attack leading to a data breach can severely damage the reputation of the application and the organization.
* **Compliance Violations:** Data breaches resulting from path traversal can lead to violations of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and associated penalties.

The "CRITICAL NODE" designation highlights that this vulnerability can be a key entry point for attackers to escalate their attacks and achieve significant impact. Exploiting path traversal can provide attackers with the information and access they need to launch further attacks.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate path traversal vulnerabilities related to DuckDB file system access, the development team should implement the following strategies:

**4.5.1. Input Validation and Sanitization (Preventative):**

* **Strict Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all user inputs that are used to construct file paths.
    * **Whitelist Allowed Characters:**  Only allow alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores, and periods in filenames and paths. Reject any input containing special characters like `../`, `./`, `\`, `:`, etc.
    * **Path Canonicalization:**  Use path canonicalization techniques to resolve symbolic links and remove redundant path separators (e.g., using functions that resolve paths to their absolute, canonical form). This can help prevent bypasses using symbolic links or unusual path representations.
* **Path Sanitization:**  Sanitize user-provided paths to remove any potentially malicious characters or sequences.
    * **Remove `../` and `./` sequences:**  Replace or remove any occurrences of `../` and `./` from user inputs.
    * **Restrict to Allowed Directories:**  Ensure that user-provided paths are always relative to a predefined safe directory.  Prefix the user-provided filename with the intended base directory.

**4.5.2. Least Privilege Principle (Preventative):**

* **Restrict DuckDB File System Access:**  Run the DuckDB process with the minimum necessary file system permissions.  Avoid running DuckDB with overly permissive user accounts.
* **Application-Level Access Control:**  Implement application-level access control to restrict which users or roles can perform file system operations through DuckDB.

**4.5.3. Secure File Handling Practices (Preventative):**

* **Avoid User-Controlled Paths Directly:**  Whenever possible, avoid directly using user-provided input as file paths. Instead, use indirect references or mappings. For example, use a user-provided ID to look up a pre-defined, safe file path in a configuration or database.
* **Parameterization (Where Applicable):** While DuckDB SQL might not directly support parameterization for file paths in the same way as for data values, consider using parameterized queries for other parts of the SQL statements and carefully construct file paths programmatically using validated and sanitized components.

**4.5.4. Security Auditing and Testing (Detective):**

* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the application code and configuration to identify potential path traversal vulnerabilities.
* **Penetration Testing:**  Perform penetration testing, specifically targeting path traversal vulnerabilities in file system access functionalities.
* **Static and Dynamic Code Analysis:**  Utilize static and dynamic code analysis tools to automatically detect potential path traversal vulnerabilities in the codebase.

**4.5.5. Error Handling and Logging (Detective):**

* **Secure Error Handling:**  Avoid revealing sensitive information in error messages related to file system access. Generic error messages should be used.
* **Detailed Logging:**  Implement detailed logging of file system access attempts, including the paths used, the user involved, and the outcome (success or failure). This can help in detecting and responding to path traversal attempts.

**Conclusion:**

Path traversal via DuckDB file system access is a significant security risk that must be addressed proactively. By implementing robust input validation, sanitization, least privilege principles, secure file handling practices, and regular security testing, the development team can effectively mitigate this vulnerability and protect the application and its data from potential attacks. The "HIGH RISK" and "CRITICAL NODE" designations underscore the importance of prioritizing the mitigation of this attack path.
