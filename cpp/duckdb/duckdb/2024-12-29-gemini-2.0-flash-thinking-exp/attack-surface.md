Here's the updated list of high and critical attack surfaces directly involving DuckDB:

*   **Description:** SQL Injection through User-Provided Queries
    *   **How DuckDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** DuckDB executes SQL queries provided to it. If the application constructs these queries by directly embedding user input without proper sanitization or parameterization, DuckDB will execute potentially malicious SQL.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to filter data based on a name. The application constructs the SQL query as `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '` + user_input + `'`. A malicious user could input `' OR 1=1 --` resulting in `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '' OR 1=1 --'`, which would return all users.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (exposure of sensitive information), data modification or deletion, potential denial-of-service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  This is the most effective way to prevent SQL injection. The query structure is defined separately from the user-provided data, preventing the data from being interpreted as SQL code.
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While not a primary defense against SQL injection, validating and sanitizing user input can help catch some basic attempts. However, rely primarily on parameterized queries.

*   **Description:** Loading Malicious Extensions
    *   **How DuckDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** DuckDB's extension mechanism allows loading external code. If the application allows loading extensions from untrusted sources or doesn't verify the integrity of extensions, malicious code can be executed within the DuckDB process.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to load custom extensions for specific data processing tasks. A malicious user provides a crafted extension that, when loaded by DuckDB, executes arbitrary system commands or exfiltrates data.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data breach, denial-of-service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict Extension Loading Sources:** Only allow loading extensions from trusted and verified sources.
        *   **Verify Extension Integrity:** Use checksums or digital signatures to ensure the integrity of extensions before loading.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the DuckDB process with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a compromised extension.
        *   **Code Review of Extensions:** If using custom or third-party extensions, perform thorough code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Description:** Path Traversal during File Operations (Loading Data)
    *   **How DuckDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** DuckDB allows loading data from files specified by path. If the application uses user-provided input to construct these file paths without proper validation, attackers can use path traversal techniques to access or load data from unintended locations.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to upload data files. The application constructs the load command as `COPY table_name FROM 'uploads/' + user_provided_filename`. A malicious user could provide a filename like `../../../../etc/passwd`, potentially exposing sensitive system files.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive files, potential for further exploitation based on accessed files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid User-Provided Paths Directly:**  Do not directly use user input to construct file paths for DuckDB operations.
        *   **Use Whitelisting and Canonicalization:** If user input is necessary, validate it against a whitelist of allowed filenames or paths. Canonicalize paths to resolve symbolic links and relative references.
        *   **Restrict File System Access:** Run the DuckDB process with restricted file system permissions, limiting the directories it can access.

*   **Description:** Data Ingestion from Untrusted Sources Leading to Exploitation of Parsing Vulnerabilities
    *   **How DuckDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** DuckDB parses data from various formats (CSV, Parquet, etc.). Vulnerabilities in the parsing logic could be exploited by providing maliciously crafted data.
    *   **Example:** An application loads CSV data provided by an external, untrusted source. The CSV data contains specially crafted fields that trigger a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issue in DuckDB's CSV parsing code.
    *   **Impact:** Denial-of-service (crashing the DuckDB process), potential for remote code execution (though less likely due to DuckDB's sandboxing).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Validate Data Schemas:** Enforce strict schema validation on ingested data to ensure it conforms to expected types and formats.
        *   **Sanitize Input Data:**  While complex for binary formats, for text-based formats like CSV, perform sanitization to remove potentially malicious characters or sequences.
        *   **Keep DuckDB Updated:** Regularly update DuckDB to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
