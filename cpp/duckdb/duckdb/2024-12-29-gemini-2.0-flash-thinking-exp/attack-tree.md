**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. [CRITICAL NODE] SQL Injection Attacks (DuckDB Specific)**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject Malicious SQL Queries:**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Via User-Controlled Input (Directly Passed to DuckDB):**
            *   An attacker crafts malicious SQL queries by manipulating user-provided input that is directly incorporated into DuckDB queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
            *   Examples include:
                *   Appending `OR 1=1 --` to bypass authentication checks.
                *   Using `UNION SELECT` statements to retrieve data from unauthorized tables.
                *   Executing stored procedures or functions to perform malicious actions.
                *   Utilizing time-based or boolean-based blind SQL injection techniques to infer information.

**2. [CRITICAL NODE] Extension/Loadable Module Exploits**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Load Malicious Extensions:**
        *   If the application allows loading external extensions into DuckDB, an attacker can load a specially crafted malicious extension.
        *   This malicious extension can:
            *   Execute arbitrary code within the DuckDB process.
            *   Gain access to the underlying operating system and resources.
            *   Exfiltrate data directly from the DuckDB instance or the host system.
            *   Modify or corrupt data within the DuckDB database.
            *   Act as a persistent backdoor.

**3. [HIGH-RISK PATH] File System Interaction Exploits**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Path Traversal via DuckDB Functions:**
        *   Attackers exploit DuckDB functions that interact with the file system (e.g., `read_csv`, `copy`, `glob`) by manipulating the file paths provided as arguments.
        *   By using techniques like `../` (dot-dot-slash), attackers can navigate outside the intended directories and access or modify unauthorized files.
        *   This can lead to:
            *   Reading sensitive configuration files or application code.
            *   Modifying application binaries or scripts.
            *   Writing malicious files to arbitrary locations on the server.
            *   Potentially achieving remote code execution if writable locations are exploited.

**4. [CRITICAL NODE] Achieve Desired Outcome**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Data Exfiltration:**
        *   Leveraging successful SQL injection or file system access exploits to extract sensitive data from the DuckDB database.
        *   Methods include:
            *   Using `SELECT` statements to retrieve data and transfer it out of the system.
            *   Copying data to attacker-controlled locations using DuckDB's file system functions.
            *   Exploiting vulnerabilities to directly access and download database files.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Data Modification/Corruption:**
        *   Utilizing SQL injection vulnerabilities to modify or delete data within the DuckDB database.
        *   This can disrupt application functionality, compromise data integrity, or lead to financial loss.
        *   Examples include:
            *   Updating sensitive fields with incorrect values.
            *   Deleting critical records.
            *   Inserting false or misleading data.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH] Code Execution (Potentially on Host System):**
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities within DuckDB itself or its loaded extensions to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application.
        *   This is the most severe outcome, allowing the attacker to:
            *   Gain complete control over the server.
            *   Install malware or backdoors.
            *   Pivot to other systems within the network.
            *   Steal sensitive data beyond the DuckDB database.
            *   Cause significant disruption and damage.

This focused view highlights the most critical areas requiring immediate attention and robust security measures to protect the application.
