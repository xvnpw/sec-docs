## Attack Tree Path: [1. Unauthorized Data Access](./attack_tree_paths/1__unauthorized_data_access.md)

*   **1.1 Exploit SQL Injection (DuckDB) [CN]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker attempts to inject malicious SQL code into the application's input fields, which are then passed to DuckDB without proper sanitization. This allows the attacker to bypass application logic and directly interact with the database.
    *   **Why it's Critical:** SQL injection is a well-known and highly effective attack vector.  Successful exploitation can grant the attacker complete control over the data within DuckDB, leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (Depends heavily on the application's input validation. Poor validation leads to High likelihood.)
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Potential for complete data compromise.)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Automated tools and readily available exploits exist.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate (Basic SQL injection is easy to learn; exploiting specific database features might require more skill.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Standard SQL injection might be detected by Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) or Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), but subtle, database-specific injections can be harder to detect.)

    *   **1.1.1 Craft Malicious Queries [HR]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker crafts specific SQL queries designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the application's interaction with DuckDB. This could involve:
            *   **Bypassing Authentication:** Injecting code to bypass login checks.
            *   **Retrieving Sensitive Data:**  Crafting queries to extract data from tables the attacker shouldn't have access to.
            *   **Exploiting DuckDB-Specific Functions:**  Using functions like `read_csv` or `read_parquet` with malicious input to read arbitrary files or execute commands.  Example: `SELECT * FROM read_csv('../../etc/passwd')` (if user input controls the filename).
            *   **Union-Based Attacks:** Using `UNION` statements to combine the results of a legitimate query with the attacker's malicious query.
            *   **Error-Based Attacks:**  Triggering database errors to reveal information about the database structure or data.
            *   **Blind SQL Injection:**  Using techniques to infer data even when the database doesn't directly return the results of the injected query (e.g., using time delays or boolean conditions).
        *   **Why it's High-Risk:** This is the primary method for exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities.  The combination of relatively high likelihood and high impact makes it a high-risk path.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate all user input against a whitelist of allowed characters and patterns.
            *   **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** Use prepared statements *correctly*.  The SQL query structure should be fixed, and user input should only be provided as parameters. *Never* concatenate user input directly into the SQL string.
            *   **Least Privilege:**  The database user account used by the application should have the minimum necessary privileges.
            *   **Output Encoding:** Encode output data to prevent it from being interpreted as SQL code.
            *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF can help detect and block common SQL injection attacks.
            *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Data Modification](./attack_tree_paths/2__data_modification.md)

*   **2.1 Inject Malicious SQL (DuckDB) [CN]**
    *   **Description:** Similar to 1.1, but the attacker's goal is to modify data within the database rather than simply reading it.
    *   **Why it's Critical:**  Successful SQL injection can allow an attacker to alter, delete, or insert data, potentially causing significant damage to the application's integrity and functionality.
    *   **Likelihood, Impact, Effort, Skill Level, Detection Difficulty:** Identical to 1.1 (Exploit SQL Injection for Unauthorized Access).

    *   **2.1.1 Craft Malicious Queries [HR]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker crafts SQL queries to perform unauthorized data modifications. This could involve:
            *   **`UPDATE` Statements:** Modifying existing data, such as changing user roles, passwords, or financial records.
            *   **`INSERT` Statements:**  Adding new data, such as creating malicious user accounts or inserting false information.
            *   **`DELETE` Statements:**  Deleting data, potentially causing data loss or application instability.
            *   **`TRUNCATE TABLE` Statements:**  Deleting all data from a table.
            *   **Exploiting Stored Procedures (if applicable):** If the application uses stored procedures, the attacker might try to inject code into the parameters of those procedures.
        *   **Why it's High-Risk:**  Same reasoning as 1.1.1.  The path is technically identical; only the attacker's objective differs.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Same as 1.1.1 (Craft Malicious Queries for Unauthorized Access), with the addition of:
            *   **Transaction Management:** Use database transactions to ensure that multiple related operations are performed atomically. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction should be rolled back.
            *   **Data Auditing:** Implement audit logging to track all data modifications, including who made the changes and when.
