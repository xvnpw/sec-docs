# BUSINESS POSTURE

DuckDB is an in-process SQL OLAP database management system. It's designed to be fast, reliable, and easy to use. It's positioned as an embedded database, similar to SQLite, but focused on analytical workloads.

Business Priorities:

- Performance: Provide fast query execution for analytical workloads.
- Ease of Use: Simple installation and usage, with minimal dependencies.
- Compatibility: Support standard SQL and integrate with various data ecosystems.
- Reliability: Ensure data integrity and consistent results.
- Cost-Effectiveness: Minimize resource consumption (CPU, memory, storage).
- Embeddability: Seamless integration into other applications and systems.

Business Goals:

- Become a leading choice for embedded analytical processing.
- Enable fast, local data analysis without the need for a separate database server.
- Facilitate data-intensive applications and workflows.
- Provide a free and open-source alternative to commercial analytical databases.

Most Important Business Risks:

- Data Corruption: Given that it's an in-process database, any crashes or errors in the host application could potentially lead to data loss or corruption.
- Security Vulnerabilities: As an embedded database, vulnerabilities in DuckDB could be exploited through the host application, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or system compromise.
- Performance Bottlenecks: Unexpected performance issues with specific queries or data sets could hinder adoption and user satisfaction.
- Compatibility Issues: Incompatibilities with specific SQL dialects or data formats could limit its applicability.
- Lack of Concurrency Control for Multiple Writers: While DuckDB supports concurrent reads, concurrent writes from multiple processes are not fully supported, which can be a limitation in some use cases.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

- security control: Secure Coding Practices: The project uses C++11 and emphasizes code quality and correctness. This is evident in their contribution guidelines and coding style documentation. (Described in CONTRIBUTING.md and docs/dev/coding_style.md)
- security control: Static Analysis: The project uses static analysis tools like clang-tidy and Coverity Scan to identify potential bugs and vulnerabilities. (Described in .github/workflows/lint.yml and docs/dev/building.md)
- security control: Fuzz Testing: DuckDB employs fuzz testing (OSS-Fuzz) to find potential crashes and vulnerabilities by providing invalid or unexpected inputs. (Described in tools/ossfuzz)
- security control: Regular Updates: The project has a frequent release cycle, allowing for timely patching of security vulnerabilities.
- security control: Dependency Management: The project carefully manages its dependencies to minimize the risk of supply chain attacks. They have a relatively small number of external dependencies.
- security control: Memory Safety: As a C++ project, memory safety is a concern. The project uses techniques like smart pointers and RAII to mitigate memory management issues.
- security control: Input Validation: DuckDB performs input validation to prevent SQL injection and other injection attacks. This is inherent in the design of a SQL database.

Accepted Risks:

- accepted risk: Single-Process Limitation: DuckDB is primarily designed for single-process use. While multiple processes can read from the same database file concurrently, concurrent writes are not fully supported and require external locking mechanisms. This is a known limitation and a trade-off for performance and simplicity.
- accepted risk: Host Application Security: As an embedded database, DuckDB's security relies heavily on the security of the host application. Vulnerabilities in the host application can potentially compromise DuckDB.
- accepted risk: Limited Access Control: DuckDB does not have built-in user management or granular access control mechanisms. It relies on the operating system's file permissions for access control.

Recommended Security Controls:

- security control: Enhanced Sandboxing: Explore options for sandboxing DuckDB within the host application to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
- security control: Authentication and Authorization: While complex access control might not be a primary goal, consider adding basic authentication and authorization mechanisms for scenarios where multiple users or processes interact with the same database.
- security control: Data Encryption at Rest: Implement encryption at rest to protect data stored on disk.

Security Requirements:

- Authentication: Not a primary requirement due to the embedded nature. However, basic authentication mechanisms could be considered for specific use cases.
- Authorization: Limited authorization based on file system permissions. More granular authorization is not a core requirement.
- Input Validation: Strict input validation is crucial to prevent SQL injection and other injection attacks. This is already a core part of DuckDB's design.
- Cryptography:
    - Data in transit: Not directly applicable as it's an in-process database.
    - Data at rest: Encryption at rest should be considered as a recommended security control.
    - Hashing: Used for data integrity checks and potentially for password storage if authentication is added.

-   security control: Dependency Management: Dependencies are carefully managed and reviewed to minimize supply chain risks.
-   security control: Automated Testing: A comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests is run as part of the CI pipeline to ensure code correctness and prevent regressions.
-   security control: Reproducible Builds: Efforts are made to ensure that builds are reproducible, meaning that the same source code and build environment will always produce the same output.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

-   Data Analysis: The primary business process is enabling fast and efficient data analysis.
-   Data Storage and Retrieval: DuckDB is responsible for storing and retrieving data reliably.
-   Integration with Applications: Seamless integration with various applications and programming languages is crucial.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

-   User Data: The data stored and processed by DuckDB can vary greatly in sensitivity depending on the specific use case. It could range from non-sensitive public data to highly confidential business data.
-   Database Metadata: Metadata about the database schema, tables, and columns should be protected.
-   Sensitivity: The sensitivity of the data is determined by the user and the application that embeds DuckDB. DuckDB itself does not have inherent knowledge of data sensitivity.
