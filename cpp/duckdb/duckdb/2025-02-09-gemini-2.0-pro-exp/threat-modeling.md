# Threat Model Analysis for duckdb/duckdb

## Threat: [Malicious Parquet File Exploitation](./threats/malicious_parquet_file_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Parquet File Exploitation

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious Parquet file that exploits a vulnerability in DuckDB's Parquet reader. The attacker could upload this file (if the application allows uploads) or provide a URL to a remote malicious Parquet file. The vulnerability could be a buffer overflow, integer overflow, or other memory corruption issue within the Parquet parsing logic.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the application's process, allowing the attacker to potentially take full control of the system or application. Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the application. Information disclosure of sensitive data.
    *   **Affected Component:** DuckDB's Parquet reader (`src/storage/table/parquet_reader.cpp` and related files, potentially also the underlying Apache Arrow library).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Strictly validate all file paths and URLs provided by users.  Use allow-lists for file extensions.
        *   **Schema Validation:** Validate the schema of the Parquet file against an expected schema before processing.
        *   **Fuzzing:** Regularly fuzz the Parquet reader with malformed inputs.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep DuckDB and its dependencies (especially Apache Arrow) up-to-date.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run the application with the lowest necessary privileges.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Consider running the DuckDB processing in a sandboxed environment.

## Threat: [CSV Parsing Integer Overflow](./threats/csv_parsing_integer_overflow.md)

*   **Threat:** CSV Parsing Integer Overflow

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a CSV file with extremely large integer values designed to trigger an integer overflow in DuckDB's CSV parser. This could lead to memory corruption or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the application. Potential for limited code execution, although less likely than with Parquet. Information disclosure.
    *   **Affected Component:** DuckDB's CSV reader (`src/storage/table/csv_reader.cpp` and related files).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate the size and format of data within the CSV file.  Limit the maximum length of fields.
        *   **Type Checking:** Enforce strict type checking during CSV parsing.
        *   **Fuzzing:** Regularly fuzz the CSV reader with various malformed inputs, including large numbers.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep DuckDB up-to-date.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Limit the amount of memory that DuckDB can use.

## Threat: [SQL Injection via `read_csv_auto` Filename (and similar functions)](./threats/sql_injection_via__read_csv_auto__filename__and_similar_functions_.md)

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection via `read_csv_auto` Filename (and similar functions)

    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious SQL code into the filename argument of the `read_csv_auto` function (or similar functions like `read_parquet`, `read_json_objects`).  If the application constructs the filename using user input without proper sanitization:  `SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('/path/to/user_input')`. The attacker could provide a filename like `/dev/random; DROP TABLE users; --` to attempt to execute arbitrary SQL or access unintended files.
    *   **Impact:**  RCE (if the attacker can write to the filesystem and then execute a file), DoS, Information Disclosure, Data Modification/Deletion.
    *   **Affected Component:**  DuckDB's file reading functions (`read_csv_auto`, `read_parquet`, `read_json_objects`, etc.) and the SQL parser.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Prepared Statements/Parameterized Queries:**  *Never* construct file paths using string concatenation with user input.  Use parameterized queries or a dedicated file handling API that properly escapes special characters.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided file paths.  Use allow-lists for allowed characters and paths.
        *   **Least Privilege:**  Run the application with the lowest necessary file system permissions.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Large Join](./threats/denial_of_service_via_large_join.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Large Join

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a query that performs a very large join operation (e.g., a Cartesian product of two large tables) without appropriate filtering. This can consume excessive memory and CPU, leading to a denial-of-service.
    *   **Impact:** Application Unavailability (DoS).
    *   **Affected Component:** DuckDB's query optimizer and execution engine (various components involved in join processing).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Query Timeouts:** Set reasonable timeouts for all DuckDB queries.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Use operating system-level resource limits (e.g., `cgroups`).
        *   **Query Complexity Analysis:** Implement checks to estimate the complexity of queries and reject overly complex ones.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the rate at which users can submit queries.
        *   **Memory Limits:** Configure DuckDB's memory limits.

## Threat: [Malicious DuckDB Extension](./threats/malicious_duckdb_extension.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious DuckDB Extension

    *   **Description:** An attacker installs a malicious DuckDB extension that contains arbitrary code. This could be achieved through social engineering or by exploiting a vulnerability that allows the attacker to load an extension.
    *   **Impact:** RCE, DoS, Information Disclosure, Data Modification/Deletion.
    *   **Affected Component:** DuckDB's extension loading mechanism (`src/main/extension_helper.cpp` and related files).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Vetting:** Only install extensions from trusted sources. Review the source code.
        *   **Code Signing:** Verify the digital signature of extensions.
        *   **Restrict Loading:** Disable dynamic extension loading if not needed.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep extensions up-to-date.

## Threat: [Concurrent Access Data Corruption](./threats/concurrent_access_data_corruption.md)

* **Threat:** Concurrent Access Data Corruption

    * **Description:** Multiple threads within the application attempt to modify the same DuckDB database concurrently using the *same* connection object without proper synchronization. This can lead to data corruption or inconsistent results.
    * **Impact:** Data Corruption, Inconsistent Data.
    * **Affected Component:** DuckDB's connection object (`DuckDB::Connection`).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Connection Pooling (Single-Threaded Use):** Use a connection pool, but ensure each connection is used by *only one thread at a time* for write operations. Multiple read-only connections *can* be used concurrently.
        * **Avoid Shared Connections:** Do *not* share `DuckDB::Connection` objects between threads for write operations.
        * **Transactions:** Use transactions to ensure atomicity of operations.
