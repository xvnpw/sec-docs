# Attack Surface Analysis for duckdb/duckdb

## Attack Surface: [Untrusted Data Source Injection](./attack_surfaces/untrusted_data_source_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers provide malicious data sources (files, URLs, streams) to DuckDB, exploiting vulnerabilities in parsing or processing logic. This remains the *most critical* attack vector.

**How DuckDB Contributes:** DuckDB's core functionality is to process data from various sources.  Its parsers and data handling routines (for formats like CSV, Parquet, JSON, etc.) are the direct targets of this attack.  DuckDB's ability to read from various sources *is* the attack surface.

**Example:** An attacker provides a URL to a crafted Parquet file that exploits a buffer overflow in DuckDB's Parquet reader, leading to arbitrary code execution.  Or, a malicious CSV file is crafted to exploit a vulnerability in the CSV parser.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Whitelisting:** *Only* allow data sources from a predefined, trusted list.  *Never* accept arbitrary file paths or URLs from users. This is the most important mitigation.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Isolate the DuckDB process (or the data loading component) within a container or restricted user account to limit the blast radius of a successful exploit.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize *all* components of the data source string, even if whitelisted (e.g., remove any special characters from filenames).
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary file system permissions.  The application should *not* have write access to sensitive areas.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep DuckDB updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities in its parsers and data handling routines.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious DuckDB Extensions](./attack_surfaces/malicious_duckdb_extensions.md)

**Description:** Untrusted or compromised DuckDB extensions can introduce vulnerabilities, including code execution.

**How DuckDB Contributes:** DuckDB's extension mechanism allows loading *external code* directly into the DuckDB process. This code has the same privileges as DuckDB itself.

**Example:** An attacker convinces the application administrator to install a malicious extension disguised as a performance enhancer.  This extension contains a backdoor that allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands within the DuckDB process.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Extension Whitelisting:** Only load extensions from *trusted sources* (e.g., the official DuckDB repository) and that are *absolutely necessary*.
    *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review the source code of *any* custom extensions before deployment.  Look for suspicious code patterns, network connections, or file system access.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep extensions updated to the latest versions to patch any known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Disable Unused Extensions:** Explicitly disable any extensions that are not actively in use. This reduces the attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of DuckDB Internal Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_duckdb_internal_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Bugs in DuckDB's core code (parsing, query execution, memory management, etc.) could be exploited, even with proper input validation at the application level. This is a direct vulnerability *within* DuckDB.

**How DuckDB Contributes:** This is inherent to the complexity of DuckDB's codebase.  Vulnerabilities can exist in any part of the system, from the SQL parser to the storage engine.

**Example:** A zero-day vulnerability in DuckDB's handling of a specific data type or SQL function allows an attacker to cause a crash or potentially gain code execution, even with seemingly valid input and a properly configured application.

**Impact:** Varies, but can include Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Denial of Service (DoS).

**Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical, depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** *Crucially important.* Keep DuckDB updated to the latest version to receive bug fixes and security patches. This is the *primary* defense against this type of vulnerability.  New releases often contain fixes for security issues.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Consider using vulnerability scanners that specifically target DuckDB to identify known vulnerabilities in the version being used.
    *   **Security Advisories:** Monitor DuckDB security advisories and mailing lists for announcements of new vulnerabilities.  Be prepared to update quickly if a critical vulnerability is disclosed.
