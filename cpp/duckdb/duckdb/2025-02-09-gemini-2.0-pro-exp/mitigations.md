# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for duckdb/duckdb

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict File Access Control (DuckDB-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_file_access_control__duckdb-specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict File Access Control (DuckDB-Specific)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Configuration:**  Within your application's DuckDB initialization code, explicitly set `allow_unsigned_extensions=false`.  This prevents DuckDB from loading unsigned extensions, significantly reducing the risk of malicious code execution.
        2.  **Configuration:** Set `custom_extension_repository` to an empty string (`''`) or to a highly controlled, trusted, and *local* directory.  *Never* allow DuckDB to download extensions from an untrusted remote repository.  If you don't need custom extensions, leave this setting empty.
        3.  **Path Validation (with DuckDB interaction):**  Before passing *any* file path to a DuckDB function (especially `COPY FROM`, `COPY TO`, `read_csv`, `read_parquet`, etc.), perform rigorous validation.  This validation should happen *before* the path is given to DuckDB.  While you can't fully prevent all issues *within* DuckDB, pre-validation is crucial.
            *   Use a whitelist of allowed directories.
            *   Normalize the path (resolve `.` and `..`) to prevent directory traversal.
            *   Reject paths with suspicious characters.
        4. **Read-Only Operations:** When possible, use DuckDB in a read-only mode. This can be achieved by connecting to the database with the `:memory:` or a read-only file path.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Arbitrary File Read/Write (Severity: High):**  Directly prevents the use of DuckDB features to access unauthorized files.
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Extensions (Severity: Medium):**  Prevents the loading of malicious or vulnerable extensions.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Arbitrary File Read/Write:** Risk significantly reduced.  DuckDB is prevented from accessing files outside the allowed set.
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Extensions:** Risk significantly reduced.  Unsigned extensions are blocked.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** `allow_unsigned_extensions` is set to `false`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  `custom_extension_repository` is not explicitly set (defaults to an empty string, which is good in this case).  Path validation is inconsistent; needs a dedicated function and consistent application. Read-only mode is not used where it could be.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits and Timeouts (DuckDB-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_and_timeouts__duckdb-specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Resource Limits and Timeouts (DuckDB-Specific)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **`PRAGMA` Statements:**  Use DuckDB's `PRAGMA` statements *within your application code* to set resource limits and timeouts *before* executing any user-supplied queries.  These should be set *per connection* or *per session*, as appropriate.
            *   `PRAGMA threads=N;` (Limit the number of threads DuckDB can use.)
            *   `PRAGMA memory_limit='XGB';` (Limit the maximum memory DuckDB can allocate.)
            *   `PRAGMA query_timeout=Y;` (Set a timeout in seconds for queries.  DuckDB will automatically terminate queries that exceed this limit.)
        2.  **Connection-Specific Settings:**  If your application uses multiple DuckDB connections, ensure that resource limits and timeouts are set appropriately for *each* connection.
        3. **Dynamic Adjustment (Advanced):** Consider dynamically adjusting resource limits based on the current system load or the expected complexity of the query. This is more complex but can provide better resource utilization.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (Severity: Medium):**  Directly prevents DuckDB queries from consuming excessive resources.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service:** Risk significantly reduced.  DuckDB's resource usage is controlled via its own configuration.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Basic `PRAGMA query_timeout` is set.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** `PRAGMA threads` and `PRAGMA memory_limit` are not consistently set.  Connection-specific settings are not managed.  Dynamic adjustment is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Error Handling (DuckDB-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_error_handling__duckdb-specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Error Handling (DuckDB-Specific)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Catch DuckDB Exceptions:**  Wrap DuckDB API calls in `try...except` blocks (or the equivalent in your programming language) to catch any exceptions raised by DuckDB.
        2.  **Sanitize Error Messages:**  Within the `except` block, *inspect* the exception object or error message provided by DuckDB.  *Before* returning the error to the user or logging it, remove or redact any potentially sensitive information, such as:
            *   Full file paths.
            *   Table schemas or column names (if they reveal sensitive information).
            *   Fragments of the SQL query that might contain sensitive data.
        3.  **Log Original Error (Securely):**  Log the *original*, unsanitized error message (including the full DuckDB error) to a secure log file for debugging purposes.  Ensure this log file has restricted access.
        4.  **Generic User-Facing Errors:**  Return a generic, user-friendly error message to the user that does *not* reveal any internal details.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data Leakage through Error Messages (Severity: Low):** Prevents DuckDB's error messages from exposing sensitive information.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduced.  Sensitive details are removed from user-facing error messages.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**  None. DuckDB exceptions are not consistently handled, and error messages are often passed directly to the user.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Comprehensive error handling with sanitization is completely missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Prepared Statements (DuckDB-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/prepared_statements__duckdb-specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Prepared Statements (DuckDB-Specific)

    *   **Description:**
        1. **Use Prepared Statements:** Whenever interacting with DuckDB using dynamic SQL queries (queries built using user input), use DuckDB's prepared statement API. This is crucial for preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities.
        2. **Bind Parameters:**  Use parameterized queries (binding variables) instead of string concatenation to construct SQL queries.  DuckDB's prepared statement API provides mechanisms for safely binding values to placeholders in the query.
        3. **Avoid String Concatenation:** *Never* directly construct SQL queries by concatenating strings with user-provided input.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **SQL Injection (Severity: High):** If user input is used to construct queries, prepared statements prevent attackers from injecting malicious SQL code.  Although DuckDB is an in-process library, and traditional SQL injection leading to remote code execution is less likely, attackers could still use injection to read or modify data, bypass security checks, or cause denial of service.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **SQL Injection:** Risk significantly reduced. Prepared statements with parameterized queries are the primary defense against SQL injection.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Some queries use prepared statements, but others still rely on string concatenation.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Consistent use of prepared statements throughout the codebase is needed. A code review should identify and fix any instances of string concatenation used to build SQL queries.
