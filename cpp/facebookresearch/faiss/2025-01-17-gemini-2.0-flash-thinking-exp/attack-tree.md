## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Faiss Index Manipulation [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_faiss_index_manipulation__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the Faiss index. This can lead to data poisoning, unauthorized access, and potentially remote code execution.
*   **Critical Node:** This is a critical node because the index is the core data structure of Faiss. Compromising it can have widespread and severe consequences.
    *   **Inject Malicious Data into Index**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Attackers attempt to insert malicious or manipulated data into the Faiss index. This can skew search results, leading to incorrect recommendations, unauthorized access, or manipulation of downstream processes.
            *   **Directly Modify Index Files (If Accessible) [CRITICAL]**
                *   **Attack Vector:** If the attacker gains file system access to the index files, they can directly modify the contents. This allows for arbitrary data injection, corruption, or replacement of the index with a compromised version.
            *   **Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]**
                *   **Attack Vector:** If the application loads serialized Faiss indexes, attackers can provide maliciously crafted index files. Vulnerabilities in the deserialization process can lead to remote code execution when the application attempts to load the malicious index.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Faiss Search/Query Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_faiss_searchquery_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in the search and query functionality of Faiss to cause resource exhaustion or bypass security checks.
    *   **Craft Malicious Queries**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft specific queries to overload the system or retrieve unauthorized data.
            *   **Trigger Excessive Resource Usage**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers submit queries designed to consume excessive computational resources, leading to denial of service or performance degradation.
                    *   Submit Queries with Extremely Large `k` Values: Requesting a very large number of nearest neighbors (`k`) can overwhelm the search process.
            *   **Bypass Security Checks (If Search Results are Used for Authorization)**
                *   **Attack Vector:** If the application uses Faiss search results to determine access rights, attackers can craft queries to retrieve vectors associated with unauthorized data, effectively bypassing access controls.
                    *   Craft Queries to Retrieve Unauthorized Data:  Manipulating query parameters or the query vector itself to retrieve results that should be restricted.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Faiss Library Internals [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_faiss_library_internals__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers target vulnerabilities within the Faiss library's code or its dependencies to gain control of the application or the underlying system.
*   **Critical Node:** This is a critical node because successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution, granting the attacker significant control.
    *   **Trigger Memory Corruption [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers provide crafted input that exploits memory management flaws in Faiss, leading to buffer overflows or use-after-free vulnerabilities.
            *   Provide Crafted Input Vectors Leading to Buffer Overflows:  Supplying input vectors that exceed allocated buffer sizes, potentially overwriting adjacent memory.
    *   **Exploit Known Faiss Vulnerabilities (If Any Exist) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in specific versions of Faiss.
            *   Research Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities:  Actively searching for and exploiting known weaknesses in the Faiss library.
    *   **Exploit Dependencies of Faiss [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in libraries that Faiss relies on, such as BLAS or LAPACK.
            *   Identify and Exploit Vulnerabilities in Libraries Faiss Relies On (e.g., BLAS, LAPACK):  Finding and exploiting security flaws in these underlying numerical libraries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Faiss](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__via_faiss.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to make the application unavailable to legitimate users by overwhelming its resources or causing it to crash.
    *   **Exhaust Server Resources**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, network) to prevent legitimate requests from being processed.
            *   Repeatedly Trigger Resource-Intensive Indexing:  Initiating multiple indexing operations, which can be computationally expensive.
            *   Send a High Volume of Complex Queries: Flooding the application with a large number of resource-intensive search queries.
    *   **Crash the Application**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers trigger errors or exceptions within Faiss that the application does not handle gracefully, leading to a crash.
            *   Trigger Unhandled Exceptions or Errors in Faiss:  Providing specific inputs or performing actions that cause Faiss to throw errors that are not caught by the application.
