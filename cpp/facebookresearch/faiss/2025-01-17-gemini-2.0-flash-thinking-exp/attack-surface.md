# Attack Surface Analysis for facebookresearch/faiss

## Attack Surface: [Loading maliciously crafted or corrupted Faiss index files.](./attack_surfaces/loading_maliciously_crafted_or_corrupted_faiss_index_files.md)

*   **Description:** Loading maliciously crafted or corrupted Faiss index files.
    *   **How Faiss Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Faiss allows saving and loading index files. If the application loads index files from untrusted sources or allows user-uploaded index files, a malicious actor could provide a crafted file designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Faiss's loading mechanism.
    *   **Example:** A crafted index file could contain unexpected data structures or values that trigger buffer overflows, memory corruption, or other vulnerabilities when Faiss attempts to load it.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution if vulnerabilities in the loading process exist.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only load Faiss index files from trusted sources.
        *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums, digital signatures) for index files.
        *   Consider sandboxing the Faiss index loading process if dealing with potentially untrusted files.

## Attack Surface: [Resource exhaustion through excessive memory or CPU usage during indexing or searching.](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_through_excessive_memory_or_cpu_usage_during_indexing_or_searching.md)

*   **Description:** Resource exhaustion through excessive memory or CPU usage during indexing or searching.
    *   **How Faiss Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Building and searching large Faiss indexes can be resource-intensive. Certain index types or search parameters might be more computationally expensive than others. An attacker could exploit this by triggering operations that consume excessive resources.
    *   **Example:**  Submitting an extremely large number of vectors for indexing, or crafting search queries that force Faiss to perform inefficient computations, leading to memory exhaustion or CPU overload.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, application slowdown, potential for other services on the same machine to be affected.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement resource limits (memory, CPU time) for Faiss operations.
        *   Monitor resource usage during Faiss operations.
        *   Implement rate limiting or request throttling for operations that interact with Faiss.
        *   Choose appropriate Faiss index types and search parameters based on the expected data size and query patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously crafted input vectors leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_input_vectors_leading_to_unexpected_behavior_or_crashes.md)

*   **Description:** Maliciously crafted input vectors leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.
    *   **How Faiss Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Faiss relies on the application to provide well-formed numerical data as input vectors for indexing and searching. It may not have robust built-in safeguards against all types of malformed or extreme numerical values.
    *   **Example:** Providing input vectors containing extremely large numbers (overflow), NaN (Not a Number), or Infinity values that could cause numerical instability or crashes within Faiss's algorithms.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential for unexpected or incorrect search results.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the application side before passing data to Faiss.
        *   Check for and handle special numerical values (NaN, Infinity) appropriately.
        *   Consider clipping or normalizing input vector values to a safe range.
