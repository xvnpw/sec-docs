# Threat Model Analysis for facebookresearch/faiss

## Threat: [Index Corruption](./threats/index_corruption.md)

*   Description: An attacker gains unauthorized access to the stored Faiss index files and modifies them. This could involve directly altering the file contents or replacing them with a maliciously crafted index.
*   Impact: Search results become unreliable and inaccurate, potentially leading to incorrect application behavior or misleading information for users. In some cases, a corrupted index might cause the application to crash or malfunction when attempting to load or use it.
*   Affected Faiss Component: Index Loading, specific index file formats (e.g., Flat, IVFFlat).
*   Risk Severity: High
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Implement strong access controls on the storage location of Faiss index files.
    *   Use file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized modifications.
    *   Consider storing index files in read-only storage if feasible.
    *   Implement backup and recovery mechanisms for index files.

## Threat: [Malicious Index Injection](./threats/malicious_index_injection.md)

*   Description: An attacker manipulates the process of building the Faiss index by injecting malicious or crafted vector data. This could happen if the data source used for index building is compromised or if the application doesn't properly sanitize input data.
*   Impact: The resulting index contains biased or malicious data, leading to skewed or manipulated search results. This could be used to promote specific items, suppress others, or even trigger vulnerabilities in downstream processing of the search results.
*   Affected Faiss Component: Index Building functions (e.g., `add`, `train`), input data handling within Faiss.
*   Risk Severity: High
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input data *before* passing it to Faiss for index building.
    *   Implement secure data pipelines and access controls for data sources used in index building.
    *   Consider using trusted and verified data sources for index creation.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Large Index Loading](./threats/denial_of_service_via_large_index_loading.md)

*   Description: An attacker provides an excessively large or specially crafted Faiss index file that consumes excessive memory or CPU resources when the application attempts to load it.
*   Impact: The application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to resource exhaustion, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.
*   Affected Faiss Component: Index Loading functions (e.g., `read_index`).
*   Risk Severity: High
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Implement checks on the size of index files before attempting to load them.
    *   Set resource limits (e.g., memory limits) for the process loading the index.
    *   Implement timeouts for index loading operations.
    *   Store index files in a secure location where unauthorized modification or replacement is difficult.

## Threat: [Exploiting Native Code Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_native_code_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Description: Faiss is primarily implemented in C++. Like any native code, it is susceptible to memory safety issues like buffer overflows, use-after-free vulnerabilities, and other memory corruption bugs. An attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities if they exist in the Faiss library itself.
*   Impact: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server or client running the application, potentially allowing the attacker to gain full control of the system.
*   Affected Faiss Component: Core C++ implementation of various modules and functions within Faiss.
*   Risk Severity: Critical
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Keep the Faiss library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to Faiss.
    *   Consider using static and dynamic analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the Faiss library (though this is primarily the responsibility of the Faiss developers).
    *   Implement security best practices in the application code that interacts with Faiss to minimize the impact of potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Description: Faiss allows saving and loading indexes from disk. If the deserialization process is not carefully implemented, it could be vulnerable to attacks where malicious index files are crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in the deserialization logic.
*   Impact: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution when the application attempts to load a malicious index file.
*   Affected Faiss Component: Index Loading functions (e.g., `read_index`), serialization/deserialization logic within Faiss.
*   Risk Severity: Critical
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Only load Faiss index files from trusted sources.
    *   Keep the Faiss library updated to benefit from security patches in the deserialization logic.
    *   Consider implementing additional validation checks on loaded index data, although this might be complex.
