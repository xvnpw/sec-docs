## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization (Vector Level)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization__vector_level_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation and Sanitization (Vector Level)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Expected Data Distribution:** Analyze legitimate input vectors. Calculate statistics (mean, standard deviation, norms, covariance - optional).
    2.  **Implement Validation Checks (Before FAISS calls):**
        *   **Dimensionality Check:** `if len(vector) != expected_dimensionality: reject_vector()`
        *   **Data Type Check:** `if vector.dtype != np.float32: reject_vector()` (or expected type)
        *   **Norm Check:** `norm = np.linalg.norm(vector)`; `if norm < min_norm or norm > max_norm: reject_vector()`
        *   **Outlier Detection (Mahalanobis):** `mahalanobis_distance = scipy.spatial.distance.mahalanobis(...)`; `if mahalanobis_distance > threshold: reject_vector()`
        *   **Component-wise Checks (Optional):** `if not all(min_val <= x <= max_val for x in vector): reject_vector()`
    3.  **Rejection Handling:** Log rejections, return error codes, consider alerts.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Poisoning (High Severity):**
    *   **Adversarial Inputs (High Severity):**
    *   **DoS (Medium Severity):** (Indirectly, by limiting vector size)
    *   **Vulnerabilities in FAISS (Medium Severity):**

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Poisoning:** Significant reduction (70-90%).
    *   **Adversarial Inputs:** Moderate to high reduction (50-80%).
    *   **DoS:** Moderate reduction (30-50%).
    *   **Vulnerabilities in FAISS:** Low to moderate reduction (20-40%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Dimensionality and data type checks in `api/query_handler.py`.
    *   Basic norm check (fixed threshold) in `api/query_handler.py`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Statistical outlier detection (Mahalanobis).
    *   Component-wise checks.
    *   Adaptive thresholding for norm check.
    *   Comprehensive logging of rejections.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Query Vector Size Limits](./mitigation_strategies/query_vector_size_limits.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Query Vector Size Limits

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Determine Maximum Dimensionality:** Based on index configuration and data.
    2.  **Determine Maximum Size (Bytes):** Based on dimensionality and data type.
    3.  **Implement Checks (Before FAISS calls):**
        *   `if len(vector) > max_dimensionality: reject_vector()`
        *   `if vector.nbytes > max_size_bytes: reject_vector()`
    4.  **Rejection Handling:** Same as Input Validation.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **DoS (Medium Severity):**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in FAISS (Low Severity):**

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Moderate reduction (40-60%).
    *   **Vulnerabilities in FAISS:** Low reduction (10-20%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Dimensionality check (part of Input Validation).
    *   Maximum size check (bytes) in `api/query_handler.py`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No major missing implementations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Index Selection and Configuration (FAISS-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/index_selection_and_configuration__faiss-specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Index Selection and Configuration

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Robust Index Types:**
        *   Prioritize index types with more predictable performance characteristics, like `IndexFlatL2` or `IndexHNSW`, over those with potentially highly variable performance, like `IndexIVF`, *unless* the performance benefits of `IndexIVF` are absolutely necessary and its risks are well-understood.
        *   If using `IndexIVF`, carefully consider the trade-offs between speed, accuracy, and robustness to adversarial inputs or unusual query distributions.
    2.  **Tune Index Parameters:**
        *   For `IndexIVF`, carefully tune the `nlist` (number of clusters) and `nprobe` (number of clusters to search) parameters.  Higher `nprobe` values increase robustness but reduce speed.  Start with conservative values and adjust based on testing.
        *   For `IndexHNSW`, tune the `M` (number of connections per node) and `efSearch` (search effort) parameters.
    3. **Quantization Considerations:**
        * If using Product Quantization (`IndexPQ`) or other quantization methods, be aware that quantization can introduce its own vulnerabilities.  Carefully evaluate the trade-offs between compression, speed, and security.
    4. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the chosen index type and parameters with a variety of inputs, including potentially adversarial or unusual inputs, to assess its robustness.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **DoS (Medium Severity):** Choosing appropriate index types and parameters can mitigate worst-case performance scenarios.
    *   **Data Poisoning (Low to Medium Severity):** Some index types are inherently more resistant to certain types of data poisoning.
    *   **Adversarial Inputs (Low to Medium Severity):** Similar to data poisoning, careful index selection can reduce the impact of adversarial examples.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Moderate reduction (30-60%).
    *   **Data Poisoning:** Low to moderate reduction (20-50%).
    *   **Adversarial Inputs:** Low to moderate reduction (20-50%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The project currently uses `IndexIVFFlat`.  `nlist` and `nprobe` are set to default values.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No systematic evaluation of different index types or parameter tuning has been performed.  The current configuration is likely suboptimal for both performance and security.
    *   No testing with adversarial or unusual inputs has been conducted.

## Mitigation Strategy: [FAISS Version Updates](./mitigation_strategies/faiss_version_updates.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** FAISS Version Updates

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor FAISS Releases:** Check the FAISS GitHub for new releases and security advisories.
    2.  **Test Updates:** Before deploying:
        *   Test in a staging environment.
        *   Verify performance and accuracy.
        *   Run security tests (e.g., fuzzing).
    3.  **Deploy Updates:** After thorough testing.
    4.  **Rollback Plan:** Have a plan to revert to the previous version.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in FAISS (Medium to High Severity):**

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in FAISS:** Highly variable (10-99%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No formal process.
    *   No staging environment.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   All aspects are largely missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Timeouts for FAISS Operations](./mitigation_strategies/timeouts_for_faiss_operations.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Timeouts for FAISS Operations
* **Description:**
    1. **Identify FAISS Calls:** Locate all code sections where FAISS functions (e.g., `index.search()`, `index.add()`) are called.
    2. **Implement Timeouts:** Wrap these calls with timeout mechanisms. This can be done using:
        * **Python's `signal` module (Unix-like systems):**
          ```python
          import signal
          import faiss

          def handler(signum, frame):
              raise TimeoutError("FAISS operation timed out")

          signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, handler)
          signal.alarm(timeout_seconds)  # Set the timeout

          try:
              index.search(query_vectors, k) # FAISS call
          except TimeoutError:
              # Handle the timeout
              pass
          finally:
              signal.alarm(0) # Disable the alarm
          ```
        * **Multiprocessing (More robust, cross-platform):** Run the FAISS operation in a separate process and terminate it if it exceeds the timeout.
        * **Threading with a timeout (Less reliable):** Use Python's threading with a join timeout. This is less reliable than multiprocessing because threads share the same memory space.
    3. **Handle Timeouts:** When a timeout occurs:
        * Log the event.
        * Return an appropriate error to the client.
        * Consider retrying the operation (with a backoff strategy).

* **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    * **DoS (Medium Severity):** Prevents long-running queries from consuming resources indefinitely.
    * **Vulnerabilities in FAISS (Low Severity):** May help mitigate some vulnerabilities that lead to infinite loops or excessive resource consumption.

* **Impact:**
    * **DoS:** Moderate reduction (40-70%).
    * **Vulnerabilities in FAISS:** Low reduction (10-30%).

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * No timeouts are currently implemented for FAISS operations.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * Timeouts need to be implemented for all FAISS calls (`search`, `add`, etc.). The `signal`-based approach is a good starting point for Unix-like systems, but multiprocessing is generally more robust.
