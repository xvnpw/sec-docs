# Attack Surface Analysis for facebookresearch/faiss

## Attack Surface: [1. Malicious Input Vectors (Index Building & Querying)](./attack_surfaces/1__malicious_input_vectors__index_building_&_querying_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft specific input vectors to exploit Faiss's internal algorithms, causing various negative effects.
*   **How Faiss Contributes:** This is *fundamental* to Faiss.  Faiss's core purpose is processing vectors, and its algorithms are the direct target.
*   **Example:** An attacker submits a query vector designed to trigger a division-by-zero or infinite loop within Faiss's distance calculations.  Or, during index building, vectors are crafted to create unbalanced clusters, degrading performance.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Crashing Faiss, exhausting memory, or causing excessive CPU usage.
    *   Information Leakage (Indirect): Revealing index structure or data distribution.
    *   Index Corruption (Rare): Potentially corrupting the index.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (DoS is very likely).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate vector dimensionality, data type, and value ranges (min/max, norms). Reject invalid vectors.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** Use fuzzing tools to generate a wide variety of vectors to test Faiss's robustness. This is *crucial*.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor Faiss's CPU and memory usage. Set limits and alerts.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the rate of index building and querying.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize inputs.

## Attack Surface: [2. Index Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/2__index_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers provide a malicious Faiss index file that, when loaded, exploits vulnerabilities in the deserialization process.
*   **How Faiss Contributes:** Faiss's *own* serialization/deserialization mechanism is the direct attack vector.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a crafted index file that, when loaded by Faiss, triggers a buffer overflow or executes arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE): The attacker gains full control of the server.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Crashing Faiss during loading.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (RCE is a major threat).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Untrusted Sources:** *Never* load Faiss indexes from untrusted sources. This is the *primary* defense.
    *   **Secure Deserialization (If Necessary):** If unavoidable, investigate secure deserialization methods or build a secure wrapper. This is complex.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Load the index in a sandboxed environment.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate loaded index.

## Attack Surface: [3. Data Poisoning (Index Modification)](./attack_surfaces/3__data_poisoning__index_modification_.md)

*   **Description:** If index modification is allowed, attackers with sufficient privileges can add/modify vectors to manipulate search results.
*   **How Faiss Contributes:** Faiss's APIs for adding, removing, and updating vectors are the direct means of attack.
*   **Example:** An attacker adds many vectors similar to a specific item to artificially boost its ranking in a recommendation system.
*   **Impact:** Biased/Incorrect Results: Search results are skewed.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (impact depends on the application; can be critical).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Access Control:** Implement robust authentication and authorization. Follow the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Auditing:** Log all index modification operations.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate all vectors added to the index.

## Attack Surface: [4. Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (Faiss-Specific Aspects)](./attack_surfaces/4__denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion__faiss-specific_aspects_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers overwhelm Faiss, causing resource exhaustion. This focuses on aspects *directly* related to Faiss's functionality.
*   **How Faiss Contributes:** Faiss's processing of queries and its index management consume resources.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Query Flooding (Targeting Faiss):** Sending a massive number of *valid but computationally expensive* Faiss queries.  This is distinct from a generic network flood.
    *   **Index Bloating (If Modification Allowed):** Adding a huge number of vectors to exhaust memory/disk *used by Faiss*.
*   **Impact:** The Faiss-based service becomes unavailable.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting (Faiss-Specific):** Limit the rate of *Faiss queries*, potentially with different limits based on query complexity.
    *   **Resource Monitoring (Faiss-Specific):** Monitor Faiss's *internal* resource usage (memory allocated to the index, etc.).
    *   **Limit Index Size (If Modification Allowed):** Set limits on the total index size or the number of vectors.
    *   **Data Validation (If Modification Allowed):** Validate incoming vectors before adding them.
