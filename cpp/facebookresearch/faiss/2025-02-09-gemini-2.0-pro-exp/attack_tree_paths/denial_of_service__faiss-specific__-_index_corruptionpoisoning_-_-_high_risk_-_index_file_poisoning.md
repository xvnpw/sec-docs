# Deep Analysis: FAISS Index File Poisoning

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**  To thoroughly analyze the "Index File Poisoning" attack path within the broader "Denial of Service (FAISS-Specific) - Index Corruption/Poisoning" attack tree.  This analysis aims to identify specific vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques, and practical mitigation strategies beyond the high-level overview provided in the initial attack tree.  We will focus on actionable recommendations for the development team.

**Scope:**

*   **Target Application:**  Any application utilizing the FAISS library (https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) for similarity search, particularly those that allow external input to influence the index building or updating process.  This includes applications where users can upload data, provide search queries that modify the index, or interact with APIs that affect index content.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Specifically, "Index File Poisoning," where an attacker manipulates the index data *during the building or updating process* to cause a denial of service.  We will *not* focus on attacks that require direct file system access after the index is built (that would be a separate attack path).
*   **FAISS Index Types:**  We will consider common FAISS index types, including `IndexFlatL2`, `IndexIVFFlat`, `IndexHNSW`, and `IndexPQ`, as the specific vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques may vary.
*   **Exclusion:** Attacks requiring physical access to the server or pre-existing administrative privileges are out of scope.  We are focusing on vulnerabilities exploitable through the application's intended interface.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Review FAISS documentation, source code (where necessary and feasible), known issues, and security research papers to identify potential vulnerabilities related to index building and updating.
2.  **Exploitation Scenario Development:**  Develop concrete scenarios demonstrating how an attacker could exploit identified vulnerabilities to poison the index.  This will include crafting specific malicious input vectors.
3.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**  Expand upon the initial mitigation suggestions, providing detailed, actionable recommendations for the development team, including code examples and configuration best practices.
4.  **Detection Technique Analysis:**  Explore methods for detecting index poisoning, both proactively (during index building) and reactively (after the index is built).
5.  **Risk Assessment:** Re-evaluate the likelihood and impact of the attack based on the deeper analysis.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Index File Poisoning

### 2.1 Vulnerability Research

FAISS, while highly optimized, is fundamentally a library that processes numerical data.  Its security relies heavily on the application using it to properly sanitize and validate input.  Here are key areas of concern:

*   **Untrusted Input:** The primary vulnerability is the acceptance of untrusted input vectors during index building or updating.  This could occur through:
    *   **User-Uploaded Data:**  Applications allowing users to upload datasets for indexing.
    *   **API Endpoints:**  APIs that accept vectors for adding to the index.
    *   **Dynamic Index Updates:**  Systems that update the index based on user queries or other dynamic data.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:**  Insufficient or absent validation of input vector characteristics:
    *   **Dimensionality Mismatch:**  Adding vectors with incorrect dimensionality can corrupt the index.  FAISS *may* throw an error in some cases, but consistent behavior isn't guaranteed across all index types.
    *   **Data Type Errors:**  Providing data of the wrong type (e.g., integers when floats are expected) can lead to crashes or incorrect results.
    *   **NaN/Inf Values:**  Including NaN (Not a Number) or Inf (Infinity) values in vectors can disrupt calculations and potentially lead to crashes or hangs, especially in certain index types.
    *   **Out-of-Range Values:**  Extremely large or small values, even if technically valid floats, can cause numerical instability and degrade performance.
    *   **Zero Vectors:** Adding many zero vectors can degrade the performance of some index types, particularly those that rely on clustering.
    *   **Highly Similar/Duplicate Vectors:** A large number of identical or near-identical vectors can lead to unbalanced clusters and poor performance, especially in IVF-based indexes.
*   **Index-Specific Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **`IndexIVFFlat`:**  Vulnerable to attacks that manipulate cluster centroids by adding carefully crafted vectors to specific clusters.  This can lead to highly unbalanced clusters and slow search times.
    *   **`IndexHNSW`:**  While generally robust, adding a large number of vectors that are very close to existing vectors can increase the graph's density and degrade performance.
    *   **`IndexPQ`:**  Product Quantization indexes can be sensitive to the distribution of input data.  Adding vectors that significantly skew the codebook can lead to poor quantization and reduced search accuracy.
    * **`IndexLSH`**: Adding vectors that cause hash collisions.

### 2.2 Exploitation Scenario Development

**Scenario 1: Dimensionality Mismatch (IndexIVFFlat)**

1.  **Application Setup:** An application uses `IndexIVFFlat` with a dimensionality of 128.  It allows users to upload datasets of vectors to be added to the index.
2.  **Attacker Action:** The attacker uploads a dataset containing vectors with a dimensionality of 129 (or any value other than 128).
3.  **Exploitation:**  The application, lacking proper dimensionality checks, attempts to add these vectors to the index.  This could result in:
    *   **Immediate Crash:** FAISS might throw an exception, causing the application to crash.
    *   **Index Corruption:**  The index might become corrupted, leading to incorrect search results or future crashes.
    *   **Memory Issues:**  The attempt to handle mismatched dimensions could lead to memory allocation errors or buffer overflows.

**Scenario 2: NaN/Inf Injection (IndexFlatL2)**

1.  **Application Setup:** An application uses `IndexFlatL2` and exposes an API endpoint for adding new vectors to the index.
2.  **Attacker Action:** The attacker sends a request to the API endpoint with a vector containing NaN or Inf values (e.g., `[1.0, 2.0, NaN, 4.0, ...]`).
3.  **Exploitation:**  FAISS's distance calculations (L2 distance) will involve NaN or Inf, leading to:
    *   **NaN Results:**  All subsequent searches involving this vector will likely return NaN distances, effectively making the vector (and potentially other vectors) unreachable.
    *   **Potential Crashes:**  Depending on how the application handles NaN results, it might crash or exhibit unexpected behavior.

**Scenario 3: Cluster Manipulation (IndexIVFFlat)**

1.  **Application Setup:**  An application uses `IndexIVFFlat` with a relatively small number of clusters (e.g., 10).  It allows users to upload data that is added to the index.
2.  **Attacker Action:** The attacker analyzes the existing data distribution (if possible) or makes educated guesses about the cluster centroids.  They then craft a large number of vectors that are very close to one specific centroid.
3.  **Exploitation:**  Adding these vectors will significantly skew the distribution of vectors across clusters, making one cluster much larger than the others.  This will:
    *   **Degrade Search Performance:**  Searches that fall within the overloaded cluster will be much slower, as FAISS needs to scan a larger number of vectors.
    *   **Potentially Unbalanced Index:**  The index structure may become unbalanced, leading to further performance degradation.

### 2.3 Mitigation Strategy Refinement

The initial mitigations were a good starting point.  Here's a more detailed and actionable breakdown:

1.  **Strict Input Validation (Mandatory):**

    *   **Dimensionality Check:**  Before adding *any* vector, verify that its dimensionality matches the index's expected dimensionality.  This is a fundamental check.
        ```python
        # Example (Python)
        import faiss
        import numpy as np

        def add_vector_safely(index, vector):
            vector = np.array(vector, dtype=np.float32)  # Enforce data type
            if vector.ndim != 1:
                raise ValueError("Input vector must be 1-dimensional")
            if vector.shape[0] != index.d:
                raise ValueError(f"Input vector dimensionality ({vector.shape[0]}) does not match index dimensionality ({index.d})")
            if not np.isfinite(vector).all():
                raise ValueError("Input vector contains NaN or Inf values")
            # Add further checks as needed (e.g., range checks)
            index.add(vector.reshape(1, -1)) #FAISS expects 2D array for adding

        # Example Usage
        index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(128)  # Index with dimensionality 128
        try:
            add_vector_safely(index, [1.0] * 128)  # Valid
            add_vector_safely(index, [1.0] * 129)  # Raises ValueError
            add_vector_safely(index, [1.0, float('NaN')] + [0.0] * 126) # Raises ValueError
        except ValueError as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")
        ```

    *   **Data Type Enforcement:**  Ensure that the input vector's data type matches the index's expected data type (usually `float32`).  Use explicit type casting if necessary.

    *   **NaN/Inf Check:**  Explicitly check for and reject vectors containing NaN or Inf values.  The `np.isfinite()` function in NumPy is efficient for this.

    *   **Range Check (Context-Dependent):**  If the application has domain-specific knowledge about the expected range of vector values, implement checks to reject outliers.  For example, if vectors represent pixel intensities (0-255), reject values outside this range.

    *   **Zero Vector Handling (Optional):**  Consider limiting the number of zero vectors added to the index, or handle them specially, depending on the index type and application requirements.

    *   **Duplicate/Near-Duplicate Handling (Optional):**  Implement mechanisms to detect and handle (e.g., reject, merge, or count) duplicate or near-duplicate vectors, especially for IVF-based indexes. This can be computationally expensive, so consider using approximate methods if necessary.

2.  **Input Filtering (Recommended):**

    *   **Statistical Outlier Detection:**  Implement statistical methods (e.g., z-score, IQR) to detect and reject vectors that deviate significantly from the expected distribution of the data.  This requires maintaining statistics about the existing data.
    *   **Density-Based Filtering:**  Use techniques like DBSCAN or OPTICS to identify and reject vectors that fall in low-density regions of the data space, as these might be malicious outliers.

3.  **Separate, Trusted Process (Strongly Recommended):**

    *   **Isolate Index Building:**  Create a separate process or service responsible for building and updating the FAISS index.  This process should have restricted access and be isolated from the main application.
    *   **Message Queue:**  Use a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) to communicate between the main application and the index building process.  The main application sends requests to add vectors, and the index building process retrieves these requests, validates them, and adds them to the index.
    *   **Sandboxing:**  Consider running the index building process in a sandboxed environment (e.g., Docker container) to further limit its access to system resources.

4.  **Regular Auditing (Recommended):**

    *   **Code Reviews:**  Regularly review the code responsible for index building and updating, paying close attention to input validation and error handling.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities that might be missed during code reviews.
    *   **Automated Security Scans:** Use static and dynamic analysis tools to automatically scan the codebase for vulnerabilities.

5.  **FAISS Configuration Best Practices:**

    *   **Choose the Right Index Type:** Select the FAISS index type that best suits the application's needs and data characteristics.  Consider the trade-offs between accuracy, speed, and memory usage.
    *   **Tune Index Parameters:**  Carefully tune the index parameters (e.g., number of clusters for `IndexIVFFlat`, number of neighbors for `IndexHNSW`) to optimize performance and robustness.
    * **Use add_with_ids, if possible:** If you are using add_with_ids, you can remove malicious vectors by their ids.

### 2.4 Detection Technique Analysis

Detecting index poisoning can be challenging, but here are some approaches:

*   **Proactive Detection (During Index Building):**
    *   **Input Validation Logs:**  Log all rejected vectors and the reasons for rejection.  This provides an audit trail and can help identify attack attempts.
    *   **Statistical Monitoring:**  Monitor the distribution of input vectors and trigger alerts if significant deviations are detected.
    *   **Index Build Time Monitoring:** Monitor the time taken to build or update the index.  Sudden increases in build time could indicate an attack.

*   **Reactive Detection (After Index Building):**
    *   **Performance Monitoring:**  Monitor search performance (latency, throughput).  Significant degradation could indicate index poisoning.
    *   **Index Structure Analysis:**  For some index types (e.g., `IndexIVFFlat`), it's possible to examine the index structure (e.g., cluster sizes, centroid locations) to detect anomalies.  This requires specialized tools and knowledge of FAISS internals.
    *   **Comparison with a Known Good Index:**  If a known good version of the index exists, compare it to the current index to identify differences. This is the most reliable method, but it requires maintaining a "golden" copy of the index.
    *   **Search Result Analysis:**  Monitor search results for unexpected patterns, such as a large number of NaN distances or consistently poor results for certain queries.
    * **Check for empty clusters:** If you are using IVF index, check for empty clusters.

### 2.5 Risk Assessment (Re-evaluated)

*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High.  The likelihood has increased because the deep analysis revealed several practical exploitation scenarios, especially in applications with insufficient input validation. The prevalence of user-generated content and API-driven interactions increases the attack surface.
*   **Impact:** High.  Successful index poisoning can render the similarity search functionality unusable, leading to a complete denial of service for that aspect of the application.
*   **Effort:** Medium.  Crafting malicious vectors requires some understanding of FAISS, but readily available tools and libraries (like NumPy) simplify the process.  The main effort lies in identifying the application's vulnerabilities and crafting input that exploits them.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to Advanced. While basic attacks (like NaN injection) are relatively simple, more sophisticated attacks (like cluster manipulation) require a deeper understanding of FAISS and the target application.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High. Proactive detection through rigorous input validation is the most effective approach. Reactive detection is more challenging and may require specialized tools and expertise.

## 3. Conclusion

Index file poisoning is a serious threat to applications using FAISS.  The most crucial mitigation is **strict and comprehensive input validation**.  A layered approach, combining input validation, filtering, a separate index building process, and regular auditing, provides the best defense.  The development team should prioritize implementing the detailed mitigation strategies outlined above, focusing on preventing untrusted data from ever reaching the FAISS index building or updating logic. Continuous monitoring and proactive detection are essential for identifying and responding to potential attacks.
