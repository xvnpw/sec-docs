## Threat Model: Compromising Application Using Faiss - High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Objective:** Compromise application that uses the Faiss library by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within Faiss itself.

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to or manipulate the data indexed and managed by Faiss, potentially leading to broader application compromise.

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors:**

**High-Risk Paths:**

*   **Exploit Faiss Library Vulnerabilities -> Leverage Known CVEs [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies that the application is using an outdated version of the Faiss library with known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). They then leverage publicly available exploit code or techniques to target these specific vulnerabilities.
    *   **Why High-Risk:**
        *   **Medium Likelihood:**  Many applications may not be diligent in immediately updating dependencies, leaving them vulnerable to known flaws. Vulnerability scanners can easily identify outdated libraries.
        *   **High Impact:**  Depending on the specific CVE, successful exploitation can lead to severe consequences such as remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain complete control of the application server.
        *   **Low Effort:** Exploits for known CVEs are often readily available, requiring less effort for the attacker.
        *   **Medium Skill Level:** While understanding the exploit is beneficial, pre-built exploits lower the skill barrier.
        *   **Low Detection Difficulty:** Vulnerability scanners can detect these outdated libraries, and intrusion detection systems might flag known exploit patterns.

*   **Supply Chain Attack -> Compromise Faiss Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker compromises a dependency of the Faiss library. This could involve injecting malicious code into the dependency's repository, build process, or distribution channels. When the application builds or updates its dependencies, the malicious code from the compromised dependency is included.
    *   **Why High-Risk:**
        *   **Low Likelihood:** Directly compromising a well-maintained dependency can be challenging.
        *   **High Impact:**  A successful supply chain attack can introduce malicious code directly into the application's core functionality, potentially leading to data breaches, backdoors, or complete system compromise.
        *   **High Effort:**  Requires significant effort to compromise a legitimate software project's infrastructure.
        *   **High Skill Level:** Requires advanced knowledge of software development, build processes, and security.
        *   **High Detection Difficulty:**  Malicious code injected through dependencies can be difficult to detect without thorough code reviews and dependency integrity checks.

**Critical Nodes:**

*   **Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if applicable) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If the application deserializes data that is then used by Faiss (e.g., to create index structures or process search queries), an attacker can craft malicious serialized data. When this data is deserialized, it can trigger arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **Why Critical:**
        *   **High Impact:** Successful exploitation of deserialization vulnerabilities often leads to remote code execution, granting the attacker complete control over the application server.

*   **Trigger Buffer Overflows (if applicable) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts malicious search queries or input data that exceed the allocated buffer size in Faiss's code. This can overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially leading to application crashes or, more critically, allowing the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Why Critical:**
        *   **High Impact:** Successful buffer overflow exploitation can result in remote code execution, allowing the attacker to take control of the application.

*   **Inject Malicious Index File [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the storage location of the Faiss index file. They then replace the legitimate index file with a malicious one that they have crafted. This malicious index could contain backdoors, be designed to cause errors, or manipulate search results for malicious purposes.
    *   **Why Critical:**
        *   **High Impact:**  Replacing the index allows the attacker to completely control the data used by the application's search functionality. This can lead to the serving of incorrect or malicious information, data exfiltration, or denial of service.

*   **Compromise Faiss Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]:** (Also part of the Supply Chain Attack High-Risk Path)
    *   **Attack Vector:** As described in the High-Risk Path, compromising a Faiss dependency introduces malicious code into the application.
    *   **Why Critical:**
        *   **High Impact:**  The injected malicious code can have a wide range of severe consequences, including data breaches, backdoors, and complete system compromise, as it becomes an integral part of the application's functionality.
