# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for facebookresearch/faiss

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Vector Dimension Validation](./mitigation_strategies/input_vector_dimension_validation.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify all points in your application code where vector data is passed to Faiss library functions (e.g., `index.add()`, `index.search()`, `index.reconstruct()`).
    *   Step 2: Determine the expected vector dimension for your Faiss index. This dimension is defined when you create the index (e.g., `faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)`).
    *   Step 3: Before passing any vector to a Faiss function, retrieve the dimension of the input vector.  This can be done by checking the length of the vector array or using a property of your vector data structure.
    *   Step 4: Compare the input vector's dimension with the expected dimension of the Faiss index.
    *   Step 5: If the dimensions do not match, reject the input vector. Implement error handling to log the invalid input and prevent the Faiss operation.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Unexpected Behavior/Crashes: Severity - High.  Mismatched dimensions can lead to crashes or unpredictable behavior within Faiss, potentially causing application downtime or incorrect results.
        *   Potential Exploitation (Memory Corruption): Severity - Medium. In some scenarios, providing unexpected input dimensions might trigger memory corruption vulnerabilities within the native Faiss library.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unexpected Behavior/Crashes: High reduction. Directly prevents crashes and unexpected behavior caused by dimension mismatches in Faiss.
        *   Potential Exploitation (Memory Corruption): Medium reduction. Reduces the attack surface by preventing potentially exploitable input conditions for Faiss.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Input validation exists in the API layer for basic data types, but specific dimension validation against the Faiss index is missing at the Faiss interaction level.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Dimension validation logic needs to be added specifically within the vector processing module, immediately before calls to Faiss library functions. This validation must explicitly check against the expected dimension of the Faiss index being used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Numerical Input Sanitization for Vector Data](./mitigation_strategies/numerical_input_sanitization_for_vector_data.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify the source of your vector data that will be used with Faiss. Is it derived from user input or external sources?
    *   Step 2: Define acceptable ranges and data types for the numerical values within your vectors that are compatible with Faiss's numerical processing.
    *   Step 3: Before using vector data with Faiss, iterate through each numerical value in the vector.
    *   Step 4: Validate each value against your defined acceptable ranges and data types, ensuring compatibility with Faiss's expected numerical inputs.
    *   Step 5: If a value is outside the acceptable range or of an incorrect data type for Faiss, sanitize it. Sanitization methods include:
        *   Clamping:  If a value is outside the range, set it to the nearest boundary value.
        *   Normalization: If values are expected to be normalized for Faiss, re-normalize if necessary.
        *   Rejection: If invalid values are critical for Faiss processing, reject the entire vector and handle it as an error before passing to Faiss.
    *   Step 6: Log any sanitized or rejected values related to Faiss input for monitoring.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Numerical Instability/Incorrect Faiss Results: Severity - Medium. Extreme or invalid numerical values can lead to numerical instability in Faiss algorithms, resulting in incorrect search results or index corruption within Faiss.
        *   Potential for Exploitation (Algorithm Manipulation in Faiss): Severity - Low. In specific scenarios, crafted numerical inputs might manipulate Faiss algorithms, though less likely in typical use.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Numerical Instability/Incorrect Faiss Results: Medium reduction. Reduces the risk of incorrect Faiss results and instability caused by invalid numerical inputs to Faiss.
        *   Potential for Exploitation (Algorithm Manipulation in Faiss): Low reduction. Minimally reduces the risk of algorithm manipulation within Faiss through numerical inputs.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Basic data type validation exists for input vectors before processing, but range validation and sanitization specifically for Faiss input are not implemented.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Implement range validation and sanitization logic within the vector processing module, right before passing vectors to Faiss. Define ranges based on Faiss's numerical stability requirements and expected data distribution.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Faiss Library Version Management and Regular Updates](./mitigation_strategies/faiss_library_version_management_and_regular_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Utilize a dependency management system for your project (e.g., `pipenv`, `poetry`, `requirements.txt`).
    *   Step 2: Pin the Faiss library version in your dependency file to ensure consistent builds and prevent unintended automatic updates of Faiss. Specify the exact version number (e.g., `faiss-cpu==1.7.3`).
    *   Step 3: Regularly monitor the Faiss GitHub repository ([https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)) and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities and new Faiss releases.
    *   Step 4: When a new stable Faiss version is released or a security vulnerability in Faiss is announced, evaluate the changes and potential impact on your application's Faiss usage.
    *   Step 5: Update the Faiss version in your dependency file to the new version.
    *   Step 6: Thoroughly test your application's Faiss integration after updating to ensure compatibility and no regressions or new issues related to Faiss are introduced. Include security testing focused on Faiss functionalities.
    *   Step 7: Document the Faiss version used in your project and the update history for traceability.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Known Faiss Vulnerabilities: Severity - High. Using outdated Faiss versions can expose your application to known security vulnerabilities within Faiss that are patched in newer versions.
        *   Faiss Software Instability/Bugs: Severity - Medium. Older Faiss versions may contain bugs or stability issues within Faiss that are resolved in newer releases.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Known Faiss Vulnerabilities: High reduction. Directly mitigates the risk of exploiting known Faiss vulnerabilities by keeping the library up-to-date.
        *   Faiss Software Instability/Bugs: Medium reduction. Reduces the likelihood of encountering bugs and instability present in older Faiss versions.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Dependency management is used, but the Faiss version is not strictly pinned, potentially leading to automatic updates.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Pin the Faiss library version in `requirements.txt`. Establish a process for regularly checking for Faiss updates and performing controlled updates with thorough testing of Faiss integration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits for Faiss Operations](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_for_faiss_operations.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify the Faiss operations in your application that are resource-intensive (e.g., index building, large-scale searches).
    *   Step 2: Determine the context in which these Faiss operations are executed.
    *   Step 3: Implement resource limits (CPU and memory) specifically for the processes or threads executing Faiss operations. Use OS-level tools, containerization platforms, or process management libraries to control resources allocated to Faiss.
    *   Step 4: Set appropriate resource limits for Faiss based on system capacity and expected resource consumption of Faiss operations. Monitor Faiss resource usage to fine-tune these limits.
    *   Step 5: Implement error handling for resource limit violations during Faiss operations. If a Faiss operation exceeds limits, gracefully terminate it, log the event, and handle the error appropriately within the application.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) via Faiss Resource Exhaustion: Severity - High. Uncontrolled Faiss operations can consume excessive resources (CPU, memory), leading to resource exhaustion and DoS specifically due to Faiss usage.
        *   Resource Starvation due to Faiss: Severity - Medium. Resource-intensive Faiss operations can starve other processes of resources, impacting application performance and stability due to Faiss load.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) via Faiss Resource Exhaustion: High reduction. Limits the impact of resource exhaustion attacks targeting Faiss by preventing uncontrolled resource consumption by Faiss.
        *   Resource Starvation due to Faiss: Medium reduction. Mitigates resource starvation caused by Faiss operations by ensuring resource limits for Faiss processes.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Basic server-level resource limits are in place, but not specifically tailored or enforced for individual Faiss operations or processes.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Implement more granular resource limits specifically for processes or containers executing Faiss operations. This could involve container resource limits or process-level resource control focused on Faiss execution.
