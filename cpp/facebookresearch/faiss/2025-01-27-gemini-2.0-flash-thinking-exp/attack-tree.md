## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Faiss Library Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_faiss_library_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **1.1. Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities (C/C++ Nature)**
    *   **1.1.1.1. Provide Maliciously Crafted Input Data during Index Creation (Critical Node)**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides maliciously crafted input data to the application during the index creation process. This data is designed to exploit buffer overflow vulnerabilities within Faiss's indexing algorithms due to its C/C++ implementation.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
            *   **Code Execution:** The attacker could potentially overwrite memory to inject and execute arbitrary code on the server.
            *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The overflow could cause the application or Faiss library to crash, leading to service disruption.
            *   **Data Corruption:** Memory corruption can lead to unpredictable behavior and data corruption within the application's memory space.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data before it is used for Faiss index creation.
            *   Utilize safe memory handling practices in the application's Faiss integration code.
            *   Consider using memory-safe languages or wrappers for the integration layer if feasible.

    *   **1.1.2.1. Craft Specific Queries to Trigger Overflow during Search (Critical Node)**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts specific search queries intended to trigger heap overflow vulnerabilities during Faiss search operations. This could involve manipulating query parameters or exploiting weaknesses in Faiss's search algorithms.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Similar to buffer overflows, successful heap overflow exploitation can result in:
            *   **Code Execution:**  Gaining control to execute arbitrary code.
            *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Causing crashes and service disruption.
            *   **Data Corruption:**  Leading to unpredictable application behavior and data integrity issues.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Review Faiss search algorithms and the application's query construction logic for potential overflow conditions.
            *   Implement resource limits to prevent excessive memory consumption during search operations.
            *   Monitor memory usage during search operations to detect anomalies.

*   **1.2. Deserialization Vulnerabilities (Index Loading)**
    *   **1.2.1.1. Inject Malicious Code or Data into Index File (Critical Node)**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious Faiss index file. This file is designed to exploit vulnerabilities during the index loading (deserialization) process within the application. The malicious index file could contain embedded code or data that triggers a vulnerability when Faiss attempts to load it.
        *   **Potential Impact:** This is a critical vulnerability as successful exploitation can lead to:
            *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The attacker can achieve RCE by embedding malicious code within the index file that gets executed when the application loads the index. This allows for full system compromise.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Implement strong integrity checks for loaded index files. Use checksums or digital signatures to verify the authenticity and integrity of index files before loading.
            *   Restrict the sources of index files to trusted locations only.
            *   If possible, sanitize or validate the content of index files before loading (though this is complex due to the binary nature of indexes).

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/2__denial_of_service__dos__attacks.md)

*   **2.2.2.1. Send a Flood of Complex or Resource-Intensive Search Queries (Critical Node)**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker floods the application with a large volume of complex or resource-intensive search queries. These queries are designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) on the server running the application and Faiss.
    *   **Potential Impact:** This attack aims to cause:
            *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Overwhelming the server resources, making the application unresponsive and unavailable to legitimate users.
            *   **Resource Exhaustion:**  Depleting server resources, potentially impacting other services running on the same infrastructure.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Implement rate limiting on incoming search queries to restrict the number of requests from a single source within a given time frame.
            *   Implement query complexity limits to prevent excessively resource-intensive queries.
            *   Monitor resource usage during search operations and implement safeguards against resource spikes.
            *   Consider using caching mechanisms to reduce the load on Faiss for frequently accessed queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Insecure API Usage](./attack_tree_paths/3__insecure_api_usage.md)

*   **3.1.1.1. Allow Direct Access to Faiss Indexing or Search Functions without Proper Authorization (Critical Node)**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The application's API design mistakenly exposes Faiss's indexing or search functionalities directly to untrusted users without proper authentication and authorization controls. This means anyone can directly interact with the Faiss library through the application's API.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Exposing the raw Faiss API can lead to:
            *   **Full Control over Faiss Functionality:** Attackers can directly manipulate Faiss indexes, perform arbitrary searches, and potentially trigger vulnerabilities.
            *   **Data Breaches:** Unauthorized access to search functionality could lead to information disclosure if sensitive data is indexed.
            *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can misuse the exposed API to launch DoS attacks by sending resource-intensive indexing or search requests.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Never expose the raw Faiss API directly to untrusted users.
            *   Implement a secure application layer with proper authentication and authorization controls to mediate access to Faiss functionality.
            *   Design the application API based on the principle of least privilege, only exposing the necessary functionalities required for legitimate use cases.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Dependencies and Third-Party Libraries (Indirect)](./attack_tree_paths/4__dependencies_and_third-party_libraries__indirect_.md)

*   **4.1. Vulnerabilities in Faiss Dependencies (e.g., BLAS, LAPACK, etc.)**
    *   **4.1.1. Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries**
        *   **4.1.1.1. Use Outdated or Vulnerable Versions of Faiss Dependencies (Critical Node)**
            *   **Attack Vector:** The application uses outdated versions of Faiss's dependencies (like BLAS, LAPACK, etc.). These outdated dependencies may contain known security vulnerabilities that have been publicly disclosed and potentially have readily available exploits.
            *   **Potential Impact:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in dependencies can have severe consequences, including:
                *   **Code Execution:**  Vulnerabilities in dependencies, especially in native libraries like BLAS/LAPACK, can often lead to code execution.
                *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Some vulnerabilities might cause crashes or resource exhaustion.
                *   **Data Breaches:** Depending on the vulnerability, data breaches or information disclosure might be possible.
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Implement a robust dependency management process.
                *   Regularly update Faiss and all its dependencies to the latest versions.
                *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for Faiss and its dependencies.
                *   Use dependency scanning tools to automatically identify outdated and vulnerable dependencies in the project.
