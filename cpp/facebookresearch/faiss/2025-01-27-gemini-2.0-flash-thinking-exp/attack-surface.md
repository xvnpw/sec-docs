# Attack Surface Analysis for facebookresearch/faiss

## Attack Surface: [Native Code Execution Vulnerabilities (Memory Corruption)](./attack_surfaces/native_code_execution_vulnerabilities__memory_corruption_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from memory management issues in Faiss's C++ code, such as buffer overflows, use-after-free, and other memory corruption bugs.
    *   **Faiss Contribution:** Faiss's core implementation in C++ makes it inherently susceptible to memory safety issues if not carefully coded and handled. Processing untrusted input data through Faiss functions can trigger these vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A specially crafted input vector with an excessively large dimension is provided to a Faiss indexing function. This triggers a buffer overflow within Faiss's memory allocation routines, allowing an attacker to overwrite critical memory regions and potentially gain control of the execution flow.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server or system running the application. This can lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for all data passed to Faiss, including vector dimensions, data types, and index parameters. Enforce strict size limits and format checks.
        *   **Memory Safety Tools:** Utilize memory safety tools like AddressSanitizer (ASan) and MemorySanitizer (MSan) during development and testing to proactively detect memory errors within Faiss integration.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Faiss updated to the latest stable version. Security patches for memory safety vulnerabilities are often included in updates.
        *   **Code Audits:** Conduct security-focused code audits of the application's Faiss integration, paying close attention to how input data is handled and passed to Faiss functions.

## Attack Surface: [Input Data Handling and Parsing (Malformed Input Exploitation)](./attack_surfaces/input_data_handling_and_parsing__malformed_input_exploitation_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from Faiss's improper handling of malformed, unexpected, or maliciously crafted input data, leading to exploitable conditions.
    *   **Faiss Contribution:** Faiss must parse and process various input types, including vectors, index parameters, and query data. Insufficient validation within Faiss can lead to vulnerabilities when processing malicious input.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides an index parameter string that is not properly validated by Faiss. This malformed parameter string triggers an integer overflow within Faiss's internal configuration parsing logic, leading to memory corruption or unexpected behavior that can be further exploited.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to resource exhaustion or crashes, potential for memory corruption and code execution depending on the specific vulnerability triggered by malformed input.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (Critical if memory corruption and code execution are possible)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement comprehensive input validation for all data provided to Faiss. Define and enforce valid ranges, formats, and allowed values for all input parameters and data structures.
        *   **Robust Error Handling:** Ensure Faiss integration includes robust error handling to gracefully manage invalid input and prevent crashes or exploitable states.
        *   **Fuzzing Faiss Input:** Employ fuzzing techniques specifically targeting Faiss's input parsing and handling routines to discover vulnerabilities related to malformed or unexpected input.

## Attack Surface: [Serialization and Deserialization of Indexes (Malicious Index Loading)](./attack_surfaces/serialization_and_deserialization_of_indexes__malicious_index_loading_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities related to the process of loading Faiss indexes from files, specifically when loading indexes from untrusted or potentially malicious sources.
    *   **Faiss Contribution:** Faiss provides functionality to serialize and deserialize index data. Loading a maliciously crafted Faiss index file can exploit vulnerabilities in Faiss's index loading code.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious Faiss index file containing carefully designed data structures that exploit vulnerabilities in Faiss's index loading routines. When an application loads this malicious index file, it triggers a buffer overflow or other memory corruption vulnerability within Faiss, leading to code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, Denial of Service, potential for data corruption if the malicious index manipulates the application's state.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Trusted Index Sources:**  **Crucially**, only load Faiss indexes from highly trusted and verified sources. Avoid loading indexes from user uploads or external, untrusted storage unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
        *   **Index Integrity Checks:** Implement strong integrity checks (e.g., cryptographic checksums or digital signatures) on Faiss index files to verify their authenticity and detect tampering before loading.
        *   **Secure Deserialization Environment:** If loading indexes from potentially less trusted sources is unavoidable, consider sandboxing or isolating the index deserialization process to limit the potential impact of vulnerabilities.
        *   **Format Validation during Load:** Implement validation of the index file format and internal structures during the loading process to detect and reject potentially malicious or malformed index files before they are fully processed by Faiss.

## Attack Surface: [Algorithmic Complexity Attacks (Faiss Algorithm Specific DoS)](./attack_surfaces/algorithmic_complexity_attacks__faiss_algorithm_specific_dos_.md)

*   **Description:** Denial of Service attacks that exploit the computational complexity of specific Faiss algorithms by providing input that triggers worst-case performance scenarios within Faiss itself.
    *   **Faiss Contribution:** Certain Faiss algorithms, particularly search and indexing algorithms, can have varying performance characteristics depending on the input data distribution and properties. Maliciously crafted input can trigger computationally expensive operations within Faiss.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts query vectors that are specifically designed to trigger the worst-case search performance for the chosen Faiss index type and search parameters. Repeatedly sending these crafted queries can overload the server's CPU and memory resources due to inefficient Faiss operations, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Performance Degradation, Resource Exhaustion, making the application unresponsive or unavailable.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Query Analysis and Limits:** Analyze typical query patterns and implement limits on query complexity or execution time for Faiss operations. Detect and reject overly complex or resource-intensive queries.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints that utilize Faiss search or indexing functionalities to prevent excessive requests and mitigate DoS attempts.
        *   **Resource Monitoring and Throttling:** Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) during Faiss operations. Implement throttling or circuit-breaker mechanisms to limit the impact of resource-intensive queries and prevent cascading failures.
        *   **Algorithm and Index Selection:** Carefully choose Faiss algorithms and index types that are less susceptible to algorithmic complexity attacks for the specific application use case and expected data characteristics. Consider trade-offs between performance and worst-case complexity.
