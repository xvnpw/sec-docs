# Threat Model Analysis for facebookresearch/faiss

## Threat: [Data Leakage through Index Files](./threats/data_leakage_through_index_files.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the storage location of Faiss index files. They might exploit weak access controls on the file system or cloud storage where the indexes are stored. Once accessed, they can download and analyze these files, potentially using reverse engineering techniques to extract sensitive information represented by the vector embeddings.

**Impact:** Confidential data embedded in the vector representations is exposed, leading to privacy violations, intellectual property theft, or other sensitive information breaches.

**Affected Faiss Component:** Index files (created and loaded by functions like `faiss.write_index`, `faiss.read_index`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong access controls on the storage location of Faiss index files.
* Encrypt index files at rest using appropriate encryption methods.
* Avoid storing highly sensitive data directly in a format easily reconstructible from the vector embeddings. Consider using anonymization or differential privacy techniques before embedding.

## Threat: [Index Poisoning](./threats/index_poisoning.md)

**Description:** An attacker with write access to the index file storage modifies or replaces existing index files with malicious or corrupted data. This could be achieved through compromised credentials, vulnerabilities in the application's file handling logic interacting with the index storage, or supply chain attacks targeting the index creation or deployment process. Upon loading the poisoned index, the application will operate on tampered data, leading to incorrect search results.

**Impact:** The application returns inaccurate or biased search results, potentially leading to incorrect decisions, flawed recommendations, or manipulation of downstream processes that rely on the search results.

**Affected Faiss Component:** Index files (read by functions like `faiss.read_index`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict access controls and authentication for any process that can write or modify Faiss index files.
* Use file integrity monitoring tools to detect unauthorized modifications to index files.
* Implement checksums or digital signatures for index files to verify their integrity before loading.
* Secure the storage location of index files and restrict write access.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Underlying Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Faiss relies on other libraries (e.g., BLAS, LAPACK). Critical vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited by an attacker if they can trigger specific code paths within Faiss that utilize the vulnerable dependency. This could lead to arbitrary code execution within the Faiss process.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server hosting the application, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Affected Faiss Component:** Underlying dependencies (e.g., BLAS, LAPACK libraries used by Faiss).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update Faiss and all its dependencies to the latest versions with security patches.
* Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Faiss's dependencies.
* Monitor security advisories for Faiss and its dependencies.
