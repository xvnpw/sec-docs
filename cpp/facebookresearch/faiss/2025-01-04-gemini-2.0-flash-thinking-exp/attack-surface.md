# Attack Surface Analysis for facebookresearch/faiss

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Malicious Faiss Indexes](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_malicious_faiss_indexes.md)

*   **Description:**  The application loads a pre-built Faiss index from a file or network source. This index could be maliciously crafted.
    *   **How Faiss Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Faiss provides functionality to save and load index data. If this process is vulnerable, a malicious index can exploit it.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a specially crafted index file. When the application loads this file using `faiss.read_index()`, it triggers a buffer overflow due to a malformed data structure within the index, leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, Data Corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only load Faiss indexes from trusted sources.
        *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., cryptographic signatures) on index files before loading.
        *   Consider sandboxing the index loading process to limit the impact of potential exploits.
        *   Keep Faiss library updated to the latest version with security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Faiss's Native Code (C++)](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_faiss's_native_code__c++_.md)

*   **Description:** Faiss is primarily written in C++. Like any C++ code, it is susceptible to memory safety issues like buffer overflows, use-after-free, and integer overflows.
    *   **How Faiss Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The complexity of Faiss's algorithms and data structures increases the potential for these types of vulnerabilities to exist within its codebase.
    *   **Example:** A bug exists in a specific Faiss indexing algorithm that allows writing beyond the bounds of an allocated buffer when processing certain types of data, leading to a crash or potential code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, Memory Corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Faiss library updated to the latest version with security patches.
        *   Monitor Faiss's release notes and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities.
        *   If contributing to Faiss or modifying its code, follow secure coding practices and perform thorough testing.
