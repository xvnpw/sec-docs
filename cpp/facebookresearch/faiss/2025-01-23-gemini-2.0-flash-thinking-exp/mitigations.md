## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Vector Dimension and Data Type Validation for Faiss](./mitigation_strategies/input_vector_dimension_and_data_type_validation_for_faiss.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Vector Dimension and Data Type Validation for Faiss
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Faiss Index Schema:**  When creating your Faiss index, explicitly define and document the expected vector dimensions (e.g., vector length) and data type (e.g., `float32`, `float16`, `int8`). This schema is inherent to how you initialize your Faiss index (e.g., `faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)`).
    2.  **Validate Input Vectors Before Faiss Calls:**  Before passing any input vectors to Faiss functions (like `index.add()`, `index.search()`, `index.add_with_ids()`), implement validation checks. These checks must confirm:
        *   **Vector Dimension Match:** The input vector's length matches the dimension defined in your Faiss index schema.
        *   **Data Type Compatibility:** The data type of the input vector elements is compatible with the data type expected by your Faiss index (and the functions you are using). Faiss may implicitly convert in some cases, but explicit validation ensures correctness and prevents unexpected behavior.
    3.  **Handle Validation Failures:** If validation fails, reject the input vector *before* it reaches Faiss. Return an error to the caller indicating the schema violation. Log these validation failures for monitoring and debugging.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Faiss Internal Errors and Crashes (High Severity):** Providing vectors with incorrect dimensions or incompatible data types can lead to errors within Faiss, potentially causing crashes or unpredictable behavior in the Faiss library itself. This can disrupt the application's functionality.
    *   **Incorrect Search Results (Medium Severity):** Mismatched dimensions or data types might not always cause crashes but can lead to Faiss producing incorrect or nonsensical search results, compromising the application's accuracy and reliability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Faiss Internal Errors and Crashes:** High reduction. Directly prevents crashes and errors originating from incorrect input data format for Faiss.
    *   **Incorrect Search Results:** Moderate reduction. Significantly reduces the risk of obtaining incorrect results due to data format issues passed to Faiss.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in the API input validation layer for the search endpoint. Specifically, dimension validation is performed before calling `index.search()`. Located in `api/validation.py` and applied in `api/search_handler.py`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Data type validation is currently implicitly handled by Python and Faiss, but explicit checks are missing.  Explicit data type validation should be added in `api/validation.py` to ensure the input vector data type is strictly as expected (e.g., `numpy.float32`). Validation needs to be extended to the background indexing processes in `data_processing/index_builder.py` as well, before vectors are added to the Faiss index using `index.add()`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Faiss Library Up-to-Date Maintenance](./mitigation_strategies/faiss_library_up-to-date_maintenance.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Faiss Library Up-to-Date Maintenance
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Faiss Releases:** Regularly monitor the official Faiss GitHub repository ([https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)) for new releases, security announcements, and bug fixes. Subscribe to release notifications if available.
    2.  **Check for Security Advisories:**  Actively look for security advisories specifically related to Faiss. Check the Faiss GitHub repository's "Issues" and "Security" tabs, and relevant security mailing lists or databases.
    3.  **Regularly Update Faiss:** Establish a process for regularly updating the Faiss library to the latest stable version. Aim for updates at least quarterly or more frequently if security vulnerabilities are reported.
    4.  **Test Updated Faiss Version:** Before deploying an updated Faiss version to production, thoroughly test it in a staging environment. Run integration tests and performance benchmarks to ensure compatibility and stability with your application.
    5.  **Dependency Updates:** When updating Faiss, also review and update its dependencies (like BLAS, LAPACK, etc.) to their latest secure versions, as vulnerabilities in these dependencies can also affect Faiss.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Faiss Vulnerabilities (Severity Varies - can be High):** Outdated versions of Faiss may contain known security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Severity depends on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Faiss Vulnerabilities:** High reduction.  Significantly reduces the risk of attackers exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in the Faiss library itself.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Automated dependency scanning in CI/CD pipeline using `dependency-check` helps identify outdated dependencies, including Faiss, based on known vulnerability databases.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  No proactive process for regularly checking for new Faiss releases and scheduling updates beyond vulnerability scanning. A dedicated process is needed to monitor Faiss releases and plan updates even if no immediate vulnerabilities are flagged by scanners.  This should include a schedule for testing and deploying new Faiss versions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits for Faiss Operations](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_for_faiss_operations.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Resource Limits for Faiss Operations
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Resource-Intensive Faiss Functions:** Focus on Faiss functions that are computationally expensive or memory-intensive, primarily `index.search()` for searching and `index.add()` or `index.add_with_ids()` for indexing large datasets.
    2.  **Implement Timeouts for Faiss Search:**  Set timeouts specifically for Faiss search operations (`index.search()`). If a search query takes longer than the defined timeout, interrupt the Faiss search operation to prevent indefinite resource consumption. Implement this timeout at the application level when calling `index.search()`.
    3.  **Control Memory Usage for Faiss Processes:**  Limit the memory available to the processes running Faiss operations. This can be achieved through containerization (e.g., Docker memory limits, Kubernetes resource quotas) or operating system-level resource limits (e.g., `ulimit` on Linux). This prevents memory exhaustion by resource-intensive Faiss operations.
    4.  **Control CPU Usage for Faiss Processes:** Similarly, limit the CPU resources available to Faiss processes using containerization or OS-level resource limits. This prevents CPU starvation and ensures fair resource allocation within the system.
    5.  **Manage Index Size (Indirect):**  While not a direct resource limit on Faiss *operations*, managing the size of your Faiss index indirectly controls resource usage. Avoid creating excessively large indexes if not necessary, as larger indexes generally require more memory and can lead to slower search times. Consider strategies like data sharding or filtering to manage index size.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Faiss-Induced Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Maliciously crafted or excessively complex search queries, or attempts to index extremely large datasets, can overload Faiss, leading to resource exhaustion and DoS.
    *   **Resource Starvation for Other Application Components (High Severity):** Uncontrolled resource consumption by Faiss operations can starve other parts of the application of resources (CPU, memory), impacting overall application performance and availability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Faiss-Induced Denial of Service (DoS):** High reduction. Timeouts and resource limits directly prevent resource exhaustion caused by long-running or resource-intensive Faiss operations, mitigating DoS risks originating from Faiss usage.
    *   **Resource Starvation for Other Application Components:** High reduction. Limits the impact of individual Faiss operations on overall system resources, preventing resource starvation for other application components.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Timeouts are configured for search API requests, which indirectly limits the execution time of `index.search()`. This is implemented at the API gateway level.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Explicit CPU and memory limits are not configured for the processes running Faiss operations. These limits should be implemented at the containerization level (e.g., Docker resource limits, Kubernetes resource quotas) or process level (e.g., using `ulimit` on Linux systems) to provide more robust resource control for Faiss.  Index size management strategies are not formally defined or implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Logging of Faiss Operation Errors and Exceptions](./mitigation_strategies/logging_of_faiss_operation_errors_and_exceptions.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Logging of Faiss Operation Errors and Exceptions
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Faiss-Specific Error Points:** Pinpoint locations in your code where Faiss functions are called and where errors or exceptions from Faiss might occur (e.g., during `index.search()`, `index.add()`, index loading/saving).
    2.  **Implement Error Logging:**  Add logging statements specifically to capture errors and exceptions raised by Faiss functions. Use structured logging to record details like:
        *   Timestamp of the error.
        *   Specific Faiss function that caused the error.
        *   Error message or exception details provided by Faiss.
        *   Input parameters (if safe to log and relevant to debugging, sanitize if necessary).
        *   Stack trace (for exceptions).
    3.  **Differentiate Faiss Errors:** Ensure that logs clearly distinguish errors originating from Faiss from other application errors. Use specific log prefixes or categories to identify Faiss-related issues.
    4.  **Centralized Error Logging:**  Send Faiss error logs to a centralized logging system for monitoring and analysis.
    5.  **Alerting on Faiss Errors (Optional):**  Set up alerts to notify administrators or developers when critical Faiss errors or exceptions occur. This enables proactive identification and resolution of issues related to Faiss.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Undetected Faiss Issues Leading to Application Instability (Medium Severity):**  Without proper error logging, issues within Faiss (due to bugs, resource problems, or incorrect usage) might go unnoticed, potentially leading to application instability, performance degradation, or incorrect results over time.
    *   **Delayed Incident Response for Faiss-Related Problems (Medium Severity):** Lack of logging hinders the ability to quickly diagnose and respond to incidents caused by or related to Faiss.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Undetected Faiss Issues Leading to Application Instability:** Moderate reduction. Improves the detection of underlying issues within Faiss that could lead to application problems.
    *   **Delayed Incident Response for Faiss-Related Problems:** Moderate reduction. Enables faster diagnosis and response to incidents related to Faiss by providing error information.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic error logging exists for API requests, which captures some general errors. However, specific logging for Faiss operation errors and exceptions is not consistently implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Detailed and structured logging of errors and exceptions specifically from Faiss function calls is missing throughout the codebase, particularly in `api/search_handler.py`, `data_processing/index_builder.py`, and index loading/saving routines.  Integration with a centralized logging system for Faiss-specific errors is also needed.
