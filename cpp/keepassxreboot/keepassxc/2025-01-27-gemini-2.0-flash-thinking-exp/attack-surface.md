# Attack Surface Analysis for keepassxreboot/keepassxc

## Attack Surface: [KeePassXC Database File (.kdbx) Compromise](./attack_surfaces/keepassxc_database_file___kdbx__compromise.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to the encrypted KeePassXC database file, which is the core storage for sensitive credentials in KeePassXC.
*   **KeePassXC Contribution:** KeePassXC's fundamental purpose is to store and manage passwords in a `.kdbx` file. The existence and format of this file are central to KeePassXC and inherently create this critical attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in your application's backup process to gain access to a stored `.kdbx` file.  They then use offline brute-force attacks or dictionary attacks to attempt to crack the master password protecting the database.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of all stored credentials if the master password is weak or cracked. This leads to a significant data breach, potential identity theft, and unauthorized access to all systems and services protected by the compromised passwords.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Minimize direct handling of the `.kdbx` file within your application. If handling is necessary, implement robust access controls, encryption at rest, and secure transfer mechanisms.
        *   Educate users on the critical importance of choosing strong, unique master passwords for their KeePassXC databases. Provide clear guidelines and potentially enforce password complexity requirements if your application manages database creation.
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Crucially, choose a strong and unique master password.** This is the primary defense for the entire KeePassXC database. Use a password manager to generate and store a complex master password if needed.
        *   Enable and utilize key files or hardware keys as a strong second factor for database protection, adding a significant layer of security beyond just the master password.
        *   Store the `.kdbx` file in secure locations with appropriate access controls on the file system level. Avoid storing backups in easily accessible or publicly exposed locations.

## Attack Surface: [KeePassXC Command-Line Interface (CLI) Parameter Injection](./attack_surfaces/keepassxc_command-line_interface__cli__parameter_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in your application's usage of the KeePassXC Command-Line Interface (CLI) to inject malicious commands. This occurs when user-controlled input is improperly incorporated into CLI commands executed by your application.
*   **KeePassXC Contribution:** KeePassXC provides a powerful CLI for automation and scripting. If your application leverages this CLI for tasks like password retrieval or database management without rigorous input sanitization, it introduces a high-risk attack vector.
*   **Example:** Your application uses the CLI to retrieve a password based on a username provided by a user. If the application directly incorporates the unsanitized username into the CLI command, an attacker could input a malicious username like `"user; rm -rf /"` to inject commands. The resulting CLI command might become `keepassxc-cli get -a "user; rm -rf /" database.kdbx`, leading to unintended system commands being executed.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the system where KeePassXC CLI is running. This can lead to severe consequences, including full system compromise, data exfiltration, data deletion, and denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Absolutely avoid directly embedding user-provided input into KeePassXC CLI commands without extremely rigorous sanitization and validation.** Treat all user input as potentially malicious.
        *   Utilize parameterized commands or secure libraries specifically designed for interacting with KeePassXC or similar tools, if available. These methods help abstract away the complexities of CLI command construction and reduce injection risks.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege when executing CLI commands. Run the KeePassXC CLI commands with a dedicated user account that has the minimum necessary permissions to perform the required tasks, limiting the potential damage from command injection.
        *   Conduct thorough security code reviews and penetration testing specifically focusing on all code paths that interact with the KeePassXC CLI to identify and eliminate any potential injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [KeePassXC Plugin/Extension Vulnerabilities (High Severity Exploits)](./attack_surfaces/keepassxc_pluginextension_vulnerabilities__high_severity_exploits_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within KeePassXC plugins or extensions that could lead to significant security breaches, such as arbitrary code execution or sensitive data access. This focuses on *high severity* vulnerabilities within plugins, not just the general risk of plugins.
*   **KeePassXC Contribution:** KeePassXC's plugin architecture, while extending functionality, inherently introduces a dependency on the security of third-party plugins.  If plugins with high severity vulnerabilities are used, they directly impact the security of KeePassXC itself.
*   **Example:** A user installs a popular but poorly maintained KeePassXC plugin. A zero-day vulnerability is discovered in this plugin that allows for arbitrary code execution within the KeePassXC process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain control of KeePassXC, access the decrypted database in memory, or even compromise the entire system.
*   **Impact:** High severity plugin vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution within KeePassXC, allowing attackers to steal the master password, decrypt and exfiltrate the entire password database, or gain control of the system running KeePassXC.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (Specifically for high severity plugin vulnerabilities)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   If your application recommends or requires plugins, **strongly advise against recommending any plugins unless absolutely essential.**  Plugins significantly increase the attack surface.
        *   If plugins are necessary, only recommend plugins from highly trusted and reputable sources with a proven track record of security. Thoroughly vet any recommended plugins.
        *   Provide clear and prominent warnings to users about the inherent security risks associated with installing third-party plugins for KeePassXC.
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Minimize or completely avoid installing KeePassXC plugins.**  The best security posture is often achieved by using only the core KeePassXC functionality.
        *   If plugins are deemed necessary, only install plugins from highly trusted and reputable sources. Research the plugin developer and community feedback before installation.
        *   Keep all installed plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities promptly.
        *   Be extremely cautious about granting plugins any unnecessary permissions or access. Review plugin permissions carefully before installation.
