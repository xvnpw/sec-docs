    * **Modify KeePassXC Behavior:** Potentially disable security features or logging to avoid detection.
    * **Establish Network Connection:** Connect to a remote server controlled by the attacker.
    * **Exfiltrate Data:** Transmit the captured credentials, potentially along with other sensitive information like database names or user details.

* **Exfiltration Methods:**  Attackers can use various methods for data exfiltration:
    * **Direct HTTP/HTTPS Requests:** Sending stolen data to a web server.
    * **DNS Tunneling:**  Encoding data within DNS queries.
    * **Email:** Sending data via email.
    * **Third-Party Services:** Using compromised or legitimate third-party services for data transfer.

**3. Potential Impact:**

The successful execution of this attack path can have severe consequences:

* **Credential Theft:**  The primary goal, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts, systems, and sensitive data protected by the stolen credentials.
* **Identity Theft:**  Stolen credentials can be used for identity theft, financial fraud, and other malicious activities.
* **Data Breaches:**  Access to managed credentials can facilitate broader data breaches affecting individuals and organizations.
* **Reputational Damage:**  If users are compromised through a malicious plugin, it can damage the reputation of KeePassXC, even if the vulnerability lies in user behavior rather than the core application.
* **Loss of Trust:**  Users might lose trust in KeePassXC's security if they believe it's susceptible to such attacks.

**4. Mitigation Strategies:**

**For KeePassXC Development Team:**
