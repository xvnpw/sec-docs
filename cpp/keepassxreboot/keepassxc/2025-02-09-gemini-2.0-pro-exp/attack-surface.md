# Attack Surface Analysis for keepassxreboot/keepassxc

## Attack Surface: [Database File Compromise](./attack_surfaces/database_file_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to the `.kdbx` database file, potentially leading to decryption and exposure of all stored credentials.
    *   **KeePassXC Contribution:** The `.kdbx` file is KeePassXC's core data storage mechanism; its compromise is the primary attack goal.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to a user's computer and copies the `.kdbx` file.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of all credentials and secrets stored within the database.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Users:**
            *   Choose a strong, unique master password.
            *   Utilize a key file stored securely and separately from the database file.
            *   Consider using a YubiKey or other hardware security key for challenge-response authentication.
            *   Avoid storing the database file in unencrypted cloud storage or shared folders.
            *   Regularly back up the database file to a secure, offline location.

## Attack Surface: [Weak Master Password/Key File](./attack_surfaces/weak_master_passwordkey_file.md)

*   **Description:** Use of an easily guessable or brute-forceable master password, or an insecurely stored key file, allowing attackers to decrypt the database.
    *   **KeePassXC Contribution:** KeePassXC's security relies *entirely* on the strength of the master password and/or key file.
    *   **Example:** A user chooses "Password123" as their master password. Or, a user stores their key file in a plain text file on their desktop.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of all credentials and secrets stored within the database.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Users:**
            *   Use a long, complex, and randomly generated master password.  A password manager (separate from KeePassXC) can help.
            *   Store key files on secure, encrypted media, separate from the database file. Consider offline storage.
            *   Never share the master password or key file.

## Attack Surface: [Memory Scraping](./attack_surfaces/memory_scraping.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with sufficient system privileges gains access to the computer's memory while KeePassXC is running and the database is unlocked, potentially extracting decrypted credentials.
    *   **KeePassXC Contribution:** While KeePassXC has memory protection, decrypted data *must* reside in memory while the database is open. This is an inherent risk of using any password manager.
    *   **Example:** Malware running with administrator privileges extracts the decrypted contents of the KeePassXC database from RAM.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of credentials currently in use or recently accessed within KeePassXC.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Users:**
            *   Keep the operating system and security software up-to-date.
            *   Avoid running untrusted software.
            *   Use KeePassXC's auto-lock features (after inactivity, on screen lock, etc.).
            *   Lock the KeePassXC database when not actively using it.
            *   Consider using a virtual machine or sandboxed environment for KeePassXC in high-security scenarios.

## Attack Surface: [Auto-Type Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/auto-type_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious window or application to trick KeePassXC's Auto-Type feature into entering credentials into the wrong location.
    *   **KeePassXC Contribution:** Auto-Type is a KeePassXC feature that automates credential entry; its reliance on window title matching creates this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A phishing website mimics a legitimate login page, and Auto-Type enters credentials into the attacker's form.
    *   **Impact:** Credentials are sent to the attacker instead of the legitimate application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Users:**
            *   Use Auto-Type with caution.
            *   Carefully configure Auto-Type sequences with specific window title matching.  Use the most restrictive matching possible.
            *   Visually verify the target window *before* initiating Auto-Type.
            *   Consider disabling Auto-Type if it's not absolutely necessary.

## Attack Surface: [KeePassXC Software Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/keepassxc_software_vulnerabilities.md)

*    **Description:** Exploitable bugs within the KeePassXC application itself (e.g., buffer overflows, format string bugs) that could lead to arbitrary code execution or data leakage.
    *    **KeePassXC Contribution:** This is a direct risk stemming from potential flaws in the KeePassXC codebase.
    *    **Example:** A zero-day vulnerability in KeePassXC's database parsing code allows an attacker to craft a malicious `.kdbx` file that executes code when opened.
    *    **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from denial-of-service to complete system compromise (and thus, database compromise).
    *    **Risk Severity:** High
    *    **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *    **Users:**
            *   Regularly update to the latest stable version of KeePassXC.  Enable automatic updates if available.
            *   Monitor the KeePassXC website and security mailing lists for announcements of vulnerabilities.
