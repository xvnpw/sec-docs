-   Lack of community engagement and contributions.
-   Competition from other password managers (both open-source and commercial).

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

-   security control: Strong encryption using industry-standard algorithms (AES, Twofish, ChaCha20). Implemented in the core application logic and described in the documentation.
-   security control: Password database protection with a master password and/or key file. Implemented in the core application logic.
-   security control: Auto-lock feature to protect the database after a period of inactivity. Implemented in the application's settings and core logic.
-   security control: Password generation using cryptographically secure random number generators. Implemented in the password generator component.
-   security control: Protection against brute-force attacks through key derivation functions (Argon2, AES-KDF). Implemented in the core application logic related to database encryption.
-   security control: Regular security audits and code reviews. Documented in the project's development process and GitHub repository.
-   security control: Cross-platform compatibility to ensure consistent security across different operating systems. Implemented through the use of cross-platform frameworks and libraries.
-   security control: Use of memory protection techniques to prevent sensitive data from being leaked to swap or other memory locations. Implemented in the core application logic, specific details may vary by platform.
-   security control: Browser integration for convenient password filling and saving. Implemented through browser extensions.
-   security control: Two-factor authentication (2FA) support using TOTP and YubiKey. Implemented in the core application logic and database format.

Accepted Risks:

-   accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies.
-   accepted risk: Risk of user error, such as choosing weak master passwords or misplacing key files.
-   accepted risk: Potential for side-channel attacks, although mitigations are in place.
-   accepted risk: The browser extensions are separate projects and have their own security considerations.

Recommended Security Controls:

-   security control: Implement a comprehensive bug bounty program to incentivize security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities.
-   security control: Provide more detailed documentation on the specific security measures implemented, including cryptographic details and memory protection techniques.
-   security control: Consider implementing hardware security module (HSM) support for enhanced key protection.
-   security control: Explore the possibility of formal security certifications (e.g., Common Criteria, FIPS 140-2).

Security Requirements:

-   Authorization:
    -   Only authenticated users should be able to access and modify the password database.
    -   The application should implement appropriate access controls to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
-   Input Validation:
    -   The application must validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
    -   The application must sanitize data before displaying it to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
-   Cryptography:
    -   The application must use strong, industry-standard encryption algorithms (AES, Twofish, ChaCha20) to protect the password database.
    -   The application must use appropriate key derivation functions (Argon2, AES-KDF) to protect against brute-force attacks.
    -   The application must use cryptographically secure random number generators for password generation and other security-critical operations.
    -   The application must securely manage cryptographic keys.
