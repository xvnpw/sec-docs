## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong Database Encryption (KeePassXC Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/strong_database_encryption__keepassxc_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Algorithm Enforcement:**  Programmatically enforce the use of strong encryption algorithms within KeePassXC.  Use the KeePassXC API to *ensure* that AES-256 (or stronger) is selected for symmetric encryption and that Argon2id is selected for key derivation.  *Do not* rely on user settings; override them if necessary.
    2.  **KDF Parameter Control:**  Programmatically set the Argon2id parameters (memory cost, time cost, parallelism) to secure values.  The application should:
        *   Set default values that are considered secure for the current hardware (e.g., memory cost >= 64 MiB, time cost >= 3).
        *   Provide an API or configuration mechanism to *increase* these parameters, but *prevent* them from being lowered below the secure defaults.  This control should be internal to the application, not exposed directly to the user.
        *   Ideally, implement an adaptive KDF configuration that adjusts the parameters based on available system resources, using the KeePassXC API to query and set these values.
    3.  **Key File Handling (API):** If key files are supported, use the KeePassXC API to correctly handle them during database creation and opening.  *Never* hardcode key file paths or attempt to manage key files outside of the KeePassXC API.
    4. **Password Quality Enforcement (via API if available):** If KeePassXC provides an API for checking password quality or enforcing password policies *during database creation*, use it to enforce strong master passwords.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromise of the KeePassXC Database File (Severity: Critical):** Strong encryption, enforced through the KeePassXC API, makes decryption without the correct credentials computationally infeasible.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Severity: High):**  A strong KDF with high iteration counts, set programmatically, makes brute-force attacks extremely difficult.
    *   **Dictionary Attacks (Severity: High):** Strong KDF and potentially password quality checks (if available via API) reduce the effectiveness of dictionary attacks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromise of Database File:** Risk reduced from *Critical* to *Low*.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Very Low*.
    *   **Dictionary Attacks:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   AES-256 and Argon2id are used, but parameters are likely hardcoded or rely on KeePassXC defaults. (Implemented in `DatabaseManager.cpp` - needs review)

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Adaptive KDF configuration using the KeePassXC API is not implemented. (Missing in `KDFSettings.cpp`)
    *   Programmatic enforcement of strong algorithm and KDF settings is not fully implemented. (Needs implementation in `DatabaseManager.cpp`)
    *   Key file handling (if supported) needs to be reviewed to ensure it exclusively uses the KeePassXC API.
    * Password quality enforcement via API is not implemented (check if API exists).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization (for KeePassXC API Calls)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization__for_keepassxc_api_calls_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Parameterized API Calls:**  Ensure that *all* interactions with the KeePassXC API use parameterized methods or their equivalent.  *Never* construct database queries or commands using string concatenation with user-supplied data.  This is crucial, even though KeePassXC uses a file-based database, to prevent any potential injection vulnerabilities within the KeePassXC library itself.
    2.  **Type and Length Checks:** Before passing data to the KeePassXC API, rigorously check the data types and lengths of all input values.  Ensure that strings are within expected length limits, numbers are within valid ranges, and so on.  This prevents potential buffer overflows or other unexpected behavior within KeePassXC.
    3.  **Sanitize Data Retrieved from Database:** Even data retrieved *from* the KeePassXC database should be treated as potentially untrusted and sanitized before being used within the application, especially if it's displayed to the user or used in further processing. This protects against scenarios where the database itself might have been tampered with.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (within KeePassXC) (Severity: High):** Prevents potential injection vulnerabilities within the KeePassXC library itself.
    *   **Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities (within KeePassXC) (Severity: High):** Length and type checks help prevent buffer overflows within KeePassXC.
    *   **Data Corruption (Severity: Medium):** Prevents malformed data from being written to the database, which could lead to instability or data loss.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Low*.
    *   **Buffer Overflows:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Low*.
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic input validation (e.g., checking for empty strings) is likely present. (Needs review across all KeePassXC API calls)

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive and consistent input validation and sanitization are likely missing for many KeePassXC API calls. (Needs thorough implementation across the codebase)
    *   Explicit use of parameterized API calls needs to be verified for *all* interactions with KeePassXC. (Needs code review)

## Mitigation Strategy: [Clipboard Clearing and Auto-Type Configuration (via KeePassXC API)](./mitigation_strategies/clipboard_clearing_and_auto-type_configuration__via_keepassxc_api_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Clipboard Timeout (API):** Use the KeePassXC API to *explicitly* configure the clipboard timeout.  Set a short timeout (e.g., 10-30 seconds) after which KeePassXC will automatically clear the clipboard.  *Do not* rely on KeePassXC's default settings, as these might be too long or disabled.
    2.  **Auto-Type Obfuscation (API):** If the application uses KeePassXC's auto-type feature, use the KeePassXC API to enable and configure any available auto-type obfuscation techniques (e.g., TCATO).  Check the KeePassXC API documentation for available options and how to control them programmatically.
    3. **Disable Auto-Type Globally (If Not Used):** If the application *does not* use the auto-type feature, use the KeePassXC API to disable it globally. This reduces the attack surface.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Clipboard Monitoring (Severity: Medium):**  A short, programmatically enforced clipboard timeout minimizes the risk of other applications capturing sensitive data.
    *   **Keylogging (Auto-Type) (Severity: Medium):**  Auto-type obfuscation, enabled via the KeePassXC API, makes keylogging more difficult.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Clipboard Monitoring:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.
    *   **Keylogging (Auto-Type):** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The application likely uses KeePassXC's clipboard and/or auto-type features.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The clipboard timeout is not explicitly configured via the KeePassXC API. (Needs implementation)
    *   Auto-type obfuscation is not enabled or configured via the KeePassXC API. (Needs investigation and implementation)
    * Auto-Type is not disabled via API if not used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Management (KeePassXC and its dependencies)](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_management__keepassxc_and_its_dependencies_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Automated Updates (KeePassXC):**  Ensure that the build system and/or dependency management system is configured to automatically check for and incorporate updates to the KeePassXC library. This should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
    2. **Vulnerability Scanning (KeePassXC):** Use tools to scan KeePassXC library for known vulnerabilities.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities (in KeePassXC) (Severity: Variable, potentially Critical):**  Reduces the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities in the KeePassXC library itself.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced from *Variable* to *Low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   CMake with FetchContent is used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated updates for KeePassXC are not fully integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. (Needs configuration)
    *   Vulnerability scanning for KeePassXC is not implemented.
