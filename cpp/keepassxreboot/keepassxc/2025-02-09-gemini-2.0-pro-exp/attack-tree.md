## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Master Key/Key File [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_master_keykey_file__critical_.md)

1.  **Compromise Master Key/Key File [CRITICAL]**

    *   **Description:** This attack vector focuses on obtaining the credentials (master password or key file) needed to unlock the KeePassXC database.  It's a critical node because successful compromise grants full access to all stored secrets.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Dictionary Attack on Master Key:**
            *   **Description:** The attacker uses a list of common passwords, previously leaked credentials, or other predictable phrases to try and guess the user's master password.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium. Depends heavily on the user's password choice. Weak, common passwords significantly increase the likelihood.
            *   **Impact:** Very High. Grants full access to the KeePassXC database.
            *   **Effort:** Medium. Readily available tools and wordlists can be used.
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate. Requires some knowledge of password cracking tools but is generally accessible.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Repeated failed login attempts might be logged, but distinguishing them from legitimate failures can be challenging.
        *   **Keylogger/Screen Scraper:**
            *   **Description:** The attacker uses malware (keylogger or screen scraper) to capture the master password as the user types it or displays it on the screen. This bypasses any password strength measures.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low. Requires compromising the system where the master key is entered, which is outside KeePassXC's direct control but a critical system-level concern.
            *   **Impact:** Very High. Grants full access to the KeePassXC database.
            *   **Effort:** Medium. Deploying malware requires some effort, but pre-built tools are available.
            *   **Skill Level:** Advanced. Creating and deploying effective, stealthy malware requires significant expertise.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard. Good keyloggers and screen scrapers are designed to be stealthy and avoid detection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Integration](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_integration.md)

2.  **Compromise Application Integration**

    *   **Description:** This attack vector focuses on vulnerabilities introduced by how the *application* interacts with KeePassXC, rather than flaws within KeePassXC itself.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Insecure Storage of KeePassXC Config/Database File Path [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:** The application stores the path to the KeePassXC database file in an insecure location, such as a world-readable configuration file, hardcoded in a vulnerable part of the application, or in easily accessible logs. This makes it trivial for an attacker to locate the database.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium. Developers may overlook the security implications of storing this information.
            *   **Impact:** Medium. Facilitates other attacks (brute-force, dictionary attacks, vulnerability exploitation) by making the database easily accessible.
            *   **Effort:** Low. Finding misconfigured files or hardcoded paths is relatively easy.
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice/Intermediate. Requires basic system administration or code review skills.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy/Medium. Can be detected through file system scans, code analysis, or configuration reviews.
        *   **Improper Key Derivation:**
            *   **Description:** The application uses a weak method to derive a key from user input *before* passing it to KeePassXC. For example, using a simple hash function instead of a proper Key Derivation Function (KDF) like Argon2. This weakens the overall security, even if KeePassXC's internal KDF is strong.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium. Developers might not fully understand the importance of strong KDFs or might choose a simpler, less secure method for convenience.
            *   **Impact:** High. Makes the master key significantly easier to compromise through brute-force or dictionary attacks.
            *   **Effort:** Low. Implementing a weak KDF is often easier than implementing a strong one.
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate. Requires some understanding of cryptography but not necessarily expert knowledge.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Requires code review and analysis of the key derivation process.
