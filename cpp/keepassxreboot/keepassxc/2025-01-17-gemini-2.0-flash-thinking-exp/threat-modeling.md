# Threat Model Analysis for keepassxreboot/keepassxc

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to `.kdbx` File](./threats/unauthorized_access_to___kdbx__file.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the KeePassXC database file (`.kdbx`). This could happen through exploiting weak file system permissions on the system where the file is stored. The attacker can then attempt to brute-force the master password offline to decrypt the database.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of all credentials stored within the KeePassXC database, potentially leading to unauthorized access to other systems and data.

**Affected KeePassXC Component:** `.kdbx` database file, file system storage.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure strong file system permissions on the directory and the `.kdbx` file itself, restricting access to only necessary users and processes.
*   Encrypt the storage location of the `.kdbx` file at rest.
*   Regularly monitor access to the `.kdbx` file for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Weak Master Password Brute-Force](./threats/weak_master_password_brute-force.md)

**Description:** An attacker attempts to guess or brute-force the master password protecting the KeePassXC database. This is more feasible if the master password is weak, short, or based on easily guessable information.

**Impact:** Successful brute-forcing leads to complete compromise of the KeePassXC database and all stored credentials.

**Affected KeePassXC Component:** Master password protection mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong master password policies, requiring a minimum length, complexity, and discouraging the reuse of passwords.
*   Educate users on the importance of strong, unique master passwords.
*   Consider using key files or hardware keys as additional authentication factors.

## Threat: [Keylogger Capturing Master Password](./threats/keylogger_capturing_master_password.md)

**Description:** Malware running on the same system as KeePassXC could log keystrokes, potentially capturing the master password as it is entered to unlock the database.

**Impact:** Compromise of the KeePassXC database and all managed credentials.

**Affected KeePassXC Component:** Master password input mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust endpoint security measures, including antivirus and anti-malware software.
*   Educate users on the risks of downloading and running untrusted software.
*   Consider using the auto-type feature with caution and awareness of potential keylogging risks.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Master Password or Key File (for programmatic access)](./threats/insecure_storage_of_master_password_or_key_file__for_programmatic_access_.md)

**Description:** If the application needs to programmatically access the KeePassXC database, it might store the master password or a key file insecurely (e.g., in plain text configuration files, environment variables without proper protection). An attacker gaining access to these storage locations can retrieve the credentials needed to unlock the database.

**Impact:** Exposure of the master password or key file, allowing attackers to decrypt the database and access all stored credentials.

**Affected KeePassXC Component:** Master password/key file handling for programmatic access.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid storing the master password directly within the application's configuration or code.
*   Utilize secure storage mechanisms provided by the operating system (e.g., credential managers) or hardware security modules (HSMs).
*   Encrypt any configuration files containing sensitive information, including paths to key files.

## Threat: [Injection Vulnerabilities in KeePassXC Interaction](./threats/injection_vulnerabilities_in_keepassxc_interaction.md)

**Description:** If the application interacts with KeePassXC through command-line interfaces or potentially future APIs, vulnerabilities could exist where attacker-controlled input is not properly sanitized. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands that are executed by KeePassXC, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data breaches.

**Impact:** Potential for unauthorized access to specific entries, modification of entries, or even manipulation of KeePassXC itself, depending on the nature of the injection.

**Affected KeePassXC Component:** Command-line interface (if used), potential future APIs.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly validate and sanitize all input used when constructing commands or queries for KeePassXC.
*   Avoid constructing commands by concatenating strings directly with user-provided input.
*   If using a command-line interface, use parameterized commands or escape user input appropriately.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in KeePassXC Software](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_keepassxc_software.md)

**Description:** Like any software, KeePassXC might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities. If such vulnerabilities are found and exploited, it could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could range from minor disruptions to complete compromise of the KeePassXC database.

**Affected KeePassXC Component:** Various modules and functions within the KeePassXC codebase.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep KeePassXC updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists related to KeePassXC.
*   Monitor for reported vulnerabilities and apply patches promptly.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on KeePassXC](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_keepassxc.md)

**Description:** The KeePassXC software or its dependencies could be compromised during the development or distribution process. This could involve malicious code being injected into the software, potentially allowing attackers to gain access to user data or systems.

**Impact:** Compromise of the KeePassXC database and all managed credentials.

**Affected KeePassXC Component:** Entire KeePassXC application and its dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Download KeePassXC from official and trusted sources.
*   Verify the integrity of the downloaded software using checksums or digital signatures.
*   Be cautious about installing third-party plugins or extensions for KeePassXC.
