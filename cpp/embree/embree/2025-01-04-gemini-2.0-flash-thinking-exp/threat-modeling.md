# Threat Model Analysis for embree/embree

## Threat: [Malformed Scene Data Injection](./threats/malformed_scene_data_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides crafted or invalid scene description data to the application, which is then passed directly to Embree for processing. This could involve incorrect geometry definitions (e.g., NaN values, degenerate triangles), out-of-bounds indices, or circular dependencies in the scene graph. Embree's parsing or processing of this malformed data could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes within the Embree library itself.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash due to errors within Embree, denial of service by causing Embree to enter an error state or consume excessive resources, potential for exploitation if the malformed data triggers a buffer overflow or other memory corruption vulnerability *within Embree*.
    *   **Affected Embree Component:** Scene parsing and geometry processing modules (e.g., `rtcNewScene`, `rtcSetGeometry`, `rtcCommitScene`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all scene data *before* passing it to Embree.
        *   Use schema validation or custom parsing logic to ensure data conforms to Embree's expected formats and constraints.
        *   Utilize Embree's built-in error handling mechanisms to catch and handle parsing or processing errors gracefully.

## Threat: [Excessive Scene Complexity Exploitation](./threats/excessive_scene_complexity_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides an extremely complex scene with a massive number of primitives, intricate geometry, or deep object hierarchies directly to Embree. This can overwhelm Embree's internal processing capabilities, leading to excessive CPU and memory consumption *within Embree*. The attacker aims to cause a denial of service by exhausting system resources through Embree's operations.
    *   **Impact:** Application slowdown or unresponsiveness due to Embree consuming excessive resources, resource exhaustion on the server or client impacting other application components, potentially leading to a complete denial of service caused by Embree.
    *   **Affected Embree Component:** Ray tracing kernels, scene traversal algorithms *within Embree*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement limits on scene complexity *before* passing data to Embree (e.g., maximum number of primitives, bounding box sizes, maximum recursion depth for instancing).
        *   Consider using techniques like level-of-detail (LOD) rendering or scene simplification *before* passing data to Embree.
        *   Implement timeouts for Embree operations to prevent indefinite resource consumption *within Embree*.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow/Underflow in Scene Data Processing by Embree](./threats/integer_overflowunderflow_in_scene_data_processing_by_embree.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates integer values within the scene data (e.g., vertex indices, primitive counts) such that when Embree processes this data, it leads to overflows or underflows during Embree's internal calculations. This can result in incorrect memory access or other unexpected behavior *within Embree*.
    *   **Impact:** Crashes within Embree, memory corruption *within Embree's internal data structures*, potential for arbitrary code execution if the overflow leads to writing outside of allocated buffers *within Embree's memory space*.
    *   **Affected Embree Component:** Geometry data structures, indexing mechanisms *within Embree*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully validate integer values within the scene data against expected ranges *before* passing them to Embree.
        *   While direct mitigation within Embree's internal workings is not possible for the application developer, ensuring valid input is the primary defense.

## Threat: [Out-of-Bounds Access via Incorrect Buffer Handling by Embree](./threats/out-of-bounds_access_via_incorrect_buffer_handling_by_embree.md)

*   **Description:** The application provides incorrect buffer sizes or indices when interacting with Embree's data structures (e.g., when setting vertex or index data), causing Embree itself to attempt to read or write memory outside of its allocated buffers.
    *   **Impact:** Crashes within Embree, memory corruption *within Embree's memory space*, potential for arbitrary code execution if the out-of-bounds access is exploitable *within Embree*.
    *   **Affected Embree Component:** Functions for setting geometry data (e.g., `rtcSetSharedGeometryBuffer`, `rtcSetNewGeometryBuffer`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test the application's code that interacts with Embree's memory buffers, ensuring correct sizes and indices are provided.
        *   Double-check buffer sizes and offsets before passing them to Embree functions.

## Threat: [Race Conditions Within Embree in Multi-threaded Usage](./threats/race_conditions_within_embree_in_multi-threaded_usage.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses Embree in a multi-threaded environment and Embree itself contains internal race conditions, multiple threads might access and modify shared Embree objects or data concurrently *within Embree's internal implementation*. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, data corruption, or crashes *within Embree*.
    *   **Impact:** Application instability due to issues within Embree, incorrect rendering results caused by data corruption within Embree, potential for security vulnerabilities if data corruption within Embree leads to exploitable states.
    *   **Affected Embree Component:** Any Embree function or data structure accessed concurrently by multiple threads *within Embree's internal implementation*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Adhere to Embree's threading model and recommendations.
        *   Keep Embree updated to the latest version, as updates may contain fixes for internal race conditions.
        *   Report any suspected race conditions to the Embree development team.
