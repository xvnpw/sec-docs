# Attack Surface Analysis for embree/embree

## Attack Surface: [Malformed Scene Descriptions Leading to Parsing Errors or Crashes](./attack_surfaces/malformed_scene_descriptions_leading_to_parsing_errors_or_crashes.md)

*   **Description:** Malformed Scene Descriptions Leading to Parsing Errors or Crashes.
    *   **How Embree Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Embree relies on user-provided data or data derived from user input to define the scene geometry (e.g., vertices, triangles, curves). If this data is malformed or contains unexpected values, Embree's parsing and processing logic might fail.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a scene description file with an invalid number of vertices for a triangle, or with extremely large or negative coordinates.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (application crash), potential for triggering exploitable memory corruption vulnerabilities within Embree's parsing logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all scene data before passing it to Embree. This includes checking data types, ranges, and consistency.
        *   **Sanitization:**  Sanitize input data to remove or escape potentially harmful characters or values.
        *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling around Embree's scene loading and building functions to gracefully handle invalid input and prevent crashes.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Impose limits on the size and complexity of the scene data that can be processed.

## Attack Surface: [Buffer Overflows in Scene Parsing or Processing](./attack_surfaces/buffer_overflows_in_scene_parsing_or_processing.md)

*   **Description:** Buffer Overflows in Scene Parsing or Processing.
    *   **How Embree Contributes to the Attack Surface:** As a C++ library, Embree is susceptible to buffer overflows if input data is not handled carefully or if internal algorithms have vulnerabilities. Maliciously crafted scene data could potentially overflow internal buffers during parsing or processing.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a scene description with an excessively long string for a material name, potentially overflowing a fixed-size buffer within Embree.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution (if the overflow is exploitable), application crash, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation (Crucial):**  Strictly validate the size and format of all input data.
        *   **Use Safe APIs (If Available):** If Embree provides safer alternatives to potentially unsafe functions, use them.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Embree updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that address known buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
        *   **Memory Safety Tools:** Employ memory safety tools (e.g., AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer) during development and testing to detect potential buffer overflows.
