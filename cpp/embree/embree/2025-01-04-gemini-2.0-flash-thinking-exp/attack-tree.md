## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities in Embree [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities_in_embree__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path focuses on manipulating the data provided to Embree, which is a common attack vector for libraries.
    *   **Provide Malicious Scene Data [CRITICAL NODE]:** This is the entry point for several input-based attacks. Attackers aim to craft scene descriptions that trigger vulnerabilities in Embree's parsing or processing logic.
        *   **Trigger Buffer Overflow in Scene Parsing [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   Attack Vector: Crafting scene data with excessively long strings or large amounts of geometry data that exceed the allocated buffer size during parsing.
            *   Potential Impact: Code execution, application crash.
        *   **Trigger Integer Overflow in Scene Processing [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   Attack Vector: Providing extremely large values for numerical parameters within the scene data (e.g., object counts, indices) that can cause integer overflows during processing.
            *   Potential Impact: Memory corruption, unexpected application behavior.
    *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Supported File Formats (if application allows user-provided files) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   This path targets vulnerabilities within Embree's parsers for common 3D file formats.
        *   **Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in OBJ, glTF, etc. parsers within Embree [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   Attack Vector: Providing specially crafted files that exploit known vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, integer overflows, logic errors) in the parsers for formats like OBJ or glTF.
            *   Potential Impact: Code execution, application crash.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Embree's API Usage within the Application [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_embree's_api_usage_within_the_application__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path focuses on vulnerabilities introduced by how the application uses the Embree library.
    *   **Improper Error Handling [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Attack Vector: The application fails to check the return codes or error indicators from Embree's API functions. This can lead to the application continuing to operate under erroneous conditions, potentially leading to exploitable states.
        *   Potential Impact: Depends on the specific error, but can range from incorrect behavior to crashes or security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization Before Passing to Embree [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Attack Vector: The application directly passes user-provided input to Embree functions without proper validation or sanitization. This makes the application directly vulnerable to any input handling vulnerabilities within Embree.
        *   Potential Impact: Inherits the potential impacts of Embree's input handling vulnerabilities (code execution, memory corruption, crashes).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Build or Dependency Issues [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_build_or_dependency_issues__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path focuses on vulnerabilities introduced through the build process or by using vulnerable versions of Embree.
    *   **Use of Vulnerable Embree Version [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Attack Vector: The application uses an outdated version of the Embree library that contains known security vulnerabilities. Attackers can leverage publicly available exploits targeting these vulnerabilities.
        *   Potential Impact: Inherits the impacts of the known vulnerabilities in the used Embree version, potentially leading to code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.
