# Attack Surface Analysis for embree/embree

## Attack Surface: [1. Malformed Geometry Input (Memory Corruption)](./attack_surfaces/1__malformed_geometry_input__memory_corruption_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers provide carefully crafted geometric data designed to trigger integer overflows/underflows or out-of-bounds memory accesses *within Embree's internal processing*.
*   **How Embree Contributes:** This is a *direct* vulnerability. Embree's internal data structures and algorithms, when processing maliciously crafted input, are susceptible to memory corruption. The vulnerability exists *within* Embree's code.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides a mesh where vertex indices are manipulated to cause an integer overflow during an internal BVH construction calculation, leading to an out-of-bounds write *inside Embree*. Or, indices point outside allocated buffers, causing Embree to read/write to arbitrary memory.
*   **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution (ACE) or information disclosure. This is a high-impact vulnerability because it can compromise the entire application.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation (Application-Side):** While the vulnerability is *in* Embree, the application *must* still perform rigorous input validation to minimize the chances of triggering it. This includes:
        *   **Precise Bounds Checking:** Extremely careful checking of all indices to ensure they are within the allocated buffer sizes.
        *   **Overflow/Underflow Detection:** Employ techniques to detect potential integer overflows/underflows before passing data to Embree.
        *   **Sanity Checks:** Implement sanity checks on geometric data (e.g., reasonable coordinate ranges) to reduce the likelihood of triggering edge cases.
    *   **Fuzz Testing (Embree-Focused):** Conduct extensive fuzz testing *specifically targeting Embree* with a wide range of malformed geometry, focusing on integer overflows, boundary conditions, and invalid indices. This is crucial for finding vulnerabilities *within* Embree.
    *   **Memory Safety Tools (During Development):** Use memory safety tools like AddressSanitizer (ASan) and Valgrind during development and testing of *both* the application and, ideally, Embree itself (if possible).
    *   **Report Vulnerabilities:** If a vulnerability is found, responsibly disclose it to the Embree developers.
    * **Embree Updates:** Keep Embree updated.

## Attack Surface: [2. Malformed Geometry Input (Denial of Service)](./attack_surfaces/2__malformed_geometry_input__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers provide intentionally crafted, excessively complex, or invalid geometric data to Embree, aiming to overwhelm its processing capabilities and cause a denial of service.
*   **How Embree Contributes:** This is a *direct* vulnerability. Embree's algorithms (BVH construction, ray traversal) are directly affected by the complexity and validity of the input geometry. The performance degradation or crash occurs *within* Embree's processing.
*   **Example:** An attacker submits a scene with millions of tiny, overlapping triangles, or a single triangle with extremely large vertex coordinates, causing Embree's BVH construction to consume excessive resources or enter a very long computation.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) â€“ the application becomes unresponsive or crashes, preventing legitimate users from accessing its functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation (Application-Side):** The application *must* limit the complexity of the geometry it passes to Embree:
        *   **Polygon Count Limits:** Enforce strict, *low* limits on the total number of polygons.
        *   **Vertex Coordinate Bounds:** Reject vertices outside a predefined, reasonable range.
        *   **Degeneracy Checks:** Detect and reject degenerate geometry.
    *   **Resource Limits (Application-Side):**
        *   **Memory Limits:** Set limits on the memory Embree can allocate.
        *   **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for Embree processing to prevent indefinite hangs.  This is *critical* for DoS mitigation.
    *   **Fuzz Testing (Embree-Focused):** Fuzz test Embree with various complex and invalid geometries to identify performance bottlenecks and potential crashes.
    * **Embree Updates:** Keep Embree updated.
