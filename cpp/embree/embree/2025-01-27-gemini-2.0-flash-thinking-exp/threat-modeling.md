# Threat Model Analysis for embree/embree

## Threat: [Malicious Scene Data Injection](./threats/malicious_scene_data_injection.md)

Description: An attacker crafts malicious scene data (e.g., OBJ, GLTF, Embree scene format) and provides it as input to the application. This data is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Embree's scene parsing and processing. The attacker might aim to trigger memory corruption by overflowing buffers with excessively large geometry data, or cause a denial of service by creating scenes that lead to infinite loops or excessive resource consumption during parsing or ray tracing.
Impact:
    * Memory corruption leading to potential code execution.
    * Denial of Service (DoS) due to resource exhaustion or application crash.
    * Unexpected program behavior and incorrect rendering results.
Embree Component Affected:
    * Scene Parsing Module (e.g., `rtcNewScene`, scene loading functions for various formats).
    * Geometry Processing (e.g., functions handling mesh data, curves, instances).
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Strict Input Validation: Implement robust validation of scene data schemas, numerical ranges, and scene complexity before processing with Embree.
    * Input Sanitization: Sanitize or normalize input data to remove potentially malicious elements.
    * Secure Scene Loading Practices: Load scenes from trusted sources or implement strong access controls.
    * Regular Embree Updates: Keep Embree updated to benefit from security patches.

## Threat: [Buffer Overflows and Out-of-Bounds Access in Embree](./threats/buffer_overflows_and_out-of-bounds_access_in_embree.md)

Description: Embree, being a C++ library, might contain buffer overflow or out-of-bounds access vulnerabilities in its internal algorithms. An attacker could trigger these vulnerabilities by providing specific scene data or ray tracing queries that exploit weaknesses in Embree's memory management. This could lead to code execution by overwriting memory regions or denial of service through crashes.
Impact:
    * Code Execution: Potential to gain control of program execution.
    * Denial of Service (DoS): Application crash due to memory corruption.
    * Information Disclosure: Reading sensitive data from memory.
Embree Component Affected:
    * Ray Traversal Module (e.g., `rtcIntersect`, `rtcOccluded`).
    * Intersection Calculation Module (e.g., geometry intersection kernels).
    * Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) Construction Module (e.g., `rtcCommitScene`).
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Regular Embree Updates: Stay updated with the latest Embree releases for bug fixes.
    * Static and Dynamic Analysis: Use analysis tools (AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer, Valgrind) during development and testing.
    * Fuzzing: Employ fuzzing techniques to test Embree's robustness against malformed data.
    * Isolate Embree Processing: Isolate Embree in a separate process or sandbox to limit vulnerability impact.

## Threat: [Use-After-Free and Double-Free Vulnerabilities in Embree](./threats/use-after-free_and_double-free_vulnerabilities_in_embree.md)

Description: Improper memory management within Embree could lead to use-after-free or double-free vulnerabilities. An attacker might trigger these by crafting specific scene data or interaction patterns that exploit memory management errors in Embree. This can result in memory corruption and potential exploitation.
Impact:
    * Code Execution: Potential to gain control of program execution.
    * Denial of Service (DoS): Application crash due to memory corruption.
Embree Component Affected:
    * Scene Management Module (e.g., `rtcNewScene`, `rtcReleaseScene`).
    * Geometry Management Module (e.g., `rtcNewGeometry`, `rtcReleaseGeometry`).
    * Internal Memory Allocation/Deallocation within Embree.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Regular Embree Updates: Keep Embree updated to benefit from memory management fixes.
    * Memory Sanitization Tools: Utilize memory sanitization tools during development and testing.
    * Careful Integration: Ensure proper memory management in application code interacting with Embree's API.
