## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Input Manipulation leading to Denial of Service (CPU/Memory Exhaustion)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_input_manipulation_leading_to_denial_of_service__cpumemory_exhaustion_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides a crafted scene description with an extremely high level of geometric complexity (e.g., a massive number of primitives, highly detailed meshes).
*   **Mechanism:** When the application uses Embree to process this scene, the excessive number of calculations or memory allocations required overwhelms the system's resources (CPU and RAM).
*   **Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive, potentially crashing or requiring a restart. This leads to a denial of service for legitimate users.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Relatively easy to generate complex scenes).
*   **Impact:** High (Application Unavailability).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploiting File Format Vulnerabilities to Achieve Arbitrary Code Execution](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploiting_file_format_vulnerabilities_to_achieve_arbitrary_code_execution.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the application loads Embree scene files from external sources, an attacker crafts a malicious scene file containing carefully designed data.
*   **Mechanism:** This malicious file exploits vulnerabilities in Embree's file parsing logic, specifically a buffer overflow. The oversized data in the file overwrites memory locations beyond the intended buffer, allowing the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:** The attacker gains complete control over the application's process and potentially the entire system. This is a critical security breach.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (Requires specific vulnerability and crafting of exploit).
*   **Impact:** Critical (Full System Compromise).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Resource Exhaustion leading to Denial of Service (Memory Exhaustion)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_resource_exhaustion_leading_to_denial_of_service__memory_exhaustion_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides input (e.g., a scene description) that forces Embree to allocate an excessive amount of memory.
*   **Mechanism:** This could be due to a large number of objects, extremely detailed geometry, or by exploiting potential memory leaks within Embree. The application's memory usage grows until it exhausts available resources.
*   **Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive, crashes, or the entire system may become unstable due to memory pressure. This results in a denial of service.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Possible through crafted input or triggering leaks).
*   **Impact:** High (Application Unavailability).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Resource Exhaustion leading to Denial of Service (CPU Exhaustion)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_resource_exhaustion_leading_to_denial_of_service__cpu_exhaustion_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides input that forces Embree to perform extremely complex and time-consuming ray tracing calculations.
*   **Mechanism:** This could involve scenes with intricate geometry, complex materials, or a large number of light sources. The CPU becomes overloaded trying to process these calculations.
*   **Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive or extremely slow, effectively denying service to legitimate users.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Achievable through complex scene design).
*   **Impact:** High (Application Unavailability).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities leading to Arbitrary Code Execution](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_memory_corruption_vulnerabilities_leading_to_arbitrary_code_execution.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides carefully crafted input that triggers a buffer overflow vulnerability within Embree's processing logic.
*   **Mechanism:** The input data exceeds the allocated buffer size, overwriting adjacent memory regions. The attacker can control the overwritten data to inject malicious code and redirect execution flow.
*   **Impact:** The attacker gains complete control over the application's process and potentially the entire system, allowing for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (Requires specific vulnerability and exploit crafting).
*   **Impact:** Critical (Full System Compromise).

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes and their Significance:](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes_and_their_significance.md)

*   **Compromise Application Using Embree:** This is the ultimate goal and therefore a critical node.
*   **Exploit Embree Vulnerability:**  This is the core requirement for achieving the goal, making it a critical node.
*   **Inject Malicious Scene Data:** A key step in many attack paths, especially those leading to DoS or memory corruption.
*   **Craft Malformed Scene File:** The point where malicious content is introduced when loading from files, crucial for file format exploits.
*   **Trigger Buffer Overflow during Parsing:** A specific vulnerability with critical impact (code execution).
*   **Achieve Arbitrary Code Execution:** The most severe outcome, representing complete compromise.
*   **Trigger Buffer Overflow:** A general category of memory corruption vulnerability with critical impact.
*   **Vulnerabilities in Dependencies:** While less directly Embree-related, vulnerabilities here can still compromise the application through Embree.
*   **Application Exposes Embree Functionality:** This node highlights how the application's design can create vulnerabilities.
*   **Application Directly Passes User-Controlled Data to Embree:** A common and dangerous practice that significantly increases the attack surface.
*   **Application Loads Embree Scenes from Untrusted Sources:** Introduces the risk of malicious file injection.
*   **Application Doesn't Properly Handle Errors Returned by Embree:** Can lead to unexpected behavior and exploitable states.
*   **Application Runs with Elevated Privileges:** Amplifies the impact of any successful exploit.
