# Attack Surface Analysis for embree/embree

## Attack Surface: [Malformed Geometry Data](./attack_surfaces/malformed_geometry_data.md)

*   **Description:** The application provides scene geometry data (vertices, indices, normals, etc.) to Embree for ray tracing. Maliciously crafted or invalid geometry data can exploit vulnerabilities in Embree's parsing or processing logic.
    *   **How Embree Contributes:** Embree's core functionality involves interpreting and processing this geometry data to build acceleration structures and perform ray intersections. Weaknesses in its parsing or handling of edge cases can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** Providing a triangle with duplicate or out-of-bounds vertex indices, excessively large coordinate values, or NaN values for vertex positions.
    *   **Impact:** Application crashes, denial of service (due to excessive processing or memory consumption), potential for memory corruption within Embree leading to more severe vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation on geometry data *before* passing it to Embree. This includes checking for valid ranges, data types, and structural integrity.
        *   Consider using a well-vetted and robust geometry loading library that performs its own validation before passing data to Embree.
        *   If possible, sanitize or normalize geometry data to fit within expected bounds.
        *   Keep Embree updated to the latest version, as updates often include bug fixes and security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Memory Safety Vulnerabilities within Embree](./attack_surfaces/memory_safety_vulnerabilities_within_embree.md)

*   **Description:**  Bugs within Embree's C++ codebase (e.g., buffer overflows, use-after-free) could be exploited if triggered by specific input or usage patterns.
    *   **How Embree Contributes:** As a native library, Embree is susceptible to common memory safety issues.
    *   **Example:**  Providing specific geometry data or ray parameters that trigger a buffer overflow in an internal Embree function.
    *   **Impact:** Application crashes, denial of service, potential for arbitrary code execution on the system running the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if exploitable for code execution), High (for crashes and DoS)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Embree updated to the latest version. The Embree development team actively addresses bugs and security vulnerabilities.
        *   Report any suspected crashes or unexpected behavior to the Embree developers to help identify and fix potential issues.
        *   While direct mitigation within the application might be limited, robust input validation can help prevent triggering certain types of memory safety issues.
