## 3. Architectural Overview

The `node-oracledb` project acts as a vital intermediary, enabling seamless communication between Node.js applications and Oracle Databases. It leverages Node.js's native addon capabilities, specifically N-API, to interface with Oracle Client libraries. The core functionalities include:

*   Establishing and managing connections to Oracle Databases, including support for connection strings and connection pools.
*   Executing a wide range of SQL and PL/SQL statements, including DML, DDL, and stored procedures.
*   Retrieving data from the database in various formats, handling different data types and large objects (LOBs).
*   Managing database transactions with support for commit and rollback operations.
*   Providing features for advanced database interactions, such as fetching metadata and handling events.

The architecture is structured into distinct layers, each with specific responsibilities:

*   **Node.js Application Layer:** The user's application code, written in JavaScript or TypeScript, that utilizes the `node-oracledb` API to interact with the database.
*   **`node-oracledb` JavaScript Layer:** The JavaScript codebase within the `node-oracledb` module. This layer exposes the high-level API, handles user requests, and orchestrates interactions with the native addon.
*   **`node-oracledb` Native Addon Layer (C/C++):** A native Node.js addon implemented in C/C++, utilizing Node-API (N-API) for stability across Node.js versions. This layer serves as the critical bridge between the JavaScript layer and the Oracle Client libraries, managing low-level communication and data transformation.
*   **Oracle Client Libraries:** A suite of libraries provided by Oracle (e.g., OCI - Oracle Call Interface, Network Layer) that are essential for establishing connections, sending requests, and receiving responses from the Oracle Database. These libraries must be installed on the system running the Node.js application.
*   **Oracle Database Server:** The target Oracle Database instance responsible for storing, processing, and managing data.
