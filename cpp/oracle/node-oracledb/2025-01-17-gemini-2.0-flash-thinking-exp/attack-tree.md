## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in how the application is configured, particularly concerning database connection details and credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Access Stored Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__access_stored_credentials.md)

*   This critical node represents the direct compromise of database credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Read Credentials from Environment Variables [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/read_credentials_from_environment_variables__high_risk_.md)

*   Attackers can attempt to access environment variables where credentials might be stored. This can occur through server-side vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or direct server access. Successful access grants full database privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Read Credentials from Configuration Files [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/read_credentials_from_configuration_files__high_risk_.md)

*   Attackers target configuration files (e.g., `.env`, `config.json`) where credentials might be stored without proper protection (e.g., weak file permissions). Access to these files provides the attacker with the necessary credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Insufficient Access Controls on Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_insufficient_access_controls_on_configuration.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Access Configuration Files with Sensitive Information [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/access_configuration_files_with_sensitive_information__high_risk_.md)

*   If configuration files containing database credentials or connection details are not adequately protected with appropriate file system permissions, attackers can read them. This provides them with the information needed to connect to the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Query Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__exploit_query_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This path centers on manipulating how the application interacts with the database through SQL queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Perform SQL Injection](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__perform_sql_injection.md)

*   This critical node represents the exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious SQL via Unsanitized User Input [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_sql_via_unsanitized_user_input__high_risk_.md)

*   If user-provided data is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization, attackers can inject malicious SQL code. This allows them to bypass application logic, access unauthorized data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Dependencies and Installation](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_dependencies_and_installation.md)

*   This path focuses on vulnerabilities introduced through the application's dependencies, including `node-oracledb` itself and its transitive dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Transitive Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_transitive_dependencies.md)

*   This critical node highlights the risk of vulnerabilities within the Oracle Client Libraries, which `node-oracledb` relies upon.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Oracle Client Libraries [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_known_vulnerabilities_in_oracle_client_libraries__high_risk_.md)

*   Attackers can exploit known security flaws in the underlying Oracle Client Libraries. These vulnerabilities can range from information disclosure to remote code execution on the application or database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Outdated or Vulnerable node-oracledb Version](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__exploit_outdated_or_vulnerable_node-oracledb_version.md)

*   This critical node emphasizes the danger of using outdated versions of the `node-oracledb` library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Target Known Vulnerabilities in Older Versions [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/target_known_vulnerabilities_in_older_versions__high_risk_.md)

*   Attackers can target known security vulnerabilities present in older versions of `node-oracledb`. Publicly available exploits for these vulnerabilities can be used to compromise the application, potentially leading to data breaches or remote code execution.
