# Threat Model Analysis for oracle/node-oracledb

## Threat: [Connection String Injection](./threats/connection_string_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate parts of the database connection string if it's dynamically constructed based on user input or external data without proper sanitization. The attacker might inject malicious connection parameters to connect to a different database, use a different user, or potentially execute arbitrary code on the database server (depending on database configuration). This directly involves how the application uses `node-oracledb`'s connection API.

**Impact:** Connecting to unintended databases, unauthorized access with different privileges, potential remote code execution on the database server.

**Affected Component:** The application logic responsible for constructing the connection string passed to `node-oracledb.getConnection()`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid dynamic construction of connection strings based on untrusted input.
* If dynamic construction is necessary, strictly validate and sanitize all input components.
* Consider using connection pools with pre-defined, secure connection configurations.

## Threat: [Lack of TLS/SSL Encryption for Database Connections](./threats/lack_of_tlsssl_encryption_for_database_connections.md)

**Description:** An attacker could intercept network traffic between the Node.js application and the Oracle database if the connection is not encrypted using TLS/SSL. This allows the attacker to eavesdrop on sensitive data, including credentials and query results. This directly relates to how `node-oracledb` establishes and manages the network connection.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transmitted over the network, including database credentials and application data.

**Affected Component:** The underlying network communication established by `node-oracledb` when connecting to the Oracle database.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure `node-oracledb` to enforce TLS/SSL encryption for database connections using the `connectString` options.
* Ensure the Oracle database server is configured to support and require encrypted connections.
* Verify the TLS/SSL configuration and certificate validity.

## Threat: [SQL Injection Vulnerabilities](./threats/sql_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code into application queries by manipulating user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized or parameterized. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially bypassing security controls and gaining unauthorized access to or manipulation of data. This is a direct consequence of how the application uses `node-oracledb` to execute queries.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion; potential execution of arbitrary commands on the database server.

**Affected Component:** The `execute`, `executeMany`, or `query` functions within the `node-oracledb` API where SQL queries are constructed and executed.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by `node-oracledb`.
* Avoid string concatenation for building SQL queries with user input.
* Implement input validation and sanitization on the application side, but rely primarily on parameterized queries for SQL injection prevention.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `node-oracledb` Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__node-oracledb__library_itself.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the `node-oracledb` library code. This could lead to various issues, including remote code execution within the Node.js process, denial of service, or information disclosure. This threat directly stems from the security of the `node-oracledb` codebase.

**Impact:** Potential compromise of the Node.js application server, leading to data breaches, service disruption, or other malicious activities.

**Affected Component:** The core modules and native bindings of the `node-oracledb` library.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical to High depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update `node-oracledb` to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
* Subscribe to security advisories related to `node-oracledb` and its dependencies.
* Implement a process for promptly applying security updates.

## Threat: [Native Code Vulnerabilities](./threats/native_code_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** `node-oracledb` relies on native code components (Oracle Client libraries). Vulnerabilities in these native components could be exploited by an attacker. This directly impacts the security of the `node-oracledb` library as it relies on these native components.

**Impact:** Potential for memory corruption, crashes, or even arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Affected Component:** The native bindings and the underlying Oracle Client libraries used by `node-oracledb`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the Oracle Client libraries updated to the latest versions provided by Oracle.
* Monitor security advisories related to the Oracle Client libraries.
* Ensure the native components are obtained from trusted sources.
