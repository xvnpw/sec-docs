## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Node-oracledb Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_node-oracledb_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

* **Compromise Application via Node-oracledb Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. If successful, the attacker gains unauthorized access to the application's data, functionality, or the underlying database by exploiting weaknesses within the `node-oracledb` library or its usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Database Connections Facilitated by node-oracledb Usage](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_database_connections_facilitated_by_node-oracledb_usage.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept and Modify Communication Between Application and Database](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_and_modify_communication_between_application_and_database.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Credential Sniffing (if credentials are not securely managed when used with node-oracledb) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/credential_sniffing__if_credentials_are_not_securely_managed_when_used_with_node-oracledb___critical_5c540cda.md)

* **Credential Sniffing (if credentials are not securely managed when used with node-oracledb) (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Attack Vector:** If the connection between the application and the database is not properly secured (e.g., using unencrypted connections or weak encryption), or if database credentials are not securely managed within the application's code or configuration, an attacker can intercept these credentials as they are transmitted over the network.
    * **How it Works:** Attackers can use network sniffing tools to capture network traffic between the application server and the database server. If the connection is not encrypted or uses weak encryption, the credentials can be extracted from the captured packets. Similarly, if credentials are hardcoded or stored in easily accessible configuration files, attackers who gain access to the application server can retrieve them.
    * **Impact:** Successful credential sniffing provides the attacker with valid credentials to access the database directly. This bypasses application-level security controls and allows the attacker to read, modify, or delete data, potentially compromising the entire application and its data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Indirect Attacks via Application Logic Flaws Exposed by node-oracledb Usage (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/indirect_attacks_via_application_logic_flaws_exposed_by_node-oracledb_usage__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Indirect Attacks via Application Logic Flaws Exposed by node-oracledb Usage (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    * This category encompasses attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in the application's code, specifically related to how it interacts with the `node-oracledb` library. These flaws often arise from improper handling of user input when constructing database queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection Vulnerabilities Due to Improper Query Construction with node-oracledb (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection_vulnerabilities_due_to_improper_query_construction_with_node-oracledb__critical_node___635240a4.md)

* **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities Due to Improper Query Construction with node-oracledb (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH):**
    * This is a critical class of vulnerabilities that arises when user-provided data is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    * **Impact:** Successful SQL injection can allow attackers to:
        * **Bypass authentication and authorization:** Gain access to data they are not supposed to see or modify.
        * **Read sensitive data:** Extract confidential information from the database.
        * **Modify or delete data:** Alter or destroy critical data.
        * **Execute arbitrary SQL commands:** Potentially gain control over the database server or even the underlying operating system.

## Attack Tree Path: [String Concatenation in Queries (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/string_concatenation_in_queries__high_risk_path_.md)

* **String Concatenation in Queries (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    * **Attack Vector:** This occurs when user-provided input is directly concatenated into SQL query strings.
    * **How it Works:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code within the user input, which is then treated as part of the SQL query by the database. For example, if a query is constructed like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '` + userInput + `'`, an attacker could input `' OR '1'='1` to bypass the username check.
    * **Impact:** This is a highly prevalent and easily exploitable form of SQL injection, leading to the impacts described above.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insufficient Input Validation Before Query Execution (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/insufficient_input_validation_before_query_execution__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Insufficient Input Validation Before Query Execution (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    * **Attack Vector:**  While input validation might be present, it is insufficient to prevent malicious SQL injection attempts. This could involve inadequate filtering of special characters or not accounting for all possible injection vectors.
    * **How it Works:** Attackers can craft input that bypasses the validation rules but is still interpreted as malicious SQL by the database. This often involves understanding the specific validation logic and finding ways to circumvent it.
    * **Impact:** Similar to string concatenation, successful exploitation leads to SQL injection and its associated impacts.
