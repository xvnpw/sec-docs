# Threat Model Analysis for oracle/node-oracledb

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion Attack](./threats/dependency_confusion_attack.md)

**Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious package with a similar name to `node-oracledb` or its dependencies on a public or private npm registry. Developers might mistakenly install this malicious package instead of the legitimate one. The attacker could then execute arbitrary code within the application's environment during the installation process or at runtime when the application attempts to load the module.

**Impact:** Code execution on the server hosting the application, potentially leading to data exfiltration, application compromise, or further attacks on the infrastructure. This can also compromise the supply chain if the affected application is distributed further.

**Affected Component:** Installation process, `require()` statements when loading `node-oracledb`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement dependency pinning and integrity checks using `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` with integrity hashes.
* Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities and potentially malicious packages.
* Verify the authenticity and source of packages before installation.
* Consider using private npm registries for internal dependencies to have more control over the supply chain.

## Threat: [Compromised npm Registry Delivering Malicious `node-oracledb`](./threats/compromised_npm_registry_delivering_malicious__node-oracledb_.md)

**Description:** If the npm registry itself is compromised, attackers could potentially inject malicious code into legitimate versions of the `node-oracledb` package. Developers downloading the package would unknowingly include this malicious code in their application. This malicious code would then execute within the context of the Node.js application.

**Impact:** Code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to perform any action the application has permissions for, including data exfiltration, modification, or further system compromise.

**Affected Component:** Installation process of `node-oracledb`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Monitor npm security advisories and community discussions for any reports of compromised packages.
* Consider using alternative package management solutions or private registries for critical dependencies where greater control and auditing are possible.
* Implement runtime integrity checks for loaded modules, although this can be complex to implement effectively.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Transitive Dependencies (Oracle Client Libraries)](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_transitive_dependencies__oracle_client_libraries_.md)

**Description:** `node-oracledb` relies on underlying Oracle Client Libraries (OCI), which are typically native C libraries. Security vulnerabilities in these C libraries can be exploited through `node-oracledb`. An attacker could craft specific inputs or trigger certain operations via `node-oracledb` that exploit these vulnerabilities in the underlying OCI, potentially leading to memory corruption or arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** Crashes, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution on the server hosting the application, potentially allowing the attacker to gain complete control of the system.

**Affected Component:** The underlying C library interactions and bindings within `node-oracledb`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep `node-oracledb` updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for vulnerabilities in the underlying client libraries.
* Monitor security advisories related to Oracle Client Libraries and ensure the system where the application runs has the latest recommended versions installed.

## Threat: [Exposure of Hardcoded Database Credentials](./threats/exposure_of_hardcoded_database_credentials.md)

**Description:** Developers might hardcode database credentials directly within the application code or configuration files used by `node-oracledb` for establishing database connections (e.g., in the `oracledb.getConnection()` call). An attacker gaining access to the codebase (through a compromised repository, server access, etc.) can easily retrieve these credentials.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Oracle database, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or deletion. The attacker could also use these credentials to pivot to other systems or escalate privileges within the database.

**Affected Component:** Connection configuration within the application code using `oracledb.getConnection()`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Never hardcode credentials.**
* Utilize secure credential management solutions like environment variables, secrets management services (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault), or configuration management tools that handle secrets securely.
* Ensure proper access controls on configuration files and the application deployment environment.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Connection Strings](./threats/insecure_storage_of_connection_strings.md)

**Description:** Connection strings, which often contain database credentials, are stored insecurely in configuration files (e.g., plain text), environment variables without proper protection, or within logging outputs used by the application with `node-oracledb`. An attacker gaining access to these locations can obtain the connection details, including credentials.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Oracle database, leading to potential data breaches, data manipulation, or deletion. The attacker can directly connect to the database, bypassing application-level security measures.

**Affected Component:** Configuration mechanisms used by the application to provide connection details to `oracledb.getConnection()`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Encrypt connection strings at rest and in transit if possible.
* Restrict access to configuration files and environment variables using appropriate file system permissions and access control mechanisms.
* Avoid logging connection strings or sensitive parts of them.

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Unsanitized Input in Queries](./threats/sql_injection_via_unsanitized_input_in_queries.md)

**Description:** While not a vulnerability *in* `node-oracledb` itself, the library provides the functionality to execute SQL queries. If the application constructs SQL queries by directly embedding unsanitized user input into the query string passed to methods like `connection.execute()` or `connection.query()`, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code. This injected code is then executed against the Oracle database.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, allowing the attacker to read sensitive information, modify or delete data, bypass authentication mechanisms, or potentially execute arbitrary commands on the database server.

**Affected Component:** `connection.execute()`, `connection.query()` when used with dynamically constructed queries.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Always use parameterized queries (bind variables)** provided by `node-oracledb`. This is the primary and most effective defense against SQL injection.
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all user-provided data before using it in SQL queries as a secondary defense layer.

## Threat: [Use of Outdated `node-oracledb` Version with Known Vulnerabilities](./threats/use_of_outdated__node-oracledb__version_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Using an outdated version of the `node-oracledb` library means the application might be vulnerable to known security flaws that have been identified and patched in later versions. Attackers can exploit these known vulnerabilities if the application uses an older, unpatched version of the library.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability, but it could range from information disclosure and denial of service to remote code execution on the server hosting the application.

**Affected Component:** The entire `node-oracledb` library.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, potentially Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update `node-oracledb` to the latest stable version to benefit from security fixes and improvements.
* Monitor security advisories and release notes for `node-oracledb` to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities and necessary updates.
* Implement automated dependency update mechanisms and processes.
