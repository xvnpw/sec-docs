# Attack Surface Analysis for oracle/node-oracledb

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker injects malicious SQL code into application input fields, which is then executed by the database, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
    *   **How node-oracledb Contributes:**  `node-oracledb` provides functions like `connection.execute()` that can execute arbitrary SQL queries. If the application constructs SQL queries by directly concatenating user input without proper sanitization or using parameterized queries, `node-oracledb` will execute the malicious SQL.
    *   **Example:**
        ```javascript
        const employeeId = req.query.id; // User-provided input
        const sql = `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = ${employeeId}`; // Vulnerable concatenation
        connection.execute(sql);
        // Attacker provides id: '1 OR 1=1 --'
        // Resulting SQL: SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = 1 OR 1=1 --
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Full database compromise, data exfiltration, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use parameterized queries (bind variables):** This is the primary defense against SQL injection. `node-oracledb` supports bind parameters, which treat user input as data, not executable code.
        *   **Input validation and sanitization:** While not a primary defense against SQL injection, validating and sanitizing user input can help prevent other types of attacks and reduce the attack surface. However, rely on parameterized queries for SQL injection prevention.

## Attack Surface: [Hardcoded or Poorly Managed Database Credentials](./attack_surfaces/hardcoded_or_poorly_managed_database_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Database credentials (username, password) are stored directly in the application code or configuration files without proper encryption or secure management.
    *   **How node-oracledb Contributes:** `node-oracledb` requires database credentials to establish a connection. If these credentials are exposed, attackers can directly connect to the database, bypassing application security.
    *   **Example:**
        ```javascript
        // Insecurely stored credentials
        const dbConfig = {
          user: 'myuser',
          password: 'mypassword',
          connectString: 'localhost/XE'
        };
        oracledb.getConnection(dbConfig);
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Full database compromise, unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never hardcode credentials directly in the code.**
        *   **Use environment variables:** Store sensitive information like database credentials in environment variables.
        *   **Use secure configuration management tools:** Tools like HashiCorp Vault or cloud provider secrets managers can securely store and manage credentials.
        *   **Encrypt configuration files:** If storing credentials in configuration files is unavoidable, encrypt them properly.

## Attack Surface: [Connection String Injection](./attack_surfaces/connection_string_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates parts of the database connection string used by `node-oracledb`, potentially leading to connections to unauthorized databases or using different credentials.
    *   **How node-oracledb Contributes:** If the application dynamically constructs the connection string based on user input or external sources without proper sanitization, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:**
        ```javascript
        const dbHost = req.query.dbHost; // User-provided input
        const dbConfig = {
          user: 'appuser',
          password: 'apppassword',
          connectString: `${dbHost}/XE` // Vulnerable concatenation
        };
        oracledb.getConnection(dbConfig);
        // Attacker provides dbHost: 'malicioushost.com'
        ```
    *   **Impact:** High - Connection to unauthorized databases, potential data breaches in other systems, use of unintended credentials.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid dynamic construction of connection strings based on untrusted input.**
        *   **Use a predefined, secure connection configuration.**
        *   **If dynamic configuration is necessary, strictly validate and sanitize all input components of the connection string.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Connection Configuration (No TLS/SSL)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_connection_configuration__no_tlsssl_.md)

*   **Description:** The connection between the Node.js application and the Oracle database is not encrypted using TLS/SSL, allowing eavesdropping and interception of sensitive data, including credentials and query results.
    *   **How node-oracledb Contributes:** `node-oracledb` provides options for establishing secure connections. Failure to configure these options properly leaves the connection vulnerable.
    *   **Example:**  Using the default connection settings without explicitly enabling TLS/SSL.
    *   **Impact:** High - Exposure of database credentials, sensitive data in transit, potential man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always configure `node-oracledb` to use TLS/SSL for database connections.** Refer to the `node-oracledb` documentation for specific configuration options.
        *   **Ensure the Oracle database server is also configured to enforce TLS/SSL connections.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in `node-oracledb` or Underlying Oracle Client Libraries](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in__node-oracledb__or_underlying_oracle_client_libraries.md)

*   **Description:**  Security vulnerabilities exist within the `node-oracledb` library itself or in the underlying Oracle Client libraries it depends on.
    *   **How node-oracledb Contributes:** The application directly uses `node-oracledb`, so any vulnerabilities in the library can be exploited through the application.
    *   **Example:** A known buffer overflow vulnerability in a specific version of `node-oracledb` could be triggered by sending specially crafted data.
    *   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the vulnerability, ranging from denial of service to remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  Can range from Medium to Critical depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep `node-oracledb` updated to the latest stable version.** Regularly check for updates and apply them promptly.
        *   **Keep the underlying Oracle Client libraries updated.** Ensure the client libraries used by `node-oracledb` are also patched against known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Monitor security advisories for `node-oracledb` and Oracle Client libraries.**
