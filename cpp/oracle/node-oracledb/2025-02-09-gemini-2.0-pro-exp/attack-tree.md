## Attack Tree Path: [1. SQL Injection [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__sql_injection__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries through application inputs. This is a classic and highly effective attack if input validation and parameterized queries are not used correctly.
*   **Critical Node:**
    *   **1.1.1 Direct SQL Query Construction:**
        *   **Description:**  The application constructs SQL queries by directly concatenating user-provided input with SQL strings, without using bind variables. This is the most severe form of SQL injection.
        *   **Example:**  `query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + userInput + "'";`
        *   **Mitigation:**  *Always* use parameterized queries (bind variables) with `node-oracledb`. Never construct SQL queries by concatenating strings.  Use input validation as defense-in-depth, but *not* as a replacement for bind variables.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Credential/Configuration Attacks [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__credentialconfiguration_attacks__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers gain access to database credentials through various insecure practices.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **3.1.1 In Source Code:**
        *   **Description:**  Database credentials are hardcoded directly within the application's source code.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Never store credentials in source code. Use environment variables, a secure configuration management system, or a dedicated secrets management solution.
    *   **3.1.2 In Configuration Files:**
        *   **Description:**  Credentials are stored in unencrypted configuration files.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Never store credentials in unencrypted files. Use encrypted configuration files or a secrets management solution.
    *   **3.2.1 Oracle Default Accounts:**
        *   **Description:**  The application uses default Oracle accounts (e.g., `SYS`, `SYSTEM`) with their default passwords unchanged.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Change default passwords immediately after installation. Use dedicated, non-privileged accounts for applications.
    *   **3.2.2 Easily Guessable Passwords:**
        *   **Description:**  The application uses weak or easily guessable passwords for database accounts.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity, rotation).
    *   **3.3.1 Plaintext Files:**
        *   **Description:** Credentials stored in unencrypted plain text files.
        *   **Mitigation:** Never store credentials in plain text. Use a secure secrets management solution.
    *   **3.4.1 Weak Password Policies:**
        *   **Description:** The application or database allows users to set weak passwords.
        *   **Mitigation:** Enforce strong password policies, including minimum length, complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and regular password changes.
    *   **3.4.2 Lack of Account Lockout:**
        *   **Description:** The application or database does not lock accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement account lockout mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks.

*   **High-Risk Sub-Paths:**
    *   **3.3 Insecure Storage of Credentials:**  This encompasses various ways credentials can be exposed if not properly secured.
    *   **3.4 Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force:** This attack vector becomes highly effective if weak passwords are allowed and there's no account lockout.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Privilege Escalation (via Database) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/5__privilege_escalation__via_database___high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within the Oracle Database to gain higher privileges than initially granted.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **5.1.1 Unpatched Oracle DB Instance:**
        *   **Description:**  The Oracle Database server is running an outdated version with known security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Keep the Oracle Database instance patched and up-to-date. Regularly apply security patches.
    *   **5.2.1 Excessive Privileges Granted to Application User:**
        *   **Description:**  The database user account used by the application has more privileges than necessary for its intended functionality.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Follow the principle of least privilege. Grant the application's database user only the minimum necessary permissions. Use roles and fine-grained access control.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (if TLS misconfigured) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/6__man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks__if_tls_misconfigured___high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers intercept and potentially modify the communication between the application and the database server. This is possible if TLS/SSL is not used or is misconfigured.
*   **Critical Node:**
    *   **6.1.1 Missing or Invalid TLS Certificates:**
        *   **Description:**  The database connection is not using TLS, or the TLS certificate is invalid (expired, self-signed without proper trust, etc.).
        *   **Mitigation:**  *Always* use TLS/SSL for database connections. Configure `node-oracledb` to use a secure connection string. Verify the database server's certificate. Use strong cipher suites.
