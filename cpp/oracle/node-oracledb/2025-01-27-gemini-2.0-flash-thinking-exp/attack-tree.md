## Attack Tree Path: [Code Injection Vulnerabilities -> SQL Injection via node-oracledb API flaws](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection_vulnerabilities_-_sql_injection_via_node-oracledb_api_flaws.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Parameter Manipulation leading to Unsafe Query Construction:**
        *   Attacker identifies API endpoints that use `node-oracledb` to interact with the database.
        *   Attacker analyzes application code to find instances of dynamic SQL query construction where user-controlled input is directly embedded into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
        *   Attacker crafts malicious input (e.g., through web forms, API requests, query parameters) containing SQL injection payloads.
        *   These payloads are injected into the dynamically constructed SQL queries executed by `node-oracledb`.
    *   **Outcome: Execute Arbitrary SQL Queries:**
        *   Successful SQL injection allows the attacker to bypass intended application logic and directly interact with the database.
        *   Attackers can perform actions such as:
            *   **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive data from database tables.
            *   **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting data in the database.
            *   **Authentication Bypass:** Circumventing application authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access.
            *   **Privilege Escalation:** Potentially gaining higher database privileges if the application user has excessive permissions.
            *   **Denial of Service:** Crafting queries that overload the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) via node-oracledb](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__via_node-oracledb.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion through Connection Leaks:**
        *   Attacker analyzes application code to understand how `node-oracledb` connections are managed.
        *   Attacker identifies scenarios where connections might not be properly closed or released (e.g., in error handling paths, asynchronous operations, or due to application logic flaws).
        *   Attacker sends a large volume of requests to the application that trigger the connection opening logic but intentionally avoid the connection closing logic.
        *   This leads to a rapid consumption of database connection pool resources.
        *   Eventually, the database server or application server runs out of available connections.
    *   **CPU or Memory Exhaustion via Malicious Queries:**
        *   Attacker identifies API endpoints that allow the application to execute database queries, especially those that might involve complex operations or user-controlled query parameters.
        *   Attacker crafts and sends malicious SQL queries designed to consume excessive database server resources (CPU, memory, I/O). Examples include:
            *   **Cartesian Product Queries:** Queries that join large tables without proper filtering, resulting in massive result sets.
            *   **Large Sort Operations:** Queries that require sorting extremely large datasets.
            *   **Recursive Queries (if applicable):**  Queries that can run indefinitely or consume excessive resources if not properly controlled.
        *   Execution of these malicious queries overloads the database server, causing slow performance or complete denial of service for the application and potentially other applications sharing the same database.
    *   **Outcome: Application Unavailability / Database Overload:**
        *   DoS attacks can render the application unusable for legitimate users.
        *   In severe cases, they can crash the database server or impact other applications relying on the same database infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Oracle Client Libraries (Dependency of node-oracledb)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_oracle_client_libraries__dependency_of_node-oracledb_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Oracle Client Libraries (OCI, etc.):**
        *   Attacker identifies the specific version of Oracle Client Libraries used by the `node-oracledb` application (often through server fingerprinting, error messages, or by analyzing application dependencies).
        *   Attacker researches known vulnerabilities (CVEs) associated with the identified Oracle Client Libraries version using public vulnerability databases and Oracle Security Alerts (Critical Patch Updates - CPUs).
        *   If vulnerable versions are found, attacker attempts to exploit these vulnerabilities. Common vulnerability types in native libraries include:
            *   **Buffer Overflows:** Exploiting memory corruption flaws to overwrite memory and potentially gain control of program execution.
            *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Exploiting vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on the server.
            *   **Denial of Service:** Triggering crashes or resource exhaustion in the Oracle Client Libraries.
        *   Exploitation is often achieved by sending specially crafted data or requests through `node-oracledb` that are processed by the vulnerable Oracle Client Libraries.
    *   **Outcome: Arbitrary Code Execution / Data Exfiltration / Denial of Service:**
        *   Successful exploitation of Oracle Client Library vulnerabilities can have severe consequences:
            *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attacker gains complete control of the server, allowing them to install malware, steal data, or perform any other malicious action.
            *   **Data Exfiltration:** Attacker can directly access and steal sensitive data from the database or the server's file system.
            *   **Denial of Service:** Attacker can crash the application or the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Configuration or Usage of node-oracledb in Application -> Insecure Connection String Management (Hardcoded/Plain Text Credentials)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_configuration_or_usage_of_node-oracledb_in_application_-_insecure_connection_string_managem_a2cb21d8.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Hardcoded Credentials in Application Code:**
        *   Attacker analyzes application source code (if accessible through source code repositories, misconfigured web servers, or decompilation).
        *   Attacker searches for hardcoded database credentials (usernames, passwords) directly embedded within the code (e.g., in connection strings, configuration variables, or database connection functions).
    *   **Credentials Stored in Plain Text Configuration Files:**
        *   Attacker attempts to access application configuration files (e.g., `.env` files, `config.json`, `.ini` files) that are often used to store database connection settings.
        *   Access can be gained through:
            *   **Misconfigured Web Servers:**  Web servers incorrectly configured to serve configuration files directly.
            *   **Directory Traversal Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities to access files outside the web root.
            *   **Source Code Repository Exposure:**  Accidental or intentional exposure of `.git` or other repository directories.
    *   **Outcome: Direct Access to Database / Credential Exposure:**
        *   Compromised database credentials allow the attacker to directly connect to the database using those credentials, bypassing application security controls.
        *   Attackers can then perform any action authorized for the compromised database user, including data access, modification, deletion, and potentially more depending on the user's privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Excessive Database Privileges Granted to Application User](./attack_tree_paths/excessive_database_privileges_granted_to_application_user.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Excessive Privileges Amplifying Other Vulnerabilities:**
        *   This is not a direct attack vector itself, but rather a condition that significantly increases the impact of other vulnerabilities (like SQL injection).
        *   If the database user used by the `node-oracledb` application is granted overly broad privileges (e.g., `DBA` role, `SELECT ANY TABLE`, `CREATE TABLE` when not needed), an attacker who successfully exploits another vulnerability (like SQL injection) can leverage these excessive privileges to:
            *   **Access Sensitive Data Beyond Application Scope:** Access data in database tables that are not intended for the application to access.
            *   **Modify Database Schema:** Alter database tables, views, or procedures, potentially disrupting the application or other systems.
            *   **Escalate Privileges:**  Potentially create new database users with higher privileges or grant themselves more privileges within the database.
    *   **Outcome: Amplified Impact of Compromise:**
        *   Excessive privileges dramatically increase the potential damage from a successful application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Logging Practices -> Logging Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_logging_practices_-_logging_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Logging Sensitive Data:**
        *   Developers may inadvertently or intentionally log sensitive information in application logs for debugging or monitoring purposes. Examples include:
            *   **SQL Queries with Sensitive Data:** Logging full SQL queries that contain sensitive data from user inputs or database tables.
            *   **Connection Strings:** Logging database connection strings that may contain usernames and passwords (even if masked, they can sometimes be reversed).
            *   **User Credentials:**  Accidentally logging user passwords or API keys.
        *   If these logs are not properly secured, attackers can gain access to them through:
            *   **Log File Access:**  Compromising the server or application to access log files directly.
            *   **Log Management System Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in centralized logging systems.
            *   **Accidental Exposure:** Logs being stored in publicly accessible locations.
    *   **Outcome: Exposure of Sensitive Data in Logs:**
        *   Compromised logs can reveal sensitive information that attackers can use for further attacks, such as:
            *   **Credential Theft:** Using exposed credentials to gain unauthorized access to the database or other systems.
            *   **Data Breach:**  Accessing and stealing sensitive data logged in the application logs.
            *   **Reconnaissance:**  Gaining insights into application logic, database schema, or internal systems from log data.
