# Threat Model Analysis for oracle/node-oracledb

## Threat: [SQL Injection](./threats/sql_injection.md)

Description: An attacker injects malicious SQL code into input fields or parameters used in SQL queries executed by `node-oracledb`. This is achieved by manipulating user input before it's properly sanitized and used in database queries. Successful injection allows attackers to bypass application logic, access unauthorized data, modify or delete data, or potentially execute database commands.
Impact: Data breach, data manipulation, data loss, unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential database server compromise, denial of service.
Affected node-oracledb Component: `oracledb.getConnection()`, `connection.execute()`, `connection.executeMany()`, and any function executing SQL queries if dynamic SQL is constructed insecurely.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Always use parameterized queries (bind variables) with `connection.execute()` and `connection.executeMany()`.
    * Validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them in SQL queries, even with parameterized queries.
    * Apply the principle of least privilege to database user accounts used by the application.

## Threat: [PL/SQL Injection](./threats/plsql_injection.md)

Description: Similar to SQL Injection, but targeting PL/SQL code blocks executed through `node-oracledb`. Attackers inject malicious PL/SQL code into inputs used within PL/SQL blocks called by the application. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary PL/SQL code, potentially granting elevated privileges or allowing manipulation of database objects and data beyond intended application functionality.
Impact: Data breach, data manipulation, data loss, unauthorized access, potential database server compromise, execution of arbitrary code within the database server.
Affected node-oracledb Component: `connection.execute()` when executing PL/SQL blocks, `connection.callProc()`, `connection.callFunc()`, and any function executing PL/SQL if dynamic PL/SQL is constructed insecurely.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Parameterize PL/SQL calls using bind variables when calling procedures or functions with `connection.callProc()` and `connection.callFunc()` or when executing PL/SQL blocks with `connection.execute()`.
    * Validate and sanitize user inputs intended for use within PL/SQL blocks.
    * Regularly review PL/SQL code for potential injection vulnerabilities and enforce secure coding practices.

## Threat: [Connection String Exposure](./threats/connection_string_exposure.md)

Description: Attackers gain unauthorized access to database connection strings, which are necessary for `node-oracledb` to connect to the database. This exposure can occur through insecure storage in configuration files, environment variables, code repositories, or logs. If the connection string contains database credentials, attackers can directly connect to the database, bypassing application security measures.
Impact: Full database compromise, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, unauthorized access to all data within the database.
Affected node-oracledb Component: Indirectly affects `oracledb.getConnection()` as it relies on connection strings. The vulnerability lies in how connection strings are managed and stored by the application.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Never hardcode credentials directly in application code.
    * Store connection strings in secure environment variables or use dedicated secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
    * Restrict access to configuration files and environment variables containing connection strings.
    * Encrypt connection strings at rest if supported by the deployment environment.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `node-oracledb` Library](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__node-oracledb__library.md)

Description: The `node-oracledb` library itself may contain security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated versions of `node-oracledb` to compromise the application or the underlying system. Exploitation could lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
Impact: Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, application compromise.
Affected node-oracledb Component: The entire `node-oracledb` module.
Risk Severity: High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Regularly update `node-oracledb` to the latest stable version.
    * Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in `node-oracledb` and its dependencies.
    * Monitor security advisories for `node-oracledb` and the Node.js ecosystem.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `node-oracledb` Native Dependencies (Oracle Client Libraries)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__node-oracledb__native_dependencies__oracle_client_libraries_.md)

Description: `node-oracledb` relies on native Oracle Client libraries. Vulnerabilities in these underlying native components can be exploited by attackers. Exploiting vulnerabilities in Oracle Client libraries can lead to similar impacts as vulnerabilities within `node-oracledb` itself, potentially allowing remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
Impact: Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, application compromise, potential system compromise.
Affected node-oracledb Component: Native components of `node-oracledb`, specifically the Oracle Client libraries.
Risk Severity: High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Keep Oracle Client libraries up-to-date and patched against known vulnerabilities. Follow Oracle's security recommendations for client libraries.
    * Regularly rebuild native modules like `node-oracledb` when updating Node.js or system libraries to ensure compatibility and incorporate security fixes.
