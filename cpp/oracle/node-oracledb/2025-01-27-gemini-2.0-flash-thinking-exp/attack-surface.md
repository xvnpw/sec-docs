# Attack Surface Analysis for oracle/node-oracledb

## Attack Surface: [1. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/1__sql_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious SQL code into database queries, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or execution of arbitrary commands on the database server.
*   **node-oracledb Contribution:** `node-oracledb` executes SQL queries provided by the application. If applications dynamically construct SQL queries by concatenating user input without proper sanitization or parameterization, it directly enables SQL injection through `node-oracledb`.
*   **Example:** An application builds a SQL query using string concatenation with user input for filtering products: `SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '` + user\_provided\_category + `'`. An attacker could input `' OR 1=1; DROP TABLE users; --` as `user_provided_category`, leading to unintended database operations executed by `node-oracledb`.
*   **Impact:** Critical data breach, data modification or deletion, potential for complete database compromise and control, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Parameterized Queries (Bind Variables):**  Exclusively use parameterized queries offered by `node-oracledb` (using `:param` syntax and binding values). This ensures user input is treated as data, not SQL code, when executed by `node-oracledb`.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Secondary):** Implement robust server-side input validation to ensure user input conforms to expected formats and lengths. Sanitize input by escaping special characters *only if* parameterized queries cannot be used in very specific scenarios (parameterization is the primary and strongly preferred method).
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Database User):**  Grant the database user used by `node-oracledb` connections only the minimum necessary privileges required for the application's functionality. Avoid using database users with `DBA` or overly broad permissions to limit the impact of successful SQL injection.

## Attack Surface: [2. Connection String Exposure](./attack_surfaces/2__connection_string_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Exposure of sensitive database connection details, including usernames and passwords, allowing unauthorized access to the database.
*   **node-oracledb Contribution:** `node-oracledb` requires connection strings to establish connections to the Oracle Database. Insecure storage or handling of these connection strings within the application or its configuration directly exposes credentials used by `node-oracledb`.
*   **Example:** Hardcoding connection strings with credentials directly in application code that uses `node-oracledb`, storing them in plain text configuration files within the application repository accessible to unauthorized users, or accidentally logging connection strings in application logs generated by `node-oracledb` related operations.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the database via `node-oracledb` connections, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Environment Variables:** Store connection strings, especially credentials, in environment variables rather than hardcoding them in the application or configuration files used by `node-oracledb`.
    *   **Secure Configuration Management:** Utilize secure configuration management systems or secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store and retrieve connection strings securely for use with `node-oracledb`.
    *   **Avoid Hardcoding Credentials:** Never hardcode usernames and passwords directly in the application code that interacts with `node-oracledb`.
    *   **Restrict Access to Configuration Files:** Ensure that configuration files containing connection details (if used at all) are not publicly accessible and have appropriate access controls.

## Attack Surface: [3. Database User Privilege Escalation via SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/3__database_user_privilege_escalation_via_sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities (facilitated by insecure use of `node-oracledb`) to escalate privileges within the database, potentially gaining administrative control.
*   **node-oracledb Contribution:** If SQL injection vulnerabilities exist due to insecure query construction in applications using `node-oracledb`, attackers can leverage these vulnerabilities, executed through `node-oracledb`, to run SQL commands that modify user privileges within the database.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a SQL injection vulnerability in an application using `node-oracledb` to execute a command like `GRANT DBA TO attacker\_user;` if the application's database user (used by `node-oracledb`) has sufficient initial privileges to perform such actions (which should be avoided).
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the database instance, full control over data and database operations, potential for wider system compromise if the database server is not properly isolated.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust SQL Injection Prevention (Paramount):**  Prioritize and rigorously implement all mitigation strategies for SQL Injection (parameterized queries, input validation) to prevent this attack vector through `node-oracledb`.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Database User - Critical):**  The database user used by `node-oracledb` must have the absolute minimum privileges necessary. It should *never* have privileges that allow granting administrative roles or modifying user permissions unless absolutely required and extremely carefully controlled.
    *   **Database Security Auditing and Monitoring:** Regularly audit database user permissions and configurations to identify and rectify any overly permissive settings. Monitor database activity for suspicious privilege escalation attempts originating from `node-oracledb` connections.

## Attack Surface: [4. Vulnerabilities in Oracle Client Libraries (OCI)](./attack_surfaces/4__vulnerabilities_in_oracle_client_libraries__oci_.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities present in the underlying Oracle Client Libraries (OCI) that `node-oracledb` directly depends on.
*   **node-oracledb Contribution:** `node-oracledb` is a wrapper around the Oracle Client Libraries. Any vulnerabilities in OCI directly impact the security of applications using `node-oracledb` because `node-oracledb` relies on OCI for database communication.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in the OCI library's network communication handling could be exploited through `node-oracledb` if an attacker can manipulate data sent to or received from the Oracle Database via `node-oracledb` connections.
*   **Impact:** Application crashes, potential remote code execution on the application server or database server, data breaches, denial of service, all potentially triggered through interactions initiated by `node-oracledb`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific OCI vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly Update Oracle Client Libraries (Crucial):**  Keep the Oracle Client Libraries updated to the latest patched versions provided by Oracle. Monitor Oracle security advisories and apply patches promptly to the environment where `node-oracledb` is running.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning (OCI):**  Include Oracle Client Libraries in your vulnerability scanning processes to identify known vulnerabilities in the OCI components used by `node-oracledb`.
    *   **Stay Informed about Oracle Security Advisories:** Subscribe to Oracle security alerts and advisories to be informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities and patches for Oracle Client and related components that directly affect `node-oracledb`'s security.

## Attack Surface: [5. Native Code Vulnerabilities in node-oracledb](./attack_surfaces/5__native_code_vulnerabilities_in_node-oracledb.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities within the native C/C++ code components of `node-oracledb` itself, which are used for performance and interaction with Oracle Client Libraries.
*   **node-oracledb Contribution:** `node-oracledb` includes native code for performance-critical operations and for interfacing with the Oracle Client Libraries. Vulnerabilities in this native code within `node-oracledb` can be directly exploited by attackers interacting with the application through `node-oracledb`'s API.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in the native code of `node-oracledb` that handles data parsing from the Oracle Database could be exploited to achieve remote code execution on the application server when processing database responses through `node-oracledb`.
*   **Impact:** Application crashes, potential remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, all stemming from vulnerabilities within `node-oracledb`'s own code.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep node-oracledb Updated (Essential):**  Regularly update `node-oracledb` to the latest versions. The maintainers of `node-oracledb` are responsible for addressing vulnerabilities in their native code and releasing patched versions.
    *   **Security Audits (Indirect User Benefit):** While less directly actionable for typical application developers, security audits of the `node-oracledb` codebase by security experts are crucial for identifying and mitigating native code vulnerabilities. Users benefit from the maintainers' efforts in performing these audits and releasing secure versions of `node-oracledb`.
    *   **Report Suspected Vulnerabilities:** If you suspect a vulnerability in `node-oracledb`'s native code, report it to the maintainers through their security channels to contribute to the library's overall security.
