# Threat Model Analysis for microsoft/cntk

## Threat: [Unauthorized Model Modification/Replacement](./threats/unauthorized_model_modificationreplacement.md)

Description: An attacker gains unauthorized access to the model storage location or deployment pipeline and replaces a legitimate CNTK model with a malicious or compromised one. This allows the attacker to control the application's behavior by substituting their own model, potentially leading to data breaches, application hijacking, or denial of service.
Impact: Complete compromise of application functionality, data breaches, application hijacking, denial of service, reputational damage, severe security incident.
Affected CNTK Component: Model Storage, Model Deployment Pipeline, Model Loading Module.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement strong authentication and authorization for model storage and deployment systems.
    * Use integrity checks (e.g., cryptographic hashes, digital signatures) to verify model authenticity before loading and using them.
    * Secure the model deployment pipeline and infrastructure with access controls and monitoring.
    * Implement version control and auditing for model deployments.
    * Regularly audit access to model storage and deployment systems.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Known CNTK Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_known_cntk_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: An attacker exploits publicly known security vulnerabilities in a specific version of CNTK that the application is using. This could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, cause denial of service, or compromise the application or underlying system, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
Impact: System compromise, data breach, denial of service, arbitrary code execution, full application takeover, severe security incident.
Affected CNTK Component: Core CNTK Framework, potentially specific modules depending on the vulnerability.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Regularly update CNTK to the latest stable and patched version.
    * Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for CNTK and its dependencies.
    * Implement a robust vulnerability management process for CNTK and its ecosystem.
    * Perform regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in CNTK](./threats/zero-day_vulnerabilities_in_cntk.md)

Description: An attacker exploits undiscovered vulnerabilities (zero-day vulnerabilities) in CNTK before a patch is available. This is a more sophisticated attack, but if successful, can have similar impacts to exploiting known vulnerabilities.
Impact: System compromise, data breach, denial of service, arbitrary code execution, full application takeover, severe security incident.
Affected CNTK Component: Core CNTK Framework, potentially any module depending on the zero-day vulnerability.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Employ defense-in-depth security measures at all levels of the application and infrastructure.
    * Implement robust monitoring and anomaly detection to identify suspicious activity that might indicate exploitation attempts.
    * Stay informed about general security best practices and emerging threats.
    * Consider using security tools and techniques like fuzzing to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities in CNTK integration.
    * Implement runtime application self-protection (RASP) or similar technologies if applicable.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in CNTK Dependencies](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_cntk_dependencies.md)

Description: An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in libraries and dependencies used by CNTK (e.g., NumPy, Protobuf, etc.). Since CNTK relies on these libraries, vulnerabilities in them can indirectly compromise the security of applications using CNTK. Exploitation could lead to similar impacts as vulnerabilities in CNTK itself.
Impact: System compromise, data breach, denial of service, arbitrary code execution, application instability, security incident.
Affected CNTK Component: CNTK Dependencies (NumPy, Protobuf, etc.), indirectly affects CNTK functionality.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Maintain a detailed inventory of CNTK dependencies.
    * Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., dependency-check, Snyk).
    * Update dependencies to patched versions promptly as security updates are released.
    * Follow security best practices for dependency management, including using dependency management tools and secure repositories.
