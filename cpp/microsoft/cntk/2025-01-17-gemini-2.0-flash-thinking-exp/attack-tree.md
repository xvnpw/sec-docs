## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Load Malicious CNTK Model](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_load_malicious_cntk_model.md)

This path represents a significant threat because the application relies on external models, making it vulnerable to attacks targeting the model itself.

*   **Attack Vector: Model Replacement [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Description:** An attacker replaces the legitimate CNTK model used by the application with a malicious one. This malicious model is crafted to execute arbitrary code, exfiltrate data, or manipulate the application's logic when loaded or during inference.
    *   **Critical Node Justification:** This is a critical node because it directly leads to the execution of attacker-controlled code within the application's context.
    *   **Enabling Factor: Insecure Model Storage [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Description:** The application stores or retrieves CNTK models in an insecure manner, allowing attackers to access and modify or replace them. This can involve weak file permissions, lack of authentication, or the absence of integrity checks.
        *   **Critical Node Justification:** This is a critical node because it is a direct enabler for the "Model Replacement" attack vector. Without secure storage, replacing the model becomes significantly easier.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Remote Code Execution (Malicious model triggers code execution during loading or inference - *High Severity*) [CRITICAL NODE]:** The malicious model, when loaded or used for inference, executes arbitrary code on the server or within the application's environment, granting the attacker full control.
        *   **Justification:** This impact is critical due to the severe consequences of allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit CNTK Inference Engine Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_cntk_inference_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses within the CNTK library itself during the model execution phase.

*   **Attack Vector: Known CNTK Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in the specific version of the CNTK library used by the application. These vulnerabilities can allow for various malicious activities, including remote code execution.
    *   **Critical Node Justification:** This is a critical node because known vulnerabilities have readily available exploits, making them a relatively easy target if the application is not properly patched.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Remote Code Execution (Vulnerability in the inference engine allows arbitrary code execution - *Critical Severity*) [CRITICAL NODE]:** A vulnerability in the CNTK inference engine allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or within the application's environment.
        *   **Justification:** This impact is critical due to the severe consequences of allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit CNTK Library Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_cntk_library_dependencies.md)

This path targets vulnerabilities in the external libraries that CNTK relies upon.

*   **Attack Vector: Vulnerable Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in the specific versions of libraries that CNTK depends on (e.g., protobuf, numpy). These vulnerabilities can be exploited through the CNTK framework.
    *   **Critical Node Justification:** This is a critical node because many applications rely on numerous dependencies, and keeping all of them updated can be challenging, making them a common attack vector.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Remote Code Execution (Through the vulnerable dependency) [CRITICAL NODE]:** A vulnerability in a CNTK dependency is exploited, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or within the application's environment.
        *   **Justification:** This impact is critical due to the severe consequences of allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code.
