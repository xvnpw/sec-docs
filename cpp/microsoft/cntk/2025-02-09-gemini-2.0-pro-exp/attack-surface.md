## Attack Surface: [Model Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/model_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*Description:* An attacker provides a malicious CNTK model file that, when loaded, executes arbitrary code due to vulnerabilities in CNTK's deserialization process.
*CNTK Contribution:* CNTK's `load_model` function (and related functions) are responsible for loading model files. Vulnerabilities in this *CNTK-specific code* are the direct attack vector. This is entirely within CNTK's domain.
*Example:* An attacker uploads a crafted `.model` file to a web application that uses CNTK. When the application calls `CNTK.load_model()` on this file, it triggers a buffer overflow, allowing the attacker to gain control.
*Impact:* Complete system compromise, data theft, denial of service.
*Risk Severity:* Critical.
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Never Load Untrusted Models:** *This is the most crucial mitigation.* Only load model files from trusted, verified sources.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Run the CNTK runtime (and specifically the `load_model` call) in a tightly sandboxed environment to limit the impact of code execution.
    *   **Migration (Essential):** Migrate to a supported framework. This is the only way to receive security patches for deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (CNTK-Specific Vulnerabilities)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion__cntk-specific_vulnerabilities_.md)

*Description:* An attacker sends crafted inputs or model files designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, GPU) *by exploiting vulnerabilities specific to CNTK's internal implementation*.
*CNTK Contribution:* This focuses on vulnerabilities *within CNTK's* computational graph engine, memory management, or custom operator implementations, *not* general resource exhaustion that could affect any framework. This is a direct consequence of using CNTK's code.
*Example:* An attacker exploits a bug in a *custom CNTK operator* (written in C++) to cause an infinite loop or memory leak, crashing the application. Or, they find a specific input pattern that triggers a pathological case in CNTK's graph optimization, leading to excessive memory allocation.
*Impact:* Service unavailability, disruption of operations.
*Risk Severity:* High.
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Resource Limits (Partial Mitigation):** Set strict limits on resources CNTK can use, but this doesn't address the underlying vulnerability.
    *   **Fuzz Testing (Difficult):** Extensive fuzz testing of CNTK's core components and *especially* any custom operators is needed, but this is challenging without access to CNTK's internal development and testing infrastructure.
    *   **Migration (Essential):** Migrate to a supported framework with active security auditing and patching. This is the only way to reliably address unknown vulnerabilities in CNTK's core.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Directly Attributable to CNTK's Deprecation)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__directly_attributable_to_cntk's_deprecation_.md)

*Description:* Vulnerabilities in libraries that CNTK depends on, *which are unpatched because CNTK is deprecated*, can be exploited.
*CNTK Contribution:* CNTK's *fixed* set of dependencies, and the lack of updates to those dependencies *due to CNTK's deprecation*, create the direct attack surface. This is a direct consequence of using an unmaintained framework.
*Example:* A vulnerability is discovered in an old version of Boost used by CNTK. Because CNTK is no longer maintained, this vulnerability will *not* be patched in CNTK. An attacker exploits this known vulnerability.
*Impact:* System compromise, data theft, denial of service.
*Risk Severity:* High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Dependency Analysis (Limited Usefulness):** Identifying the vulnerable dependencies is possible, but *fixing* them within the CNTK context is extremely difficult and likely to break compatibility.
    *   **Migration (Essential):** Migrate to a supported framework. This is the *only* practical solution, as it ensures that dependencies are actively maintained and patched.
