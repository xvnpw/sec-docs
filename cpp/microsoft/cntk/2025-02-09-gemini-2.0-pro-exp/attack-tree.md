## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code on Server [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_on_server__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker. Successful execution grants the attacker significant control over the server, allowing for data exfiltration, system manipulation, denial of service, and potentially lateral movement within the network.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in CNTK [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_cntk__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This branch represents direct attacks against the CNTK codebase itself. Vulnerabilities here can lead directly to arbitrary code execution.

    *   **Buffer Overflow / Memory Corruption [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting memory safety issues in CNTK's C++ code (both core and components like the BrainScript reader). Attackers craft malicious input (model files, training data, configuration) to trigger these vulnerabilities.
        *   **CNTK Core Code (C++) [CRITICAL]:** Vulnerabilities in the core are critical due to their widespread impact.
        *   **BrainScript Reader [CRITICAL]:** The reader is critical as it handles external input, a common attack vector.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting insecure deserialization processes in CNTK (core code or BrainScript reader) to execute arbitrary code. Attackers provide malicious serialized data that, when processed, triggers the execution of attacker-controlled code.
        *   **CNTK Core Code (C++) [CRITICAL]:** Core code deserialization vulnerabilities have a broad impact.
        *   **BrainScript Reader [CRITICAL]:** The reader's role in processing potentially untrusted input is critical.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **Logic Errors in CNTK**
        *   **Description:** Flaws in CNTK's design or implementation that allow attackers to bypass security checks, gain unauthorized access, or cause unintended behavior. This is broader than memory corruption and focuses on logical flaws.
        *   **CNTK Core Code (C++) [CRITICAL]**: Logic errors in the core can have a wide-ranging impact.
        *   **BrainScript Reader [CRITICAL]**: The reader's logic is critical for input handling.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Model Loading Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/model_loading_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting weaknesses in how CNTK loads models, allowing attackers to introduce malicious models. This could involve bypassing security checks, loading from untrusted sources, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the model loading process itself (including deserialization, as mentioned above).
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Model Training Data Poisoning [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/model_training_data_poisoning__high_risk_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker could subtly modify the training data used to train a CNTK model, causing it to behave incorrectly or maliciously.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High
    *   **Effort:** Low to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard to Very Hard
