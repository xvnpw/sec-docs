## Mitigation Strategy: [CNTK Configuration for Resource Limits (Limited Scope)](./mitigation_strategies/cntk_configuration_for_resource_limits__limited_scope_.md)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Review CNTK Documentation:** Examine the CNTK documentation (though archived, it's still available) for any configuration options related to resource usage. This is less common and less powerful than OS-level or container-level controls, but it's worth checking. Look for settings related to:
            *   `traceLevel`: Reduce logging verbosity to minimize I/O overhead.
            *   `forceDeterministicAlgorithms`: While primarily for reproducibility, this *might* have a slight impact on resource usage in some cases.
            *   Parameters related to GPU usage (if applicable), such as memory allocation strategies.
        2.  **Experiment and Profile:** If any relevant configuration options are found, experiment with different settings and profile the model's performance and resource usage to determine the optimal configuration.
        3. **Set config in code:** Use `cntk.cntk_py.set_default_device` to set up device.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High) - *Limited* mitigation. CNTK's internal configuration options are unlikely to provide robust DoS protection on their own. This is primarily a supplementary measure.
        *   **Threat:** Inefficient Resource Usage (Severity: Low) - Optimizing CNTK's internal configuration *might* slightly improve resource efficiency, but the impact is likely to be small compared to other mitigation strategies.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Minimal direct impact. This strategy is not a primary defense against DoS.
        *   **Inefficient Resource Usage:** Potentially small improvements in resource efficiency.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical Project) - Not implemented. The default CNTK configuration is being used.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  A review of the CNTK documentation for relevant configuration options and experimentation with those options is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Choice of CNTK Operations and Layers](./mitigation_strategies/careful_choice_of_cntk_operations_and_layers.md)

    * **Description:**
        1.  **Understand Operation Costs:** Be aware of the computational cost of different CNTK operations and layers. Some operations (e.g., certain types of convolutions, recurrent layers) are inherently more computationally expensive than others.
        2.  **Optimize Model Architecture:** Design the model architecture carefully to minimize unnecessary computations. Avoid overly complex models or layers that don't significantly improve accuracy.
        3.  **Use Efficient Layers:** When possible, choose CNTK layers and operations that are known to be efficient for the target hardware (CPU or GPU). For example, use optimized convolution implementations if available.
        4. **Quantization (If supported by your CNTK version and usage):** Explore using lower-precision data types (e.g., float16 instead of float32) for model weights and activations, *if* your CNTK version and target hardware support it and if the accuracy loss is acceptable. This can significantly reduce memory usage and computational cost. *This is a direct interaction with how CNTK handles data and computation.*
        5. **Pruning (If supported by your CNTK version):** If your version of CNTK supports model pruning (removing less important connections in the network), use it to reduce model size and computational cost.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High) - *Indirectly* mitigates DoS by reducing the overall computational cost of the model, making it harder for an attacker to cause resource exhaustion.
        *   **Threat:** Inefficient Resource Usage (Severity: Low) - Directly addresses inefficient resource usage by optimizing the model's architecture and operations.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Moderate indirect impact. A more efficient model is less susceptible to DoS, but this is not a primary defense.
        *   **Inefficient Resource Usage:** Potentially significant improvements in resource efficiency, depending on the optimization effort.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical Project) - Partially implemented. Some basic model architecture choices have been made, but no systematic optimization for efficiency has been performed.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  A thorough review of the model architecture and operations, with a focus on computational cost and efficiency, is needed. Quantization and pruning should be investigated if supported by the CNTK version.
