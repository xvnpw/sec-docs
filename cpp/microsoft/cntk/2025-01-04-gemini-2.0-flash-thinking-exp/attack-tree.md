## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Manipulate Model Behavior -> Load Malicious Model -> Exploit Model Loading Vulnerabilities -> Inject Malicious Code into Model File](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_manipulate_model_behavior_-_load_malicious_model_-_exploit_model_loading_vulnerabilit_96a2de35.md)

- Attack Vector: An attacker crafts a malicious CNTK model file containing embedded code.
- Execution: When the application loads this malicious model, vulnerabilities in CNTK's model loading process (specifically during deserialization) allow the embedded code to be executed on the server.
- Impact: Critical - Remote Code Execution, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the application server.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Manipulate Model Behavior -> Load Malicious Model -> Exploit Model Loading Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Deserialization Flaws in CNTK's Model Format](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_manipulate_model_behavior_-_load_malicious_model_-_exploit_model_loading_vulnerabilit_7f31d432.md)

- Attack Vector: An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how CNTK deserializes model files. A specially crafted model file can trigger these flaws.
- Execution: Upon loading the malicious model, the deserialization process is exploited, leading to the execution of arbitrary code on the server.
- Impact: Critical - Remote Code Execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Manipulate Model Behavior -> Load Malicious Model -> Replace Legitimate Model with Malicious One -> Exploit Insecure Storage or Access Controls for Model Files](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_manipulate_model_behavior_-_load_malicious_model_-_replace_legitimate_model_with_mali_d785c33c.md)

- Attack Vector: The application's storage location for CNTK model files has weak access controls or is otherwise insecure.
- Execution: An attacker gains access to this storage location and replaces the legitimate model file with a malicious one. When the application loads the model, it loads the attacker's version.
- Impact: Critical - Full control over the model's behavior, potentially leading to data breaches, incorrect application functionality, or further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Gain Unauthorized Access via CNTK -> Leverage CNTK's External Library Dependencies -> Exploit Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries (e.g., MKL, CUDA)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_gain_unauthorized_access_via_cntk_-_leverage_cntk's_external_library_dependencies_-_e_e5ce70f2.md)

- Attack Vector: CNTK relies on external libraries like MKL or CUDA, which may have known vulnerabilities.
- Execution: An attacker identifies a vulnerability in one of these libraries and crafts an attack that is triggered through CNTK's usage of the vulnerable library.
- Impact: Critical - Remote Code Execution, allowing the attacker to compromise the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Execute Arbitrary Code via CNTK -> Leverage Custom Operators or Layers -> Inject Malicious Code into Custom CNTK Components](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_execute_arbitrary_code_via_cntk_-_leverage_custom_operators_or_layers_-_inject_malici_0a37455b.md)

- Attack Vector: The application uses custom CNTK operators or layers developed internally. These custom components contain vulnerabilities.
- Execution: An attacker exploits these vulnerabilities, potentially through crafted input or by directly manipulating the custom component's code if access is gained.
- Impact: Critical - Remote Code Execution, allowing the attacker to gain control of the application server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Inject Malicious Code into Model File](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_inject_malicious_code_into_model_file.md)

- Attack Vector: An attacker directly modifies a CNTK model file to include malicious executable code.
- Execution: When the application loads this tampered model file, the injected code is executed.
- Impact: Critical - Remote Code Execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Deserialization Flaws in CNTK's Model Format](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_deserialization_flaws_in_cntk's_model_format.md)

- Attack Vector:  Vulnerabilities exist in how CNTK processes and deserializes model files.
- Execution: A specially crafted model file triggers these flaws during loading, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Impact: Critical - Remote Code Execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Replace Legitimate Model with Malicious One](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_replace_legitimate_model_with_malicious_one.md)

- Attack Vector:  Weak security on the storage location of model files allows an attacker to overwrite the legitimate model.
- Execution: The application loads the attacker's malicious model.
- Impact: Critical - Full control over model behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Insecure Storage or Access Controls for Model Files](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_insecure_storage_or_access_controls_for_model_files.md)

- Attack Vector:  Lack of proper permissions or security measures on the model file storage.
- Execution: Allows attackers to read, modify, or replace model files.
- Impact: Critical - Enables model replacement attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries (e.g., MKL, CUDA)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_libraries__e_g___mkl__cuda_.md)

- Attack Vector: Known vulnerabilities in CNTK's dependencies.
- Execution: Triggering these vulnerabilities through CNTK's interaction with the libraries.
- Impact: Critical - Remote Code Execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Achieve Remote Code Execution via Deserialization Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_achieve_remote_code_execution_via_deserialization_flaws.md)

- Attack Vector: Successfully exploiting deserialization vulnerabilities during model loading.
- Execution: Arbitrary code execution on the server.
- Impact: Critical - Full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Buffer Overflows Leading to Code Execution](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_buffer_overflows_leading_to_code_execution.md)

- Attack Vector:  Providing input to CNTK that exceeds buffer limits, overwriting memory.
- Execution:  If not handled correctly, this can lead to the execution of attacker-controlled code.
- Impact: Critical - Remote Code Execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Inject Malicious Code into Custom CNTK Components](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_inject_malicious_code_into_custom_cntk_components.md)

- Attack Vector:  Vulnerabilities in custom-developed CNTK components.
- Execution:  Exploiting these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code.
- Impact: Critical - Remote Code Execution.
