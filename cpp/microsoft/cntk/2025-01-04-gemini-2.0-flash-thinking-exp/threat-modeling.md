# Threat Model Analysis for microsoft/cntk

## Threat: [Malicious Model Injection](./threats/malicious_model_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker replaces a legitimate, trained CNTK model file with a malicious one. This could involve gaining unauthorized access to the model storage location or intercepting the model during transfer.

**Impact:** The application starts using the attacker's model, leading to incorrect predictions, biased outputs, or even actions designed to harm the system or users.

**Affected CNTK Component:** Model loading functionality (e.g., functions used to load `.dnn` or other model formats).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong access controls and authentication for model storage locations.
*   Use secure transfer protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SSH) for model deployment.
*   Implement integrity checks (e.g., cryptographic hashes) for model files to detect tampering.
*   Regularly audit model storage and deployment pipelines.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in CNTK Library](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_cntk_library.md)

**Description:** An attacker leverages known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the CNTK library itself. This could involve crafting specific inputs or triggering specific sequences of operations.

**Impact:** Could lead to denial of service, arbitrary code execution on the server running the application, information disclosure, or other system-level compromises.

**Affected CNTK Component:** Various modules and functions within the core CNTK library (e.g., computational graph execution, memory management).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the CNTK library updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
*   Monitor for security advisories related to CNTK and its dependencies.
*   Implement input validation and sanitization before feeding data to CNTK functions.
*   Run the application and CNTK in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in CNTK's Ecosystem](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_cntk's_ecosystem.md)

**Description:** CNTK relies on various other libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to compromise the application.

**Impact:** Similar to vulnerabilities in CNTK itself, this could lead to various security breaches.

**Affected CNTK Component:** The entire CNTK installation and its dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update all CNTK dependencies to their latest secure versions.
*   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies.
*   Follow security best practices for managing dependencies (e.g., using a package manager with security auditing features).

## Threat: [Model Poisoning via Training Data Manipulation](./threats/model_poisoning_via_training_data_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the training data used to build the CNTK model. This could involve injecting malicious samples, altering existing data, or manipulating labels.

**Impact:** The trained model becomes biased or performs poorly on specific inputs, potentially leading to incorrect or harmful application behavior in targeted scenarios.

**Affected CNTK Component:** Training functionalities (e.g., data readers, training loops, optimization algorithms).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict access controls and validation for training data sources.
*   Monitor training data for anomalies and suspicious patterns.
*   Use data augmentation techniques defensively to make the model more robust.
*   Implement data provenance tracking to understand the origin and transformations of training data.
*   Consider using federated learning or differential privacy techniques when dealing with sensitive or untrusted data sources.
