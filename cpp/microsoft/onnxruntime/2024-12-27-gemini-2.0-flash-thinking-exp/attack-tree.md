## High-Risk Attack Paths and Critical Nodes Sub-Tree

**Objective:** Compromise application that use given project by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the project itself.

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, cause denial of service, or exfiltrate sensitive information from the application leveraging ONNX Runtime.

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Compromise Application via ONNX Runtime [CRITICAL NODE]:**

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the starting point for all high-risk paths. Success here means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application.

**Exploit Malicious ONNX Model [CRITICAL NODE]:**

*   This is a critical node because it represents a direct way to inject malicious behavior into the application's workflow. By providing a crafted model, the attacker can bypass the intended functionality and potentially gain control.
    *   **Compromise Model Repository/Storage [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Exploit Weak Access Controls:** If the repository or storage where ONNX models are kept has weak access controls, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to upload or replace legitimate models with malicious ones.
        *   **Social Engineering to Gain Credentials:** An attacker might use social engineering techniques to trick authorized users into revealing their credentials, allowing them to access and manipulate the model repository.
    *   **Craft Malicious Model Content [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Exploit Operator Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:** ONNX Runtime relies on various operators to perform computations. Vulnerabilities in the implementation of these operators can be exploited by crafting specific model structures or input data.
            *   **Trigger Buffer Overflow in Operator Implementation:** Crafting input data that exceeds the buffer limits of an operator can lead to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution.
            *   **Trigger Arbitrary Code Execution via Operator:** Exploiting logical flaws in operator implementations might allow the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code within the ONNX Runtime process.

**Exploit Vulnerabilities in ONNX Runtime Library [CRITICAL NODE]:**

*   This node is critical because vulnerabilities within the ONNX Runtime library itself can affect any application using that version.
    *   **Trigger Known Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the specific version of ONNX Runtime being used. This requires the application to be using an outdated or unpatched version.
    *   **Exploit Dependencies of ONNX Runtime [CRITICAL NODE]:** ONNX Runtime relies on other libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the application.
        *   **Replace legitimate dependency with a malicious one (Dependency Confusion):** Tricking the application's build system into downloading a malicious package with the same name as a legitimate dependency.

**Exploit Application's Interaction with ONNX Runtime:**

*   Even with a secure ONNX Runtime library, vulnerabilities in how the application uses it can be exploited.
    *   **Exploit Unsafe Deserialization of ONNX Output:** If the application deserializes the output from ONNX Runtime without proper validation, an attacker might manipulate the output data to inject malicious payloads that are then executed by the application.
    *   **Exploit Lack of Input Validation Before Feeding to ONNX Runtime:** If the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate input before feeding it to the ONNX Runtime, malicious input could cause crashes or unexpected behavior within the library, potentially leading to further exploitation.

This sub-tree highlights the most critical areas of concern and the attack paths that pose the highest risk to the application. Focusing mitigation efforts on these areas will provide the most significant security improvements.
