### Key Attack Surface List: ONNX Runtime (High & Critical, Direct Involvement)

Here's an updated list of key attack surfaces that directly involve ONNX Runtime, focusing on high and critical severity risks:

*   **Maliciously Crafted ONNX Models:**
    *   **Description:** Loading an ONNX model from an untrusted source that contains crafted operators or structures designed to exploit vulnerabilities in ONNX Runtime's parsing or execution logic.
    *   **How ONNX Runtime Contributes:** ONNX Runtime's core functionality involves parsing and executing ONNX model files. If the parser or operator implementations have weaknesses, a malicious model can trigger them.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a seemingly legitimate ONNX model for image classification. However, the model contains a custom operator with a buffer overflow vulnerability. When ONNX Runtime attempts to execute this operator with specific input, it leads to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Model Source Verification:** Only load models from trusted and verified sources. Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of models (e.g., digital signatures).
        *   **Input Sanitization (Model Input):** While the model itself is the attack vector here, limiting the types and sources of models accepted can reduce risk.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Run ONNX Runtime in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges to contain potential damage from exploited vulnerabilities.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep ONNX Runtime updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   **Model Scanning/Analysis:** Employ tools or techniques to statically analyze ONNX models for potential malicious content or suspicious structures before loading.

*   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities during Model Loading:**
    *   **Description:** Exploiting weaknesses in the process of deserializing the ONNX model file format.
    *   **How ONNX Runtime Contributes:** ONNX Runtime needs to deserialize the protobuf-based ONNX model file to build the internal representation of the model. Vulnerabilities in the deserialization process can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A specially crafted ONNX model exploits a buffer overflow in the protobuf parsing library *used by ONNX Runtime during model loading*, leading to a crash or potentially RCE.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Ensure ONNX Runtime and its dependencies (like protobuf) are updated to the latest versions to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.
        *   **Input Validation (Model File):** While the format is expected, ensure basic checks on the model file structure before attempting to load it.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Isolate the model loading process within a sandbox to limit the impact of potential exploits.

*   **Vulnerabilities in Specific Operators:**
    *   **Description:** Exploiting bugs or security flaws within the implementation of individual ONNX operators.
    *   **How ONNX Runtime Contributes:** ONNX Runtime provides a wide range of operators for performing various computations. Bugs in the implementation of these operators can be exploited with specific input data.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability exists in the `MaxPool` operator implementation that causes a buffer overflow when processing input with specific dimensions. An attacker crafts input data that triggers this overflow, leading to a crash or potentially RCE.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), Information Disclosure (if the operator mishandles sensitive data).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep ONNX Runtime updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches for operator implementations.
        *   **Input Validation (Data):** Validate and sanitize input data before feeding it to the ONNX Runtime to ensure it conforms to expected types and ranges, reducing the likelihood of triggering operator vulnerabilities.
        *   **Fuzzing:** Employ fuzzing techniques to test ONNX Runtime with various inputs to identify potential crashes or unexpected behavior in operator implementations.

*   **Custom Operator Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Description:** Exploiting security flaws within custom operators that are registered and used with ONNX Runtime.
    *   **How ONNX Runtime Contributes:** ONNX Runtime allows users to register and use custom operators, extending its functionality. If these custom operators are not implemented securely, they can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A developer creates a custom operator for a specific task but introduces a buffer overflow vulnerability in its implementation. An attacker crafts input data that triggers this overflow when the custom operator is executed.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if custom operators are used).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Development Practices:** Follow secure coding practices when developing custom operators, including thorough input validation, bounds checking, and memory management.
        *   **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews of custom operator implementations to identify potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Sandboxing (Custom Operators):** If possible, run custom operators in a more isolated or sandboxed environment.
        *   **Limited Privilege Execution:** Execute ONNX Runtime with the least privileges necessary, limiting the impact of vulnerabilities in custom operators.
