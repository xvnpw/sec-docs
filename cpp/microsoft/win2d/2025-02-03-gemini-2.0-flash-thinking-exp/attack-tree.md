## Attack Tree Path: [Code Execution via Image Processing Buffer Overflow (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/code_execution_via_image_processing_buffer_overflow__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Path:** Gain Code Execution -> Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Win2D -> Trigger Buffer Overflow in Image Processing -> Craft Malicious Image File -> Load Malicious Image via Win2D API
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **Gain Code Execution (CRITICAL NODE - HIGH IMPACT GOAL):** The attacker aims to execute arbitrary code within the application's context. This is a primary objective due to the potential for complete system compromise.
    *   **Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Win2D (CRITICAL NODE - VULNERABILITY AREA):** Win2D, being a native library, is susceptible to memory corruption issues. This area is critical because memory corruption vulnerabilities can lead to code execution.
    *   **Trigger Buffer Overflow in Image Processing (CRITICAL NODE - VULNERABILITY AREA):** Image processing is a complex operation, and vulnerabilities like buffer overflows are common in image decoding libraries. This specific area is critical due to the potential for exploitation through malicious images.
    *   **Craft Malicious Image File (e.g., PNG, JPEG, BMP) (CRITICAL NODE - ATTACK VECTOR):** Attackers create specially crafted image files designed to trigger a buffer overflow vulnerability when processed by Win2D. This is the method of delivering the exploit.
    *   **Load Malicious Image via Win2D API (e.g., CanvasBitmap.LoadAsync) (CRITICAL NODE - ENTRY POINT):** The application's use of Win2D APIs to load images (like `CanvasBitmap.LoadAsync`) becomes the entry point for the attack. If the application loads images from untrusted sources, this path becomes highly relevant.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Execution via Font Handling Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/code_execution_via_font_handling_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Path:** Gain Code Execution -> Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Win2D -> Exploit Vulnerabilities in Text Rendering or Font Handling -> Craft Malicious Font File
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **Gain Code Execution (CRITICAL NODE - HIGH IMPACT GOAL):** (Same as above)
    *   **Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Win2D (CRITICAL NODE - VULNERABILITY AREA):** (Same as above)
    *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Text Rendering or Font Handling (CRITICAL NODE - VULNERABILITY AREA):** Font parsing and rendering are also complex processes, and vulnerabilities in font handling libraries are known. This area is critical because malicious fonts can be used to exploit these vulnerabilities.
    *   **Craft Malicious Font File (CRITICAL NODE - ATTACK VECTOR):** Attackers create specially crafted font files designed to trigger vulnerabilities during font parsing or rendering within Win2D. This is the method of delivering the exploit via fonts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion (VRAM/RAM) (HIGH-RISK PATH for DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion__vramram___high-risk_path_for_dos_.md)

*   **Path (VRAM):** Cause Denial of Service (DoS) -> Resource Exhaustion -> Exhaust Graphics Memory (VRAM) -> Allocate Large CanvasRenderTargets or CanvasBitmaps
*   **Path (RAM):** Cause Denial of Service (DoS) -> Resource Exhaustion -> Exhaust System Memory (RAM) -> Create Excessive Number of Win2D Objects
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **Cause Denial of Service (DoS) (CRITICAL NODE - HIGH IMPACT GOAL for Availability):** The attacker aims to make the application unavailable or unresponsive. While not as severe as code execution in terms of confidentiality and integrity, DoS attacks can significantly disrupt service.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (CRITICAL NODE - ATTACK VECTOR for DoS):** This is the general method for achieving DoS. By consuming excessive resources, the attacker can overwhelm the application or system.
    *   **Exhaust Graphics Memory (VRAM) / Exhaust System Memory (RAM) (CRITICAL NODE - RESOURCE TARGET for DoS):** These are the specific resources targeted for exhaustion. VRAM exhaustion can lead to rendering failures and application crashes, while RAM exhaustion can lead to system slowdown and application crashes.
    *   **Allocate Large CanvasRenderTargets or CanvasBitmaps / Create Excessive Number of Win2D Objects (CRITICAL NODE - ATTACK STEP for DoS):** These are the specific actions an attacker can take using Win2D APIs to exhaust VRAM or RAM respectively.  These are simple API calls that can be easily automated.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Exfiltration (Indirect, after Code Execution) (HIGH-RISK PATH after Code Execution)](./attack_tree_paths/data_exfiltration__indirect__after_code_execution___high-risk_path_after_code_execution_.md)

*   **Path:** Data Exfiltration -> Leverage Code Execution to Access Sensitive Data -> (Access Application Memory OR Access File System OR Network Communication)
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **Data Exfiltration (Indirect, often after Code Execution) (CRITICAL NODE - HIGH IMPACT GOAL):** The attacker's ultimate goal might be to steal sensitive data. This path becomes relevant *after* successful code execution.
    *   **Leverage Code Execution to Access Sensitive Data (CRITICAL NODE - ATTACK STEP):** Once code execution is achieved, the attacker can use their control to access and steal data.
    *   **Access Application Memory / Access File System (CRITICAL NODE - DATA TARGET):** These are the locations where sensitive data might be stored and targeted for exfiltration.
    *   **Network Communication (CRITICAL NODE - EXFILTRATION METHOD):** This is a common method for sending stolen data to an attacker-controlled server.
