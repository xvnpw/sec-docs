# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Provide Windows application developers with an efficient and easy-to-use API for 2D graphics rendering.
 - Enable developers to create visually rich and performant Windows applications leveraging GPU acceleration.
 - Maintain compatibility and stability across different Windows versions and hardware configurations.
 - Foster a thriving ecosystem of Windows applications by offering robust graphics capabilities.
- Business Risks:
 - Security vulnerabilities in the Win2D API could lead to exploitation in applications using it, causing harm to end-users and damaging Microsoft's reputation.
 - Performance bottlenecks or instability in the API could hinder application performance and developer adoption.
 - Lack of compatibility with future Windows updates or hardware changes could render applications using Win2D obsolete.
 - Insufficient adoption by developers compared to alternative graphics solutions could lead to the project's decline.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) - Implemented throughout the development process at Microsoft, encompassing requirements, design, implementation, verification, and release phases. (Location: Microsoft internal development processes)
 - security control: Code Reviews - Implemented as part of the development process to identify potential security flaws and vulnerabilities. (Location: Microsoft internal development processes, likely documented in development guidelines)
 - security control: Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) - Implemented to automatically scan the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities. (Location: Microsoft internal build and CI/CD pipelines)
 - security control: Dynamic Analysis Security Testing (DAST) - Implemented to test the running application for vulnerabilities. (Location: Microsoft internal testing environments and processes)
 - security control: Penetration Testing - Likely performed periodically by internal security teams or external vendors to identify exploitable vulnerabilities. (Location: Microsoft internal security testing processes)
 - security control: Dependency Scanning - Implemented to identify vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and components used by Win2D. (Location: Microsoft internal build and CI/CD pipelines)
 - security control: Signing of Binaries - Win2D components are digitally signed by Microsoft to ensure integrity and authenticity. (Location: Microsoft build and release processes)
 - security control: Access Control - Access to the source code repository and build systems is restricted to authorized Microsoft personnel. (Location: Microsoft internal infrastructure and access management systems)
- Accepted Risks:
 - accepted risk: Complexity of graphics rendering logic may introduce subtle vulnerabilities that are difficult to detect through automated testing.
 - accepted risk: Performance optimizations might sometimes prioritize speed over certain exhaustive security checks in specific code paths.
 - accepted risk: Newly discovered zero-day vulnerabilities in underlying graphics drivers or hardware could potentially impact Win2D applications.
- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Fuzzing - Implement fuzzing techniques to automatically generate and test a wide range of inputs to uncover potential crashes and vulnerabilities in the graphics rendering engine.
 - security control: Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Generation - Generate SBOM for Win2D releases to provide transparency into the components and dependencies, facilitating vulnerability management for users.
 - security control: Security Champions Program - Designate security champions within the Win2D development team to promote security awareness and best practices.
 - security control: Incident Response Plan - Establish a clear incident response plan for handling security vulnerabilities reported in Win2D, including patching and communication procedures.
- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Not directly applicable to the Win2D API itself, as it is a client-side graphics rendering library.
  - However, related services like NuGet package management and developer accounts require strong authentication mechanisms.
 - Authorization:
  - Not directly applicable to the Win2D API itself.
  - Access to Win2D source code, build systems, and release pipelines should be strictly authorized and controlled.
 - Input Validation:
  - Critical requirement for Win2D to prevent vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, injection attacks, and denial-of-service.
  - All input data processed by the Win2D API, including graphics commands, image data, and resource parameters, must be thoroughly validated to ensure it conforms to expected formats and ranges.
  - Input validation should be implemented at multiple layers to catch errors early in the processing pipeline.
 - Cryptography:
  - May be relevant for specific use cases within graphics rendering, such as secure rendering of sensitive content or watermarking.
  - If cryptographic operations are used within Win2D, they must be implemented using secure and well-vetted cryptographic libraries and algorithms.
  - Key management and secure storage of cryptographic keys should be addressed if applicable.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Providing a secure, reliable, and high-performance 2D graphics API for Windows developers.
 - Maintaining the integrity and availability of the Win2D library and its distribution channels (NuGet).
 - Protecting the reputation of Microsoft as a trusted provider of development tools and technologies.
- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - Win2D API Source Code: Highly sensitive. Confidentiality and integrity are crucial to prevent unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure, which could lead to vulnerabilities or intellectual property theft.
 - Win2D Build Artifacts (Binaries, NuGet Packages): Highly sensitive. Integrity and availability are critical to ensure that developers and end-users receive genuine and untampered software.
 - Microsoft's Signing Keys: Extremely sensitive. Confidentiality and integrity are paramount as compromise could allow malicious actors to sign and distribute malware disguised as legitimate Win2D components.
 - Vulnerability Information: Sensitive. Confidentiality is important to allow for coordinated vulnerability disclosure and patching before exploits become widespread.
