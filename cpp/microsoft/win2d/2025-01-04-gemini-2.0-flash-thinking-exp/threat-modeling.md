# Threat Model Analysis for microsoft/win2d

## Threat: [Malicious Image Input Exploitation](./threats/malicious_image_input_exploitation.md)

* **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG, BMP) with malformed headers, excessive metadata, or embedded malicious data. This input is then processed by Win2D's image decoding functionality. The attacker aims to trigger a vulnerability within Win2D's image parsing logic, leading to unexpected behavior.
    * **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential for memory corruption if the parsing vulnerability is severe enough, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution in the application's context.
    * **Affected Win2D Component:** `Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.Image.CanvasBitmap` (specifically the image decoding modules for various formats).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict input validation on image files before loading them with Win2D. Check file headers and metadata for anomalies.
        * Limit the supported image formats to only those necessary.
        * Consider using a separate, isolated process or sandbox to handle image decoding if dealing with untrusted sources.
        * Stay updated with the latest Win2D releases and security patches, as these often address vulnerabilities in image handling.

## Threat: [Exploiting Buffer Overflows in Drawing Operations](./threats/exploiting_buffer_overflows_in_drawing_operations.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts specific drawing commands or provides excessive data (e.g., very large arrays of points for a path) that, when processed by Win2D's drawing APIs, causes a buffer overflow within the library's internal memory management.
    * **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, memory corruption which could lead to arbitrary code execution.
    * **Affected Win2D Component:** `Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.UI.Xaml.CanvasControl`, `Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasDrawingSession` (specifically functions related to drawing shapes, paths, and text).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement limits on the complexity and size of drawing operations allowed in the application.
        * Validate data used in drawing operations, such as array sizes and coordinate values, to ensure they are within reasonable bounds.
        * Be mindful of the performance implications of very large drawing operations, as these can also indicate potential issues.
