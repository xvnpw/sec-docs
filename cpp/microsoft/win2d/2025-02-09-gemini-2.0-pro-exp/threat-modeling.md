# Threat Model Analysis for microsoft/win2d

## Threat: [Malicious Image Resource Injection](./threats/malicious_image_resource_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker replaces a legitimate image resource (e.g., a PNG, JPG, or DDS file) loaded by `CanvasBitmap.LoadAsync` with a crafted malicious image. This malicious image contains specially designed data intended to trigger a buffer overflow or other vulnerability *within Win2D's image decoding process* (or a custom effect that processes the image *within Win2D*). The attacker achieves this by compromising the application's installation, a network share, or exploiting a separate vulnerability to write to the resource location. This is *not* about simply displaying a "bad" image; it's about exploiting a flaw in Win2D's handling of image data.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Potential code execution with the application's privileges (if a vulnerability exists in Win2D's image decoding).
        *   Application crash (Denial of Service).
        *   Information disclosure (if the vulnerability allows reading memory).
    *   **Win2D Component Affected:** `CanvasBitmap.LoadAsync`, image decoding pipeline (internal to Win2D, and potentially underlying Direct2D/Direct3D components *as used by Win2D*).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical if code execution is achieved).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Digitally Sign Resources:** Sign all image resources and verify the signature before loading with `CanvasBitmap.LoadAsync`. This is the primary defense.
        *   **Secure Resource Storage:** Store image resources in protected locations (e.g., application package, system folders with restricted access).
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring:** Implement a mechanism to detect unauthorized modifications to image resource files.
        *   **AppContainer Isolation:** Leverage AppContainer to limit the impact of a successful exploit, even if code execution occurs.
        *   **Keep Win2D Updated:** This is crucial to ensure any discovered vulnerabilities in Win2D's image handling are patched.

## Threat: [Shader Code Injection (Custom Effects)](./threats/shader_code_injection__custom_effects_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses custom effects with HLSL shader code loaded from external files (e.g., using `CanvasEffect` and loading a compiled shader `.cso` file), an attacker replaces the legitimate shader file with a malicious one. This malicious shader contains code designed to exploit vulnerabilities *in the GPU driver or Win2D's effect processing pipeline*. This is *not* about simply making the shader do something unexpected; it's about exploiting a flaw to gain control.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Potential code execution (though likely within the GPU's context, which may have limited privileges, but could potentially be escalated).
        *   GPU hang or crash (Denial of Service).
        *   System instability.
    *   **Win2D Component Affected:** `CanvasEffect`, custom effect loading and execution pipeline (internal to Win2D, relies on Direct3D).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on the GPU driver's security and potential for privilege escalation).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Digitally Sign Shader Files:** Sign compiled shader files (.cso) and verify the signature before loading. This is the primary defense.
        *   **Secure Shader Storage:** Store shader files in protected locations.
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring:** Monitor shader files for unauthorized changes.
        *   **Keep Win2D and GPU Drivers Updated:** Crucial for patching any vulnerabilities in shader handling.
        *   **AppContainer Isolation:** Limits the impact of a successful exploit.
