# Attack Surface Analysis for microsoft/win2d

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Image Input](./attack_surfaces/malicious_image_input.md)

*Description:* Exploitation of vulnerabilities in image codecs through crafted image files passed to Win2D.
*Win2D Contribution:* Win2D's image loading functions (e.g., `CanvasBitmap.LoadAsync`) are the direct entry point for processing potentially malicious image data. Win2D relies on the OS's image decoding, but Win2D is the component *handling* the potentially malicious input.
*Example:* An attacker uploads a specially crafted JPEG file that triggers a buffer overflow in the Windows image decoder, accessed via `CanvasBitmap.LoadAsync`, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*Impact:* Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, system compromise.
*Risk Severity:* Critical
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   *Developer:*
        *   Validate image dimensions and file sizes *before* loading with Win2D.  This is crucial *before* any Win2D API call.
        *   Implement robust error handling for image loading failures.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed process for image decoding, isolating it from the main Win2D rendering process.
        *   Fuzz test with malformed image inputs, specifically targeting Win2D's loading functions.
        *   Use a memory safe language if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Font Input](./attack_surfaces/malicious_font_input.md)

*Description:* Exploitation of vulnerabilities in font rendering engines through crafted font files used by Win2D.
*Win2D Contribution:* Win2D's text rendering functions directly utilize the system's font rendering engine.  Win2D is the component that loads and uses the potentially malicious font data.
*Example:* An application allows users to select custom fonts. An attacker provides a crafted TrueType font file that exploits a vulnerability in the font rasterizer (accessed through Win2D's text rendering), leading to potential code execution.
*Impact:* Denial of service, potential code execution (though often less likely than image codec exploits).
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   *Developer:*
        *   Prefer system fonts whenever possible, reducing the attack surface.
        *   If custom fonts are *absolutely* necessary, thoroughly vet their source and integrity *before* allowing Win2D to use them.
        *   Validate font files before use, if technically feasible (this can be complex).
        *   Consider sandboxing font rendering if high security is a paramount concern.

## Attack Surface: [Direct2D/Direct3D Interop Vulnerabilities (When Used Incorrectly)](./attack_surfaces/direct2ddirect3d_interop_vulnerabilities__when_used_incorrectly_.md)

*Description:* Exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying Direct2D/Direct3D APIs *through incorrect usage of Win2D's interop features*.  This is *specifically* about the application's misuse of Win2D's interop capabilities.
*Win2D Contribution:* Win2D provides interop features that allow direct access to underlying Direct2D/Direct3D resources.  *Incorrect* use of these features by the application developer can introduce vulnerabilities that wouldn't exist if only the managed Win2D API was used.  This is a *direct* consequence of using Win2D's interop incorrectly.
*Example:* An application uses Win2D's interop to directly access a Direct3D texture, but makes an error in handling the texture's memory (e.g., a use-after-free), leading to a vulnerability.  This vulnerability is *directly* caused by the application's code interacting with Direct3D *through* Win2D.
*Impact:* Varies depending on the specific Direct2D/Direct3D vulnerability exposed; could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   *Developer:*
        *   **Strongly prefer** using Win2D's managed API and *avoid* direct access to Direct2D/Direct3D resources through interop unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
        *   If interop is *unavoidable*, follow Microsoft's security best practices and guidelines for Direct2D/Direct3D programming *meticulously*.  This includes careful memory management, resource handling, and input validation.
        *   Thoroughly test and review *any* code that uses Win2D's interop features, with a specific focus on security vulnerabilities.  Code review by a security expert is highly recommended.
        * Understand and apply secure coding principles for native code (C++).
