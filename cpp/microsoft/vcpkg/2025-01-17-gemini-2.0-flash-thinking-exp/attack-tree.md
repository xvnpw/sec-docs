# Attack Tree Analysis for microsoft/vcpkg

Objective: To execute arbitrary code within the context of the application using vcpkg.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
Compromise Application via vcpkg **(CRITICAL NODE)**
* Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities Introduced by vcpkg **(HIGH-RISK PATH START)**
    * Introduce Malicious Dependency **(CRITICAL NODE)**
        * Compromise Upstream Dependency Repository **(CRITICAL NODE)**
        * Dependency Confusion Attack **(HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)**
    * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Portfiles/Build Scripts **(HIGH-RISK PATH START)**
        * Introduce Malicious Code in Portfile **(CRITICAL NODE)**
            * Compromise Developer Machine **(HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)**
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via vcpkg (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_vcpkg__critical_node_.md)

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved their objective of executing arbitrary code within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities Introduced by vcpkg (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities_introduced_by_vcpkg__high-risk_path_start_.md)

* This represents a broad category of attacks that leverage vcpkg's role in managing dependencies to introduce vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Dependency (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_dependency__critical_node_.md)

* This node signifies the successful introduction of a compromised dependency into the application's build process. This can be achieved through various means.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Upstream Dependency Repository (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_upstream_dependency_repository__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * **Gain Access to Repository Credentials:**
        * Phishing attacks targeting repository maintainers.
        * Credential stuffing using leaked credentials.
        * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the repository platform's authentication mechanisms.
    * **Exploit Repository Vulnerabilities:**
        * Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the repository platform itself to gain unauthorized access or modify packages.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Confusion Attack (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_confusion_attack__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * **Publish Malicious Package with Same Name in Public Registry:**
        * An attacker identifies an internal dependency used by the target application.
        * They create a malicious package with the same name and a higher version number.
        * If vcpkg is not configured to prioritize internal repositories, it may download the attacker's malicious package from the public registry.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Portfiles/Build Scripts (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_portfilesbuild_scripts__high-risk_path_start_.md)

* This category focuses on attacks that exploit weaknesses in the portfiles used by vcpkg to build and integrate dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Code in Portfile (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_code_in_portfile__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * **Compromise Developer Machine (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
        * Gaining unauthorized access to a developer's machine through malware, phishing, or other means.
        * Modifying portfiles directly on the compromised machine.
    * **Submit Malicious Pull Request:**
        * Submitting a pull request containing malicious code disguised as a legitimate change.
        * Relying on insufficient code review to merge the malicious changes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Developer Machine (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_developer_machine__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * Phishing attacks targeting developers.
    * Exploiting vulnerabilities in software used by developers.
    * Social engineering tactics to gain access to developer credentials.
    * Supply chain attacks targeting developer tools.
