# Threat Model Analysis for microsoft/vcpkg

## Threat: [Compromised Official vcpkg Repository](./threats/compromised_official_vcpkg_repository.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control over the official vcpkg repository (or a mirror) and modifies portfiles or injects malicious code into package sources. When developers use vcpkg to install or update packages, they unknowingly download and build the compromised versions.
*   **Impact:** Introduction of backdoors, malware, or vulnerabilities into the application's dependencies, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
*   **Affected vcpkg Component:**  `vcpkg` core functionality, specifically the package download and update mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Rely on the official vcpkg repository and avoid using untrusted mirrors.
    *   Implement checksum verification for downloaded package sources (vcpkg does this, ensure it's enabled and trusted).
    *   Monitor official vcpkg announcements and security advisories for any reported compromises.
    *   Consider using signed packages if this feature becomes available in vcpkg.

## Threat: [Compromised Community Port Repository](./threats/compromised_community_port_repository.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a community-maintained repository of vcpkg ports. Developers using these community ports might unknowingly download and build packages containing malicious code or vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Similar to a compromised official repository, leading to the introduction of malicious or vulnerable dependencies.
*   **Affected vcpkg Component:** `vcpkg` core functionality when configured to use community repositories, specifically the package download and build mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Exercise caution when using community ports.
    *   Thoroughly review portfiles from community repositories before using them.
    *   Prefer ports from well-established and reputable community maintainers.
    *   Consider forking and auditing community ports before integrating them into your project.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Package Downloads](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_package_downloads.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic during the download of package sources or portfiles by vcpkg. The attacker injects malicious code or modified files before they reach the developer's machine.
*   **Impact:** Introduction of compromised dependencies, potentially leading to application vulnerabilities or system compromise during the build process.
*   **Affected vcpkg Component:** `vcpkg` core functionality, specifically the package download mechanism.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure all vcpkg operations are performed over secure connections (HTTPS).
    *   Verify checksums of downloaded files to detect tampering (vcpkg does this, ensure it's enabled and trusted).
    *   Use a trusted network connection for development and build environments.

## Threat: [Malicious Code in Portfiles](./threats/malicious_code_in_portfiles.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker contributes or modifies a portfile in a way that executes malicious commands during the package build process. This could involve downloading and executing arbitrary scripts or modifying build configurations to introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine or build server, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or the introduction of backdoors into the built libraries.
*   **Affected vcpkg Component:** `vcpkg` portfile processing and build execution mechanism.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review portfiles before using them, especially those from community sources.
    *   Implement code review processes for portfile changes.
    *   Run vcpkg in isolated environments or containers to limit the impact of malicious portfile execution.
    *   Utilize static analysis tools to scan portfiles for suspicious commands or patterns.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attack](./threats/dependency_confusionsubstitution_attack.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker creates a malicious package with the same name as a legitimate dependency in a public or private repository that vcpkg is configured to search. vcpkg might inadvertently download and install the attacker's malicious package instead of the intended one.
*   **Impact:** Introduction of malicious dependencies into the application, potentially leading to various security vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected vcpkg Component:** `vcpkg` package resolution and download mechanism, especially when multiple repositories are configured.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully manage and prioritize the order of configured repositories in vcpkg.
    *   Use explicit version pinning for dependencies in the vcpkg manifest file.
    *   Consider using private vcpkg registries for internal dependencies to avoid confusion with public packages.
