# Attack Tree Analysis for microsoft/vcpkg

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To gain unauthorized access and control over the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities introduced through the vcpkg dependency management system.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
Compromise Application via vcpkg **(CRITICAL NODE)**
*   Introduce Malicious Dependency **(HIGH RISK PATH)**
    *   Supply Chain Attack on Upstream Dependency **(HIGH RISK PATH)**
        *   Compromise Upstream Git Repository **(CRITICAL NODE)**
        *   Compromise Maintainer Account **(CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH)**
    *   Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attack **(HIGH RISK PATH)**
    *   Directly Add Malicious Dependency to vcpkg.json **(HIGH RISK PATH)**
        *   Compromise Developer Machine/CI Environment **(CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH)**
*   Exploit Vulnerability in vcpkg Itself
    *   Exploit vcpkg Server/Registry Vulnerability (if using private registry)
        *   Gain Unauthorized Access to Registry **(CRITICAL NODE)**
*   Manipulate the Build Process **(HIGH RISK PATH)**
    *   Modify Portfile (build script) **(HIGH RISK PATH)**
    *   Tamper with Downloaded Source Code
        *   Compromise Download Server Infrastructure **(CRITICAL NODE)**

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via vcpkg (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_vcpkg__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access and control over the application, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or other malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Dependency (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_dependency__high_risk_path_.md)

This involves injecting harmful code into the application by leveraging the vcpkg dependency management system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attack on Upstream Dependency (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attack_on_upstream_dependency__high_risk_path_.md)

This targets the source code of legitimate libraries used by the application.
*   **Compromise Upstream Git Repository (CRITICAL NODE):**  Attackers gain control over the source code repository of a dependency.
    *   Inject Malicious Code into Existing Library: Modifying existing files to introduce backdoors or malicious functionality.
    *   Replace Legitimate Library with Malicious One: Completely replacing the legitimate code with a malicious version.
*   **Compromise Maintainer Account (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH):** Attackers target the accounts of maintainers with write access to the upstream repository.
    *   Phishing Attack: Tricking maintainers into revealing their credentials.
    *   Credential Stuffing: Using compromised credentials from other breaches.
    *   Social Engineering: Manipulating maintainers into performing actions that compromise their accounts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attack (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_confusionsubstitution_attack__high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers exploit how dependency managers resolve package names.
*   Register Malicious Package with Same Name in Public/Private Registry: An attacker registers a malicious package with the same name as an internal dependency in a public or private registry.

## Attack Tree Path: [Directly Add Malicious Dependency to vcpkg.json (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/directly_add_malicious_dependency_to_vcpkg_json__high_risk_path_.md)

This requires access to the application's source code repository.
*   **Compromise Developer Machine/CI Environment (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH):** Gaining access to systems where the `vcpkg.json` file is stored and modified.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in vcpkg Itself](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_vcpkg_itself.md)

This involves directly exploiting weaknesses within the vcpkg tool.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit vcpkg Server/Registry Vulnerability (if using private registry)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vcpkg_serverregistry_vulnerability__if_using_private_registry_.md)

If a private vcpkg registry is used, vulnerabilities in that infrastructure can be exploited.
*   **Gain Unauthorized Access to Registry (CRITICAL NODE):** Exploiting authentication or authorization flaws to access the private registry.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate the Build Process (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_the_build_process__high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers interfere with the process of building the application and its dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Portfile (build script) (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/modify_portfile__build_script___high_risk_path_.md)

`portfile.cmake` scripts define how dependencies are built. Attackers can manipulate these scripts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tamper with Downloaded Source Code](./attack_tree_paths/tamper_with_downloaded_source_code.md)

Intercepting and modifying the source code downloaded by vcpkg.
*   **Compromise Download Server Infrastructure (CRITICAL NODE):** Targeting the servers hosting the source code archives to inject malicious code directly into the files.
