# Threat Model Analysis for microsoft/vcpkg

## Threat: [Compromised Upstream Source Code](./threats/compromised_upstream_source_code.md)

**Threat:** Compromised Upstream Source Code

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the upstream repository (e.g., through compromised credentials or a vulnerability in the repository platform) and modifies the source code of a library managed by vcpkg. When vcpkg fetches and builds this compromised version, the resulting application will contain the malicious code. The attacker might inject backdoors, malware, or vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**  Application compromise, data breaches, denial of service, supply chain attack affecting downstream users of the application.

**Affected Component:** vcpkg download process, vcpkg build process.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- Pin specific commit hashes or tags in `vcpkg.json` instead of relying solely on version numbers.
- Implement submodules or similar mechanisms for vendoring critical dependencies when feasible.
- Monitor upstream repositories for suspicious activity and security advisories.
- Consider using tools that perform static analysis on downloaded source code.

## Threat: [Malicious Packages in Unofficial Overlays](./threats/malicious_packages_in_unofficial_overlays.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Packages in Unofficial Overlays

**Description:** An attacker creates or compromises an unofficial vcpkg overlay repository and introduces malicious packages. If developers unknowingly or intentionally use this overlay, vcpkg will fetch and build these malicious packages, integrating them into the application. The attacker might create packages that exfiltrate data, execute arbitrary code upon installation or runtime, or introduce vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Application compromise, data breaches, arbitrary code execution on developer machines and potentially end-user machines.

**Affected Component:** vcpkg overlay mechanism, vcpkg package resolution, vcpkg build process.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- Exercise extreme caution when using unofficial overlays. Only use overlays from trusted and reputable sources.
- Thoroughly review the contents and portfiles of packages from unofficial overlays before using them.
- Consider maintaining an internal, curated overlay with vetted packages.
- Implement mechanisms to restrict the use of specific overlays within the development team.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attacks](./threats/dependency_confusionsubstitution_attacks.md)

**Threat:** Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attacks

**Description:** An attacker creates a malicious package with the same name as a legitimate library managed by vcpkg and publishes it to a location where vcpkg might find it (e.g., a public Git repository if using custom repositories). If vcpkg is configured to search these locations and doesn't have strict resolution rules, it might install the malicious package instead of the intended one.

**Impact:** Installation of malicious code, application compromise, arbitrary code execution.

**Affected Component:** vcpkg package resolution logic, vcpkg search paths, `vcpkg.json` configuration.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- Be explicit and precise in `vcpkg.json` when specifying dependencies, potentially including repository locations if necessary.
- Avoid overly broad search paths for packages.
- If using custom repositories, ensure their security and integrity.
- Consider using a private, internal package repository for dependencies.

## Threat: [Malicious Code in Portfiles](./threats/malicious_code_in_portfiles.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Code in Portfiles

**Description:** An attacker compromises a portfile within a vcpkg repository (either the official one or a custom overlay). The malicious portfile contains commands that execute arbitrary code during the build process. This could involve downloading and executing additional malicious scripts, modifying build outputs, or exfiltrating data from the build environment.

**Impact:** Compromise of the build environment, potential backdoors in built libraries, exposure of sensitive information from the build environment.

**Affected Component:** vcpkg portfile execution, vcpkg build process.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- Implement code review processes for portfile changes.
- Use static analysis tools to scan portfiles for suspicious commands.
- Limit write access to portfile repositories.
- Run vcpkg builds in isolated and controlled environments.

## Threat: [Compromised Developer Machine Leads to Malicious Package Integration](./threats/compromised_developer_machine_leads_to_malicious_package_integration.md)

**Threat:** Compromised Developer Machine Leads to Malicious Package Integration

**Description:** An attacker compromises a developer's machine and gains the ability to modify the local vcpkg installation, cache, or project files (including `vcpkg.json`). The attacker could then introduce malicious dependencies or modify existing ones to inject malicious code into the application during the next build.

**Impact:** Application compromise, introduction of malware, potential supply chain attack if the compromised application is distributed.

**Affected Component:** Local vcpkg installation, vcpkg cache, `vcpkg.json` file.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- Enforce strong security practices on developer machines (endpoint security, regular patching, strong passwords, multi-factor authentication).
- Implement access controls and restrict write access to project files and the vcpkg installation directory.
- Use code signing for application binaries to verify their integrity.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack on vcpkg Tool Itself](./threats/supply_chain_attack_on_vcpkg_tool_itself.md)

**Threat:** Supply Chain Attack on vcpkg Tool Itself

**Description:** An attacker compromises the vcpkg tool's distribution mechanism or repository. This could involve distributing a modified version of the vcpkg executable that contains malicious code.

**Impact:** Widespread compromise of applications built using the compromised vcpkg tool.

**Affected Component:** vcpkg executable, vcpkg distribution channels.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- Download vcpkg from the official GitHub repository or trusted distribution channels.
- Verify the integrity of the downloaded vcpkg executable using checksums or signatures provided by the developers.
- Keep the vcpkg tool updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
