## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise a vcpkg Port (Package) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_a_vcpkg_port__package___high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the overarching category for attacks that target the packages managed by vcpkg. The attacker aims to introduce malicious code into a package that will then be installed by users.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **1.1. Supply Chain Attack on Upstream Source [HIGH-RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** Attacks targeting the original source code of the library *before* it's packaged for vcpkg.
        *   **Sub-Vectors:**
            *   **1.1.1. Compromise Upstream Source Repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) [CRITICAL]:**
                *   **Description:** Gaining full control over the repository where the library's source code is hosted. This allows the attacker to modify the code directly.
                *   **Sub-Vectors:**
                    *   **1.1.1.1. Stolen Credentials of Upstream Maintainer [HIGH-RISK]:**
                        *   **Description:** Obtaining the username and password (or other authentication tokens) of a maintainer with write access to the repository. This could be achieved through phishing, credential stuffing, or other credential theft techniques.
                    *   **1.1.1.3. Social Engineering of Upstream Maintainer [HIGH-RISK]:**
                        *   **Description:** Tricking a maintainer into granting access to the repository or revealing sensitive information. This could involve impersonation, pretexting, or other social engineering tactics.

    *   **1.2.1. Bypass vcpkg Port Review Process [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** Circumventing the checks and reviews that are in place to prevent malicious code from being added to the official vcpkg ports repository.
        *    **Sub-Vectors:**
            *    **1.2.1.3. Submit Obfuscated Malicious Code [HIGH-RISK]:**
                *   **Description:**  Writing malicious code in a way that is difficult to understand or detect during code review. This could involve using complex logic, unusual coding patterns, or encoding techniques.

    *   **1.3. Create a Typosquatting Port [HIGH-RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** Creating a malicious package with a name that is very similar to a popular, legitimate package. This relies on users making typographical errors when installing packages.
        *   **Sub-Vectors:**
            *   **1.3.1.1. User Installs Typosquatting Package by Mistake [HIGH-RISK]:**
                *   **Description:** The final step in the typosquatting attack, where a user accidentally installs the malicious package instead of the intended one.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Misconfiguration of vcpkg [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__misconfiguration_of_vcpkg__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This category covers vulnerabilities that arise from incorrect or insecure configurations of vcpkg itself.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **3.1. Using an Outdated vcpkg Version [HIGH-RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** Failing to update vcpkg to the latest version, leaving it vulnerable to known security flaws.
        *   **Sub-Vectors:**
            *   **3.1.1. Known Vulnerabilities in Older vcpkg Versions [HIGH-RISK]:**
                *   **Description:**  Specific vulnerabilities that have been publicly disclosed and patched in newer versions of vcpkg. Attackers can easily exploit these known vulnerabilities if the user hasn't updated.

    *   **3.3. Ignoring vcpkg Security Warnings/Recommendations [HIGH-RISK]:**
        *   **Description:**  Disregarding security best practices and recommendations provided by the vcpkg developers.
        *   **Sub-Vectors:**
            *   **3.3.1. Disabling Security Features (e.g., Binary Caching Validation) [HIGH-RISK]:**
                *   **Description:**  Turning off security features that are designed to protect against malicious packages or compromised builds.  For example, disabling binary caching validation would allow the use of potentially tampered-with pre-built binaries.

    *   **3.4. Using Unverified/Untrusted Registries [HIGH-RISK]:**
        *   **Description:**  Configuring vcpkg to download packages from sources that are not officially vetted or trusted.
        *   **Sub-Vectors:**
            *   **3.4.1. Downloading Packages from Malicious Registries [HIGH-RISK]:**
                *   **Description:**  Actually downloading and installing packages from a registry that is controlled by an attacker or contains compromised packages.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Installed Packages (Post-Installation) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_installed_packages__post-installation___high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This category covers vulnerabilities that exist within the libraries and dependencies that are installed *after* vcpkg has done its job.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **4.1. Known Vulnerabilities in Installed Libraries [HIGH-RISK] [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities that have been publicly disclosed in the libraries that are used by the application.
        *   **Sub-Vectors:**
            *   **4.1.1. Failure to Update Dependencies Regularly [HIGH-RISK]:**
                *   **Description:**  Not keeping the installed libraries up-to-date with the latest security patches.
                *   **Sub-Vectors:**
                    *   **4.1.1.1. Application Uses Vulnerable Version of a Library [HIGH-RISK]:**
                        *   **Description:**  The direct consequence of not updating dependencies – the application is running code that contains known vulnerabilities.
