# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for microsoft/vcpkg

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use a Private `vcpkg` Registry](./mitigation_strategies/use_a_private__vcpkg__registry.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy:** Use a Private `vcpkg` Registry

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Set up a private registry server:** (Details omitted, as this is external to `vcpkg`)
    2.  **Configure the registry:** (Details omitted, as this is external to `vcpkg`)
    3.  **Populate the registry:**
        *   **Initial population:** Download source, audit, and build using `vcpkg`.
        *   **Build the package:** Use `vcpkg install <package> --triplet <triplet>` to build the package from the audited source code.  Use the appropriate triplet for your target platform.
        *   **Upload to the registry:** (Details omitted, as this is external to `vcpkg`)
    4.  **Configure `vcpkg` to use the private registry:**
        *   **Set environment variables:** This is the *direct `vcpkg` interaction*. Set `VCPKG_DEFAULT_BINARY_CACHE` and `VCPKG_BINARY_SOURCES`. Example:
            ```bash
            export VCPKG_DEFAULT_BINARY_CACHE=https://your-private-registry/vcpkg-cache
            export VCPKG_BINARY_SOURCES="clear;your-private-registry-source"
            ```
        *   **Test the configuration:** Run `vcpkg install <package>` to verify.
    5.  **Maintain the registry:** (Details omitted, as this is largely external to `vcpkg`)

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Dependency Confusion/Substitution (High Severity)
    *   Supply Chain Attacks (High Severity)
    *   Outdated/Vulnerable Dependencies (Medium Severity)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Dependency Confusion/Substitution: Risk reduced to near zero.
    *   Supply Chain Attacks: Risk significantly reduced.
    *   Outdated/Vulnerable Dependencies: Risk moderately reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Entire strategy is missing. Requires setting environment variables for all `vcpkg` usage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Binary Caching with Verification](./mitigation_strategies/binary_caching_with_verification.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy:** Binary Caching with Verification

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a binary cache provider:** (Details omitted, as this is external to `vcpkg`)
    2.  **Configure the binary cache:** (Details omitted, as this is external to `vcpkg`)
    3.  **Enable signature verification:** (Details omitted, as this is external to `vcpkg`)
    4.  **Configure `vcpkg`:**
        *   **Set the `VCPKG_BINARY_SOURCES` environment variable:** This is the *direct `vcpkg` interaction*. Example with Azure Artifacts:
            ```bash
            export VCPKG_BINARY_SOURCES="clear;nuget,https://your-nuget-feed/index.json,readwrite"
            ```
        *   **Configure authentication:** Provide credentials (e.g., through environment variables or configuration files, depending on the provider and `vcpkg`'s integration).
    5.  **Build and upload signed packages:**
        *   Use `vcpkg` with a signing tool. The specifics depend on the tool, but the interaction with `vcpkg` is to build the package as usual; the signing happens as a pre- or post-build step.
        *   Upload using the provider's tools (not directly `vcpkg`).
    6.  **Test the configuration:** Run `vcpkg install <package>`. `vcpkg` should download and verify the signature.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Supply Chain Attacks (High Severity)
    *   Tampering (High Severity)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Supply Chain Attacks: Risk significantly reduced.
    *   Tampering: Risk reduced to near zero.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented (caching enabled, but no signature verification).

*   **Missing Implementation:** Signature verification. Requires setting `VCPKG_BINARY_SOURCES` to a provider supporting verification and configuring signing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicitly Specify Package Versions (and Hashes)](./mitigation_strategies/explicitly_specify_package_versions__and_hashes_.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy:** Explicitly Specify Package Versions (and Hashes)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Edit `vcpkg.json`:** This is the *direct `vcpkg` interaction*.
    2.  **Specify exact versions:** Use the `"version"` field within the `"overrides"` section for each dependency.
        ```json
        {
          "dependencies": [
            { "name": "fmt", "version>=": "8.1.1", "overrides": [{"name": "fmt", "version": "8.1.1"}] }
          ]
        }
        ```
    3.  **Use `builtin-baseline`:** Add the `builtin-baseline` field and set it to a commit hash.
        ```json
        {
          "name": "my-project",
          "version": "1.0.0",
          "builtin-baseline": "a1b2c3d4e5f6...", // Commit hash
          "dependencies": [ /* ... */ ]
        }
        ```
    4.  **Verify with `dry-run` (Optional):** Use `vcpkg install --triplet <triplet> --dry-run`.
    5.  **Commit changes:** Commit the updated `vcpkg.json`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Dependency Confusion/Substitution (Medium Severity)
    *   Outdated/Vulnerable Dependencies (Medium Severity)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Dependency Confusion/Substitution: Risk moderately reduced.
    *   Outdated/Vulnerable Dependencies: Risk moderately reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented (some versions specified, `builtin-baseline` missing).

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Full version specification and `builtin-baseline` in `vcpkg.json`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update `vcpkg` and Packages](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update__vcpkg__and_packages.md)

**4. Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update `vcpkg` and Packages

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Update `vcpkg`:**
        *   Run `git pull` within the `vcpkg` directory. This is the *direct `vcpkg` interaction*.
    2.  **Update packages:**
        *   Run `vcpkg update`. This is the *direct `vcpkg` interaction*.
        *   Run `vcpkg upgrade`. This is the *direct `vcpkg` interaction*.
    3.  **Establish a schedule:** (Details omitted, as this is a process issue)
    4.  **Automate (Optional):** (Details omitted, as this is external to `vcpkg`)

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Outdated/Vulnerable Dependencies (High Severity)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Outdated/Vulnerable Dependencies: Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Requires regular execution of `git pull`, `vcpkg update`, and `vcpkg upgrade`.
