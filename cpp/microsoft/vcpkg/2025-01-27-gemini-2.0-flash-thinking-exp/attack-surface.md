# Attack Surface Analysis for microsoft/vcpkg

## Attack Surface: [Compromised vcpkg Repository](./attack_surfaces/compromised_vcpkg_repository.md)

*   **Description:** The official vcpkg GitHub repository or its mirrors are compromised, leading to malicious code injection into the vcpkg tool or port definitions distributed through vcpkg.
*   **vcpkg Contribution:** vcpkg relies on its repository as the primary source for its executable and dependency information (ports). Compromise here directly impacts all vcpkg users.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the vcpkg repository and modifies the `vcpkg.exe` binary hosted for download or a core port definition like `openssl` within the repository. Users downloading vcpkg or installing/updating `openssl` via vcpkg will receive the compromised components.
*   **Impact:** Widespread and critical compromise of developer machines and applications built using vcpkg. Potential for large-scale supply chain attacks, data breaches, and erosion of trust in the development ecosystem.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Verify vcpkg Source:** Download vcpkg only from the official GitHub releases page and verify the integrity using provided checksums or signatures if available.
    *   **Pin vcpkg Commit:** Use a specific, known-good commit hash of the vcpkg repository instead of relying on dynamic tags or `HEAD` for more predictable and auditable builds.
    *   **Monitor Official Channels:** Actively monitor official vcpkg security advisories and announcements from Microsoft for any indications of repository compromise or security issues.
    *   **Repository Mirroring with Strict Controls (Advanced):** For highly sensitive environments, consider creating and maintaining a private mirror of the official vcpkg repository with stringent access controls and integrity verification processes.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Port Repositories (Third-Party/Custom)](./attack_surfaces/compromised_port_repositories__third-partycustom_.md)

*   **Description:** When using custom or third-party port repositories with vcpkg, these repositories become a potential attack vector if they are compromised, leading to malicious code in port definitions or build scripts used by vcpkg.
*   **vcpkg Contribution:** vcpkg's design allows for the addition of external port repositories, expanding the scope of trusted sources beyond the official repository and potentially introducing less secure or unverified sources.
*   **Example:** A development team adds a third-party vcpkg port repository to access a specific library. An attacker compromises this third-party repository and injects malicious code into the `portfile.cmake` of a seemingly benign port. Developers using this repository and installing that port via vcpkg will execute the malicious build script.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of applications that depend on libraries from the malicious port repository. Potential for targeted attacks, data exfiltration, and application instability due to backdoored dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rigorous Vetting of Third-Party Repositories:** Exercise extreme caution and perform thorough due diligence when considering the use of any third-party or custom vcpkg port repositories. Evaluate the repository maintainer's reputation, security practices, and history.
    *   **Mandatory Code Review of Port Definitions:** Implement a mandatory code review process for all port definitions and build scripts originating from third-party repositories before they are used in development or production builds. Focus on `portfile.cmake` and any associated scripts for suspicious or malicious commands.
    *   **Repository Scope Minimization:** Limit the use of third-party repositories to only those that are absolutely necessary and avoid adding repositories with broad or unvetted collections of ports.
    *   **Preference for Official Ports:** Prioritize using ports available in the official vcpkg repository whenever possible, as these are subject to Microsoft's maintenance and (presumably) security oversight.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Port Build Scripts](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_port_build_scripts.md)

*   **Description:** Port build scripts (primarily `portfile.cmake` and related scripts) within vcpkg port definitions may contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited by vcpkg during the dependency build process.
*   **vcpkg Contribution:** vcpkg directly executes the build scripts defined in port definitions to automate dependency compilation and installation. Vulnerabilities within these scripts can be directly triggered by vcpkg during its normal operation.
*   **Example:** A `portfile.cmake` in a vcpkg port definition contains a command injection vulnerability. When vcpkg executes this script as part of the build process, an attacker who can influence the build environment or the port definition itself could inject malicious commands that are then executed with the privileges of the vcpkg build process.
*   **Impact:** Local code execution on the build machine during the vcpkg build process. This can lead to system compromise, privilege escalation, injection of malicious code into build artifacts, or denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (can be critical depending on the nature of the vulnerability and the privileges of the build environment)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Security Audits of Port Build Scripts:** Conduct regular security audits of port build scripts, especially for complex or less common ports, looking for common vulnerability patterns such as command injection, path traversal, insecure file handling, and race conditions.
    *   **Static Analysis Tools for Build Scripts:** Employ static analysis tools specifically designed for CMake or shell scripting to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities in port build scripts.
    *   **Sandboxed vcpkg Build Environments:** Isolate vcpkg build processes within sandboxed or containerized environments to limit the potential impact of vulnerabilities in build scripts. Restrict the permissions and network access available to the build process.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Builds:** Ensure that the vcpkg build process operates with the minimum necessary privileges required to perform its tasks, reducing the potential damage from successful exploitation of build script vulnerabilities.
