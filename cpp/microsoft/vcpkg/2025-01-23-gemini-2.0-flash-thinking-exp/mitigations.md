# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for microsoft/vcpkg

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Dependency Scanning and Vulnerability Monitoring for vcpkg Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/implement_dependency_scanning_and_vulnerability_monitoring_for_vcpkg_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Select a vulnerability scanning tool capable of analyzing vcpkg manifest files (`vcpkg.json`, `vcpkg.lock.json`) and identifying known vulnerabilities in the libraries managed by vcpkg.
    2.  Integrate this scanning tool into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan for vulnerabilities whenever dependencies are updated or changed in `vcpkg.json`.
    3.  Configure the tool to generate reports and alerts when vulnerabilities are detected in vcpkg-managed dependencies.
    4.  Establish a workflow to review these reports, prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity and exploitability, and plan for updates or patches using vcpkg.
    5.  Ensure the vulnerability database used by the scanning tool is regularly updated to include the latest vulnerability information relevant to vcpkg libraries.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Vulnerable vcpkg Dependencies (High Severity):** Introduction of vulnerable third-party libraries into the application through vcpkg, leading to potential exploits.
        *   **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities via vcpkg (Medium Severity):**  Compromised or vulnerable libraries unknowingly pulled in through vcpkg's dependency resolution process.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Vulnerable vcpkg Dependencies:** Significantly reduces the risk of deploying applications with known vulnerable libraries managed by vcpkg.
        *   **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities via vcpkg:** Moderately reduces the risk by providing visibility into vulnerabilities within the vcpkg dependency supply chain.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** No (Example - Assuming not yet implemented, adjust based on your project status)
        *   Currently, we rely on manual checks and general awareness of library vulnerabilities, without automated scanning integrated with vcpkg.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Selection and integration of a vulnerability scanning tool compatible with vcpkg manifests.
        *   Automated scanning of `vcpkg.json` and `vcpkg.lock.json` in the CI/CD pipeline.
        *   Automated alerts and reporting for vcpkg dependency vulnerabilities.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Pin vcpkg Dependency Versions using Manifest Mode and Lockfiles](./mitigation_strategies/pin_vcpkg_dependency_versions_using_manifest_mode_and_lockfiles.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Adopt vcpkg's manifest mode by including a `vcpkg.json` file in your project root to declare direct dependencies.
    2.  Utilize version constraints within `vcpkg.json` to specify acceptable version ranges or exact versions for your dependencies.
    3.  After running `vcpkg install`, ensure you commit the automatically generated `vcpkg.lock.json` file to your version control system. This file precisely records the resolved versions of all direct and transitive dependencies.
    4.  Configure your build system to consistently use the committed `vcpkg.lock.json` to ensure reproducible builds with the exact same dependency versions across different environments.
    5.  When updating vcpkg dependencies, intentionally modify `vcpkg.json` and regenerate `vcpkg.lock.json`, followed by thorough testing to validate the changes.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **vcpkg Dependency Version Drift (Medium Severity):** Inconsistencies in vcpkg dependency versions across development, testing, and production environments, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities in production.
        *   **Unintentional vcpkg Dependency Updates (Medium Severity):**  Automatic or uncontrolled updates of vcpkg dependencies that might introduce regressions, bugs, or new vulnerabilities without proper testing.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **vcpkg Dependency Version Drift:** Significantly reduces the risk of version drift by enforcing consistent vcpkg dependency versions through lockfiles.
        *   **Unintentional vcpkg Dependency Updates:** Significantly reduces the risk of unexpected updates by requiring explicit changes to `vcpkg.json` and lockfile regeneration.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Yes (Example - Assuming manifest mode and lockfiles are used, adjust based on your project status)
        *   We are currently using vcpkg manifest mode and committing `vcpkg.lock.json` to version control for dependency version pinning.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   N/A - Currently implemented.  However, reinforce developer understanding of the importance of `vcpkg.lock.json` and the manifest workflow.
