Here's the updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving the Microsoft Calculator library:

*   **Threat:** Malicious Input Exploiting Parsing Logic
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a specially designed input string intended to exploit vulnerabilities in the calculator's input parsing module. This could involve providing malformed expressions, excessively long inputs, or inputs with unexpected characters that the parser doesn't handle correctly. This could lead to the parser crashing, entering an infinite loop, or behaving in an unpredictable manner.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) against the calculator functionality, potentially causing the web application to become unresponsive or return errors.
    *   **Affected Component:** Input Parsing Module (likely within the core calculation engine of the library).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation on all data passed to the calculator library, including type checking, range checks, and format validation.
        *   Sanitize user input to remove or escape potentially harmful characters before passing it to the calculator.
        *   Implement timeouts for calculator operations to prevent indefinite processing.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed environment or a separate process to execute the calculator library to limit the impact of crashes.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Calculator Library Dependencies
    *   **Description:** The Microsoft Calculator library might depend on other third-party libraries. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, they could indirectly affect the security of the web application. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities through the calculator library.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for various vulnerabilities depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability (e.g., remote code execution, data breaches).
    *   **Affected Component:** Dependencies of the Microsoft Calculator library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update the calculator library and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies.
