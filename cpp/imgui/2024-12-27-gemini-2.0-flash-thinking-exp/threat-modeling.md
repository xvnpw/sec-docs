| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected ImGui Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Input Injection via Text Fields** | An attacker enters maliciously crafted text into `ImGui::InputText` fields. This could involve excessively long strings, format string specifiers, or escape sequences, potentially leading to buffer overflows or unexpected behavior within ImGui's internal handling or when the application processes the (potentially malformed) input received from ImGui. | Application crash, denial of service, potential for code execution if ImGui's internal handling or the application's processing of the input is vulnerable. | `imgui.h` - Specifically the `InputText` family of functions. | High | * **Input Validation (Application-Side):** Implement strict input validation and sanitization on data received from `ImGui::InputText` *before* processing it within the application logic. Limit input length, restrict character sets, and escape special characters as needed. * **Consider ImGui's Internal Limits:** Be aware of ImGui's internal buffer sizes and limitations for text input to avoid triggering issues within ImGui itself. |
