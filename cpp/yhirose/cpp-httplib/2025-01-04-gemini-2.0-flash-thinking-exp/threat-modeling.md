# Threat Model Analysis for yhirose/cpp-httplib

## Threat: [Malformed HTTP Request Parsing (Headers)](./threats/malformed_http_request_parsing__headers_.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a crafted HTTP request with malformed or excessively large headers. The `cpp-httplib` request parser fails to handle this input correctly, potentially leading to a crash, denial-of-service (DoS), or unexpected behavior. The attacker might exploit this by repeatedly sending such requests to exhaust server resources.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential server crash, unpredictable application behavior.

**Affected Component:** `httplib::detail::request_reader` (specifically header parsing logic).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement request size limits within the application using `cpp-httplib`'s configuration options or by adding a layer of input validation before processing with the library.
*   Ensure proper error handling around request parsing to gracefully handle invalid input without crashing.

## Threat: [HTTP Header Injection](./threats/http_header_injection.md)

**Description:** If the application uses user-controlled input to construct HTTP headers when sending responses (server) or requests (client) *using `cpp-httplib`'s header manipulation functions*, an attacker could inject arbitrary headers. This can lead to vulnerabilities like HTTP Response Splitting (server-side), cache poisoning, or manipulation of client-side behavior.

**Impact:** HTTP Response Splitting, cache poisoning, session hijacking (if cookies are manipulated), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** `httplib::Response` (for server), `httplib::Client` and `httplib::Request` (for client) when using functions to set headers programmatically.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Never directly use user input when using `cpp-httplib`'s functions to set HTTP headers.
*   Sanitize or encode user-provided data before including it in headers using appropriate encoding functions *before* passing it to `cpp-httplib`.

## Threat: [Large HTTP Body Handling Vulnerabilities](./threats/large_http_body_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a request or the server sends a response with an extremely large body. If `cpp-httplib` doesn't handle large bodies efficiently or has insufficient resource limits *within its own implementation*, it could lead to excessive memory consumption, denial-of-service, or application crashes.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), memory exhaustion, application crash.

**Affected Component:** `httplib::detail::request_reader` (for requests), `httplib::detail::response_writer` (for responses), and potentially underlying buffer management within `cpp-httplib`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement limits on the maximum allowed size for request and response bodies within the application, considering `cpp-httplib`'s capabilities and limitations.
*   Utilize `cpp-httplib`'s mechanisms for handling large data streams (if available) in a memory-efficient way.

## Threat: [TLS/SSL Implementation Weaknesses](./threats/tlsssl_implementation_weaknesses.md)

**Description:** `cpp-httplib` relies on an underlying TLS/SSL library (like OpenSSL). If this underlying library has known vulnerabilities or is configured insecurely *within `cpp-httplib`'s SSL context setup*, the application's secure communication can be compromised, allowing man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

**Impact:** Data interception, eavesdropping, data manipulation, impersonation.

**Affected Component:** `httplib::SSLClient`, `httplib::SSLServer`, and the underlying TLS/SSL library integration *as configured by `cpp-httplib`*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Ensure `cpp-httplib` is built against a recent and patched version of the underlying TLS/SSL library.
*   Configure `cpp-httplib` to use strong and secure cipher suites, disabling known weak or vulnerable ones through its configuration options.
*   Enforce proper certificate validation for both client and server roles *using `cpp-httplib`'s provided methods*.

## Threat: [Improper Certificate Validation (Client-Side)](./threats/improper_certificate_validation__client-side_.md)

**Description:** When the application acts as an HTTPS client using `cpp-httplib`, if it doesn't properly validate the server's SSL/TLS certificate *using `cpp-httplib`'s certificate verification mechanisms*, an attacker could perform a MITM attack by presenting a forged certificate.

**Impact:** Connection to malicious servers, data interception, data manipulation, credential theft.

**Affected Component:** `httplib::SSLClient` (specifically certificate verification logic within `cpp-httplib`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Ensure that certificate verification is enabled and configured correctly when using `httplib::SSLClient`'s options for certificate validation.
*   Consider using certificate pinning for enhanced security in specific scenarios, leveraging `cpp-httplib`'s capabilities if available.

## Threat: [Path Traversal (Server-Side File Serving)](./threats/path_traversal__server-side_file_serving_.md)

**Description:** If the application uses `cpp-httplib`'s server functionality to serve static files, vulnerabilities *within `cpp-httplib`'s path handling logic* could allow an attacker to request files outside the intended directory by manipulating the requested path (e.g., using "../").

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, information disclosure.

**Affected Component:** `httplib::Server`'s file serving functionality (specifically path resolution within `cpp-httplib`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   When using `cpp-httplib`'s file serving, ensure it's configured to restrict access to the intended document root.
*   Avoid directly using user-provided input to construct file paths passed to `cpp-httplib`'s file serving functions without thorough validation.

## Threat: [Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities (Buffer Overflows, Use-After-Free)](./threats/memory_corruption_vulnerabilities__buffer_overflows__use-after-free_.md)

**Description:** Due to the nature of C++, vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or use-after-free errors might exist within `cpp-httplib`'s code, particularly in areas handling string manipulation, data parsing, or memory management. An attacker could trigger these vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted requests or data, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution.

**Affected Component:** Various internal components of `cpp-httplib`, especially those dealing with memory management and data processing.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Regularly update `cpp-httplib` to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
*   Report any potential memory corruption issues discovered to the `cpp-httplib` developers.
