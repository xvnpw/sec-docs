## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using cpp-httplib [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_cpp-httplib__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Successful exploitation of any high-risk path can lead to this.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities (Application using cpp-httplib as a server) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server-side_vulnerabilities__application_using_cpp-httplib_as_a_server___critical_node_.md)

This involves targeting the application when it's acting as an HTTP server using cpp-httplib.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Request Handling [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_request_handling__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Buffer Overflow in Request Parsing [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/buffer_overflow_in_request_parsing__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Sending overly long HTTP headers or request body that exceed allocated buffer sizes within cpp-httplib's request parsing logic, leading to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Header Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/header_injection__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Injecting malicious HTTP headers (e.g., using CRLF characters) into the request that are then interpreted by the server or downstream systems, potentially leading to response splitting, session hijacking, or cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal via URL Encoding/Decoding Issues [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_via_url_encodingdecoding_issues__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Manipulating URL paths, often using URL encoding or other techniques, to bypass security checks and access files or directories outside of the intended webroot.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed Requests [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__via_malformed_requests__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Sending specially crafted, malformed, or excessively large HTTP requests that consume significant server resources (CPU, memory, network), leading to service disruption or crash.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Flooding the server with a large number of connection requests (Connection Exhaustion) or sending requests that cause excessive memory allocation (Memory Exhaustion), leading to denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Default Configurations](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_default_configurations.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Request Size Limits [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_request_size_limits__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Exploiting the absence of proper limits on the size of incoming requests to send extremely large requests, potentially causing buffer overflows, memory exhaustion, or other resource exhaustion issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Request Handlers (if applicable) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_custom_request_handlers__if_applicable___high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Exploiting security flaws within the application's own code that handles specific routes or functionalities defined using cpp-httplib's routing mechanisms. This could involve injection vulnerabilities, logic flaws, or other common web application vulnerabilities within the custom code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities (Application using cpp-httplib as a client) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities__application_using_cpp-httplib_as_a_client___critical_node_.md)

This involves targeting the application when it's making HTTP requests to external servers using cpp-httplib.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Response Handling [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_response_handling__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Buffer Overflow in Response Parsing](./attack_tree_paths/buffer_overflow_in_response_parsing.md)

Attack Vector: A malicious server sending overly long HTTP headers or response body that exceed allocated buffer sizes within cpp-httplib's response parsing logic in the client application, leading to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution on the client.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Handling of Redirects [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_handling_of_redirects__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: A malicious server sending redirect responses that lead the client application to a harmful website, a phishing page, or a location serving malware.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Response Processing Logic [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_custom_response_processing_logic__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Exploiting weaknesses in how the application processes the data received in HTTP responses. This could involve insecure deserialization, improper data validation leading to further vulnerabilities, or other logic flaws in the application's handling of the response data.

## Attack Tree Path: [TLS/SSL Vulnerabilities (related to client usage) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/tlsssl_vulnerabilities__related_to_client_usage___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (if certificate validation is disabled or flawed)](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks__if_certificate_validation_is_disabled_or_flawed_.md)

Attack Vector: If the client application doesn't properly validate the server's TLS certificate, an attacker can intercept and modify communication between the client and the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Certificate Validation Failures](./attack_tree_paths/certificate_validation_failures.md)

Attack Vector: The client application accepting invalid or self-signed certificates, making it vulnerable to MitM attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities within cpp-httplib Library Internals [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_within_cpp-httplib_library_internals__critical_node_.md)

This involves directly exploiting vulnerabilities within the cpp-httplib library's code itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Memory Management Issues [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/memory_management_issues__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Use-After-Free](./attack_tree_paths/use-after-free.md)

Attack Vector: Triggering a condition where the application attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to crashes or potentially arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Double-Free](./attack_tree_paths/double-free.md)

Attack Vector: Triggering a condition where the application attempts to free the same memory twice, leading to crashes or potentially exploitable memory corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Concurrency Issues (if the application uses cpp-httplib in a multi-threaded environment) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/concurrency_issues__if_the_application_uses_cpp-httplib_in_a_multi-threaded_environment___high-risk__daa46d57.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Race Conditions](./attack_tree_paths/race_conditions.md)

Attack Vector: Exploiting timing dependencies between threads accessing shared resources within cpp-httplib, leading to unpredictable behavior, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (if cpp-httplib relies on other vulnerable libraries) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_vulnerabilities__if_cpp-httplib_relies_on_other_vulnerable_libraries___high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries that cpp-httplib depends on. This requires identifying the vulnerable dependencies and leveraging existing exploits for those libraries.
