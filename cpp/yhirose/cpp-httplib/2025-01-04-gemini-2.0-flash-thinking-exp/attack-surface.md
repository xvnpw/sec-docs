# Attack Surface Analysis for yhirose/cpp-httplib

## Attack Surface: [Malformed HTTP Request Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/malformed_http_request_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The `cpp-httplib` library might be vulnerable to issues when parsing malformed or unexpected HTTP requests. This can include overly long headers, invalid characters, or non-standard formatting.
    *   **How cpp-httplib Contributes:** The library's internal parsing logic is responsible for interpreting the raw bytes of the incoming request. Errors in this logic can lead to crashes, unexpected behavior, or even memory corruption.
    *   **Example:** Sending a request with an excessively long header line (e.g., `GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nVery-Long-Header: ... [thousands of characters] ... \r\n\r\n`).
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the server, potential for memory corruption leading to arbitrary code execution (though less likely with modern memory safety features of C++ and the library).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Resource Limits:** Configure `cpp-httplib` with appropriate limits for header sizes and request body sizes (if the library provides such options).
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `cpp-httplib` updated to the latest version, as bug fixes often address parsing vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/http_header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** If the application logic directly uses user-controlled data to construct HTTP response headers through `cpp-httplib`'s API, attackers can inject arbitrary headers.
    *   **How cpp-httplib Contributes:** The library provides functions to set response headers. If the values passed to these functions are not properly sanitized, malicious headers can be injected.
    *   **Example:** An application sets a cookie based on user input: `response.set_header("Set-Cookie", "user=" + user_input);`. If `user_input` contains `"; HttpOnly"`, it injects the `HttpOnly` flag. More dangerous injections are possible.
    *   **Impact:** HTTP Response Splitting (leading to Cross-Site Scripting or cache poisoning), setting malicious cookies, manipulating caching behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Header-Specific Functions:** Use `cpp-httplib`'s API functions that handle header construction safely, if available (e.g., functions that might automatically handle escaping).

## Attack Surface: [URI Handling Vulnerabilities (Path Traversal)](./attack_surfaces/uri_handling_vulnerabilities__path_traversal_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses parts of the request URI to access files or resources on the server without proper validation, attackers can manipulate the URI to access unauthorized files.
    *   **How cpp-httplib Contributes:** The library parses the request URI and makes it available to the application. If the application directly uses this raw URI part for file system operations without sanitization, it's vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An application uses `request.path` to serve static files: `server.Get("/files/(.*)", [&](const httplib::Request& req, httplib::Response& res) { res.set_content(read_file("static/" + req.matches[1].str()), "text/plain"); });`. An attacker could request `/files/../../../../etc/passwd`.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for arbitrary file read or even write depending on the application logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Attack Surface: [Request Body Handling (Denial of Service)](./attack_surfaces/request_body_handling__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Description:**  If the application processes request bodies of arbitrary size without proper limits, attackers can send extremely large payloads to exhaust server resources.
    *   **How cpp-httplib Contributes:**  The library receives the request body. If the application reads and processes this body without size checks, it's vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** Sending a `POST` request with a multi-gigabyte payload to an endpoint that attempts to load the entire body into memory.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) by consuming excessive memory, CPU, or disk space.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Request Body Size Limits:** Configure `cpp-httplib` or the application to enforce maximum request body size limits.

## Attack Surface: [TLS/SSL Configuration Weaknesses (If HTTPS is Used)](./attack_surfaces/tlsssl_configuration_weaknesses__if_https_is_used_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses `cpp-httplib` for HTTPS and the TLS/SSL configuration is weak, it can be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks or other cryptographic weaknesses.
    *   **How cpp-httplib Contributes:** The library provides options for configuring TLS/SSL. Incorrect configuration choices expose the application.
    *   **Example:** Using outdated TLS protocols (e.g., TLS 1.0), weak cipher suites, or not properly validating server certificates.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach (data interception), integrity compromise (data manipulation), authentication bypass.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong TLS Configuration:**  Use strong and up-to-date TLS protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher).
        *   **Secure Cipher Suites:**  Configure `cpp-httplib` to use secure cipher suites and disable weak or vulnerable ones.

## Attack Surface: [Integer Overflows in Request/Response Handling](./attack_surfaces/integer_overflows_in_requestresponse_handling.md)

*   **Description:**  Bugs in `cpp-httplib`'s internal implementation might lead to integer overflows when calculating buffer sizes or other related values during request or response processing.
    *   **How cpp-httplib Contributes:** This is a vulnerability within the library's code itself.
    *   **Example:** A carefully crafted request with specific header lengths or body sizes might trigger an integer overflow in an internal calculation, leading to a small buffer being allocated for a large amount of data.
    *   **Impact:** Memory corruption (buffer overflows), leading to potential crashes or arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if exploitable)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:**  The primary mitigation is to keep `cpp-httplib` updated to the latest version, as such bugs are typically fixed by the library developers.
