## Deep Analysis: Header Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]

**Context:** This analysis focuses on the "Header Injection" attack path within an attack tree for an application utilizing the `cpp-httplib` library. This path is designated as "HIGH-RISK," indicating a significant potential for exploitation and impact.

**Attack Tree Path:** Header Injection

**Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious HTTP headers (e.g., using CRLF characters) into the request that are then interpreted by the server or downstream systems, potentially leading to response splitting, session hijacking, or cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

**Detailed Analysis:**

This attack vector leverages the way HTTP protocols handle headers. Headers are separated by Carriage Return Line Feed (CRLF) characters (`\r\n`). By injecting these characters into user-controlled input that is later used to construct HTTP responses, an attacker can effectively inject arbitrary headers or even the response body itself.

**Breakdown of the Attack Mechanism:**

1. **Vulnerable Input Point:** The application must have a point where user-controlled data is directly or indirectly used to construct HTTP headers. Common examples include:
    * **Query Parameters:**  Data passed in the URL (e.g., `?param=value`).
    * **Form Data (POST requests):** Data submitted through HTML forms.
    * **Custom Headers:**  Headers explicitly set by the client.
    * **Path Parameters:**  Segments within the URL path.

2. **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the input received from the user. This means it doesn't remove or escape CRLF characters or other potentially malicious header components.

3. **Header Construction:** The application uses the unsanitized input to build HTTP headers. This might involve directly concatenating user input into header strings or using functions that don't automatically escape special characters.

4. **CRLF Injection:** The attacker crafts a malicious input containing CRLF sequences. For example, if a parameter named `redirect_url` is vulnerable, the attacker might send:

   ```
   GET /vulnerable_page?redirect_url=https://evil.com%0d%0aSet-Cookie: PHPSESSID=malicious_session%0d%0a%0d%0aHTTP/1.1 200 OK%0d%0aContent-Type: text/html%0d%0a%0d%0a<html><body>You have been redirected!</body></html>
   ```

   Here, `%0d%0a` represents the URL-encoded CRLF.

5. **Server Interpretation:** The `cpp-httplib` server (or a downstream proxy/server) interprets the injected CRLF sequences as legitimate header separators. This allows the attacker to inject arbitrary headers and even start a new HTTP response.

**Potential Vulnerabilities Exploited:**

* **Response Splitting:** This is the most common consequence of header injection. By injecting CRLF characters, the attacker can insert arbitrary headers and even a complete second HTTP response. This can lead to:
    * **Cache Poisoning:**  The attacker can inject a malicious response into a cache server, which will then serve it to other users.
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By injecting headers like `Content-Type: text/html` and then a malicious HTML body, the attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.

* **Session Hijacking:** By injecting `Set-Cookie` headers, the attacker can potentially set their own session cookies on the victim's browser, allowing them to impersonate the victim.

* **Open Redirect:** If the injected headers manipulate redirection logic, the attacker can redirect users to malicious websites.

* **Information Disclosure:**  In some cases, attackers might inject headers to extract sensitive information or manipulate server behavior to reveal internal details.

**Specific Considerations for `cpp-httplib`:**

* **Input Handling:** How does the application using `cpp-httplib` receive and process user input that might be used in headers? Are there any built-in sanitization mechanisms within the application logic?
* **Header Setting:** How are headers being set in the application's responses? Are they being constructed using string concatenation or dedicated functions that might offer some level of protection?
* **Downstream Systems:** Even if the `cpp-httplib` server itself is hardened, vulnerabilities in downstream proxies or load balancers could still be exploited through header injection.

**Risk Assessment:**

* **Likelihood:**  If user input is directly used in header construction without proper sanitization, the likelihood of this attack being successful is **HIGH**.
* **Impact:** The impact of a successful header injection can be **CRITICAL**, leading to:
    * **Confidentiality Breach:** Session hijacking, information disclosure.
    * **Integrity Breach:** Cache poisoning, malicious redirects.
    * **Availability Breach:**  Potentially disrupting service through manipulated responses.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Strictly validate all user input:**  Define expected formats and reject anything that doesn't conform.
    * **Encode output:**  When constructing headers, use appropriate encoding functions to escape special characters, especially CRLF (`\r\n`). Ensure the library or framework you are using provides functions for this.
    * **Consider using a dedicated library for header manipulation:** This can help ensure consistent and secure handling of headers.

* **Secure Coding Practices:**
    * **Avoid direct string concatenation for header construction:** Use dedicated functions provided by `cpp-httplib` or other libraries that handle escaping automatically.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary permissions to reduce the impact of a successful attack.

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF to detect and block malicious requests containing CRLF sequences or other header injection patterns.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not a direct mitigation for header injection, a strong CSP can help mitigate the impact of XSS attacks that might be launched through response splitting.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure that mitigation measures are effective.

**Development Team Responsibilities:**

* **Code Review:**  Thoroughly review code that handles user input and constructs HTTP headers. Look for potential injection points and missing sanitization.
* **Input Validation Implementation:**  Implement robust input validation and sanitization mechanisms at all entry points.
* **Secure Header Handling:**  Utilize secure functions and libraries for header construction, avoiding manual string concatenation.
* **Security Testing:**  Perform specific tests for header injection vulnerabilities, including manually crafting malicious requests and using automated tools.
* **Stay Updated:**  Keep the `cpp-httplib` library and other dependencies up-to-date to benefit from security patches.

**Testing and Validation:**

* **Manual Testing:**  Craft requests with CRLF characters in various input fields (query parameters, form data, custom headers) and observe the server's response.
* **Automated Security Scanners:** Utilize security scanning tools that can identify header injection vulnerabilities.
* **Penetration Testing:** Engage security professionals to perform penetration testing and simulate real-world attacks.

**Conclusion:**

The "Header Injection" attack path represents a significant security risk for applications using `cpp-httplib`. The potential for response splitting, session hijacking, and XSS makes it crucial to implement robust mitigation strategies. The development team must prioritize secure coding practices, thorough input validation, and regular security testing to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Understanding the mechanisms of this attack and the specific context of `cpp-httplib` is essential for building secure applications.
