## Deep Dive Analysis: HTTP Header Injection Threat in `cpp-httplib` Applications

This document provides a detailed analysis of the HTTP Header Injection threat within applications utilizing the `cpp-httplib` library, as outlined in the provided threat model.

**1. Threat Breakdown and Mechanism:**

HTTP Header Injection occurs when an attacker can influence the content of HTTP headers sent by the server or client. This is achieved by injecting control characters, specifically Carriage Return (`\r`) and Line Feed (`\n`), into header values. These characters are used to delimit headers in the HTTP protocol. By injecting `\r\n`, an attacker can effectively terminate the current header and inject new, arbitrary headers.

**In the context of `cpp-httplib`:**

The library provides convenient functions for setting HTTP headers programmatically. While this offers flexibility, it becomes a vulnerability if the header values are directly derived from untrusted user input without proper sanitization.

* **Server-Side (`httplib::Response`):** When building responses, developers might use functions like `response.set_header(name, value)` to add custom headers. If `value` contains attacker-controlled data with injected `\r\n` sequences, the attacker can inject malicious headers into the response.
* **Client-Side (`httplib::Client`, `httplib::Request`):** Similarly, when making requests, developers might use `client.set_default_headers()` or directly manipulate `request.headers` to add custom headers. If these header values originate from untrusted sources and are not sanitized, the attacker can inject headers into the outgoing request.

**Example of Injection:**

Imagine a server-side application using `cpp-httplib` to set a custom header based on user input:

```cpp
#include "httplib.h"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  httplib::Server svr;

  svr.Get("/set_custom_header", [](const httplib::Request& req, httplib::Response& res) {
    std::string user_input = req.get_param("custom_value"); // Potentially malicious input

    // Vulnerable code: Directly using user input in the header
    res.set_header("Custom-Header", user_input);
    res.set_content("Header set!", "text/plain");
  });

  svr.listen("localhost", 8080);
  return 0;
}
```

An attacker could send a request like:

`GET /set_custom_header?custom_value=Injected-Header: malicious-value%0d%0aAnother-Injected-Header: more-malice HTTP/1.1`

This would result in the following HTTP response:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 11
Custom-Header: Injected-Header: malicious-value
Another-Injected-Header: more-malice
Header set!
```

The attacker has successfully injected the `Another-Injected-Header`.

**2. Detailed Impact Scenarios:**

* **HTTP Response Splitting (Server-Side):** This is the most direct consequence of header injection on the server. By injecting `\r\n\r\n`, the attacker can terminate the current HTTP response headers and inject their own malicious HTTP response. This can be used for:
    * **Cache Poisoning:** Injecting headers that cause intermediate caches to store the malicious response, serving it to other users.
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting a full HTML page with malicious JavaScript.
    * **Session Hijacking:** Injecting a `Set-Cookie` header to overwrite or set a session cookie for the victim.

* **Cache Poisoning (Client-Side):** When injecting headers into client requests, an attacker might be able to influence the caching behavior of intermediary proxies or the target server's cache. This could lead to the server caching a malicious response based on the attacker's crafted request.

* **Manipulation of Client-Side Behavior (Client-Side):** By injecting headers into client requests, an attacker could potentially influence the server's response in unexpected ways. For example, injecting a specific `User-Agent` or `Accept-Language` header might trigger different server-side logic. While less severe than response splitting, it can still lead to unexpected behavior or information disclosure.

* **Information Disclosure:** Injecting headers like `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` without proper handling can lead to vulnerabilities if the server doesn't correctly process chunked encoding, potentially revealing internal data.

**3. Affected Components in Detail:**

* **`httplib::Response::set_header(const std::string& name, const std::string& value)`:** This function is the primary entry point for injecting headers on the server-side. If the `value` parameter is derived from untrusted input, it's highly susceptible to injection.

* **`httplib::Client::set_default_headers(Headers headers)`:**  Setting default headers for all client requests using this function becomes vulnerable if any of the header values within the `headers` map originate from untrusted sources.

* **`httplib::Request::headers` (Direct Manipulation):**  While not a specific function call, directly accessing and modifying the `request.headers` map with untrusted data can also lead to header injection vulnerabilities on the client-side.

**4. Risk Severity Justification (High):**

The "High" severity rating is justified due to the significant potential impact of HTTP Header Injection:

* **Wide Range of Exploits:** It enables various attacks, including response splitting, cache poisoning, and potentially XSS and session hijacking.
* **Bypass of Security Controls:** Successful injection can bypass other security measures, as the attacker is manipulating the fundamental structure of HTTP communication.
* **Potential for Widespread Impact:** Cache poisoning can affect multiple users if the malicious response is cached by shared infrastructure.
* **Ease of Exploitation:**  Injecting `\r\n` is relatively simple, making this vulnerability easily exploitable if user input is not properly handled.

**5. Expanded Mitigation Strategies with `cpp-httplib` Specific Guidance:**

* **Prioritize Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Strictly Validate:**  Define expected formats for header values and reject any input that doesn't conform.
    * **Encode Control Characters:**  Replace or remove carriage return (`\r`) and line feed (`\n`) characters before using the data in headers. Consider using a library function for URL encoding or a custom function to replace these characters.
    * **Consider Allow-listing:** If possible, define a limited set of acceptable header values and only allow those.

* **Avoid Direct User Input in Headers:**  Whenever feasible, avoid directly incorporating user-provided data into HTTP headers. Instead, consider alternative approaches:
    * **Use Predefined Header Values:** If the header value can be chosen from a predefined set, select the appropriate value based on the user's input rather than directly using the input.
    * **Indirect Mapping:** If the header value needs to be dynamic based on user input, map the user input to a safe, predefined value.

* **Context-Aware Output Encoding (While less directly applicable to headers, it's good practice):**  While header injection focuses on control characters, be mindful of other encoding needs if user input is used in other parts of the response.

* **Code Review and Static Analysis:**
    * **Manual Code Review:**  Specifically look for instances where `response.set_header()`, `client.set_default_headers()`, or `request.headers` are used with variables derived from user input.
    * **Static Analysis Tools:** Utilize static analysis tools that can identify potential header injection vulnerabilities by tracking data flow and identifying instances where untrusted input reaches header manipulation functions.

* **Dynamic Testing and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Fuzzing:** Use fuzzing techniques to send requests with various combinations of injected control characters to identify vulnerable endpoints.
    * **Manual Penetration Testing:** Conduct manual penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify exploitable header injection points.

* **Security Audits of Third-Party Libraries:** While `cpp-httplib` is generally considered safe, regularly audit the library and its dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Stay updated with security advisories.

**6. Secure Coding Examples with `cpp-httplib`:**

**Vulnerable Code (Server-Side):**

```cpp
res.set_header("User-Preference", req.get_param("pref"));
```

**Secure Code (Server-Side - Sanitization):**

```cpp
std::string user_pref = req.get_param("pref");
// Sanitize by removing or encoding control characters
std::string sanitized_pref;
for (char c : user_pref) {
  if (c == '\r' || c == '\n') {
    // Option 1: Remove the character
    continue;
    // Option 2: Replace with a safe character (e.g., space or underscore)
    // sanitized_pref += '_';
    // Option 3: URL encode the character
    // ... (implementation for URL encoding)
  } else {
    sanitized_pref += c;
  }
}
res.set_header("User-Preference", sanitized_pref);
```

**Secure Code (Server-Side - Avoiding Direct Input):**

```cpp
std::string user_pref_input = req.get_param("pref");
std::string actual_pref_header;
if (user_pref_input == "dark") {
  actual_pref_header = "dark-theme";
} else if (user_pref_input == "light") {
  actual_pref_header = "light-theme";
} else {
  // Handle invalid input appropriately
  res.set_content("Invalid preference", "text/plain");
  return;
}
res.set_header("User-Theme", actual_pref_header);
```

**Vulnerable Code (Client-Side):**

```cpp
httplib::Client cli("example.com");
cli.set_default_headers({{"Custom-ID", get_user_provided_id()}});
```

**Secure Code (Client-Side - Sanitization):**

```cpp
httplib::Client cli("example.com");
std::string user_id = get_user_provided_id();
// Sanitize the user ID
std::string sanitized_id;
// ... (sanitization logic as shown in the server-side example)
cli.set_default_headers({{"Custom-ID", sanitized_id}});
```

**7. Detection and Prevention Strategies During Development:**

* **Security Training for Developers:** Educate developers about the risks of HTTP Header Injection and secure coding practices.
* **Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL):** Integrate security considerations into every stage of the development lifecycle.
* **Code Reviews:** Implement mandatory code reviews with a focus on identifying potential header injection vulnerabilities.
* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan code for vulnerabilities. Configure the tools to specifically look for header injection patterns.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Use DAST tools to test the running application for vulnerabilities by sending malicious requests.
* **Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular penetration testing by security experts to identify vulnerabilities that might have been missed by automated tools.
* **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** Deploy a WAF that can detect and block malicious requests attempting header injection. Configure the WAF with rules to identify common injection patterns.
