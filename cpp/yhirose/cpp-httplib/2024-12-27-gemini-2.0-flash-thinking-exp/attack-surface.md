*   **Attack Surface:** HTTP Request Header Overflow
    *   **Description:**  An attacker sends an HTTP request with excessively long headers, potentially overflowing internal buffers within `cpp-httplib` during parsing.
    *   **How cpp-httplib Contributes:**  If `cpp-httplib` doesn't have sufficient built-in limits or robust error handling for oversized headers, it can be vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** Sending a request with hundreds of `X-Custom-Header` lines, each being several kilobytes long.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for denial-of-service (crash), and in some cases, potentially exploitable for remote code execution if memory corruption occurs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure `cpp-httplib` with appropriate limits for maximum header size.

*   **Attack Surface:** TLS/SSL Configuration Weaknesses
    *   **Description:**  The application using `cpp-httplib` for HTTPS connections is configured with weak or outdated TLS/SSL protocols or cipher suites.
    *   **How cpp-httplib Contributes:** `cpp-httplib` provides options for configuring TLS/SSL. If these options are not set securely, the connection can be vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** Enabling support for SSLv3 or using known weak cipher suites like RC4 within `cpp-httplib`'s SSL context configuration.
    *   **Impact:**  Communication can be intercepted and decrypted by attackers (man-in-the-middle attacks).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure `cpp-httplib` to use only strong and up-to-date TLS protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher) and secure cipher suites. Disable support for older, vulnerable protocols and ciphers within the library's SSL context settings.
