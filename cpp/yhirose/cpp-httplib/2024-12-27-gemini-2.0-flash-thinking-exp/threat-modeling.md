Here is the updated threat list containing only high and critical threats that directly involve `cpp-httplib`:

| Threat | Description | Impact | Affected Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **TLS Certificate Issues (Server)** | An attacker could impersonate the server if it's configured with invalid, expired, or self-signed certificates without proper client-side validation. This allows the attacker to intercept communication and potentially steal sensitive information or manipulate data. | Loss of confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted between client and server. Potential for man-in-the-middle attacks. | `HTTPS Server`, `SSL/TLS Context Configuration` | **High** | Use valid, publicly trusted certificates obtained from a Certificate Authority (CA). Ensure proper configuration of the `SSLContext` to load and use the certificate and private key. |
| **Ignoring Server Certificate Validation Errors (Client)** | An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack if the client application is configured to ignore TLS certificate validation errors. The attacker can present their own certificate, and the client will trust it, allowing them to intercept and potentially modify communication. | Loss of confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted between client and server. Client may send sensitive data to a malicious server. | `HTTPS Client`, `SSL/TLS Context Configuration`, `Certificate Verification Callback` | **Critical** | **Never** disable or bypass server certificate validation in production environments. Ensure the client application is configured to properly verify the server's certificate against trusted CAs using the `set_verify_server_cert` method with `true`. |
| **Buffer Overflow/Underflow in Request Handling (Server)** | An attacker could send a specially crafted request with excessively long headers, URLs, or body data that exceeds the allocated buffer size in `cpp-httplib`'s request parsing logic. This could lead to memory corruption, potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. | Potential for remote code execution, leading to complete compromise of the server. Denial of service due to crashes. | `Request Parsing`, `Header Parsing`, `Body Handling` | **Critical** | Keep `cpp-httplib` updated to the latest version with bug fixes. While direct mitigation within the application might be limited due to it being a library vulnerability, ensure the underlying system has memory protection mechanisms in place. |
| **Buffer Overflow/Underflow in Response Parsing (Client)** | A malicious server could send a specially crafted response with excessively long headers or body data that exceeds the allocated buffer size in `cpp-httplib`'s response parsing logic on the client side. This could lead to memory corruption and potentially allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the client machine. | Potential for remote code execution on the client machine. Denial of service due to crashes. | `Response Parsing`, `Header Parsing`, `Body Handling` | **Critical** | Keep `cpp-httplib` updated to the latest version with bug fixes. Ensure the client operating system has memory protection mechanisms in place. |
| **Incorrect Handling of Chunked Transfer Encoding (Server)** | An attacker could send a malicious chunked request with incorrect chunk sizes or other malformed data, potentially leading to vulnerabilities like heap overflows or denial of service if `cpp-httplib` doesn't handle these cases robustly. | Denial of service due to server crashes or resource exhaustion. Potential for memory corruption and code execution. | `Request Parsing`, `Chunked Transfer Decoding` | **High** | Keep `cpp-httplib` updated to the latest version with bug fixes. |
| **Crash due to Malformed Requests/Responses (Server/Client)** | Vulnerabilities in `cpp-httplib`'s parsing logic could lead to crashes if it encounters specially crafted or malformed requests (server) or responses (client). An attacker can exploit this to cause denial of service. | Denial of service due to application crashes. | `Request Parsing`, `Response Parsing`, `Header Parsing`, `Body Handling` | **High** | Keep `cpp-httplib` updated to the latest version with bug fixes. |
| **Lack of Mutual TLS (mTLS) Enforcement (Server)** | If the application requires client authentication via mTLS, but the server is not configured to enforce it correctly using `cpp-httplib`, unauthorized clients might be able to connect. | Unauthorized access to resources, potentially leading to data breaches or other security violations. | `HTTPS Server`, `SSL/TLS Context Configuration`, `Client Certificate Verification` | **High** | Properly configure the `SSLContext` to require and verify client certificates. |

**Key takeaway:**  Focus on keeping `cpp-httplib` updated to mitigate these direct vulnerabilities. Ensure proper TLS configuration is in place for both client and server applications.
