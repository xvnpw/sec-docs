## Attack Tree Path: [1. Execute Arbitrary Code [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__execute_arbitrary_code__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This represents the attacker's ability to run arbitrary code of their choosing on the server hosting the application. This is the most severe outcome, granting the attacker full control.
*   **Why Critical:**  Complete system compromise.  The attacker can do anything the application's user account can do, including reading, modifying, or deleting data, installing malware, and potentially pivoting to other systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Buffer Overflow [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_buffer_overflow__high_risk___critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker sends a crafted request (e.g., with an overly long header or body) that exceeds the size of a buffer allocated by `cpp-httplib`. This overwrites adjacent memory, potentially including return addresses or function pointers, allowing the attacker to redirect execution to their own malicious code.
*   **Why High Risk:**  Classic, high-impact vulnerability.  While mitigated by modern C++ practices, it remains a significant threat if any manual memory management or unsafe functions are used.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (Modern C++ practices reduce this, but it's not impossible)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Complete system compromise)
*   **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires finding and exploiting the vulnerability)
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Can be detected by fuzzing, static analysis, or runtime errors, but might go unnoticed initially)

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Denial of Service (DoS) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3__denial_of_service__dos___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker prevents legitimate users from accessing the application by making it unavailable.
*   **Why Critical:** Directly impacts the application's core functionality and availability.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Resource Exhaustion [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_resource_exhaustion__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker consumes server resources (CPU, memory, network connections) to the point where the application can no longer function.
        *   **Why Critical:** Encompasses multiple common and effective DoS attack vectors.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.2 CPU Intensive Operations [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_2_cpu_intensive_operations__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker sends requests designed to trigger computationally expensive operations within `cpp-httplib` (e.g., complex regular expressions, inefficient parsing, or algorithmic complexity vulnerabilities). This consumes excessive CPU cycles, slowing down or completely halting the server's ability to process legitimate requests.
            *   **Why High Risk:** Relatively easy to exploit if such operations are exposed and can have a significant impact on availability.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the presence of computationally expensive operations)
            *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Slowdown or unresponsiveness)
            *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Crafting requests to trigger expensive operations)
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (High CPU usage is noticeable)

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2 Logic Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_logic_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting flaws in the application or library's logic to cause a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.2 Slow Loris (Header Manipulation) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_2_slow_loris__header_manipulation___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker establishes multiple connections to the server but sends HTTP request headers very slowly, one small piece at a time.  If `cpp-httplib` doesn't have appropriate timeouts or connection management, these slow connections can tie up server resources (e.g., connection slots in a thread pool), preventing legitimate clients from connecting.
            *   **Why High Risk:** Easy to execute with readily available tools, and highly effective against servers without proper mitigation.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on connection handling and timeouts)
            *   **Impact:** High (Can exhaust connection pool)
            *   **Effort:** Low (Tools readily available)
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires monitoring connection states; can be mitigated by reverse proxies)
