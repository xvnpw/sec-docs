# Attack Surface Analysis for yhirose/cpp-httplib

## Attack Surface: [Header Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/header_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of flaws in how `cpp-httplib` parses HTTP headers.
    *   **cpp-httplib Contribution:** The library is *directly responsible* for parsing all incoming HTTP headers.  Any bugs in this parsing logic create a vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a request with an extremely long header value, or a header containing specially crafted characters designed to trigger a buffer overflow in the parsing code.  Another example is sending many headers with the same name.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) in severe cases, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific parsing bug).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Developers *must* independently validate and sanitize *all* header values *after* `cpp-httplib` parses them.  Do not trust the parsed values directly.
        *   **Length Limits:** Enforce strict maximum lengths for header names and values.
        *   **Character Restrictions:** Define and enforce allowed character sets for header names and values.
        *   **Duplicate Header Handling:** Implement a clear policy for handling duplicate headers (e.g., reject the request, use the first/last occurrence).
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Use fuzzing tools to test the header parsing logic with a wide range of malformed inputs.
        *   **Library Updates:** Keep `cpp-httplib` updated to the latest version.

## Attack Surface: [URL Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/url_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of flaws in how `cpp-httplib` parses URLs.
    *   **cpp-httplib Contribution:** The library *directly* parses the request URL, extracting components like the path and query parameters. Bugs in this parsing are directly attributable to the library.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a URL with `../` sequences in the path, attempting a path traversal attack to access files outside the web root.  Or, a URL with excessive length or unusual encoding.
    *   **Impact:** Path Traversal, Information Disclosure, DoS, potential RCE (if combined with other vulnerabilities).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the application's use of the URL).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Developers *must* independently validate and sanitize all parts of the URL *after* parsing by `cpp-httplib`.
        *   **Path Sanitization:** Use a robust path sanitization routine to remove or encode potentially dangerous characters (e.g., `../`, `..\`).  *Never* directly use the raw path from the URL to access files.
        *   **Length Limits:** Enforce maximum lengths for the entire URL and its individual components.
        *   **Character Restrictions:** Define and enforce allowed character sets for each URL component.
        *   **URL Encoding:** Ensure proper handling of URL encoding and decoding.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Fuzz test the URL parsing logic.
        *   **Library Updates:** Keep `cpp-httplib` updated.

## Attack Surface: [Multipart/Form-Data Parsing Vulnerabilities (File Uploads)](./attack_surfaces/multipartform-data_parsing_vulnerabilities__file_uploads_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of flaws in how `cpp-httplib` handles multipart/form-data, typically used for file uploads.
    *   **cpp-httplib Contribution:** The library *directly* parses the multipart data, extracting individual parts (including uploaded files).  Vulnerabilities in this parsing are directly attributable to the library.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a very large file, or a request with many small parts, to cause a DoS.  Or, they upload a file with a malicious filename (e.g., containing path traversal characters) or a file disguised as an image but containing executable code.
    *   **Impact:** DoS, RCE (if the uploaded file is executed), file system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Size Limits:** Enforce strict limits on the size of uploaded files and the number of parts in a multipart request.
        *   **Content-Type Validation:** Validate the `Content-Type` header for each part and reject unexpected types.
        *   **Filename Sanitization:** *Never* use the filename provided by the client directly.  Generate a safe, unique filename on the server.
        *   **File Scanning:** Scan uploaded files for malware *before* storing them.
        *   **Storage Location:** Store uploaded files *outside* the web root, in a location that is not directly accessible via the web server.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Fuzz test the multipart parsing logic.
        *   **Library Updates:** Keep `cpp-httplib` updated.

## Attack Surface: [Weak SSL/TLS Configuration (HTTPS)](./attack_surfaces/weak_ssltls_configuration__https_.md)

*   **Description:** Using insecure SSL/TLS settings when `cpp-httplib` is used for HTTPS.
    *   **cpp-httplib Contribution:** The library relies on an underlying SSL/TLS library (e.g., OpenSSL) and *provides configuration options for it*. Incorrect configuration *through cpp-httplib* is a direct vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** Using weak ciphers (e.g., RC4), outdated protocols (e.g., TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1), or failing to properly validate server certificates.
    *   **Impact:** Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, data interception, loss of confidentiality and integrity.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Ciphers:** Use only strong, modern ciphers (e.g., AES-GCM, ChaCha20).
        *   **Modern Protocols:** Use TLS 1.3 (preferred) or TLS 1.2.  Disable older protocols.
        *   **Certificate Validation:** Ensure that server certificates are properly validated (check hostname, validity period, trust chain).
        *   **HSTS:** Configure HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to force clients to use HTTPS.
        *   **SSL/TLS Library Updates:** Keep the underlying SSL/TLS library (e.g., OpenSSL) updated.
        *   **Configuration Review:** Carefully review and configure all SSL/TLS settings provided by `cpp-httplib`.

## Attack Surface: [WebSocket Vulnerabilities (If Applicable)](./attack_surfaces/websocket_vulnerabilities__if_applicable_.md)

* **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in WebSocket handling.
    * **cpp-httplib Contribution:** If `cpp-httplib` supports WebSockets, it *directly* handles the WebSocket handshake and message framing. Vulnerabilities in this logic are directly attributable to the library.
    * **Example:** An attacker sends malicious WebSocket messages containing XSS payloads, or floods the server with WebSocket connections.
    * **Impact:** XSS, DoS, potentially other application-specific vulnerabilities.
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Validation:** Rigorously validate and sanitize *all* data received over WebSocket connections. Treat it as untrusted input.
        * **Output Encoding:** Properly encode all data sent over WebSocket connections to prevent XSS.
        * **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement proper authentication and authorization for WebSocket connections.
        * **Connection Limits:** Limit the number of concurrent WebSocket connections per user and globally.
        * **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting for WebSocket messages.
        * **Library Updates:** Keep `cpp-httplib` updated.
