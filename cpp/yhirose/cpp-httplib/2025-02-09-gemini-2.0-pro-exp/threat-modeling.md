# Threat Model Analysis for yhirose/cpp-httplib

## Threat: [Slowloris Attack](./threats/slowloris_attack.md)

*   **Threat:** Slowloris Attack
    *   **Description:** An attacker opens numerous connections to the server and sends HTTP requests very slowly, byte by byte, or sends incomplete requests. The attacker keeps these connections alive as long as possible, tying up server resources and preventing legitimate users from connecting. `cpp-httplib`'s connection handling, if not properly configured, is susceptible to this.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). Legitimate users are unable to access the application. Server resources (threads, memory, file descriptors) are exhausted.
    *   **Affected Component:** `httplib::Server` (overall connection handling), potentially `httplib::ThreadPool` if used. The core issue is how the server manages incoming connections and their associated resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use `svr.set_read_timeout(...)` and `svr.set_write_timeout(...)` to set short timeouts for reading and writing data on connections. This is *crucial* for mitigating Slowloris.
        *   Use `svr.set_max_connections(...)` to limit the maximum number of concurrent connections.
        *   Consider using an event-driven, non-blocking approach (if your application design allows) to minimize the overhead of idle connections.

## Threat: [Large Request Body DoS](./threats/large_request_body_dos.md)

*   **Threat:** Large Request Body DoS
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a request with an extremely large body (e.g., a multi-gigabyte upload). The server, if not configured to limit body size, attempts to read the entire body into memory, leading to resource exhaustion and a potential crash.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). The server may crash or become unresponsive due to excessive memory consumption.
    *   **Affected Component:** `httplib::Request::body`, and the handlers that process the request body (e.g., within your `svr.Post(...)` callback). The vulnerability lies in the lack of a default body size limit.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory:** Use `svr.set_payload_max_length(...)` to set a strict limit on the maximum allowed size of request bodies. This is the *primary* defense.
        *   If large uploads are expected, implement a streaming approach where the request body is processed in chunks *without* loading the entire body into memory at once. Use the `httplib::Request` object's callbacks to handle data incrementally.

## Threat: [Directory Traversal (when serving static files)](./threats/directory_traversal__when_serving_static_files_.md)

*   **Threat:** Directory Traversal (when serving static files)
    *   **Description:** If using `cpp-httplib`'s built-in file serving capabilities, an attacker uses `../` sequences in a URL to navigate outside the intended directory and access arbitrary files on the server. This is due to insufficient input validation within the file serving logic *if not properly implemented by the developer*.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to files on the server, potentially including sensitive configuration files or source code.
    *   **Affected Component:** `httplib::Server::set_mount_point(...)` and `httplib::Server::set_base_dir(...)`, and *crucially*, the developer's implementation of request handlers that interact with these functions. The vulnerability is in how the developer *uses* these functions, not inherently in the functions themselves, but the library provides the *mechanism* for the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Crucially:** Sanitize user-provided input used to construct file paths. Normalize paths and reject or carefully handle `../` sequences. This is the developer's responsibility.
        *   Use `svr.set_base_dir(...)` to define a restricted base directory for file serving.
        *   Avoid using user input directly in file paths. If necessary, validate it rigorously using a robust path sanitization library.

## Threat: [Vulnerability in `cpp-httplib` itself (Hypothetical)](./threats/vulnerability_in__cpp-httplib__itself__hypothetical_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Vulnerability in `cpp-httplib` itself (Hypothetical - but important to acknowledge)
    *   **Description:**  An unknown, *hypothetical* vulnerability exists within the `cpp-httplib` library code itself (e.g., a buffer overflow, integer overflow, use-after-free, etc.). This is a threat to *any* library, and is important to include.
    *   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the nature of the vulnerability, potentially ranging from DoS to remote code execution (RCE).  Could be Critical.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Any part of the `cpp-httplib` library.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  Unknown (but potentially Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `cpp-httplib` updated to the latest version. This is the *most important* mitigation for unknown vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reports related to `cpp-httplib`.
        *   Perform regular security audits and code reviews of your application, including its interaction with `cpp-httplib`.
        *   Consider fuzz testing `cpp-httplib` to proactively discover vulnerabilities.
