# Deep Analysis: Slow Loris Attack (Header Manipulation) on cpp-httplib

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the mechanics of a Slow Loris attack targeting a `cpp-httplib`-based application, identify specific vulnerabilities within the library's default configuration and common usage patterns, and propose concrete mitigation strategies.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for developers to harden their applications against this threat.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the **Slow Loris attack variant that manipulates HTTP headers** (as opposed to the request body).  We will consider:

*   **`cpp-httplib`'s default behavior:** How the library handles incoming connections and header parsing out-of-the-box.
*   **Common usage patterns:** How developers typically configure and use `cpp-httplib` in real-world applications.
*   **Resource exhaustion:**  How Slow Loris exploits connection limits and timeouts (or lack thereof).
*   **Mitigation techniques:**  Both within the application code (using `cpp-httplib` features) and through external infrastructure (e.g., reverse proxies, load balancers).
*   **Testing methodologies:** How to reliably simulate and detect Slow Loris attacks.

We will *not* cover:

*   Other Slow HTTP attack variants (e.g., Slow Body, Slow Read).
*   Denial-of-Service attacks unrelated to HTTP (e.g., SYN floods).
*   Vulnerabilities unrelated to Slow Loris (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

### 1.3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the `cpp-httplib` source code (specifically, connection handling, header parsing, and timeout mechanisms) to identify potential vulnerabilities.  This includes looking at relevant classes like `httplib::Server`, `httplib::Client`, and how they manage sockets and buffers.
2.  **Literature Review:**  Consult existing documentation, security advisories, and research papers on Slow Loris attacks and `cpp-httplib` security best practices.
3.  **Experimentation:**  Set up a test environment with a simple `cpp-httplib` server and use Slow Loris attack tools (e.g., `slowhttptest`, custom scripts) to simulate the attack under various configurations.  This will involve monitoring server resource usage (CPU, memory, open connections).
4.  **Mitigation Testing:**  Implement proposed mitigation strategies and re-test to verify their effectiveness.
5.  **Documentation:**  Clearly document findings, vulnerabilities, and recommended mitigations.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 3.2.2 Slow Loris (Header Manipulation)

### 2.1. Attack Mechanics

The Slow Loris attack exploits the way HTTP servers handle incomplete requests.  The attacker initiates multiple connections to the target server.  For each connection, the attacker sends a partial HTTP request header, like this:

```
GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n
Host: www.example.com\r\n
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0\r\n
```

Crucially, the attacker *does not* send the final `\r\n\r\n` sequence that signals the end of the headers.  Instead, the attacker sends a single header line, or even just a few characters, and then waits.  The attacker repeats this process, sending small pieces of the headers very slowly, potentially over a long period (minutes or even hours).

The server, expecting the complete headers, keeps the connection open, waiting for the rest of the data.  If the server has a limited number of connections it can handle concurrently (which is almost always the case), the attacker can exhaust these connection slots with relatively few connections.  This prevents legitimate clients from connecting, resulting in a denial-of-service.

### 2.2. `cpp-httplib` Vulnerability Analysis

The vulnerability of a `cpp-httplib` application to Slow Loris depends heavily on its configuration and how connections are managed.  Here's a breakdown of potential issues:

*   **Default Timeouts:**  `cpp-httplib` *does* have some built-in timeout mechanisms, but they might not be sufficiently aggressive to prevent Slow Loris by default.  The key parameters to investigate are:
    *   `read_timeout_sec` and `read_timeout_usec`: These control how long the server will wait for data to arrive on a socket.  If these are too high (or set to 0, meaning no timeout), the server will be vulnerable.  The default is likely to be a few seconds, which is *far* too long for a Slow Loris attack.
    *   `write_timeout_sec` and `write_timeout_usec`:  Less relevant to Slow Loris (which focuses on slow *sending*), but still important for overall connection management.
    *   `idle_interval_sec` and `idle_interval_usec`: These control how long the server will keep the connection alive if no data is being sent or received.
    *   `request_timeout_sec` and `request_timeout_usec`: These control how long the server will wait the whole request.
*   **Connection Limits:**  `cpp-httplib` uses a thread pool to handle connections.  The size of this thread pool determines the maximum number of concurrent connections.  If the pool is too small, it's easier for an attacker to exhaust it.  The default thread pool size might be relatively small.  The relevant parameter is:
    *   `worker_thread_num`: This parameter in `httplib::Server` constructor defines the number of worker threads.
*   **Header Parsing:**  `cpp-httplib` likely buffers incoming header data until it receives the complete `\r\n\r\n` sequence.  The size of this buffer and how it's managed could be a factor, although Slow Loris primarily targets connection exhaustion rather than buffer overflows.
*   **Lack of Connection Monitoring:**  A basic `cpp-httplib` application might not have any built-in monitoring of connection states.  This makes it difficult to detect Slow Loris attacks in progress.  Without monitoring, the server won't know how many connections are in a "waiting for headers" state.

### 2.3. Mitigation Strategies

Here are several mitigation strategies, categorized by where they are implemented:

#### 2.3.1. Application-Level Mitigations (within `cpp-httplib`)

These are the most important mitigations, as they directly address the vulnerability within the application.

1.  **Aggressive Timeouts:**  This is the **most crucial** mitigation.  Set `read_timeout_sec` and `read_timeout_usec` to very low values.  A value of **1 second or less** for `read_timeout_sec` is a good starting point.  Experiment to find the lowest value that doesn't impact legitimate clients.  Consider using even lower values for `idle_interval_sec` and `idle_interval_usec`. Set `request_timeout_sec` and `request_timeout_usec` to reasonable value, that will prevent slow request processing.
    ```c++
    httplib::Server svr;
    svr.set_read_timeout(1, 0); // 1 second read timeout
    svr.set_idle_interval(0, 500000); // 0.5 second idle timeout
    svr.set_request_timeout(5,0); // 5 second for whole request
    ```

2.  **Increase Worker Threads (with caution):**  Increasing `worker_thread_num` can provide more headroom, but it's *not* a primary defense.  A sufficiently determined attacker can still exhaust a larger thread pool.  This should be combined with aggressive timeouts.  Monitor resource usage carefully if increasing the thread pool size.
    ```c++
    httplib::Server svr(8); // Use 8 worker threads (example)
    ```

3.  **Connection Monitoring and Limiting:**  Implement custom logic to monitor the state of connections.  This could involve:
    *   Tracking the number of connections that are currently waiting for headers.
    *   Setting a limit on the number of connections from a single IP address.
    *   Closing connections that have been idle for an unusually long time, even if they haven't reached the `read_timeout`.
    *   This is more complex to implement but provides the most fine-grained control.

4.  **Asynchronous I/O (Advanced):**  `cpp-httplib` supports asynchronous I/O using `svr.set_io_multiplexing_type(httplib::IO_TYPE::POLL);` or `svr.set_io_multiplexing_type(httplib::IO_TYPE::EPOLL);`.  This *can* improve performance and potentially make the server more resilient to Slow Loris, but it requires careful handling of non-blocking sockets and event loops.  This is a more advanced technique and should only be considered if you have experience with asynchronous programming.

#### 2.3.2. Infrastructure-Level Mitigations

These mitigations are implemented outside the application code, typically in the network infrastructure.

1.  **Reverse Proxy (Highly Recommended):**  Deploy a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache, HAProxy) in front of the `cpp-httplib` application.  Reverse proxies are designed to handle a large number of concurrent connections and can be configured to:
    *   Enforce strict timeouts.
    *   Limit the number of connections per IP address.
    *   Buffer requests and responses.
    *   Terminate slow connections.
    *   This is generally the **easiest and most effective** mitigation.

2.  **Load Balancer:**  A load balancer can distribute traffic across multiple instances of the `cpp-httplib` application.  This can increase overall capacity and make it harder for an attacker to overwhelm a single server.  However, a load balancer alone is not sufficient; it should be combined with other mitigations (especially a reverse proxy).

3.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF can detect and block Slow Loris attacks based on traffic patterns and other heuristics.  This is a more sophisticated solution that can provide additional protection.

4.  **Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS):**  An IDS/IPS can monitor network traffic for Slow Loris attacks and take action to block or mitigate them.

### 2.4. Testing and Detection

*   **Slowhttptest:**  Use the `slowhttptest` tool to simulate Slow Loris attacks.  This tool allows you to configure the attack parameters (number of connections, delay, etc.) and monitor the server's response.
    ```bash
    slowhttptest -c 1000 -H -g -o my_header_stats -i 10 -r 200 -t GET -u http://your-server-ip:port -x 24 -p 3
    ```
    *   `-c`: Number of connections.
    *   `-H`:  Specifies Slow Loris (header) mode.
    *   `-i`:  Interval between follow-up data (seconds).
    *   `-r`:  Connection rate per second.
    *   `-u`:  Target URL.
    *   `-x`:  Length of follow-up data.
    *   `-p`:  Timeout for probe connection.

*   **Custom Scripts:**  Write custom scripts (e.g., in Python) to simulate Slow Loris attacks with more specific parameters.

*   **Monitoring:**  Monitor the following metrics on the server during testing:
    *   Number of open connections.
    *   CPU usage.
    *   Memory usage.
    *   Network traffic.
    *   Response times.
    *   Error rates.

*   **Logging:**  Enable detailed logging in `cpp-httplib` (if available) and in the reverse proxy (if used) to capture information about connection states and errors.

### 2.5. Conclusion and Recommendations

A `cpp-httplib` application is potentially vulnerable to Slow Loris attacks, especially if not configured with appropriate timeouts.  The **primary mitigation is to set aggressive read timeouts** (`read_timeout_sec` and `read_timeout_usec`) within the application code.  Deploying a **reverse proxy** (like Nginx) with proper configuration is highly recommended as an additional layer of defense and simplifies management.  Regular testing with tools like `slowhttptest` is crucial to verify the effectiveness of mitigations.  Connection monitoring and limiting within the application provide the most robust defense but require more development effort.  By implementing these recommendations, developers can significantly reduce the risk of Slow Loris attacks against their `cpp-httplib`-based applications.
