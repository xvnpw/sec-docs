# Threat Model Analysis for yhirose/cpp-httplib

## Threat: [Malformed HTTP Request Handling leading to Crash or Unexpected Behavior](./threats/malformed_http_request_handling_leading_to_crash_or_unexpected_behavior.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a crafted HTTP request with malformed headers, an invalid request line, or incorrect encoding. This exploits vulnerabilities in the library's parsing logic, causing the application to crash, enter an unexpected state, or exhibit undefined behavior.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to application crashes, potential for information disclosure if the unexpected state reveals sensitive data, or exploitation of further vulnerabilities due to the application's unstable state.

**Affected Component:** Request Parsing module, specifically the functions responsible for parsing headers and the request line.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep `cpp-httplib` updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches addressing parsing vulnerabilities.
* While application-level validation is helpful, the core issue lies within the library's ability to handle malformed input gracefully.

## Threat: [Header Injection Vulnerability](./threats/header_injection_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** If `cpp-httplib`'s response handling logic doesn't properly sanitize or encode header values provided to its API, an attacker could potentially inject malicious headers. This can lead to HTTP Response Splitting, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary content into the response stream, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or cache poisoning. This assumes the application is passing unsanitized data *to* `cpp-httplib`'s header setting functions.

**Impact:** XSS attacks, cache poisoning, bypassing security controls, and potentially redirecting users to malicious sites.

**Affected Component:** Response Handling module, specifically the functions for setting HTTP headers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use the library's provided methods for setting headers, assuming they perform necessary encoding. If the library has known vulnerabilities in this area, avoid directly using functions that might be susceptible.
* Keep `cpp-httplib` updated to address any reported header injection vulnerabilities within the library itself.

## Threat: [Memory Management Issues (Buffer Overflows, Use-After-Free)](./threats/memory_management_issues__buffer_overflows__use-after-free_.md)

**Description:** As a C++ library, `cpp-httplib` is potentially susceptible to memory management errors if not implemented carefully. An attacker could craft specific inputs that trigger buffer overflows during parsing or processing, or exploit use-after-free vulnerabilities if memory is accessed after being deallocated *within the library's code*. This could lead to crashes, arbitrary code execution, or information leaks.

**Impact:** Application crashes, potential for remote code execution, information disclosure.

**Affected Component:** Various internal modules, particularly those involved in string manipulation, memory allocation, and data processing *within the library*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Rely on the library developers to address such issues through regular updates and security patches.
* Monitor the library's issue tracker and security advisories for reported memory safety vulnerabilities.
* Consider using static analysis tools on the application code that uses `cpp-httplib` to identify potential misuse that could exacerbate memory safety issues within the library.

## Threat: [Insecure Default TLS Configuration (if using HTTPS)](./threats/insecure_default_tls_configuration__if_using_https_.md)

**Description:** If the application uses `cpp-httplib` for HTTPS, the *default* TLS configuration provided by the library might not be secure (e.g., using weak ciphers, not verifying certificates). An attacker could then perform man-in-the-middle attacks to eavesdrop on communication or tamper with data. This is a direct issue with the library's default settings.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data integrity compromise.

**Affected Component:** TLS/SSL implementation within the library (if it handles TLS directly), specifically the default configuration settings.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Explicitly configure `cpp-httplib` to use strong TLS ciphers and protocols, overriding any insecure defaults.
* Ensure proper certificate verification is enabled and configured correctly within the application's usage of the library.
* Consult the library's documentation for how to configure TLS settings securely.

## Threat: [Request Smuggling](./threats/request_smuggling.md)

**Description:** Discrepancies in how `cpp-httplib` parses HTTP requests, particularly regarding `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers, compared to intermediary proxies or servers, could allow an attacker to "smuggle" requests. This is a vulnerability within the library's parsing logic itself. This can lead to bypassing security controls, accessing unintended resources, or even poisoning the connection for other users.

**Impact:** Security bypass, unauthorized access, potential for further exploitation.

**Affected Component:** Request Parsing module, specifically the handling of `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep `cpp-httplib` updated to benefit from any fixes related to request smuggling vulnerabilities.
* If possible, configure intermediary proxies to have strict and consistent HTTP parsing behavior to minimize discrepancies.
