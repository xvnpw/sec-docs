*   **Compromise Application via cpp-httplib (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access, control, or causing significant disruption to the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    *   Attackers target the way the application and `cpp-httplib` process incoming data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit HTTP Request Parsing Flaws (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_http_request_parsing_flaws__high-risk_path_.md)

        *   **Exploit HTTP Request Parsing Flaws (HIGH-RISK PATH):**

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Buffer Overflow in Header Parsing (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_buffer_overflow_in_header_parsing__critical_node_.md)

## Attack Tree Path: [Send overly long HTTP headers (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/send_overly_long_http_headers__high-risk_path_.md)

                *   **Send overly long HTTP headers (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attacker sends requests with extremely long header lines exceeding expected buffer sizes, potentially overwriting adjacent memory.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send headers with excessively long values (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/send_headers_with_excessively_long_values__high-risk_path_.md)

                *   **Send headers with excessively long values (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Similar to long headers, but focuses on the length of individual header values.

                *   **Send crafted headers containing format string specifiers (HIGH-RISK PATH):**  Attacker injects format string sequences (e.g., `%s`, `%x`) into headers that are later used in logging or error messages without proper sanitization, potentially leading to information disclosure or code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Smuggling Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_smuggling_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

            *   **Exploit Request Smuggling Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH):**

## Attack Tree Path: [Send ambiguous Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/send_ambiguous_content-length_and_transfer-encoding_headers__high-risk_path_.md)

                *   **Send ambiguous Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attacker crafts requests with conflicting information about the message body length, causing the server and intermediary proxies to interpret the request differently, potentially leading to request hijacking or other malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit HTTP Body Processing Flaws (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_http_body_processing_flaws__high-risk_path_.md)

        *   **Exploit HTTP Body Processing Flaws (HIGH-RISK PATH):**

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Buffer Overflow in Body Reading/Processing (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_buffer_overflow_in_body_readingprocessing__critical_node_.md)

            *   **Trigger Buffer Overflow in Body Reading/Processing (CRITICAL NODE):**

## Attack Tree Path: [Send excessively large request bodies (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/send_excessively_large_request_bodies__high-risk_path_.md)

                *   **Send excessively large request bodies (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attacker sends requests with bodies larger than the allocated buffer size, potentially leading to memory corruption and code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Internal Logic Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_internal_logic_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Exploit Internal Logic Vulnerabilities:**

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Denial of Service (DoS) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_denial_of_service__dos___high-risk_path_.md)

    *   **Trigger Denial of Service (DoS) (HIGH-RISK PATH):**

## Attack Tree Path: [Exhaust Server Resources (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exhaust_server_resources__high-risk_path_.md)

        *   **Exhaust Server Resources (HIGH-RISK PATH):**

## Attack Tree Path: [Send a large number of concurrent requests (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/send_a_large_number_of_concurrent_requests__high-risk_path_.md)

            *   **Send a large number of concurrent requests (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attacker floods the server with a high volume of requests, overwhelming its resources and making it unavailable to legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send requests with excessively large headers or bodies (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/send_requests_with_excessively_large_headers_or_bodies__high-risk_path_.md)

            *   **Send requests with excessively large headers or bodies (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attacker sends requests with unusually large headers or bodies, consuming excessive server memory and bandwidth, leading to resource exhaustion.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS Implementation (if used)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_ssltls_implementation__if_used_.md)

*   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS Implementation (if used):**

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Underlying SSL/TLS Library (if any) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_ssltls_library__if_any___critical_node_.md)

    *   **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Underlying SSL/TLS Library (if any) (CRITICAL NODE):** If `cpp-httplib` relies on an external SSL/TLS library (like OpenSSL), attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in that library (e.g., Heartbleed, POODLE) to compromise the security of the connection, potentially leading to eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Developer Misuse of cpp-httplib (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_developer_misuse_of_cpp-httplib__high-risk_path_.md)

    *   **Exploit Lack of Input Sanitization Before Passing to httplib (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**

## Attack Tree Path: [Pass unsanitized user input directly into httplib functions (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/pass_unsanitized_user_input_directly_into_httplib_functions__high-risk_path_.md)

        *   **Pass unsanitized user input directly into httplib functions (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Developers fail to properly sanitize user-provided data before using it in `cpp-httplib` functions. This can lead to various vulnerabilities, such as:
            *   **Path Traversal:** Using unsanitized input in file paths can allow attackers to access arbitrary files on the server.
            *   **Command Injection:** Using unsanitized input in system commands can allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
            *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Using unsanitized input in responses can allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into the user's browser.
