# Attack Surface Analysis for yhirose/cpp-httplib

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Header Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/http_header_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Improper handling of malformed, oversized, or specially crafted HTTP headers can lead to crashes, unexpected behavior, or memory corruption within `cpp-httplib`.
*   **How cpp-httplib contributes:** `cpp-httplib`'s core responsibility is parsing incoming HTTP headers. Vulnerabilities in its parsing logic are directly exploitable.
*   **Example:** Sending a request with an extremely long header line that exceeds internal buffer limits in `cpp-httplib`, causing a crash.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) if memory corruption is exploitable within `cpp-httplib`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep `cpp-httplib` updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that address parsing vulnerabilities.
    *   While direct configuration might be limited, understand any configurable limits related to header processing within `cpp-httplib` and ensure they are appropriately set if available.

## Attack Surface: [TLS/SSL Configuration and Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/tlsssl_configuration_and_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfiguration of TLS/SSL settings within `cpp-httplib` or vulnerabilities in the underlying TLS library it uses can compromise the confidentiality and integrity of communication.
*   **How cpp-httplib contributes:** `cpp-httplib`'s configuration dictates how the underlying TLS library (like OpenSSL or mbedTLS) is used. Vulnerabilities in these libraries directly impact `cpp-httplib`'s security.
*   **Example:** Compiling `cpp-httplib` against an outdated version of OpenSSL with known vulnerabilities, or configuring `cpp-httplib` to allow weak cipher suites.
*   **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping, data manipulation due to weak or compromised encryption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure `cpp-httplib` is compiled against the latest stable and security-patched version of its underlying TLS library.
    *   Configure `cpp-httplib` to enforce the use of strong TLS protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher) and secure cipher suites. Avoid outdated or weak options.
    *   If `cpp-httplib` is used as an HTTP client, ensure proper certificate verification is enabled and configured correctly.

## Attack Surface: [Potential Bugs in cpp-httplib Itself](./attack_surfaces/potential_bugs_in_cpp-httplib_itself.md)

*   **Description:** Undiscovered bugs within `cpp-httplib`'s code, including security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, or other memory corruption issues.
*   **How cpp-httplib contributes:** The vulnerability exists directly within the library's implementation.
*   **Example:** A carefully crafted HTTP request triggering a memory corruption bug within `cpp-httplib`'s request handling or response generation logic.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to exploitable vulnerabilities within `cpp-httplib`'s process.
*   **Risk Severity:** Can be Critical depending on the nature and exploitability of the bug.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Stay updated with the latest stable version of `cpp-httplib` to benefit from bug fixes and security patches released by the developers.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported vulnerabilities specific to `cpp-httplib`.
    *   Consider contributing to or reviewing the `cpp-httplib` codebase for potential security issues.
    *   Incorporate security testing practices, including fuzzing, to identify potential bugs within the library's usage in your application.
