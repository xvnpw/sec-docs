# Attack Surface Analysis for yhirose/cpp-httplib

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Header Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/http_header_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Flaws in `cpp-httplib`'s parsing of HTTP headers can lead to buffer overflows, integer overflows, or format string bugs due to malformed or excessively large headers.
*   **cpp-httplib Contribution:** `cpp-httplib` is responsible for parsing incoming HTTP request headers to extract crucial information. Vulnerabilities here are within the library's header parsing implementation.
*   **Example:** A malicious client sends a request with an extremely long header line exceeding buffer limits in `cpp-httplib`'s header parsing code. This could cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep `cpp-httplib` updated:** Regularly update to the latest version of `cpp-httplib` to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in header parsing logic.
    *   **Compiler Security Features:** Ensure the application and `cpp-httplib` are compiled with modern compiler security features enabled (like ASLR, Stack Canaries, DEP) to make exploitation more difficult.

## Attack Surface: [URI Parsing Vulnerabilities (Path Traversal)](./attack_surfaces/uri_parsing_vulnerabilities__path_traversal_.md)

**Description:**  Improper URI parsing within `cpp-httplib` can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities when handling file requests. If the library doesn't correctly sanitize or validate requested paths, attackers might access files outside the intended web root.
*   **cpp-httplib Contribution:** `cpp-httplib`'s file serving functionalities rely on parsing the URI to determine the requested file path. Vulnerabilities in this parsing within `cpp-httplib` directly contribute to path traversal risks.
*   **Example:** When serving files using `cpp-httplib`, a request with a URI like `/../../sensitive.conf` is sent. If `cpp-httplib`'s path handling is flawed, it might incorrectly resolve this path and serve `sensitive.conf` from outside the intended directory.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Files.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict `cpp-httplib` Base Directory:** When using file serving, strictly define and limit the base directory that `cpp-httplib` is allowed to access.
    *   **Path Normalization within Application:** While `cpp-httplib` handles path parsing, ensure your application logic that interacts with file paths also performs path normalization and validation to prevent traversal attempts before passing paths to `cpp-httplib` file serving functions.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Body Parsing Vulnerabilities (Buffer Overflows, DoS)](./attack_surfaces/http_body_parsing_vulnerabilities__buffer_overflows__dos_.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities in `cpp-httplib`'s handling of HTTP request bodies, especially when parsing specific content types or handling large bodies, can lead to buffer overflows or denial of service.
*   **cpp-httplib Contribution:** `cpp-httplib` is responsible for receiving and potentially parsing request bodies. Flaws in its body parsing implementation can be exploited.
*   **Example:** A malicious client sends a POST request with an extremely large body, potentially exceeding buffer limits in `cpp-httplib`'s body handling code. This could lead to a buffer overflow or excessive memory consumption causing a denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, Remote Code Execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on exploitability for code execution).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Limit Request Body Size in Application:** Configure your application to enforce limits on the maximum allowed request body size *before* it's fully processed by `cpp-httplib`. This can prevent resource exhaustion and mitigate buffer overflow risks.
    *   **Keep `cpp-httplib` Updated:** Ensure you are using the latest version of `cpp-httplib` which includes fixes for potential body parsing vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [SSL/TLS Vulnerabilities (Underlying Library Dependency)](./attack_surfaces/ssltls_vulnerabilities__underlying_library_dependency_.md)

**Description:** `cpp-httplib` relies on an external SSL/TLS library (like OpenSSL or mbedTLS) for HTTPS functionality. Vulnerabilities within these underlying libraries directly impact the security of applications using `cpp-httplib` over HTTPS.
*   **cpp-httplib Contribution:** `cpp-httplib`'s HTTPS support is built upon and depends on the security of the linked SSL/TLS library. It directly exposes the attack surface of the underlying library.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in the version of OpenSSL that `cpp-httplib` is linked against. This vulnerability could be exploited to perform man-in-the-middle attacks or gain access to encrypted communication even when using `cpp-httplib` for HTTPS.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, Man-in-the-Middle Attacks, Complete Loss of Confidentiality and Integrity for HTTPS traffic.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly Update SSL/TLS Library:**  The most critical mitigation is to diligently update the underlying SSL/TLS library (e.g., OpenSSL, mbedTLS) to the latest patched versions. This is essential to address known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Secure Build and Linking:** Ensure your build process correctly links against the updated SSL/TLS library. Verify the linked version after updates.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories for the SSL/TLS library you are using to stay informed about new vulnerabilities and required updates.

## Attack Surface: [WebSocket Handshake Vulnerabilities (Authentication Bypass)](./attack_surfaces/websocket_handshake_vulnerabilities__authentication_bypass_.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities in `cpp-httplib`'s WebSocket handshake handling could potentially allow attackers to bypass authentication or establish unauthorized WebSocket connections.
*   **cpp-httplib Contribution:** `cpp-httplib` implements the WebSocket handshake process. Flaws in this implementation within the library can lead to security issues.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in `cpp-httplib`'s WebSocket handshake logic might allow an attacker to craft a malicious handshake request that bypasses intended authentication checks, granting them access to WebSocket functionalities without proper authorization.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized Access, Data Manipulation via WebSocket, Potential for further exploitation depending on WebSocket application logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Review and Test WebSocket Implementation:** Carefully review and thoroughly test the WebSocket handshake handling in your application and how you utilize `cpp-httplib`'s WebSocket features.
    *   **Implement Application-Level Authentication:**  Do not rely solely on the basic WebSocket handshake for security. Implement robust application-level authentication and authorization mechanisms *on top* of the WebSocket connection to verify and control access.
    *   **Keep `cpp-httplib` Updated:** Update `cpp-httplib` to the latest version to benefit from potential fixes in WebSocket handshake handling.
