# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Priority: Rapid Application Development
  - Priority: Performance and Efficiency
  - Priority: Cost-Effectiveness (using a header-only library simplifies deployment and reduces dependencies)
  - Goal: To quickly build and deploy applications that require HTTP/HTTPS server or client functionalities.
  - Goal: To leverage a lightweight and efficient HTTP library to minimize resource consumption and maximize application performance.
- Business Risks:
  - Risk: Security vulnerabilities in the cpp-httplib library could be exploited in applications using it, leading to data breaches or service disruption.
  - Risk: Lack of comprehensive security testing and formal security audits for a community-driven header-only library might introduce undetected vulnerabilities.
  - Risk: Potential for misconfiguration or misuse of the library by developers, leading to security weaknesses in the applications built upon it.
  - Risk: Dependency on an open-source project with community-based support might lead to delays in security patch availability or lack of guaranteed long-term maintenance.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code Review - The library is open-source and benefits from community code review, increasing the likelihood of identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities. (Implemented by: Community, GitHub repository history)
  - security control: Unit Testing - The repository includes unit tests, which help ensure the library functions as expected and can catch some types of bugs, including security-relevant ones. (Implemented by: Repository's 'test' directory and CI workflows)
  - security control: Usage of Standard C++ Libraries - The library relies on standard C++ libraries, which are generally well-vetted and less prone to common vulnerabilities compared to custom implementations. (Implemented by: Library's code base)
  - accepted risk: Limited Formal Security Audits - As a community-driven open-source project, cpp-httplib likely lacks formal, in-depth security audits conducted by dedicated security firms.
  - accepted risk: Dependency on Community for Security Patches - Security vulnerabilities are addressed by community contributions, which might lead to variable patch release timelines compared to commercially supported libraries.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Dependency Scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning on the project using cpp-httplib to identify known vulnerabilities in the library or its transitive dependencies (if any, although header-only libraries minimize this).
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the development pipeline to automatically analyze the application code that uses cpp-httplib for potential security flaws and misconfigurations.
  - security control: Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) - Perform DAST on applications built with cpp-httplib to identify runtime vulnerabilities and assess the overall security posture of deployed applications.
  - security control: Security Training for Developers - Provide security training to developers using cpp-httplib, focusing on secure coding practices for web applications and common pitfalls when using HTTP libraries.
  - security control: Penetration Testing - Conduct regular penetration testing of applications utilizing cpp-httplib to simulate real-world attacks and identify exploitable vulnerabilities.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Applications using cpp-httplib must implement their own authentication mechanisms as the library itself does not provide built-in authentication features.
    - Requirement: Authentication mechanisms should be robust and appropriate for the sensitivity of the application and data being protected (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT, API keys).
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Applications must implement authorization controls to ensure that authenticated users only have access to the resources and functionalities they are permitted to access.
    - Requirement: Authorization should be enforced at the application level, considering the specific business logic and data access requirements.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Applications must perform thorough input validation on all data received via HTTP requests handled by cpp-httplib to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting).
    - Requirement: Input validation should be applied on both the client and server sides, and should include checks for data type, format, length, and allowed values.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: When using HTTPS, applications must ensure proper TLS configuration, including strong cipher suites, up-to-date TLS versions, and valid SSL/TLS certificates.
    - Requirement: For sensitive data transmitted over HTTP/HTTPS, consider implementing application-level encryption in addition to TLS to provide end-to-end protection.
    - Requirement: Securely manage cryptographic keys and certificates used for HTTPS and application-level encryption, following best practices for key generation, storage, and rotation.
