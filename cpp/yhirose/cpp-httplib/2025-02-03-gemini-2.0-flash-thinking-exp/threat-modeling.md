# Threat Model Analysis for yhirose/cpp-httplib

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in HTTP Header Parsing](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_http_header_parsing.md)

* **Description:** An attacker sends an HTTP request with excessively long headers. `cpp-httplib`'s header parsing logic fails to properly handle the oversized headers, leading to a buffer overflow. The attacker could potentially overwrite adjacent memory regions, causing a crash or potentially injecting malicious code for remote code execution.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (crash), Potential Remote Code Execution.
    * **Affected cpp-httplib Component:** `httplib::detail::parse_header_fields` function (internal parsing logic), potentially affecting all HTTP request handling components.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use the latest version of `cpp-httplib` with known parsing vulnerabilities patched.
        * Review `cpp-httplib`'s issue tracker for reported buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
        * Consider implementing header size limits at the application level before requests reach `cpp-httplib` handlers (though ideally, `cpp-httplib` should handle this).
        * Use memory safety tools (Valgrind, AddressSanitizer) during development and testing to detect buffer overflows.

## Threat: [HTTP Request Smuggling/Splitting](./threats/http_request_smugglingsplitting.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious HTTP requests manipulating `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers in a way that `cpp-httplib` and intermediary proxies/servers interpret differently. This allows the attacker to "smuggle" a second request within the first one, leading to request routing manipulation, bypassing security controls, or cache poisoning.
    * **Impact:** Bypass of security controls, unauthorized access, cache poisoning, potential data leakage.
    * **Affected cpp-httplib Component:** HTTP request parsing logic, specifically handling of `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers within `httplib::detail::parse_request_line` and `httplib::detail::parse_header_fields` functions.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly test application with HTTP smuggling vulnerability scanners.
        * Stay updated with `cpp-httplib` releases and security patches related to HTTP parsing.
        * Avoid complex or unusual header manipulations in the application that might interact unexpectedly with `cpp-httplib`'s parsing.
        * Configure upstream proxies/load balancers to normalize or strictly validate HTTP requests to reduce smuggling risks.

## Threat: [Weak TLS/SSL Configuration (HTTPS)](./threats/weak_tlsssl_configuration__https_.md)

* **Description:** When using HTTPS, if the application or `cpp-httplib`'s default settings allow weak TLS/SSL configurations (e.g., outdated protocols like TLS 1.0, weak cipher suites), an attacker performing a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack could downgrade the connection to a weaker, vulnerable protocol or cipher, enabling eavesdropping or data manipulation.
    * **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data interception, man-in-the-middle attacks.
    * **Affected cpp-httplib Component:** HTTPS server setup, TLS/SSL configuration within `httplib::SSLServer` class and related functions for setting up SSL context.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Explicitly configure `cpp-httplib` to use strong TLS/SSL settings.
            * Enforce TLS 1.2 or higher.
            * Use strong cipher suites (e.g., those recommended by security best practices, avoiding weak or export-grade ciphers).
            * Disable insecure protocols like SSLv3 and TLS 1.0.
        * Regularly update the underlying TLS library (e.g., OpenSSL, mbedTLS) on the server system.
        * Use tools like SSL Labs SSL Server Test to verify HTTPS configuration.

## Threat: [Improper HTTPS Client Certificate Validation](./threats/improper_https_client_certificate_validation.md)

* **Description:** If the application uses `cpp-httplib` as an HTTPS client and doesn't properly validate server certificates, an attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle attack by presenting a fraudulent certificate. If certificate validation is weak or disabled, the client will connect to the attacker's server, believing it's the legitimate server, potentially leading to data interception or manipulation.
    * **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, data interception, potential data manipulation.
    * **Affected cpp-httplib Component:** HTTPS client functionality, specifically certificate verification logic within `httplib::SSLClient` and related functions for establishing SSL connections and verifying certificates.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure the application implements robust certificate validation when using `cpp-httplib` as an HTTPS client.
            * Verify the server certificate's chain of trust against a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) store.
            * Check for certificate revocation (CRL or OCSP).
            * Properly handle certificate errors and warnings, failing securely if validation fails.
            * Avoid allowing self-signed certificates in production unless explicitly required and with strong justification and understanding of the risks.

## Threat: [Use-After-Free or Double-Free Vulnerabilities](./threats/use-after-free_or_double-free_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Due to memory management errors in `cpp-httplib`'s code, specifically related to object lifetimes or resource cleanup, a use-after-free or double-free vulnerability might exist. An attacker could potentially trigger these vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted requests, leading to crashes, denial of service, or potentially remote code execution if the memory corruption is exploitable.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service, Potential Remote Code Execution.
    * **Affected cpp-httplib Component:** Memory management logic throughout `cpp-httplib`, potentially affecting various components depending on the specific vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use memory safety tools (AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer) during development and testing to detect use-after-free and double-free vulnerabilities.
        * Conduct thorough code reviews of `cpp-httplib`'s source code (if feasible and necessary) and report any potential memory safety issues to the maintainers.
        * Keep `cpp-httplib` updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that address memory management issues.
