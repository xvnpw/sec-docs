## 6. Data Flow

The following diagram illustrates a more detailed flow of a transaction through the `rippled` server:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Client"
        A["'Client Application'"]
    end

    subgraph "rippled Server"
        B["'API Interface'"]
        C["'Transaction Submission'"]
        D["'Transaction Validation'"]
        E["'Transaction Queue'"]

        I["'Application Logic'"]
    end

    subgraph "Peer Network"
        J["'Other rippled Servers'"]
    end

    A -- "Submit Transaction (API)" --> B
    B -- "Receive Raw Transaction" --> C
    C -- "Initial Checks" --> D
    D -- "Validate Transaction" --> E
    E -- "Add to Queue" --> G

    I -- "Execute Transaction" --> H
    H -- "Update Ledger" --> I
    B -- "Return Result (API)" --> A
    I -- "Notify Peers (Ledger Update)" --> F
```

**Detailed Transaction Data Flow:**

1. **Transaction Submission (API):** A client application submits a transaction to the `rippled` server via the API Interface.
2. **Receive Raw Transaction:** The API Interface receives the raw transaction data.
3. **Initial Checks:** The Transaction Submission component performs basic checks on the transaction format.
4. **Validate Transaction:** The Transaction Validation component performs comprehensive validation, including signature verification, account existence, and sufficient balance checks.
5. **Add to Queue:** If the transaction is valid, it's added to the Transaction Queue.
6. **Propose Transaction:** The Consensus Engine selects transactions from the queue to propose for inclusion in the next ledger.
7. **Broadcast Proposal:** The Network Communication (P2P) component broadcasts the proposed transaction to other `rippled` servers in the network.
8. **Participate in Consensus:** The Consensus Engine engages in the consensus process with other validators, exchanging messages and voting on the proposed ledger.
9. **Vote/Validate:** Other `rippled` servers in the peer network validate the proposed transactions and participate in the voting process.
10. **Agreement Reached:** Once a consensus is reached on the set of transactions for the next ledger, the Consensus Engine signals the Application Logic.
11. **Execute Transaction:** The Application Logic executes the agreed-upon transactions, updating the in-memory ledger state.
12. **Update Ledger:** The updated ledger state is persisted to the Ledger Store.
13. **Return Result (API):** The API Interface sends a confirmation or error message back to the client application.
14. **Notify Peers (Ledger Update):** The Application Logic, via Network Communication, informs other peers about the newly validated ledger.

## 7. Security Considerations
