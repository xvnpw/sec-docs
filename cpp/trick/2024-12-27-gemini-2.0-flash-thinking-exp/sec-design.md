## 5. Data Flow

The following diagram illustrates the general flow of data within the Trick simulation environment:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Trick Simulation Environment"
        A("Input Configuration Data")
        B("Simulation Core")
        C("User-Defined Models")
        D("Simulation State Data")
        E("Telemetry / Output Data")
        F("User Interface Commands")

        A -- "Configuration & Initial Conditions" --> B
        B -- "Model Execution & Data Exchange" --> C
        C -- "State Updates & Data" --> B
        B -- "State Data" --> D
        D -- "Data for Output" --> E
        F -- "Control Commands" --> B
    end
```

**Detailed Data Flow Description:**

1. **Input Configuration Data:** Simulation parameters, model configurations, and initial conditions are read by the "Input Processing" component and passed to the "Simulation Core." This data defines how the simulation will run.
2. **User Interface Commands:** External user interfaces can send commands to the "Simulation Core" to control the simulation lifecycle and parameters (e.g., start, stop, pause, modify parameters, request specific data).
3. **Model Execution & Data Exchange:** The "Simulation Core" schedules and executes the "User-Defined Models." Models exchange data with the core (e.g., reading state variables, scheduling events) and potentially with each other (e.g., through shared memory or message passing).
4. **State Updates & Data:** Models update the "Simulation State Data" based on their calculations and interactions, reflecting the evolving state of the simulated system.
5. **State Data:** The "Simulation Core" manages and provides access to the "Simulation State Data," acting as a central repository for the current state of the simulation.
6. **Data for Output:** The "Output Generation" component retrieves data from the "Simulation State Data" to generate telemetry, reports, and other outputs for analysis and monitoring.
7. **Telemetry / Output Data:** Simulation results are generated and can be stored in files, displayed to the user interface, or streamed to external systems for further processing or visualization.

## 6. Deployment Architecture

The deployment architecture of Trick can vary depending on the specific use case and the complexity of the simulation.

| Scenario             | Description                                                                                                | Key Considerations                                                                                             |

| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Input Validation** | Robustly validate all input data (configuration files, user inputs, real-time data) against expected formats, types, and ranges.          | Buffer overflows, format string bugs, injection attacks (e.g., command injection if processing external commands), denial-of-service through malformed input.              |
| **Model Security**   | User-defined models execute within the simulation environment. Ensure proper sandboxing or isolation to prevent malicious models from harming the system. | Arbitrary code execution, access to sensitive system resources, data exfiltration, denial-of-service by resource exhaustion.                                          |
| **Data Integrity**   | Protect the integrity of simulation state data and output data. Implement mechanisms to detect and prevent unauthorized modification.      | Tampering with simulation results, injecting false data, compromising the accuracy and reliability of the simulation.                                                        |
| **Communication Security** | Secure inter-process communication channels (if distributed) using encryption and authentication.                                         | Eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, data tampering during transmission.                                                                                             |
| **Access Control**   | Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for any user interfaces or external access points to the simulation.                 | Unauthorized access to the simulation, modification of simulation parameters, exfiltration of sensitive data.                                                              |
| **Dependency Management** | Regularly audit and update third-party libraries and dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.                                       | Exploitation of vulnerabilities in outdated libraries, supply chain attacks.                                                                                                |
| **Output Security**  | Protect sensitive simulation data in the output from unauthorized access. Implement access controls or encryption for output files.        | Disclosure of confidential information, misuse of sensitive simulation results.                                                                                             |
| **Code Injection**   | If the system allows dynamic loading or execution of code, implement strict controls and validation to prevent code injection vulnerabilities. | Execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the simulation process, potentially leading to full system compromise.                                                |
