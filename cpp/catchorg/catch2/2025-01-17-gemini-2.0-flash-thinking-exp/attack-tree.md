## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Leverage Catch2 Features for Malicious Purposes](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_leverage_catch2_features_for_malicious_purposes.md)

This node represents the attacker's ability to misuse the intended functionalities of Catch2 to achieve malicious goals. This doesn't involve exploiting bugs in Catch2 itself, but rather using its features in unintended and harmful ways.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Inject Malicious Code via Test Cases](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_inject_malicious_code_via_test_cases.md)

This path focuses on compromising the test code itself to execute malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Gain Ability to Modify Test Code (e.g., compromised developer machine, insecure CI/CD pipeline)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_gain_ability_to_modify_test_code__e_g___compromised_developer_machine__insecure_cicd_p_0bb34426.md)

* Attack Vector: Compromising a developer's workstation through phishing, malware, or software vulnerabilities.
* Attack Vector: Exploiting vulnerabilities in the CI/CD pipeline to inject malicious code into the test repository.
* Attack Vector: Insider threat where a malicious developer intentionally introduces harmful test code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Test Cases that Execute Malicious Code During Test Execution](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_test_cases_that_execute_malicious_code_during_test_execution.md)

* Attack Vector: Writing test cases that interact with production databases to exfiltrate or modify data.
* Attack Vector: Creating tests that use stored credentials to access external APIs for malicious purposes.
* Attack Vector: Implementing tests that execute operating system commands to gain shell access or perform other harmful actions on the test environment (which might have access to production).

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Exploit Test Environment Weaknesses Exposed by Catch2](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_exploit_test_environment_weaknesses_exposed_by_catch2.md)

This path highlights the risks when Catch2 tests require access to sensitive resources in an inadequately secured test environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Catch2 Tests Require Access to Sensitive Resources (e.g., databases, API keys)](./attack_tree_paths/catch2_tests_require_access_to_sensitive_resources__e_g___databases__api_keys_.md)

* Attack Vector: Tests need to connect to a database containing sensitive customer data for integration testing.
* Attack Vector: Tests require API keys to interact with external services, and these keys are stored insecurely.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Test Environment Lacks Sufficient Security Controls](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_test_environment_lacks_sufficient_security_controls.md)

* Attack Vector: The test environment is on the same network segment as the production environment without proper segmentation.
* Attack Vector: Weak or default credentials are used for accessing test environment resources.
* Attack Vector: Lack of monitoring and logging within the test environment makes it difficult to detect malicious activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Misconfigurations or Poor Practices Related to Catch2 Usage](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_misconfigurations_or_poor_practices_related_to_catch2_usage.md)

This node encompasses risks arising from how Catch2 is used and managed within the development and deployment process, rather than vulnerabilities in Catch2 itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Leaving Test Code or Binaries in Production Environment](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_leaving_test_code_or_binaries_in_production_environment.md)

This path describes the danger of unintentionally deploying test-related artifacts to the production environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Test Executables or Source Code Containing Catch2 Remain Accessible in Production](./attack_tree_paths/test_executables_or_source_code_containing_catch2_remain_accessible_in_production.md)

* Attack Vector: Test executables are included in the production deployment package due to misconfiguration.
* Attack Vector: The `.git` directory containing test code is accidentally deployed to the production web server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Attacker Can Execute Tests or Analyze Test Code for Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/attacker_can_execute_tests_or_analyze_test_code_for_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker can download the test executables and run them in the production environment, potentially revealing sensitive information or triggering unintended actions.
* Attack Vector: Attackers can analyze the test code to understand internal application logic, identify vulnerabilities, or find exposed credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Insecure Handling of Test Artifacts](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_insecure_handling_of_test_artifacts.md)

This path focuses on the risks associated with the storage and management of test-related outputs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Test Reports, Logs, or Executables are Stored Insecurely](./attack_tree_paths/test_reports__logs__or_executables_are_stored_insecurely.md)

* Attack Vector: Test reports containing sensitive data or error messages are stored in publicly accessible cloud storage buckets.
* Attack Vector: Test logs containing API keys or database credentials are stored without proper access controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [Attacker Gains Access to These Artifacts](./attack_tree_paths/attacker_gains_access_to_these_artifacts.md)

* Attack Vector: Attackers discover and access the insecurely stored test artifacts, gaining access to sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Overly Permissive Test Environment Access](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_overly_permissive_test_environment_access.md)

This path highlights the dangers of granting the test environment excessive privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Test Environment Has Access to Production Systems or Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_test_environment_has_access_to_production_systems_or_sensitive_data.md)

* Attack Vector: The test environment is configured to directly access the production database for testing purposes.
* Attack Vector: API keys that grant access to production services are used within the test environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insufficient Access Controls on the Test Environment](./attack_tree_paths/insufficient_access_controls_on_the_test_environment.md)

* Attack Vector: Weak authentication mechanisms are used to access the test environment.
* Attack Vector: Lack of network segmentation allows an attacker who compromises the test environment to easily pivot to the production environment.
