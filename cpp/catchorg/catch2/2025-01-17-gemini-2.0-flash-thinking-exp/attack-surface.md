# Attack Surface Analysis for catchorg/catch2

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure through Assertion Messages](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_through_assertion_messages.md)

* **Attack Surface: Information Disclosure through Assertion Messages**
    * **Description:** Developers might inadvertently include sensitive information (API keys, internal paths, database credentials, etc.) within the messages of Catch2 assertions (e.g., `REQUIRE(user.isAdmin(), "User is not an admin - check API KEY: ABCDEFG");`).
    * **How Catch2 Contributes:** Catch2 allows developers to provide custom messages with assertions, which are displayed when the assertion fails and are included in test output.
    * **Example:** A developer uses `REQUIRE(db.connect(), "Failed to connect to database with password: mySecretPassword");`. If this test fails, the password will be exposed in the test output generated by Catch2.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information in test reports, logs, or CI/CD output generated by Catch2, potentially leading to unauthorized access or further attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid including sensitive information directly in Catch2 assertion messages.
        * Review test code and Catch2 assertion messages for potential information leaks.
        * Implement mechanisms to redact sensitive information from Catch2 test output.
        * Consider using more generic or parameterized assertion messages within Catch2 tests.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Input to Custom Reporters](./attack_surfaces/malicious_input_to_custom_reporters.md)

* **Attack Surface: Malicious Input to Custom Reporters**
    * **Description:** If developers implement custom Catch2 reporters, these implementations might be vulnerable to malicious input when processing test results or output provided by Catch2.
    * **How Catch2 Contributes:** Catch2 provides an interface for creating custom reporters that receive test results, including test case names and assertion messages, and can format them in various ways. Vulnerabilities can arise in the custom reporter's logic when handling this data from Catch2.
    * **Example:** A custom reporter writes test results to a file. If the reporter doesn't properly sanitize test case names or assertion messages received from Catch2 before using them as filenames, it could be vulnerable to path traversal. A malicious test case name like `"../../../../evil.txt"` could cause the reporter to write to an unintended location.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Arbitrary File Write/Overwrite:** A malicious test case name or assertion message from Catch2 could be used to overwrite critical files if the custom reporter doesn't sanitize filenames.
        * **Command Injection:** If the custom reporter executes commands based on test results received from Catch2 without proper sanitization.
        * **Information Disclosure:** If the custom reporter logs sensitive information to insecure locations based on data from Catch2.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the reporter's functionality)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization within custom Catch2 reporters for all data received from Catch2.
        * Avoid executing external commands based on test results received from Catch2 without careful sanitization.
        * Follow secure coding practices when developing custom Catch2 reporters.
        * Regularly review and audit custom Catch2 reporter code.
