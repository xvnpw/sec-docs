# Threat Model Analysis for catchorg/catch2

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Custom Matchers or Reporters](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_custom_matchers_or_reporters.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could potentially exploit security vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, injection flaws, logic errors) within custom matchers or reporters that extend Catch2's functionality. This could occur if developers implement these components without proper security considerations. An attacker might leverage these vulnerabilities if they can influence the test execution environment or the loading of these custom components.
*   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution within the test environment, information disclosure from the test process, or denial of service of the testing infrastructure.
*   **Affected Catch2 Component:** Custom Matchers (`Catch::MatcherBase`), Custom Reporters (`Catch::EventListenerBase`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Apply secure coding practices when developing custom matchers and reporters.
    *   Conduct thorough code reviews and security testing (including static and dynamic analysis) of custom components.
    *   Avoid using external libraries with known vulnerabilities in custom components.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when designing custom components and their interactions with the testing environment.
    *   Ensure proper input validation and sanitization within custom components.
