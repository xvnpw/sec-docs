# Attack Tree Analysis for catchorg/catch2

Objective: Compromise the application by executing arbitrary code within its context through vulnerabilities in or related to the Catch2 testing framework.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```

    *   Manipulate Test Execution Environment [HIGH-RISK PATH]
        *   Inject Malicious Test Cases [CRITICAL NODE]
            *   Modify Existing Test Files [HIGH-RISK PATH]
                *   Gain Write Access to Source Code Repository [CRITICAL NODE]
            *   Introduce New Malicious Test Files [HIGH-RISK PATH]
                *   Exploit Build System Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Test Execution Environment -> Inject Malicious Test Cases -> Modify Existing Test Files -> Gain Write Access to Source Code Repository](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_test_execution_environment_-_inject_malicious_test_cases_-_modify_existing_test_files_-_g_5a69e708.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Compromise Developer Accounts:** Attackers can use phishing, credential stuffing, or exploiting vulnerabilities in developer workstations to gain access to developer accounts. With these credentials, they can directly modify existing test files in the source code repository.
*   **Exploit VCS Vulnerabilities:**  Attackers can exploit weaknesses in the version control system (VCS) itself, such as insecure hooks that execute arbitrary code, or vulnerabilities in the VCS software that allow unauthorized modification of files.
*   **Insufficient Access Controls:** If the source code repository has overly permissive write access controls, an attacker who has gained access to a less privileged account might still be able to modify test files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Test Cases](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_test_cases.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   This node represents the point where the attacker successfully introduces malicious code into the testing process through test cases. This can be achieved by modifying existing files or introducing new ones. The successful execution of these malicious tests leads to code execution within the application's context during testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Test Execution Environment -> Inject Malicious Test Cases -> Introduce New Malicious Test Files -> Exploit Build System Vulnerabilities -> Inject Malicious Code during Compilation](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_test_execution_environment_-_inject_malicious_test_cases_-_introduce_new_malicious_test_f_49833e53.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Compromise Build System Infrastructure:** Attackers can target the infrastructure used for building the application, such as CI/CD servers. This can be done by exploiting vulnerabilities in the build system software, compromising accounts with access to the build system, or through supply chain attacks targeting dependencies of the build system.
*   **Modify Build Scripts or Configurations:** Once access to the build system is gained, attackers can modify build scripts or configuration files to include malicious test files in the build process. This ensures that the malicious tests are present and executed during testing.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks on Test Dependencies:** Attackers might compromise dependencies used in the testing process, injecting malicious code that gets pulled into the build environment and executed as part of the tests.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Write Access to Source Code Repository](./attack_tree_paths/gain_write_access_to_source_code_repository.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   As described in the first High-Risk Path, this involves compromising developer accounts, exploiting VCS vulnerabilities, or taking advantage of insufficient access controls on the repository. Successful compromise allows for direct and persistent modification of test files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Build System Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_build_system_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   This node represents the successful exploitation of weaknesses in the build system. This can involve exploiting software vulnerabilities in the CI/CD tools, compromising credentials used to access the build system, or leveraging misconfigurations in the build pipeline.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code during Compilation](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_during_compilation.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   This node represents the point where the attacker has successfully manipulated the build process to inject malicious code. This can be achieved by:
    *   Modifying compiler flags or settings to include malicious code.
    *   Replacing legitimate source files with malicious ones.
    *   Injecting malicious code into the build artifacts directly.
    *   Using compromised dependencies that introduce malicious code during the build.
