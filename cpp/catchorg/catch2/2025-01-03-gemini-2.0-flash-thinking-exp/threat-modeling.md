# Threat Model Analysis for catchorg/catch2

## Threat: [Malicious Test Code Execution](./threats/malicious_test_code_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Test Code Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker, potentially a disgruntled developer or someone who has gained unauthorized access to the codebase, writes a test case that executes arbitrary and malicious code *during Catch2 test execution*. This leverages Catch2's ability to execute arbitrary C++ code within test cases.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the testing environment, potentially leading to data breaches, denial of service, or the introduction of backdoors into the application being tested.
    *   **Catch2 Component Affected:** Test Case Code (`TEST_CASE`, `SECTION`, `REQUIRE`, `CHECK`, etc.)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict code review processes for all test code.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for the test execution environment.
        *   Utilize sandboxed or containerized environments for test execution to limit the impact of malicious code executed by Catch2.
        *   Employ static analysis tools on test code to identify potentially dangerous constructs within Catch2 test cases.
        *   Restrict access to the codebase and test environment to authorized personnel only.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Test Output](./threats/information_disclosure_through_test_output.md)

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure through Test Output
    *   **Description:** Developers might inadvertently include sensitive information within test assertions, logging statements, or custom string representations *used by Catch2* in test output. This information is then exposed through Catch2's reporting mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data to unauthorized individuals who have access to Catch2 test reports or logs. This can lead to account compromise, data breaches, or further attacks.
    *   **Catch2 Component Affected:** Assertion Macros (`REQUIRE`, `CHECK`, `INFO`, `CAPTURE`), Custom String Makers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Train developers on secure coding practices, emphasizing the risks of including sensitive data in Catch2 test output.
        *   Implement code reviews to identify and remove sensitive information from Catch2 test code and output.
        *   Sanitize or redact sensitive information in Catch2 test output before it is stored or shared.
        *   Avoid directly comparing or displaying sensitive data in Catch2 assertion messages. Instead, compare hashes or summaries.
        *   Securely store and manage Catch2 test reports, limiting access to authorized personnel.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Test Results](./threats/manipulation_of_test_results.md)

*   **Threat:** Manipulation of Test Results
    *   **Description:** An attacker with sufficient access to the test environment or codebase could modify test code or *Catch2 execution parameters* to falsely report successes or hide failures. This could involve commenting out failing assertions, altering test data used by Catch2, or manipulating the test runner's behavior.
    *   **Impact:**  Deployment of vulnerable or faulty code due to a false sense of security from manipulated Catch2 test results. This can lead to production issues, security vulnerabilities, and reputational damage.
    *   **Catch2 Component Affected:** Test Case Code, Catch2 Command Line Options, Test Runner Configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls for the codebase and test environment.
        *   Use version control systems and track changes to test code and Catch2 configuration.
        *   Automate Catch2 test execution within a controlled and auditable CI/CD pipeline.
        *   Regularly review Catch2 test results and investigate unexpected changes or patterns.
        *   Consider using signed Catch2 test results or other mechanisms to ensure integrity.

## Threat: [Exposure of Test Credentials in Code](./threats/exposure_of_test_credentials_in_code.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Test Credentials in Code
    *   **Description:** Developers might accidentally hardcode credentials (usernames, passwords, API keys) required for testing external services or databases directly within *Catch2 test code*.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials if the Catch2 test code is committed to a version control system, especially a public repository. This can lead to unauthorized access to external resources.
    *   **Catch2 Component Affected:** Test Case Code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never hardcode credentials in Catch2 test code.
        *   Use environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions to store and access test credentials used by Catch2 tests.
        *   Implement pre-commit hooks or static analysis checks to prevent the accidental committing of credentials within Catch2 test files.
        *   Regularly scan the codebase for exposed secrets in Catch2 test files.
