# Attack Surface Analysis for catchorg/catch2

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Input to Command Line Arguments](./attack_surfaces/malicious_input_to_command_line_arguments.md)

**Description:** Catch2 accepts various command-line arguments to control test execution, reporters, and output. Maliciously crafted input to these arguments could lead to unexpected behavior.
    - **How Catch2 Contributes:** Catch2 parses and acts upon the provided command-line arguments. Insufficient validation or sanitization within Catch2's argument parsing logic could be exploited.
    - **Example:** Providing a very long string or special characters to the `-n` (name filter) argument, potentially causing a buffer overflow or excessive resource consumption within Catch2's internal processing.
    - **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the test runner, potential for arbitrary code execution if a buffer overflow is exploitable.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Implement strict input validation on Catch2 command-line arguments within the test execution scripts or CI/CD pipeline.
        - Avoid directly passing user-controlled input to Catch2 command-line arguments.
        - Keep Catch2 updated to benefit from any security patches in argument parsing.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Reporter Output Path](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_reporter_output_path.md)

**Description:** Some Catch2 reporters allow specifying output file paths. If not properly validated, an attacker could potentially use path traversal techniques to write test results to arbitrary locations on the file system.
    - **How Catch2 Contributes:** Catch2 uses the provided output path without sufficient sanitization, allowing ".." sequences or absolute paths to write outside the intended directory.
    - **Example:** Providing an output path like `-o ../../../../../tmp/malicious_report.xml` to a reporter, potentially overwriting critical system files or writing sensitive information to a publicly accessible location.
    - **Impact:** Arbitrary file write, potentially leading to system compromise, data corruption, or information disclosure.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        -  Enforce strict validation of output paths provided to Catch2 reporters.
        -  Use relative paths for output files and ensure they remain within a designated output directory.
        -  Avoid constructing file paths directly from user-provided input.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Reporters](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_reporters.md)

**Description:** Catch2 allows developers to create custom reporters. If a custom reporter is poorly written or contains vulnerabilities, it can be exploited during test execution.
    - **How Catch2 Contributes:** Catch2 executes the code within the custom reporter. If the reporter has vulnerabilities, Catch2's execution context becomes a vector.
    - **Example:** A custom reporter that directly executes shell commands based on test case names or results, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands.
    - **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the test execution environment, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        -  Thoroughly review and test custom reporters for security vulnerabilities.
        -  Avoid performing privileged operations or executing external commands within custom reporters.
        -  Sanitize any input received by the custom reporter.
        -  Consider code review and security audits for custom reporters.
