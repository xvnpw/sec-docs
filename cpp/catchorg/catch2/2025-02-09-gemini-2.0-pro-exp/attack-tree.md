# Attack Tree Analysis for catchorg/catch2

Objective: To cause a denial-of-service (DoS) or achieve arbitrary code execution (ACE) on the target application by exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within the Catch2 testing framework that are exposed in a production environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposed Catch2 Infrastructure](./attack_tree_paths/exposed_catch2_infrastructure.md)

Description: This is the foundational vulnerability. Catch2, a testing framework, is unintentionally included and accessible in a production environment. This should *never* happen.
Why it's Critical: This node enables all subsequent attack paths. Without exposure, the other attacks are largely impossible.
Why it's High Risk: The presence of Catch2 in production is a significant deviation from best practices and indicates a serious configuration error.
Mitigation:
    Primary: Ensure Catch2 is *completely* excluded from production builds. Use conditional compilation (`#ifndef NDEBUG` or similar) and build system configurations to prevent its inclusion.
    Secondary (if absolutely necessary, which is highly discouraged): Implement strict network-level access controls (firewalls, reverse proxies) and strong authentication to prevent unauthorized access to any Catch2-related components.

## Attack Tree Path: [Direct Access to Catch2 Endpoints](./attack_tree_paths/direct_access_to_catch2_endpoints.md)

Description: An attacker can directly access URLs or network endpoints associated with Catch2's reporting or control mechanisms (e.g., `/catch2/`, `/tests/`, etc.).
Why it's Critical: This allows the attacker to interact with the testing framework, which is the prerequisite for exploiting further vulnerabilities.
Why it's High Risk: Direct access provides a low-effort entry point for attackers.
Mitigation:
    Primary: Ensure that no Catch2-related routes or endpoints are exposed to the public internet or untrusted networks.
    Secondary: Implement web application firewall (WAF) rules to block requests to known Catch2 paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [Crafted HTTP Requests](./attack_tree_paths/crafted_http_requests.md)

Description: The attacker sends specially crafted HTTP requests to the exposed Catch2 endpoints. These requests may exploit vulnerabilities in the framework itself or in the test code.
Why it's Critical: This is the mechanism by which the attacker triggers the malicious actions (DoS or ACE).
Why it's High Risk: Once endpoints are exposed, crafting requests is relatively straightforward, especially for DoS.
Mitigation:
    Primary: Prevent exposure of endpoints (as above).
    Secondary: Implement input validation and sanitization on any exposed endpoints (though this is a defense-in-depth measure, as the endpoints shouldn't be exposed in the first place). Monitor for unusual HTTP request patterns.

## Attack Tree Path: [DoS via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/dos_via_resource_exhaustion.md)

Description: The attacker crafts requests that trigger long-running tests, allocate excessive memory, or otherwise consume server resources, leading to a denial of service.
Attack Vector: The attacker might repeatedly trigger computationally expensive tests or tests designed to allocate large amounts of memory.
Impact: Application unavailability.
Mitigation:
    Primary: Prevent exposure of endpoints.
    Secondary: Implement resource limits and monitoring to detect and prevent excessive resource consumption. Rate-limiting requests to Catch2 endpoints (if they must exist) can also help.

## Attack Tree Path: [ACE via Vulnerability in Test Code](./attack_tree_paths/ace_via_vulnerability_in_test_code.md)

Description: The attacker exploits a vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, command injection) within the *test code itself*. This requires that the test code is both vulnerable *and* reachable through the exposed Catch2 infrastructure.
Attack Vector: The attacker crafts requests that provide malicious input to vulnerable test cases, triggering the vulnerability and achieving arbitrary code execution.
Impact: Complete system compromise.
Mitigation:
    Primary: Prevent exposure of endpoints.
    Secondary: Perform thorough code reviews and static analysis of *test code*, treating it with the same security rigor as production code. Sanitize any inputs used in test cases.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Security Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_security_mechanisms.md)

Description: If the exploited test code runs with higher privileges than the main application, the attacker can use the ACE to bypass security controls.
Attack Vector: After achieving ACE via a test code vulnerability, the attacker leverages the elevated privileges of the test environment to disable security features, access sensitive data, or perform other unauthorized actions.
Impact: Escalation of privileges and further compromise.
Mitigation:
    Primary: Ensure that test code runs with the *least privilege* necessary. Avoid running tests as root or with administrative privileges.
    Secondary: Implement strong separation of privileges between the testing environment and the production environment.
