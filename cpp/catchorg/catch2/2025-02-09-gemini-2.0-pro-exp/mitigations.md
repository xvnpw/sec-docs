# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for catchorg/catch2

## Mitigation Strategy: [Conditional Compilation with Catch2](./mitigation_strategies/conditional_compilation_with_catch2.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define a Preprocessor Macro:** Choose a clear preprocessor macro (e.g., `TESTING`, `CATCH2_ENABLED`).
    2.  **Wrap Catch2 Includes:** Use `#ifdef` and `#endif` to conditionally include *all* Catch2 headers:
        ```c++
        #ifdef TESTING
        #include <catch2/catch_all.hpp> // Or individual headers
        #endif
        ```
    3.  **Wrap Test Case Definitions:** Wrap all test case definitions and related Catch2 macros:
        ```c++
        #ifdef TESTING
        TEST_CASE("My Test", "[mytag]") {
            // ... test code ...
        }
        #endif
        ```
    4.  **Wrap Custom Reporters/Listeners:** If you have custom reporters or event listeners, wrap their definitions and usage within the `#ifdef` blocks as well.
    5.  **Build System Integration:** Ensure your build system (CMake, Make, etc.) defines the chosen macro *only* for test builds.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Inclusion in Production Builds (Severity: High):** Prevents Catch2 code from being included in production releases.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Inclusion in Production Builds:** Risk reduced from High to Negligible (if implemented correctly).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `#ifdef TESTING` is used to wrap most Catch2 code.
    *   CMake is configured to define `TESTING` only for test targets.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Some helper functions used in tests are not wrapped in `#ifdef TESTING`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Catch2 Test Timeouts](./mitigation_strategies/catch2_test_timeouts.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Long-Running Tests:** Identify tests or test sections that are known to take a significant amount of time.
    2.  **Apply `.timeout()` Modifier:** Use the `.timeout(seconds)` modifier on `TEST_CASE` or `SECTION` blocks to set a time limit:
        ```c++
        TEST_CASE("My Long Test", "[long]") {
          SECTION("Potentially Slow Operation") {
            REQUIRE(some_long_function() == expected);
          }
          .timeout(10); // Timeout after 10 seconds
        }
        ```
    3.  **Granular Timeouts:** Use nested `SECTION` blocks with different timeouts to pinpoint the specific part of a test that is causing delays.
    4.  **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review and adjust timeout values as your code and tests evolve.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service on Testing Infrastructure (Severity: Medium):** Prevents tests from running indefinitely.
    *   **Hanging Tests (Severity: Low):** Helps identify and diagnose stuck tests.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Hanging Tests:** Risk reduced from Low to Negligible.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Some test cases have timeouts set using `.timeout()`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Timeouts are not consistently applied across all test cases.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review and Configure Catch2 Output (Redaction)](./mitigation_strategies/review_and_configure_catch2_output__redaction_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Output:** Determine if any test cases might print sensitive information to the console or to Catch2's output files (e.g., XML, JUnit).
    2.  **Custom Reporters (If Necessary):** If standard output redaction isn't sufficient, create a custom Catch2 reporter.  This allows you to intercept and modify the output before it's written.  This is more complex but provides fine-grained control.
        *   Inherit from `Catch::StreamingReporterBase` (or a more specific reporter class).
        *   Override relevant methods (e.g., `testCaseEnded`, `sectionEnded`) to filter or redact sensitive data.
        *   Register your custom reporter using `CATCH_REGISTER_REPORTER`.
    3.  **Command-Line Options:** Explore Catch2's command-line options for controlling output verbosity and format.  Options like `-v` (verbosity) and `-r` (reporter) can be used to limit the amount of information displayed.
    4. **Filtering Test Output:** If sensitive data is unavoidable in *some* output, consider using tools like `grep` or `sed` to filter the output *after* the tests have run, removing sensitive lines before storing or displaying the results.  This is a less robust solution than a custom reporter.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Sensitive Information Leakage During Testing (Severity: Medium):** Prevents sensitive data from being exposed in test output.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Sensitive Information Leakage:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low (depending on the effectiveness of redaction).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   None.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No output redaction or custom reporters are in place. This is a significant gap if tests might handle sensitive data.
