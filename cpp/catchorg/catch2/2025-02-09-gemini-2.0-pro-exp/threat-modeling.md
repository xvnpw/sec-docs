# Threat Model Analysis for catchorg/catch2

## Threat: [Threat: Production Deployment of Test Code](./threats/threat_production_deployment_of_test_code.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a production environment where Catch2 and its associated test code have been inadvertently deployed.  The attacker identifies entry points (e.g., exposed endpoints, command-line arguments) that trigger test execution. They craft specific inputs or commands to execute tests designed for a development environment.  Because Catch2 is present, these tests can be run.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Execution of privileged operations within tests (e.g., file system manipulation, database access) leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.  These operations are facilitated by the presence of the test code, which Catch2 executes.
        *   Exposure of sensitive information contained within test data, assertions, or verbose output (generated by Catch2).
        *   Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk) due to test execution (managed by Catch2), causing denial of service.
        *   Potential for code injection if tests interact with external systems or user input in an unsafe manner, and Catch2 is used to execute these interactions.
    *   **Catch2 Component Affected:** Entire Catch2 framework and all associated test code (sections, test cases, generators, matchers, reporters, etc.). The risk is the *presence* of the framework and the ability to execute arbitrary test code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Build Process:** Implement rigorous build process controls to *exclude* Catch2 and all test code from production builds. Use preprocessor directives (`#ifndef NDEBUG`, `#if !defined(PRODUCTION)`, etc.) to conditionally compile out test code. This is the primary mitigation.
        *   **Automated Checks:** Integrate automated checks into the CI/CD pipeline to detect the presence of Catch2 libraries or test-related files in production artifacts. Fail the build if detected.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Mandate code reviews to ensure that test code is properly isolated and does not contain production secrets or credentials.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management system that clearly distinguishes between development and production dependencies. Ensure Catch2 is *only* a development dependency.
        *   **Configuration Management:** Separate configuration files for development, testing, and production environments.  Ensure production configurations do not enable any test-related functionality (which would require Catch2).

## Threat: [Threat: Tampering with Test Executables or Results](./threats/threat_tampering_with_test_executables_or_results.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with access to the build or test environment (e.g., a compromised build server, malicious insider) modifies the compiled test executable (which uses Catch2), the Catch2 library itself, or the test result files generated by Catch2. They alter test logic to bypass security checks, inject malicious code *into the test executable*, or manipulate the reported results to hide vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   False negatives: Vulnerabilities are masked, leading to a false sense of security and the deployment of insecure code. The attacker relies on Catch2 to report these falsified results.
        *   Introduction of new vulnerabilities: The attacker could inject malicious code into the test executable (which is linked with Catch2), which might then be executed during testing, potentially compromising the test environment or even the system under test.
        *   Loss of trust in the testing process: The integrity of the testing process, and specifically Catch2's reporting, is undermined.
    *   **Catch2 Component Affected:** Catch2 library (compiled code), test executables (linked with Catch2), reporter output (e.g., XML, JUnit, console output â€“ generated by Catch2).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Build Environment:** Restrict access to the build and test environment to authorized personnel only. Implement strong authentication and authorization controls.
        *   **Code Signing:** Digitally sign test executables and the Catch2 library (if feasible) to ensure their integrity and authenticity. Verify signatures before execution. This directly mitigates tampering.
        *   **Integrity Checks:** Calculate and store cryptographic hashes (e.g., SHA-256) of test executables and result files (produced by Catch2). Regularly verify these hashes to detect any unauthorized modifications.
        *   **Audit Logging:** Maintain detailed audit logs of all build and test activities, including modifications to test code, executables, and results reported by Catch2.
        *   **Version Control:** Use a secure version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes to test code and Catch2 configurations.
