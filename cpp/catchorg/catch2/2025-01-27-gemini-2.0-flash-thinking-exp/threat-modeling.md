# Threat Model Analysis for catchorg/catch2

## Threat: [Accidental Inclusion of Test Code and Catch2 in Production Builds](./threats/accidental_inclusion_of_test_code_and_catch2_in_production_builds.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might exploit the presence of Catch2 framework and test code that was unintentionally included in production builds. This could allow them to reverse engineer internal logic, trigger debugging features left enabled by the testing framework, or exploit exposed test-specific functionalities to gain unauthorized access or disrupt application behavior.
*   **Impact:** Increased attack surface, exposure of internal application logic and potentially sensitive data embedded in tests, unexpected application behavior due to test code execution, potential for exploitation of debugging or test functionalities in production.
*   **Affected Catch2 Component:** Entire Catch2 framework (headers, potentially linked libraries if not properly excluded), test code files.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust and clearly defined build processes to strictly separate test and production code.
    *   Utilize compiler flags and build system configurations to explicitly exclude test code and Catch2 libraries from production builds.
    *   Employ static analysis tools and build pipeline checks to automatically detect and prevent the inclusion of test-related artifacts in production.
    *   Conduct thorough code reviews of build and deployment pipelines to ensure proper separation and exclusion mechanisms are in place.
    *   Use separate and isolated build environments for testing and production to minimize the risk of accidental inclusion.
