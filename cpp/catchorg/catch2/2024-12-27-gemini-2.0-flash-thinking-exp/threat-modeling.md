## High and Critical Catch2 Threats

Here's an updated threat list focusing only on high and critical threats that directly involve the Catch2 testing framework:

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Catch2 Component Affected | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Malicious Test Case Injection** | An attacker (malicious developer or through compromised account) injects a test case containing malicious code within a `TEST_CASE` or `SECTION`. This code is executed by Catch2 during the test run and could exploit vulnerabilities in the application under test, modify the build environment, or exfiltrate data. |  **Critical:** Potential for arbitrary code execution on the build system or the environment where tests are run, leading to system compromise, data breach, or supply chain contamination. | `TEST_CASE` macro, `SECTION` macro, custom test case registration mechanisms | **Critical** | - **Mandatory Code Review for Test Cases:** Treat test code with the same scrutiny as production code. - **Principle of Least Privilege for Test Execution:** Run tests with the minimum necessary permissions. Avoid running tests as root. - **Input Validation in Tests:** If tests use external data, validate and sanitize it. - **Static Analysis of Test Code:** Use static analysis tools to scan test code for potential vulnerabilities. - **Secure Development Practices:** Educate developers on the risks of malicious test cases. |
| **Tampering with Test Configuration** | An attacker modifies Catch2 configuration settings, such as command-line arguments or configuration macros (`#define`), to disable critical security tests, alter reporting to hide failures, or introduce malicious behavior during test execution. | **High:**  Security vulnerabilities might be missed, leading to the release of vulnerable software. False sense of security due to manipulated test results. Potential for malicious actions during test execution if configuration allows it. | Command-line argument parsing, configuration macros (`#define`), `Catch::Config` class | **High** | - **Secure Configuration Management:** Store and manage test configurations securely using version control and access controls. - **Immutable Test Configurations:** Where possible, make critical test configurations read-only or enforce them through CI/CD pipelines. - **Regularly Review Test Configurations:** Periodically audit test configurations to ensure they haven't been tampered with. - **Centralized Configuration:** Manage test configurations in a central, controlled location. |
| **Information Leakage in Test Cases** | Developers inadvertently include sensitive information (API keys, passwords, internal configurations) directly within the string literals of `TEST_CASE` names, `SECTION` names, or data used within tests. This information could be exposed in Catch2's test reports, logs, or version control history. | **High:** Exposure of sensitive credentials or internal details could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems or data. | `TEST_CASE` macro, `SECTION` macro, string literals within tests, data files used by tests | **High** | - **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets:** Never hardcode sensitive information in test cases. Use environment variables, secure vaults, or mock data. - **Secure Logging and Reporting:** Configure Catch2's reporting to avoid including sensitive information in output. Redact or mask sensitive data. - **Regularly Scan Test Code for Secrets:** Use tools to scan test code and data for potential secrets. - **Review Test Reports and Logs:** Periodically review test reports and logs for accidental information disclosure. |
| **Manipulated Test Results** | An attacker modifies the output or reporting generated by Catch2 to make failing tests appear as passing. This could involve tampering with custom reporters or intercepting and altering the standard output/files generated by Catch2. This masks critical bugs and leads to the release of vulnerable software. | **High:** Release of vulnerable software, false sense of security, potential for significant real-world impact if vulnerabilities are exploited. | Custom reporters, output stream handling within Catch2, integration with CI/CD systems | **High** | - **Secure Test Reporting Pipelines:** Ensure the integrity of the test reporting pipeline. Use secure protocols and authentication for transferring test results. - **Digital Signatures for Test Results:** Consider digitally signing test results to ensure they haven't been tampered with. - **Audit Logging of Test Execution:** Maintain audit logs of test execution and reporting processes. - **Compare Results Across Runs:** Implement mechanisms to compare test results across different runs to detect anomalies. |
| **Abuse of Custom Reporters for Malicious Actions** | A malicious actor creates or modifies a custom Catch2 reporter (implementing `Catch::EventListenerBase`) to perform actions beyond simply reporting test results. This could include exfiltrating data from the build environment, modifying files, or executing arbitrary code on the build system during the test execution phase. | **Critical:** Potential for arbitrary code execution on the build system, data breaches, and supply chain attacks. | Custom reporter interface (`Catch::EventListenerBase`), programmatic test registration | **Critical** | - **Strict Review of Custom Reporters:**  Thoroughly review the code of any custom Catch2 reporters before using them. - **Principle of Least Privilege for Reporters:** Limit the permissions granted to custom reporters. - **Sandboxing Reporter Execution:** Consider running custom reporters in sandboxed environments. - **Limit Use of Custom Reporters:**  Only use custom reporters when absolutely necessary and prefer built-in reporting options. |
