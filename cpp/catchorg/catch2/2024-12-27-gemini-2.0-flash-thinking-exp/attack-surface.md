Here's the updated key attack surface list, focusing only on elements directly involving Catch2 with high or critical risk severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Exploiting Custom Reporters
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in custom reporters can be exploited, leading to significant security risks.
    *   **How Catch2 Contributes:** Catch2 provides the interface and mechanism for integrating custom reporters, making the application directly reliant on their security.
    *   **Example:** A custom reporter that writes test results to a file based on user-provided input without proper validation could be vulnerable to path traversal (e.g., writing to `/etc/passwd`).
    *   **Impact:** Critical: Arbitrary file read/write, remote code execution (depending on the reporter's functionality). High: Information disclosure, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Developers must thoroughly review and audit custom reporter code for security vulnerabilities. Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any user-provided data used by the reporter. Follow secure coding practices. Consider using well-vetted, open-source reporter implementations if possible.

*   **Attack Surface:** Exploiting Custom Listeners
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in custom listeners can be exploited, leading to significant security risks.
    *   **How Catch2 Contributes:** Catch2 provides the interface for integrating custom listeners, making the application directly reliant on their security.
    *   **Example:** A custom listener that logs test results to a database without proper input sanitization could be vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   **Impact:** Critical: Database compromise, remote code execution (depending on the listener's functionality). High: Information disclosure, data manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Developers must thoroughly review and audit custom listener code for security vulnerabilities. Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any data handled by the listener. Follow secure coding practices, especially when interacting with external systems.
