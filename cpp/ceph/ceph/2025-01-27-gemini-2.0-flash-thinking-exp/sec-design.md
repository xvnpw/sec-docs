## 4. Component Details (Security Deep Dive)

### 4.1. Ceph Monitors (MONs) - Security Authority

*   **Function:**  Maintain cluster map, enforce authentication (Cephx), manage authorization (capabilities), crucial for cluster consensus and integrity.
*   **Key Security Aspects:**
    *   **Authentication (Cephx Protocol):**  Vulnerable to replay attacks, man-in-the-middle if not properly configured (e.g., time synchronization, secure channels). Key management for Cephx is critical.
    *   **Authorization (Capabilities):**  Overly permissive capabilities grant excessive access. Capability management needs granular control and least privilege principle.
    *   **Quorum & Consensus (Paxos/Raft):**  DoS attacks targeting quorum formation can disrupt cluster availability. Compromise of a quorum majority leads to complete cluster control.
    *   **Data Sensitivity (Cluster Map, Keys):**  Store highly sensitive data. Access control to MON data (e.g., RocksDB) is paramount. Encryption at rest for MON data is recommended.
    *   **Communication Security:**  Inter-monitor and monitor-daemon communication must be secured (e.g., using `cephx_require_signatures`, `cephx_cluster_require_signatures`, `cephx_service_require_signatures`).
    *   **Vulnerability to Clock Drift:** Cephx relies on time synchronization. Clock drift can lead to authentication failures or vulnerabilities. NTP configuration is essential.

### 4.2. Ceph Managers (MGRs) - Management & Monitoring Exposure

*   **Function:**  Management interface (dashboard, API), monitoring data aggregation, module hosting. Potential attack vector for administrative access.

*   **Key Security Aspects:**
    *   **API Security (S3/Swift API Implementation):**  Vulnerable to web application vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10). Input validation, output encoding, and secure API design are crucial.
    *   **Authentication & Authorization (S3/Swift Authentication):**  Secure handling of S3 keys, Swift tokens, and IAM policies. Vulnerabilities in authentication can lead to unauthorized access.
    *   **Access Control (Bucket/Object Policies, ACLs):**  Enforce bucket and object-level access control policies. Misconfigurations in policies can lead to data breaches.
    *   **Data in Transit Encryption (HTTPS/TLS):**  Mandatory for protecting data confidentiality and integrity during transmission. Proper TLS configuration is essential.
    *   **Input Validation & Injection Prevention:**  Rigorous input validation to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, command injection, etc.).
    *   **DoS Protection (Rate Limiting, WAF):**  RGWs are exposed to internet-facing DoS attacks. Rate limiting, Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), and other DoS mitigation techniques are necessary.
    *   **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):**  RGW functionalities that interact with external resources can be vulnerable to SSRF attacks.

### 4.6. LibRados & Client Libraries - Client-Side Vulnerabilities

*   **Function:**  Direct RADOS access for applications. Client-side security is paramount as vulnerabilities here can bypass Ceph's internal security.
*   **Key Security Aspects:**
    *   **Client-Side Security Vulnerabilities:**  Applications using LibRados can introduce vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, format string bugs, insecure coding practices). Secure coding practices and regular security audits of client applications are essential.
    *   **Authentication & Authorization Handling (Client-Side):**  Clients must securely handle Ceph authentication credentials (keys, capabilities). Hardcoding credentials or insecure storage of keys is a major risk.
    *   **Input Validation (Client-Side):**  Client applications should validate user inputs before sending requests to Ceph to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Dependency Management (Client Libraries):**  Vulnerabilities in LibRados or other client library dependencies can impact application security. Regular updates and vulnerability scanning of client libraries are important.
