# Attack Surface Analysis for ceph/ceph

## Attack Surface: [Monitor Quorum Manipulation (Denial of Service)](./attack_surfaces/monitor_quorum_manipulation__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker disrupts the Ceph monitor quorum, rendering the cluster unavailable.
*   **Ceph Contribution:** Ceph relies on a healthy monitor quorum for cluster consensus and operation. Disrupting this quorum directly impacts Ceph's availability.
*   **Example:** Network flooding targeting monitor nodes, exploiting a vulnerability in the monitor consensus algorithm to cause monitors to crash or become unresponsive, or resource exhaustion on monitor nodes.
*   **Impact:** Cluster-wide Denial of Service, inability to access data, application downtime, potential data loss if the cluster cannot recover.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Network Segmentation: Isolate monitor network traffic and restrict access to monitor ports.
    *   Resource Management: Ensure sufficient resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) are allocated to monitor nodes.
    *   Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on monitor communication to mitigate flooding attacks.
    *   Regular Security Audits: Audit monitor configurations and network security to identify and address vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor Node Redundancy: Deploy sufficient monitor nodes (typically 3 or 5) in geographically diverse locations for fault tolerance.
    *   Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS): Deploy IDS/IPS to detect and block malicious network traffic targeting monitors.

## Attack Surface: [Credential Theft and Compromise (Ceph Authentication)](./attack_surfaces/credential_theft_and_compromise__ceph_authentication_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers steal or compromise Ceph authentication credentials (keys, passwords), gaining unauthorized access to Ceph components and data.
*   **Ceph Contribution:** Ceph uses `cephx` authentication and key management. Compromised keys grant access to Ceph services (MON, OSD, RGW, MDS) based on the key's capabilities.
*   **Example:** Phishing attacks targeting administrators to obtain Ceph admin keys, exploiting vulnerabilities in applications using Ceph client libraries to extract keys from memory, or gaining access to systems where keys are stored insecurely.
*   **Impact:** Full cluster compromise, unauthorized data access, data modification, data deletion, denial of service, potential lateral movement within the infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strong Key Management: Securely store and manage Ceph keys. Use dedicated key management systems (KMS) or hardware security modules (HSMs) for sensitive keys.
    *   Principle of Least Privilege: Grant minimal necessary capabilities to Ceph users and applications. Avoid using admin keys for regular application access.
    *   Regular Key Rotation: Implement a policy for regular rotation of Ceph keys to limit the lifespan of compromised credentials.
    *   Secure Key Distribution: Use secure channels for distributing Ceph keys to authorized applications and users. Avoid embedding keys directly in application code.
    *   Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Capabilities: Utilize Ceph's ACLs and capabilities system to restrict access based on roles and needs.
    *   Monitoring and Auditing: Monitor access to Ceph keys and audit key usage for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Data Access (OSD and RGW)](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_data_access__osd_and_rgw_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers bypass Ceph's access control mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to data stored in OSDs or accessed through RGW.
*   **Ceph Contribution:** Ceph's access control relies on authentication, authorization (capabilities, bucket policies, ACLs), and proper configuration. Weaknesses in these areas can lead to unauthorized access.
*   **Example:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in RGW's S3 API authentication to bypass bucket policies, misconfigured bucket policies granting public read access to sensitive data, or vulnerabilities in OSD daemons allowing direct data access bypassing Ceph's access layer.
*   **Impact:** Data confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive information, potential regulatory compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strict Access Control Policies: Implement and enforce strict bucket policies and ACLs in RGW. Regularly review and audit these policies.
    *   Principle of Least Privilege (Capabilities):  Grant minimal necessary capabilities to applications accessing Ceph data.
    *   Authentication and Authorization Hardening:  Ensure robust authentication mechanisms are in place for RGW (e.g., IAM integration, strong password policies).
    *   Input Validation and Sanitization (RGW):  Implement proper input validation and sanitization in applications interacting with RGW to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address access control vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (OSD, MDS, RGW)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__osd__mds__rgw_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers overwhelm Ceph services (OSD, MDS, RGW) with requests or exploit vulnerabilities to cause service disruption and unavailability.
*   **Ceph Contribution:** Ceph services are critical for data access and cluster operation. Overloading or crashing these services directly impacts application availability.
*   **Example:** Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks targeting RGW API endpoints, overwhelming OSDs with read/write requests, exploiting vulnerabilities in MDS daemons to cause crashes, or resource exhaustion attacks on Ceph services.
*   **Impact:** Service unavailability, application downtime, inability to access data, potential data loss if redundancy is insufficient, reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Rate Limiting and Traffic Shaping: Implement rate limiting and traffic shaping on RGW API endpoints and client access to Ceph.
    *   Resource Management and Capacity Planning: Ensure sufficient resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, storage capacity) are allocated to Ceph services to handle expected load and potential surges.
    *   Load Balancing and Distribution: Distribute load across multiple RGW instances and OSDs to improve resilience and performance.
    *   Web Application Firewall (WAF) (RGW): Deploy a WAF in front of RGW to protect against common web attacks and DoS attempts.
    *   Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS): Deploy IDS/IPS to detect and block malicious traffic targeting Ceph services.
    *   Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address DoS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [API Vulnerabilities (RGW S3/Swift)](./attack_surfaces/api_vulnerabilities__rgw_s3swift_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in RGW's S3 or Swift compatible APIs to gain unauthorized access, manipulate data, or disrupt service.
*   **Ceph Contribution:** RGW exposes S3 and Swift APIs for object storage access. Vulnerabilities in these APIs can directly impact the security of data stored in Ceph.
*   **Example:** Exploiting injection vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection, SSRF) in RGW API handlers, authentication bypass vulnerabilities in the API implementation, or vulnerabilities in API parsing logic leading to unexpected behavior.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data modification, data deletion, denial of service, potential code execution on RGW servers, reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regular Security Updates and Patching: Apply security updates and patches to Ceph and RGW components promptly to address known vulnerabilities.
    *   Input Validation and Sanitization: Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all API requests to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Security Audits and Code Reviews: Conduct regular security audits and code reviews of RGW API implementation to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Web Application Firewall (WAF) (RGW): Deploy a WAF in front of RGW to protect against common web attacks and API-specific vulnerabilities.
    *   Penetration Testing: Conduct regular penetration testing of RGW APIs to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Communication (General Ceph Deployment)](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_communication__general_ceph_deployment_.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between Ceph components or between clients and Ceph is not encrypted, allowing attackers to eavesdrop on sensitive data in transit.
*   **Ceph Contribution:** Ceph supports encryption for inter-component communication (`cephx`) and client-to-cluster communication (TLS for RGW). Failure to enable these features exposes communication channels.
*   **Example:** Network sniffing to capture authentication credentials, data being transferred between OSDs, or sensitive data accessed through RGW API calls when encryption is not enabled.
*   **Impact:** Data confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive information, credential theft, potential man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High** (depending on the sensitivity of the data and network environment)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable `cephx` Authentication Encryption: Ensure `cephx` encryption is enabled for inter-component communication within the Ceph cluster.
    *   Enable TLS for RGW: Configure TLS encryption for RGW to secure client-to-RGW communication over HTTPS.
    *   Network Segmentation: Isolate Ceph network traffic to reduce the risk of eavesdropping within the network.
    *   VPN or Encrypted Tunnels: Use VPNs or encrypted tunnels for client access to Ceph over untrusted networks.
