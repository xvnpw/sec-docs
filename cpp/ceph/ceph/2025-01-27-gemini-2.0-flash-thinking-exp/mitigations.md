# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ceph/ceph

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement CephX Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/implement_cephx_authentication.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable CephX:** Ensure CephX authentication is enabled cluster-wide. Verify in your `ceph.conf` file under the `[global]` section that `auth_cluster_required = cephx`, `auth_service_required = cephx`, and `auth_client_required = cephx` are set. Restart Ceph Monitors and OSDs for changes to take effect.
    2.  **Create Ceph Users:** For each application component or service needing Ceph access, create a dedicated Ceph user using `ceph auth add`. Example: `ceph auth add client.myapp mon 'allow r' osd 'allow rwx pool=mypool' rgw 'allow rwx'`. 
    3.  **Grant Minimal Capabilities:** When creating users, grant only necessary capabilities. Avoid `*`. Define capabilities for `mon`, `osd`, and `rgw` based on need (e.g., `r`, `w`, `x`, `rw`, `rwx`, `profile osd`). Use pool and namespace restrictions for finer control.
    4.  **Distribute Keys Securely:** Retrieve user keys using `ceph auth get-key client.myapp`. Distribute securely to applications. Avoid embedding in code. Use environment variables, secure config files, or secrets management.
    5.  **Application Configuration:** Configure applications to use CephX user ID and key when connecting (e.g., librados, RGW S3/Swift clients).

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Data (High Severity):** Without CephX, anyone with network access could read/modify data. CephX prevents this.
    *   **Data Breaches (High Severity):** Unauthorized access leads to breaches. CephX reduces this risk.
    *   **Data Tampering (High Severity):** Unauthorized modification/deletion. CephX prevents this.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Data:** High reduction. CephX effectively blocks unauthorized access.
    *   **Data Breaches:** High reduction. Significantly lowers breach risk from unauthorized access.
    *   **Data Tampering:** High reduction. Prevents unauthorized data manipulation.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, CephX enabled cluster-wide in staging/production.
    *   Dedicated Ceph users for main application services.
    *   Keys via environment variables in container deployments.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Granular capability restrictions for all services not fully implemented. Some use broader capabilities than needed.
    *   Automated key rotation is missing; manual quarterly rotation in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Ceph Users](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_ceph_users.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review User Capabilities:** List existing users and capabilities with `ceph auth list`.
    2.  **Identify Required Capabilities:** Analyze minimum Ceph operations for each application/user. Determine needed permissions (`r`, `w`, `x`, combinations) and resources (monitors, OSDs, pools, namespaces, RGW buckets).
    3.  **Refine Capabilities:** Use `ceph auth caps` to restrict user capabilities. Example: `osd 'allow r pool=mypool'` instead of `osd 'allow rwx pool=mypool'` if read-only access is sufficient. Use pool/namespace restrictions.
    4.  **Test Application Functionality:** Test applications after capability reduction to ensure correct function.
    5.  **Document User Capabilities:** Document purpose and capabilities for each user for audits and reference.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Lateral Movement (Medium to High Severity):** Compromised service with broad capabilities can access other Ceph parts. Least privilege limits this.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Overly permissive capabilities can be exploited for escalation within Ceph.
    *   **Accidental Data Corruption/Deletion (Medium Severity):** Excessive write/delete permissions increase risk of accidental damage. Least privilege reduces impact.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Medium to High reduction. Limits attacker movement within Ceph after compromise.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Medium reduction. Reduces attack surface for escalation in Ceph.
    *   **Accidental Data Corruption/Deletion:** Medium reduction. Minimizes damage from accidental errors.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Capability review started, restrictions for newer services.
    *   Older services may have broader capabilities than ideal.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Systematic capability review and refinement for all users across environments.
    *   Automated capability validation/enforcement in infrastructure-as-code pipeline.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Data-at-Rest Encryption (Encryption at Rest - EAR)](./mitigation_strategies/enable_data-at-rest_encryption__encryption_at_rest_-_ear_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Encryption Method:** Select encryption for Ceph OSDs. LUKS (dm-crypt) is recommended.
    2.  **Enable OSD Encryption during Deployment:** Configure OSD encryption during initial Ceph cluster deployment. Configure OSD creation to use LUKS and provide encryption keys.
    3.  **Key Management for EAR:** Securely manage OSD encryption keys. Options:
        *   **Passphrase-based:** Simpler for testing, less secure for production.
        *   **Keyfile-based:** Securely store keyfiles, potentially using secrets manager.
        *   **Key Management System (KMS):** Integrate with KMS (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Barbican, KMIP) for robust key management, rotation, auditing.
    4.  **Performance Considerations:** Encryption impacts performance. Use hardware acceleration (AES-NI) if available.
    5.  **Regular Key Rotation (for KMS):** If using KMS, implement regular key rotation for OSD encryption keys.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Physical Storage Compromise (High Severity):** Stolen/lost/improperly decommissioned drives expose data. EAR prevents unauthorized access.
    *   **Data Breaches from Physical Security Failures (High Severity):** Physical breaches can lead to data breaches without EAR.
    *   **Insider Threats (Physical Access) (Medium Severity):** Malicious insiders with physical access could extract unencrypted data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Physical Storage Compromise:** High reduction. Data on compromised drives unusable without keys.
    *   **Data Breaches from Physical Security Failures:** High reduction. Significantly reduces breach risk from physical incidents.
    *   **Insider Threats (Physical Access):** Medium reduction. Adds barrier for insiders stealing data physically.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No, Data-at-Rest Encryption is **not implemented** in production Ceph cluster.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Full EAR implementation for all Ceph OSDs in all environments.
    *   Selection and KMS integration for OSD encryption key management.
    *   Procedures for key rotation and recovery.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Data-in-Transit Encryption (Encryption in Transit - EIT)](./mitigation_strategies/enable_data-in-transit_encryption__encryption_in_transit_-_eit_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable TLS for Ceph Daemons:** Configure Ceph to enforce TLS/SSL for communication between daemons (Monitors, OSDs, MDS, RGW). In `ceph.conf` `[global]`: `cephx_require_signatures = true`, `cephx_cluster_require_signatures = true`, `cephx_service_require_signatures = true`, `ms_cluster_mode = secure`, `ms_service_mode = secure`, `ms_client_mode = secure`.
    2.  **Generate and Distribute TLS Certificates:** Generate TLS certificates for Ceph cluster. Use trusted CA or self-signed CA. Distribute to all Ceph nodes and clients.
    3.  **Configure RGW TLS:** Configure TLS termination for RGW service. Configure RGW frontend (Nginx, Apache) to use TLS certificates for HTTPS.
    4.  **Client TLS Configuration:** Configure applications/clients to use TLS when connecting (e.g., `rados_connect_to_rados_with_user_and_key_r` with TLS options in librados, HTTPS for S3/Swift clients).
    5.  **Cipher Suite Selection:** Choose strong TLS cipher suites, disable weak ciphers. Configure in Ceph config and RGW frontend.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):** Unencrypted traffic vulnerable to eavesdropping/interception. MitM for data/credential theft. TLS prevents this.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping (High Severity):** Unencrypted traffic allows passive monitoring and capture of sensitive data. TLS prevents this.
    *   **Data Tampering in Transit (Medium Severity):** Unencrypted traffic could be intercepted and modified. TLS provides integrity.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** High reduction. TLS effectively prevents MitM attacks.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping:** High reduction. Makes eavesdropping and data theft very difficult.
    *   **Data Tampering in Transit:** Medium reduction. Provides integrity against in-transit modification.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. TLS for client RGW connections (HTTPS).
    *   Internal Ceph cluster communication **not currently encrypted** with TLS.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Full TLS encryption for internal Ceph cluster communication (daemon-to-daemon).
    *   TLS certificate generation/distribution for internal communication.
    *   Enforcement of TLS for all Ceph client connections (including librados).
    *   Regular TLS certificate rotation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Object Versioning (for RGW)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_object_versioning__for_rgw_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Versioning on Buckets:** Enable object versioning for relevant RGW buckets. Use S3/Swift API. Example (AWS CLI): `aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket my-bucket --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled`.
    2.  **Define Versioning Policies:** Establish policies for version management, retention periods, lifecycle rules for older versions.
    3.  **Educate Users:** Train users/applications on versioning and how to access/manage versions.
    4.  **Regularly Review Versioning Configuration:** Periodically review and adjust versioning policies for data recovery and compliance.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Accidental Data Deletion (Medium Severity):** Accidental object deletion. Versioning allows easy recovery.
    *   **Accidental Data Overwriting (Medium Severity):** Unintentional object overwrite. Versioning preserves previous versions for rollback.
    *   **Ransomware (Low to Medium Severity):** Versioning can help recover previous versions of encrypted objects in some ransomware scenarios.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Accidental Data Deletion:** High reduction. Straightforward recovery of deleted data.
    *   **Accidental Data Overwriting:** High reduction. Easy rollback to previous versions.
    *   **Ransomware:** Low to Medium reduction. Can be helpful, but not primary ransomware defense.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Versioning enabled for some critical RGW buckets.
    *   Not all buckets have versioning, especially less critical data.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Systematic enablement of versioning for all relevant RGW buckets.
    *   Versioning policies and lifecycle rules implementation.
    *   Automated monitoring/alerting for versioning configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Erasure Coding (EC) with Caution](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_erasure_coding__ec__with_caution.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Understand EC Security Implications:** Recognize that EC fragments data across OSDs. Secure EC profiles are crucial for data integrity and availability if nodes are compromised.
    2.  **Secure EC Profile Configuration:** Carefully design EC profiles. Consider factors like failure domain, required data durability, and performance needs. Ensure sufficient data redundancy and distribution across failure domains.
    3.  **Monitor EC Health:**  Closely monitor the health of EC pools. Ensure timely recovery and repair of degraded objects to maintain data durability.
    4.  **Consider Replication for Sensitive Data:** For highly sensitive data, replication might offer a simpler and potentially more robust security model compared to EC, despite higher storage overhead. Evaluate trade-offs.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Loss from Node Failures (Medium Severity):** Improperly configured EC profiles or insufficient redundancy can increase data loss risk if multiple OSDs fail, especially during recovery. Secure profiles mitigate this.
    *   **Data Availability Issues (Medium Severity):**  Poor EC configuration can lead to reduced data availability during OSD failures or recovery processes.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Low to Medium Severity):** In rare scenarios with very poorly configured EC and multiple failures, data integrity could be compromised. Secure profiles minimize this.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Loss from Node Failures:** Medium reduction (with proper EC configuration). Secure EC profiles provide good data durability.
    *   **Data Availability Issues:** Medium reduction (with proper EC configuration). Well-designed EC profiles maintain good availability.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues:** Low to Medium reduction (with proper EC configuration). Secure profiles minimize integrity risks.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Erasure Coding is used for some of our Ceph pools for cost optimization.
    *   EC profiles are based on standard recommendations, but a formal security review of EC configuration is **missing**.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal security review of existing EC profiles to ensure they are configured securely and meet our data durability and security requirements.
    *   Enhanced monitoring and alerting for EC pool health and recovery processes.
    *   Clear guidelines on when to use replication vs. erasure coding based on data sensitivity and security needs.
