## Attack Tree Path: [1. Credential Stuffing/Brute Force (Ceph Auth) (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/1__credential_stuffingbrute_force__ceph_auth___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Using lists of compromised usernames and passwords from previous data breaches against Ceph authentication endpoints (e.g., Ceph Monitor, RGW).
    *   Automated tools to try numerous password combinations for known or common usernames.
    *   Exploiting weak or default password policies to guess passwords more easily.
*   **Impact:** Successful brute force or credential stuffing leads to unauthorized access to Ceph services, potentially granting control over data and cluster operations.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement strong password policies (complexity, length, rotation).
    *   Enable account lockout after multiple failed login attempts.
    *   Implement rate limiting on authentication requests.
    *   Consider multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Ceph management interfaces.
    *   Monitor authentication logs for suspicious activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Key Leakage/Exposure (Ceph Keys - e.g., in application code, logs, insecure storage) (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/2__key_leakageexposure__ceph_keys_-_e_g___in_application_code__logs__insecure_storage___critical_nod_60787b87.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Finding Ceph secret keys embedded in application source code (e.g., hardcoded credentials).
    *   Discovering keys in application logs, debug outputs, or error messages.
    *   Accessing insecure storage locations where keys are stored without proper encryption or access control (e.g., unprotected filesystems, unencrypted configuration files).
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in secrets management systems (if used) to retrieve keys.
*   **Impact:** Exposed Ceph keys grant immediate and direct authentication to Ceph services, bypassing normal authentication mechanisms. This allows full access to data and cluster operations.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Never embed Ceph keys directly in application code.
    *   Use dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets) to store and manage keys securely.
    *   Encrypt key storage locations.
    *   Implement strict access control to key storage and secrets management systems.
    *   Regularly audit code, logs, and configuration files for accidental key exposure.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Ceph Communication (if not properly encrypted):](./attack_tree_paths/3__man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_ceph_communication__if_not_properly_encrypted_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Intercepting network traffic between application clients and Ceph cluster if communication is not encrypted (e.g., using tools like Wireshark, Ettercap).
    *   Performing ARP spoofing or DNS spoofing to redirect traffic through attacker-controlled network segments.
    *   Exploiting weak or outdated encryption protocols if TLS/SSL is used but misconfigured.
*   **Impact:** MITM attacks can allow attackers to eavesdrop on sensitive data in transit (data confidentiality breach), modify data being transmitted (data integrity breach), or intercept authentication credentials.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Enforce TLS/SSL encryption for all Ceph communication channels (client-to-cluster, inter-cluster, RGW API).
    *   Use strong cipher suites and up-to-date TLS/SSL protocols.
    *   Implement mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) for enhanced security.
    *   Monitor network traffic for suspicious patterns and anomalies.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Insecure Application-Level Authorization using Ceph Credentials (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/4__insecure_application-level_authorization_using_ceph_credentials__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Using Ceph credentials directly for application-level authorization decisions, instead of implementing separate application-specific roles and permissions.
    *   Granting overly permissive Ceph access to applications, exceeding the necessary level of access.
    *   Failing to properly validate and sanitize user inputs when constructing Ceph access requests, leading to potential authorization bypass.
*   **Impact:** Insecure application-level authorization can allow users to access data or perform actions they are not supposed to, even if Ceph's own authorization mechanisms are correctly configured. This can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or unauthorized operations.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Design application authorization logic independently of Ceph credentials.
    *   Use Ceph credentials solely for authenticating and authorizing the application's access to Ceph, not for user-level permissions within the application.
    *   Implement application-specific roles and permissions.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting Ceph access to applications.
    *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent authorization bypass vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Write Access via Compromised Credentials (from Authentication Bypass branch) (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/5__write_access_via_compromised_credentials__from_authentication_bypass_branch___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   This is a consequence of successful authentication bypass (e.g., through credential stuffing, key leakage). Once authenticated with compromised credentials, attackers can gain write access to Ceph.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized write access allows attackers to inject malicious data, modify existing data, corrupt data, or delete data stored in Ceph. This can lead to data integrity breaches, application malfunction, and data loss.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Prevent authentication bypass through robust authentication and authorization mechanisms (as detailed in previous points).
    *   Implement granular access control within Ceph to limit write access to only necessary users and applications.
    *   Monitor write operations for suspicious activity.
    *   Implement data integrity checks and backups to detect and recover from data corruption or manipulation.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to modify Ceph object metadata (e.g., object attributes, ownership, ACLs if used).
    *   Manipulating metadata to bypass access control checks, gain unauthorized access to objects, or alter object interpretation by applications.
    *   Corrupting metadata to cause data unavailability or service instability.
*   **Impact:** Metadata manipulation can lead to access control bypass, data breaches, data corruption, and service disruption. It can be a subtle but powerful attack vector.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Understand the security implications of Ceph metadata.
    *   Restrict metadata modification permissions to authorized users and services only.
    *   Implement monitoring for unexpected metadata changes.
    *   Regularly audit metadata configurations and permissions.
    *   Ensure metadata integrity through checksums or other mechanisms.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Flooding Ceph services (OSDs, Monitors, MDS, RGW) with a large volume of requests to consume resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth).
    *   Sending computationally expensive requests to overload Ceph services.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in request handling to amplify resource consumption.
*   **Impact:** Resource exhaustion can lead to denial of service (DoS), making Ceph services unavailable to legitimate users and applications. This can disrupt application functionality and business operations.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement rate limiting and request filtering to control the volume of incoming requests.
    *   Implement resource monitoring and alerting to detect resource exhaustion conditions.
    *   Perform capacity planning to ensure sufficient resources for expected workloads and potential attack scenarios.
    *   Use caching mechanisms to reduce load on Ceph services.
    *   Implement DDoS mitigation techniques (e.g., network firewalls, intrusion prevention systems).

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Network-Level Attacks Targeting Ceph Cluster (e.g., network flooding, disrupting inter-cluster communication) (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/8__network-level_attacks_targeting_ceph_cluster__e_g___network_flooding__disrupting_inter-cluster_co_24747793.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Network flooding attacks (e.g., SYN flood, UDP flood) targeting Ceph cluster network infrastructure.
    *   Disrupting inter-cluster communication by targeting network segments or devices used for Ceph replication and data distribution.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in network protocols or devices to disrupt network connectivity.
*   **Impact:** Network-level attacks can disrupt Ceph cluster communication, leading to data unavailability, service degradation, and potential cluster instability.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement network security best practices (firewalls, network segmentation, intrusion detection/prevention systems).
    *   Use DDoS mitigation services to protect against network flooding attacks.
    *   Harden network infrastructure and devices.
    *   Monitor network traffic for suspicious patterns and anomalies.
    *   Ensure network redundancy and resilience to withstand network disruptions.

## Attack Tree Path: [9. Outdated Ceph Version with Known Vulnerabilities (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/9__outdated_ceph_version_with_known_vulnerabilities__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Running an outdated version of Ceph software that contains publicly known security vulnerabilities (CVEs).
    *   Attackers exploiting these known vulnerabilities to compromise Ceph services (RADOS, RGW, MDS, Monitors, OSDs).
    *   Using readily available exploit code or tools to target these vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities can lead to complete compromise of Ceph infrastructure, including authentication bypass, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, and cluster takeover.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Maintain a regular Ceph update schedule.
    *   Subscribe to Ceph security advisories and mailing lists.
    *   Promptly apply security patches and updates to address known vulnerabilities.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Accidentally or intentionally exposing Ceph management interfaces (e.g., Ceph Dashboard, Ceph Manager API) to the public internet without proper authentication or access control.
    *   Attackers accessing these exposed interfaces to gain administrative control over the Ceph cluster.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in management interfaces themselves.
*   **Impact:** Exposed management interfaces provide a direct pathway for attackers to gain full control over the Ceph cluster, allowing them to manipulate data, disrupt services, and potentially compromise the underlying infrastructure.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Never expose Ceph management interfaces directly to the public internet.
    *   Restrict access to management interfaces to trusted networks only (e.g., internal management network, VPN).
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for management interfaces.
    *   Regularly audit network configurations to ensure management interfaces are not inadvertently exposed.

## Attack Tree Path: [11. Insecure Network Configuration (e.g., unencrypted communication, open ports) (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/11__insecure_network_configuration__e_g___unencrypted_communication__open_ports___critical_node_&_hi_32053f0a.md)
