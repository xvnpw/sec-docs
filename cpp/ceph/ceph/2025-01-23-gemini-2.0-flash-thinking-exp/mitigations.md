# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ceph/ceph

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Cephx Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/implement_cephx_authentication.md)

### Description:

*   **Step 1: Enable Cephx:** Ensure Cephx authentication is enabled cluster-wide in the `ceph.conf` configuration file. Set `auth_cluster_required = cephx`, `auth_service_required = cephx`, and `auth_client_required = cephx`.
*   **Step 2: Generate and Distribute Keys:** Generate Cephx keys for all users and applications that need to access the Ceph cluster using `ceph auth get-or-create-key` command. Securely distribute these keys to authorized users and applications.
*   **Step 3: Configure Clients:** Configure client applications to use Cephx authentication by providing the user ID and secret key when connecting to the Ceph cluster. Ensure client libraries are configured to use authentication.
*   **Step 4: Regular Key Rotation:** Implement a policy for regular rotation of Cephx keys. Automate key rotation processes where possible.
*   **Step 5: Secure Key Storage:** Store Cephx keys securely, avoiding hardcoding in application code. Use environment variables, secret management systems, or secure configuration files.

### List of Threats Mitigated:

*   **Unauthorized Access to Data (High Severity):** Mitigates the risk of unauthorized users or applications accessing Ceph data.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Medium Severity):** Prerequisite for secure communication channels (like TLS), mitigating MITM attacks.
*   **Insider Threats (Medium Severity):** Limits damage from insider threats by controlling and auditing access.

### Impact:

*   **Unauthorized Access to Data:** High reduction in risk. Cephx is the primary authentication mechanism.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Medium reduction in risk. Necessary step for enabling further encryption.
*   **Insider Threats:** Medium reduction in risk. Limits access based on roles and users.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Daemon Binding](./mitigation_strategies/secure_daemon_binding.md)

### Description:

*   **Step 1: Configure Daemon Binding:** Configure Ceph daemons (Monitors, OSDs, MDS, RGW) to bind to specific network interfaces in `ceph.conf`. Use options like `public_addr`, `cluster_addr`, `ms_bind_ipv6`, `ms_public_bind_ip`, and `ms_cluster_bind_ip`.
*   **Step 2: Bind to Internal Interfaces:** Bind daemons to internal network interfaces dedicated for Ceph cluster communication, instead of listening on all interfaces (0.0.0.0).
*   **Step 3: Verify Binding Configuration:** Verify daemon binding configuration after changes to ensure daemons are listening on intended interfaces using `netstat` or similar tools on daemon hosts.

### List of Threats Mitigated:

*   **Unnecessary Network Exposure (Medium Severity):** Reduces the attack surface by limiting network interfaces where Ceph services are exposed. Prevents accidental exposure of Ceph services to public networks or less trusted networks.
*   **Unauthorized Access from External Networks (Medium Severity):** Makes it harder for attackers on external networks to directly connect to Ceph daemons if they are not bound to public interfaces.

### Impact:

*   **Unnecessary Network Exposure:** Medium reduction in risk. Limits the attack surface by controlling interface binding.
*   **Unauthorized Access from External Networks:** Medium reduction in risk. Reduces direct accessibility from external networks.
