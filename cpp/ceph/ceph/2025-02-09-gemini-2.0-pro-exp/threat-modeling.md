# Threat Model Analysis for ceph/ceph

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access via CephX Key Compromise](./threats/unauthorized_data_access_via_cephx_key_compromise.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Data Access via CephX Key Compromise

    *   **Description:** An attacker obtains a valid CephX key (e.g., through a compromised server, leaked credentials). The attacker uses this key to directly access the Ceph cluster and read data they are not authorized to see. The scope is determined by the key's capabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Data confidentiality breach.  The attacker can read sensitive data stored in the Ceph cluster.
    *   **Affected Ceph Component:** CephX authentication system (primarily `auth` modules within Monitors and OSDs), client libraries interacting with CephX.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if the key has broad permissions) or High (if the key has limited permissions).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Key Generation and Storage:** Use strong, randomly generated CephX keys. Store keys securely (e.g., secrets management system).
        *   **Key Rotation:** Regularly rotate CephX keys. Automate the process.
        *   **Least Privilege (Capabilities):** Each CephX key should have *only* the minimum necessary capabilities (read, write, execute) for specific pools, namespaces, and objects.
        *   **Client-Side Security:** Secure client machines using CephX keys. Implement strong endpoint security.
        *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor Ceph logs for suspicious authentication attempts. Alert on key compromise indicators.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via OSD Overload](./threats/denial_of_service_via_osd_overload.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via OSD Overload

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests to specific Ceph OSDs, overwhelming their resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network). This makes the OSDs slow or unresponsive, impacting the availability of the Ceph cluster.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service. Legitimate clients cannot access data on the affected OSDs, potentially causing application downtime.
    *   **Affected Ceph Component:** Ceph OSDs (specifically, the `osd` daemon and related modules for handling I/O requests).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting (Ceph-Side):** Use Ceph's throttling mechanisms (e.g., `ms_osd_op_queue_cut_off`, `ms_osd_op_timeout`) to limit operations per OSD. Requires careful tuning.
        *   **Resource Quotas:** Set quotas on Ceph resources (storage capacity, object count) per client/user to prevent resource exhaustion.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Ceph cluster on a dedicated network segment with sufficient bandwidth and QoS.
        *   **Load Balancing:** Ensure client requests are distributed evenly across OSDs (handled by the Ceph client library and CRUSH, but requires correct configuration).
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor OSD performance metrics (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network latency) to detect and respond to overload.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Modification via RGW Vulnerability](./threats/unauthorized_data_modification_via_rgw_vulnerability.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Data Modification via RGW Vulnerability

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Ceph Object Gateway (RGW) (e.g., injection, buffer overflow) to gain unauthorized access to modify or delete objects.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity and confidentiality breach. The attacker can modify or delete data via the RGW interface.
    *   **Affected Ceph Component:** Ceph Object Gateway (RGW) - specifically, the `radosgw` daemon and associated modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Security Updates:** Keep RGW up-to-date with security patches. Subscribe to Ceph security advisories.
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation on all RGW API requests.
        *   **Secure Configuration:** Follow security best practices for configuring RGW (disable unnecessary features, strong authentication, enable HTTPS).
        *   **Least Privilege (RGW Users and Policies):** Create RGW users with minimum permissions. Use S3-style policies to control access.
        *   **Auditing:** Enable RGW auditing to track access and modification attempts.

## Threat: [Monitor Quorum Loss Leading to Cluster Unavailability](./threats/monitor_quorum_loss_leading_to_cluster_unavailability.md)

*   **Threat:** Monitor Quorum Loss Leading to Cluster Unavailability

    *   **Description:** Enough Ceph Monitors (MONs) fail (hardware failures, network partitions, bugs) that the remaining Monitors cannot form a quorum. Without a quorum, the Ceph cluster becomes unavailable.
    *   **Impact:** Complete denial of service. The entire Ceph cluster is unavailable; no data access or modification is possible.
    *   **Affected Ceph Component:** Ceph Monitors (MONs) - specifically, the `mon` daemon and the Paxos-based consensus algorithm.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Sufficient Number of Monitors:** Deploy an odd number of Monitors (at least 3, preferably 5+) for quorum maintenance.
        *   **Monitor Placement:** Distribute Monitors across different physical locations (racks, availability zones) to reduce correlated failures.
        *   **Monitor Health Monitoring:** Implement robust monitoring of Monitor health. Alert on failures or quorum loss.
        *   **Automated Monitor Recovery:** Consider tools/scripts to automatically restart or replace failed Monitors.
        *   **Network Redundancy:** Ensure the network connecting the Monitors is highly available.
        *   **Regular Backups of Monitor Data:** Back up Monitor data (cluster map) regularly for recovery.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Unpatched Ceph Vulnerability (High/Critical Impact)](./threats/exploitation_of_unpatched_ceph_vulnerability__highcritical_impact_.md)

* **Threat:** Exploitation of Unpatched Ceph Vulnerability (High/Critical Impact)

    * **Description:** A new *high or critical* severity vulnerability is discovered in a Ceph component (OSD, MON, RGW, MDS). An attacker exploits this before a patch is applied, leading to significant impact.
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but *high or critical* impact, such as significant data loss, complete cluster unavailability, or complete data breach.
    * **Affected Ceph Component:** Depends on the specific vulnerability; any Ceph component.
    * **Risk Severity:** High or Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to Ceph security advisories; actively monitor for new vulnerability announcements.
        * **Prompt Patching:** Apply security patches *immediately* upon release. Have a well-defined, rapid patching process.
        * **Testing Patches:** Test patches in a non-production environment *quickly* before deploying.
        * **Mitigating Controls:** If a patch isn't immediately available, implement *temporary* mitigating controls (firewall rules, configuration changes) to reduce exploitation risk.
