# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ceph/ceph

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Capability Management (CephX)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_capability_management__cephx_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement and enforce the principle of least privilege for CephX capabilities.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Roles:** Define distinct roles for users and services accessing Ceph (e.g., "RBD-User," "RGW-Admin," "CephFS-ReadOnly").
    2.  **Map Capabilities:** For each role, determine the *minimum* necessary Ceph capabilities. Use specific capabilities like `allow r`, `allow rw`, `allow class-read`, `allow class-write`, `allow x`, and capabilities specific to pools (e.g., `allow rwx pool=rbd`), rather than granting broad `allow *` permissions. Consult the Ceph documentation for the full capability list.
    3.  **Create Keyrings:** Generate CephX keyrings for each role, assigning only the mapped capabilities. Use commands like:
        ```bash
        ceph auth get-or-create client.rbd-user mon 'allow r' osd 'allow class-read object_prefix rbd_data, allow rwx pool=rbd' -o /etc/ceph/ceph.client.rbd-user.keyring
        ```
        (Adjust capabilities to your specific needs).
    4.  **Distribute Keyrings Securely:** Distribute keyrings to the appropriate clients/services. *Ideally*, use a secure key management system (this is a *general* security practice, but the *keyring distribution* itself is Ceph-specific).
    5.  **Regular Review:** At least quarterly, review and audit all assigned capabilities using `ceph auth list`. Revoke or modify capabilities as roles and requirements change.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized access to Ceph objects/data.
    *   **Unauthorized Data Modification (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized changes to Ceph objects/data.
    *   **Unauthorized Data Deletion (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized deletion of Ceph objects/data.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Limits the potential for a compromised user/service to gain broader Ceph access.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access/Modification/Deletion:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Medium).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic keyrings are created during initial Ceph deployment.
    *   Some capabilities are assigned (e.g., `client.admin`).
    *   Keyrings are stored on client nodes in `/etc/ceph/`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal RBAC is not fully implemented.
    *   No regular capability review process.
    *   Capabilities are not consistently minimized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Keyring Management (CephX)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_keyring_management__cephx_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Securely store, distribute, and rotate CephX keys. While *using* a key management system is a general best practice, the *actions* of storing, distributing, and rotating *CephX keys* are Ceph-specific.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Key Storage:** Avoid storing keyrings in plain text on client nodes.  Even without an external KMS, consider encrypting the keyring files themselves.
    2.  **Controlled Distribution:**  Don't distribute keyrings via insecure channels (e.g., unencrypted email). Use `scp` or a similar secure method if a KMS isn't used.
    3.  **Rotation Procedure:**  Establish a procedure for rotating keys:
        *   Generate a new key with `ceph auth get-or-create`.
        *   Distribute the new key to clients.
        *   *After* confirming clients are using the new key, remove the old key using `ceph auth del`.
        *   Update any scripts or configurations that reference the old key.
    4. **Monitor Key Usage:** If possible (often requires a KMS), monitor which keys are being used to access Ceph. This helps detect compromised keys.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Key Compromise (High Severity):** Reduces the impact of a compromised client node.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Makes it harder for attackers to gain access via stolen keyrings.
    *   **Insider Threat (Medium Severity):** Limits the ability of insiders to easily obtain and misuse keys.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Key Compromise/Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Medium).
    *   **Insider Threat:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   None. Keyrings are in plain text on client nodes.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Entire strategy is missing. Secure storage, controlled distribution, and a rotation procedure are needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Proper Placement Groups (PGs) and CRUSH Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/proper_placement_groups__pgs__and_crush_configuration.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Configure PGs and the CRUSH map for data redundancy and fault tolerance *within Ceph*.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Understand Failure Domains:** Identify failure domains (disks, servers, racks, etc.).
    2.  **Choose Replication/Erasure Coding:** Select replication (e.g., 3x) or erasure coding based on your needs. This is a *Ceph-specific* decision.
    3.  **Calculate PG Count:** Use the Ceph PG calculator or formula to determine the *correct* PG count for your pools. This is a *Ceph-specific* calculation.
    4.  **Define CRUSH Rules:** Create CRUSH rules (`ceph osd crush`) that distribute data across failure domains. This is entirely *Ceph-specific*. Example:
        ```bash
        ceph osd crush rule create-replicated replicated_rule default host
        ceph osd crush rule set replicated_rule take default
        ceph osd crush rule set replicated_rule chooseleaf firstn 0 type host
        ceph osd crush rule set replicated_rule emit
        ```
        (This creates a simple rule; you'll likely need more complex rules).
    5.  **Test CRUSH Map:** Use `ceph osd test-crush` to simulate data placement and ensure the map works as intended. This is a *Ceph-specific* test.
    6.  **Monitor PG States:** Regularly monitor PG states (`ceph -s`, `ceph pg dump`) to ensure they are `active+clean`. This is *Ceph-specific* monitoring.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Loss (High Severity):** Ensures data redundancy within the Ceph cluster.
    *   **Data Corruption (High Severity):** Reduces risk from multiple failures.
    *   **Service Interruption (High Severity):** Minimizes downtime due to Ceph component failures.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Loss/Corruption/Service Interruption:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic CRUSH map with 3x replication.
    *   PG count calculated during initial setup.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   CRUSH map doesn't fully account for all failure domains.
    *   No regular CRUSH map review/testing.
    *   No proactive PG state monitoring.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Scrubbing and Deep Scrubbing (OSD Level)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_scrubbing_and_deep_scrubbing__osd_level_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Enable and schedule regular scrubbing and deep scrubbing of Ceph OSDs.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Understand Scrubbing:** Scrubbing checks for inconsistencies between object replicas *within Ceph*. Deep scrubbing is a more thorough check.
    2.  **Configure Scrubbing Schedules:** Use Ceph configuration options (in `ceph.conf` or via `ceph config set`):
        *   `osd_scrub_begin_hour`, `osd_scrub_end_hour`: Control when scrubbing occurs.
        *   `osd_scrub_min_interval`, `osd_scrub_max_interval`: Control frequency.
        *   `osd_deep_scrub_interval`: Control deep scrub frequency.
        *   `osd_scrub_chunk_min`, `osd_scrub_chunk_max`: Tune performance.
    3.  **Monitor Scrubbing:** Monitor using `ceph -s` and `ceph osd dump`. Look for errors. This is *Ceph-specific* monitoring.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Corruption (Medium Severity):** Detects and repairs inconsistencies *within Ceph*.
    *   **Silent Data Corruption (Medium Severity):** Addresses "bit rot" within Ceph's storage.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Corruption/Silent Data Corruption:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Default scrubbing settings are enabled.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No specific scheduling for off-peak hours.
    *   No active scrubbing progress/error monitoring.

## Mitigation Strategy: [MDS Security (CephFS)](./mitigation_strategies/mds_security__cephfs_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure the Ceph Metadata Servers (MDSs).

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Capability Control (Again):**  Ensure MDS clients have only the *minimum* necessary capabilities.  This is a CephX capability issue.
    2.  **MDS Daemons Configuration:** Review `ceph.conf` settings related to MDS daemons:
        *   `mds_cache_memory_limit`:  Control memory usage to prevent MDS overload.
        *   `mds_max_mds`:  Set the maximum number of active MDS daemons.
        *   `mds_standby_for_name`, `mds_standby_for_rank`: Configure standby MDS daemons for failover.
    3. **Monitor MDS Daemons:** Use `ceph -s` and Ceph logs to monitor MDS health and performance. This is *Ceph-specific* monitoring.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **CephFS Unavailability (High Severity):** Prevents MDS overload or failure.
    *   **Unauthorized CephFS Access (High Severity):**  If MDS is compromised, file system access is compromised.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **CephFS Unavailability/Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Medium).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
        * Basic MDS configuration.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No specific tuning of MDS parameters.
    *   No proactive MDS performance monitoring.

## Mitigation Strategy: [RBD Image Permissions (RBD)](./mitigation_strategies/rbd_image_permissions__rbd_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Use Ceph's RBD image features to restrict access and capabilities.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Use `rbd feature disable <image_name> <feature_name>` to disable features on RBD images that are not required.  This reduces the attack surface.  Common features to consider disabling if not used:
        *   `exclusive-lock`
        *   `object-map`
        *   `fast-diff`
        *   `deep-flatten`
        *   `journaling`
    2.  **Capability Control (Again):** Ensure RBD clients have only the minimum necessary capabilities (e.g., `allow r`, `allow rw`, specific pool permissions).
    3. **Monitor Image Usage:** Use `rbd status <image_name>` to monitor image usage and identify any unexpected activity.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized RBD Image Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized access to RBD images.
    *   **RBD Image Feature Exploitation (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of vulnerabilities in specific RBD features.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access/Feature Exploitation:** Risk reduced (High/Medium to Low/Medium).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No specific feature disabling.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Review and disable unnecessary RBD features on all images.

## Mitigation Strategy: [RGW S3/Swift Policies (RGW)](./mitigation_strategies/rgw_s3swift_policies__rgw_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement least-privilege S3/Swift policies for RGW users and buckets.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create Fine-Grained Policies:**  Instead of granting broad permissions (e.g., `s3:*`), create policies that grant access only to specific buckets and actions (e.g., `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`, `s3:ListBucket`). Use condition keys to further restrict access (e.g., based on IP address, user agent).
    2.  **Use IAM Roles (if applicable):** If integrating with AWS IAM, use IAM roles to manage RGW credentials and permissions.
    3.  **Regularly Review Policies:**  Periodically review and update RGW policies to ensure they remain aligned with security requirements.
    4.  **Use `radosgw-admin` commands:** Use the `radosgw-admin` command-line tool to manage users, buckets, and policies.  Example:
        ```bash
        radosgw-admin user create --uid="user1" --display-name="User One"
        radosgw-admin bucket create --bucket="mybucket" --uid="user1"
        # Create a policy (this is a simplified example)
        cat > policy.json << EOF
        {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
            {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Principal": {"AWS": ["arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/user1"]},
              "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
              "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*"]
            }
          ]
        }
        EOF
        radosgw-admin user modify --uid="user1" --policy=policy.json
        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized RGW Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized access to objects stored via RGW.
    *   **Data Leakage (High Severity):**  Limits the potential for data to be exposed through misconfigured policies.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access/Data Leakage:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic RGW users and buckets are created.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No fine-grained S3/Swift policies are implemented.
    *   No regular policy review process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitor Quorum (Ceph Monitors)](./mitigation_strategies/monitor_quorum__ceph_monitors_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Maintain a healthy monitor quorum.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Odd Number of Monitors:** Deploy an *odd* number of monitor nodes (at least 3) to ensure a majority can always be reached.
    2.  **Monitor `ceph -s`:**  Regularly check the output of `ceph -s` (or `ceph health detail`) to ensure the monitors are in quorum (`quorum_status: quorum`).
    3.  **Monitor Logs:** Check the Ceph monitor logs for any errors or warnings related to quorum.
    4.  **Address Quorum Issues Promptly:** If quorum is lost, investigate and resolve the issue immediately. This may involve restarting monitor daemons, fixing network connectivity, or replacing failed monitors.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Ceph Cluster Unavailability (High Severity):** Prevents split-brain scenarios and ensures the cluster remains operational.
    *   **Data Inconsistency (High Severity):**  Loss of quorum can lead to data inconsistencies.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unavailability/Data Inconsistency:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Three monitor nodes are deployed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No proactive monitoring of monitor quorum status.
    *   No documented procedure for handling quorum loss.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Ceph Configuration Auditing (`ceph.conf`)](./mitigation_strategies/ceph_configuration_auditing___ceph_conf__.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly audit the `ceph.conf` file and related configuration settings.

* **Description:**
    1. **Establish a Baseline:** Create a known-good, secure `ceph.conf` configuration.
    2. **Regular Audits:** At least quarterly, compare the current `ceph.conf` (and any overrides) to the baseline. Use `ceph config dump` to get a complete view of the running configuration.
    3. **Check for Security-Relevant Settings:** Pay close attention to settings related to:
        * Authentication (`auth_cluster_required`, `auth_service_required`, `auth_client_required`)
        * Encryption (`ms_client_mode`, `ms_cluster_mode`, `ms_service_mode`)
        * Network settings (ports, interfaces)
        * OSD, MDS, and RGW settings (as discussed in previous sections)
    4. **Document Changes:** Track any changes made to the configuration and the reasons for those changes.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Misconfiguration (High Severity):** Detects insecure or unintended configuration changes.
    * **Unauthorized Configuration Changes (Medium Severity):** Helps identify unauthorized modifications to the Ceph configuration.

* **Impact:**
    * **Misconfiguration/Unauthorized Changes:** Risk reduced (High/Medium to Medium/Low).

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * None.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * Establish a baseline configuration.
    * Implement a regular audit process.
    * Document configuration changes.
