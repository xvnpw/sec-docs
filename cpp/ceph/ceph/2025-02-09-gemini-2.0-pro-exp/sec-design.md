Okay, let's create a design document for the Ceph project, focusing on aspects relevant to threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Ceph is a distributed storage system designed to provide excellent performance, reliability, and scalability. It's used in a variety of contexts, from cloud platforms (like OpenStack) to enterprise storage solutions. Given its nature, the business priorities and goals revolve around data integrity, availability, and performance. The project is mature and widely adopted, suggesting a lower risk appetite than a brand-new project.

Business Priorities:

*   Data Durability and Availability: Ensuring data is not lost and remains accessible even in the face of hardware failures.
*   Scalability: Allowing users to easily expand storage capacity as needed.
*   Performance: Providing fast and efficient access to data.
*   Cost-Effectiveness: Offering a storage solution that is competitive in terms of cost per gigabyte.
*   Open Source Community: Maintaining a healthy and active open-source community.
*   Integration: Seamlessly integrating with other systems and platforms.

Business Risks:

*   Data Loss: The most critical risk is the permanent loss of user data.
*   Data Corruption: Data becoming unusable due to software bugs or hardware issues.
*   Service Unavailability: Users being unable to access their data.
*   Performance Degradation: Slow data access impacting user applications.
*   Security Breaches: Unauthorized access to or modification of data.
*   Supply Chain Attacks: Compromise of the Ceph software supply chain.
*   Lack of Adoption: Failure to attract and retain users and contributors.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Ceph incorporates several security controls, and given its widespread use, likely has a number of accepted risks related to legacy deployments and backward compatibility.

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Authentication: Ceph uses `cephx`, a protocol similar to Kerberos, to authenticate clients and daemons. This is described in the Ceph documentation and codebase.
*   security control: Authorization: Ceph provides access control mechanisms to restrict access to specific resources (pools, objects) based on user identity. This is implemented within the Ceph daemons.
*   security control: Encryption (in transit): Ceph supports encryption of data in transit between clients and servers, and between Ceph daemons. This is configurable and implemented using cryptographic libraries.
*   security control: Encryption (at rest): Ceph supports encryption of data at rest. This is configurable and implemented using cryptographic libraries.
*   security control: Auditing: Ceph provides logging capabilities that can be used to track access and changes to data. This is implemented within the Ceph daemons.
*   security control: Network Segmentation: Ceph recommends deploying different components (MONs, OSDs, MDSs) on separate networks or using network segmentation to limit the impact of a compromise. This is a deployment-level control.
*   security control: Regular Security Updates: The Ceph project releases security updates to address vulnerabilities. This is part of the project's release process.
*   security control: Secure Coding Practices: The Ceph project, being a mature open-source project, likely follows secure coding practices, although this is an ongoing effort. This is reflected in code reviews and community contributions.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Legacy Deployments: Some older Ceph deployments might not have all security features enabled or might be running older versions with known vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Complexity: The distributed nature of Ceph introduces complexity, which can make it challenging to configure and manage securely.
*   accepted risk: User Misconfiguration: Users might misconfigure Ceph, leaving it vulnerable to attack.
*   accepted risk: Dependence on Underlying Infrastructure: Ceph relies on the security of the underlying operating system and network infrastructure.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Integrate with centralized identity and access management (IAM) systems (e.g., Active Directory, LDAP) for easier user management and stronger authentication.
*   security control: Implement robust monitoring and alerting for security-related events.
*   security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.
*   security control: Enforce mandatory access control (MAC) using SELinux or AppArmor.
*   security control: Implement a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for improved supply chain security.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   All clients and daemons must authenticate before accessing Ceph resources.
    *   Support for strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication).
    *   Integration with existing identity providers.

*   Authorization:
    *   Fine-grained access control to restrict access to specific resources.
    *   Role-based access control (RBAC).
    *   Regular review of access permissions.

*   Input Validation:
    *   All input from clients and other systems must be validated to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Sanitize data before using it in system calls or database queries.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use strong, well-vetted cryptographic algorithms and libraries.
    *   Secure key management practices.
    *   Regular review of cryptographic configurations.
    *   Support for both encryption in transit and at rest.

## BUILD

Ceph's build process involves multiple steps, from compiling the source code to creating packages and container images. Security controls are crucial throughout this process.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer[("Developer")] -- Pushes Code --> GitHub[("GitHub Repository")]
    GitHub -- Triggers --> CI_Server[("CI Server (Jenkins/GitHub Actions)")]
    CI_Server -- Runs --> Build_Scripts[("Build Scripts")]
    Build_Scripts -- Produce --> Artifacts[("Build Artifacts (Packages, Container Images)")]
    Artifacts -- Stored in --> Artifact_Repository[("Artifact Repository")]

    subgraph CI_Server
        Linters[("Linters")]
        SAST[("SAST Scanners")]
        Tests[("Unit/Integration Tests")]
    end

    Build_Scripts -- Runs --> Linters
    Build_Scripts -- Runs --> SAST
    Build_Scripts -- Runs --> Tests
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers write code and push it to the Ceph GitHub repository.
2.  A Continuous Integration (CI) server (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) is triggered by the code push.
3.  The CI server runs build scripts that perform the following tasks:
    *   Code Compilation: Compiling the Ceph source code into executables.
    *   Static Analysis: Running linters and Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools to identify potential code quality and security issues.
    *   Testing: Running unit and integration tests to verify the functionality of the code.
    *   Package Creation: Creating packages (e.g., DEB, RPM) for various Linux distributions.
    *   Container Image Creation: Building container images (e.g., Docker images) for containerized deployments.
4.  The build artifacts (packages, container images) are stored in an artifact repository.
5. Supply chain security:
    * Use of signed commits and releases.
    * Vulnerability scanning of dependencies.
    * Building from source in a controlled environment.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Data Storage and Retrieval: The core function of Ceph is to store and retrieve data reliably and efficiently.
*   Data Replication and Recovery: Ensuring data is replicated across multiple nodes to prevent data loss and enable recovery from failures.
*   Cluster Management: Maintaining the health and stability of the Ceph cluster.

Data Sensitivity:

*   Ceph can store a wide variety of data, ranging from non-sensitive public data to highly sensitive confidential data. The sensitivity of the data depends on the specific use case and the data stored by the users.
*   Data types could include:
    *   User files (documents, images, videos)
    *   Virtual machine images
    *   Database backups
    *   Application data
*   Data sensitivity levels:
    *   Public: Data that can be freely shared with anyone.
    *   Internal: Data that is only accessible to authorized users within an organization.
    *   Confidential: Data that is highly sensitive and requires strict access controls.
    *   Restricted: Data that is subject to regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
