## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Ceph Monitors (MON)](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_ceph_monitors__mon_.md)

*   **{1. Compromise Ceph Monitors (MON)}:**
    *   **Description:** This is the primary critical node. Ceph Monitors (MONs) are the central control point of a Ceph cluster. They maintain the cluster map, manage authentication, and coordinate cluster operations. Compromising a quorum (usually a majority) of MONs grants an attacker near-total control over the Ceph cluster, allowing them to manipulate data, disrupt services, or steal information.
    *   **Criticality:**  Compromise of the MONs leads to a complete cluster compromise.
    *   **Mitigation Focus:** Strong authentication, network segmentation, intrusion detection, and *especially* rapid patching of MON vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit MON CVEs](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit_mon_cves.md)

*   **1.1 Exploit MON CVEs:**
    *   **Description:** This attack vector involves leveraging publicly known and documented vulnerabilities (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures - CVEs) in the Ceph Monitor software. Attackers can use publicly available exploit code or develop their own based on the CVE details.
    *   **High-Risk Rationale:** This is a high-risk path because CVEs are publicly known, making them easier for attackers to find and exploit. The impact is very high due to the criticality of the MONs.
    *   **Mitigation Focus:**  Rigorous and timely patching of Ceph MON software is the *primary* defense. Vulnerability scanning should be performed regularly.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Known MON Bugs](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_known_mon_bugs.md)

*   **1.1.1 Known MON Bugs:**
    *   **Description:** This is the specific execution of exploiting a known MON bug (CVE). The attacker uses a specific exploit targeting a known vulnerability to gain unauthorized access or control over a MON.
    *   **Criticality:** This node represents the successful exploitation of a known vulnerability, leading directly to the compromise of a critical component.
    *   **Mitigation Focus:**
        *   **Patching:** Immediate application of security patches released by the Ceph project.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regular scanning to identify systems vulnerable to known CVEs.
        *   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention:** Configure IDS/IPS to detect and potentially block known exploit attempts.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** If Ceph management interfaces are exposed through a web application, a WAF can help filter malicious requests.
        *   **Configuration Hardening:** Ensure the MONs are configured securely, following Ceph's best practice guidelines, to minimize the attack surface.
        *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement robust monitoring and alerting to detect any suspicious activity related to MON processes and network connections.
