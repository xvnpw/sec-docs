*   **Threat:** Weak or Shared Ceph Credentials
    *   **Description:** An attacker could obtain weak or default Ceph authentication keys (rados keys) used by the application through various means (e.g., exploiting application vulnerabilities, accessing insecure configuration files, social engineering). If keys are shared between multiple applications, compromising one grants access to all.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Ceph data, potential for data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. If the compromised key has broad permissions, the impact could be significant.
    *   **Affected Component:** CephX authentication, librados client interface.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Generate strong, unique authentication keys for each application accessing Ceph.
        *   Securely store and manage these keys, avoiding hardcoding them in the application.
        *   Implement key rotation policies to periodically change the authentication keys.
        *   Utilize secrets management systems to securely store and retrieve Ceph credentials.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Key Distribution
    *   **Description:** An attacker could intercept or gain access to Ceph authentication keys during the distribution process if insecure methods are used (e.g., transmitting keys in plain text, storing them in easily accessible configuration files without proper encryption).
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of Ceph credentials, leading to unauthorized access to data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Key management and distribution mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize secure methods for key distribution, such as TLS/SSL encryption for transmission.
        *   Employ secrets management systems to securely provision keys to applications.
        *   Avoid storing keys in plain text configuration files or environment variables.

*   **Threat:** Data at Rest Encryption Not Enabled or Improperly Configured
    *   **Description:** If Ceph's encryption at rest feature for OSDs is not enabled or is misconfigured, an attacker who gains physical access to the storage hardware (e.g., through a data center breach or compromised hardware) can directly access the raw data stored on the disks.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data stored within Ceph.
    *   **Affected Component:** Ceph OSD (Object Storage Device), dm-crypt (or similar encryption mechanism).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable and properly configure Ceph's encryption at rest feature for all OSDs.
        *   Ensure strong encryption keys are used and managed securely.
        *   Implement proper physical security measures for the Ceph storage infrastructure.

*   **Threat:** Compromise of Ceph Monitor (MON) Nodes
    *   **Description:** An attacker who compromises a Ceph monitor node could gain control over the cluster's configuration, potentially disrupting the entire storage system. This could involve manipulating cluster maps, authentication settings, or other critical parameters.
    *   **Impact:** Complete loss of access to data, data corruption, or the ability to inject malicious configurations affecting the entire cluster.
    *   **Affected Component:** ceph-mon daemon, cluster configuration database (e.g., LevelDB).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Harden Ceph monitor nodes by minimizing installed software and disabling unnecessary services.
        *   Implement strong access controls and multi-factor authentication for accessing monitor nodes.
        *   Regularly patch and update the operating system and Ceph software on monitor nodes.
        *   Monitor monitor node activity for suspicious behavior.

*   **Threat:** Compromise of Ceph OSD (Object Storage Device) Nodes
    *   **Description:** If an OSD node is compromised, an attacker could potentially access the data stored on that specific OSD. They might also attempt to disrupt the OSD's operation, leading to data unavailability or corruption.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of data stored on the compromised OSD, potential for data corruption or deletion affecting the data stored on that specific node.
    *   **Affected Component:** ceph-osd daemon, underlying storage devices.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Harden OSD nodes.
        *   Implement full disk encryption on OSDs to protect data at rest even if the node is compromised.
        *   Securely erase decommissioned OSDs to prevent data leakage.
        *   Monitor OSD node activity for suspicious behavior.

*   **Threat:** Compromise of Ceph Metadata Server (MDS) Nodes (for CephFS)
    *   **Description:** If using CephFS, a compromised MDS node could allow an attacker to manipulate file system metadata, potentially leading to unauthorized access to files, data corruption, or denial of service for the file system.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to files, data corruption within the file system, or denial of service for CephFS.
    *   **Affected Component:** ceph-mds daemon, metadata storage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Harden MDS nodes.
        *   Implement strong access controls for accessing MDS nodes.
        *   Regularly patch and update the operating system and Ceph software on MDS nodes.
        *   Monitor MDS node activity for suspicious behavior.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Ceph Ports to Untrusted Networks
    *   **Description:** If Ceph ports (e.g., monitor ports, OSD ports) are exposed to untrusted networks, attackers could attempt to directly interact with Ceph services, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities or launching denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access attempts, potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in Ceph services, denial of service attacks against the Ceph cluster.
    *   **Affected Component:** Network services provided by Ceph daemons (ceph-mon, ceph-osd, ceph-mds).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict network access to Ceph ports using firewalls and network segmentation.
        *   Only allow necessary communication from trusted networks.

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion Attacks on Ceph Monitors
    *   **Description:** An attacker could flood the Ceph monitors with requests or invalid data, potentially overwhelming them and causing the cluster to become unavailable or unstable.
    *   **Impact:** Inability to access data stored in Ceph, disruption of application functionality relying on Ceph.
    *   **Affected Component:** ceph-mon daemon.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting and traffic filtering on network devices protecting the Ceph cluster.
        *   Configure appropriate resource limits for monitor processes.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Management Interfaces
    *   **Description:** If Ceph management interfaces (e.g., Ceph Dashboard, command-line tools accessed remotely) are not properly secured, attackers could gain unauthorized access to manage the cluster.
    *   **Impact:** Ability to reconfigure the cluster, potentially leading to data loss, denial of service, or unauthorized access.
    *   **Affected Component:** Ceph Dashboard, Ceph CLI tools, management APIs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure access to Ceph management interfaces with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        *   Enforce HTTPS for web-based management interfaces.
        *   Restrict access to management interfaces to authorized personnel only.
        *   Consider using VPNs or bastion hosts for remote access to management interfaces.
