# Attack Surface Analysis for ceph/ceph

## Attack Surface: [Improper CephX Key Management](./attack_surfaces/improper_cephx_key_management.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Improper CephX Key Management
    *   **Description:** CephX keys are used for authentication and authorization within the Ceph cluster. Improper management can lead to unauthorized access.
    *   **How Ceph Contributes:** Ceph's security model heavily relies on the secure generation, distribution, and storage of these keys. Weaknesses in these processes directly expose the cluster.
    *   **Example:** A developer hardcodes a CephX key in the application code, which is then exposed in a public repository.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Ceph cluster, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement secure key generation practices, using strong, randomly generated keys.
        *   Avoid embedding keys directly in application code. Use secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets).
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege when granting capabilities to CephX users.
        *   Regularly rotate CephX keys.
        *   Securely store and manage CephX keys, limiting access to authorized personnel and systems.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in RADOS Gateway (RGW)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_rados_gateway__rgw_.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in RADOS Gateway (RGW)
    *   **Description:** RGW provides object storage functionality via S3 and Swift compatible APIs. Vulnerabilities in RGW can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or disrupt service.
    *   **How Ceph Contributes:** RGW is a core component of Ceph for object storage, and its security directly impacts the security of the data stored within it.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in the RGW API handling to bypass authentication and access sensitive data stored in buckets.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification or deletion, denial of service against the object storage service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Ceph cluster and RGW components up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of RGW to filter malicious traffic and protect against common web attacks.
        *   Follow security best practices for configuring RGW, including secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        *   Regularly audit RGW configurations and access policies.
        *   Disable unnecessary RGW features or APIs to reduce the attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Ceph Monitor (MON) Ports](./attack_surfaces/exposed_ceph_monitor__mon__ports.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Exposed Ceph Monitor (MON) Ports
    *   **Description:** If Ceph monitor ports are exposed to the public internet or untrusted networks, attackers can attempt to connect and potentially exploit vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Ceph Contributes:** Monitors are critical for cluster consensus and management. Their accessibility directly impacts the availability and integrity of the entire cluster.
    *   **Example:** An attacker scans the internet and finds an exposed Ceph monitor port, then attempts to exploit a known vulnerability in the monitor service to gain control of the cluster.
    *   **Impact:** Complete cluster compromise, denial of service, data loss, unauthorized access to all data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly limit access to Ceph monitor ports to only authorized systems and networks. Use firewalls to restrict access.
        *   Avoid exposing Ceph monitor ports directly to the public internet.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the monitor service.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Ceph OSD Daemons](./attack_surfaces/compromised_ceph_osd_daemons.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Compromised Ceph OSD Daemons
    *   **Description:** If an Object Storage Daemon (OSD) is compromised, attackers can gain direct access to the data stored on that OSD.
    *   **How Ceph Contributes:** OSDs are the components responsible for storing the actual data. Their security is paramount for data confidentiality and integrity.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the operating system or a dependency on a host running an OSD, gaining root access and the ability to read or modify data on the underlying storage.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, data loss, denial of service affecting the storage availability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Harden the operating systems hosting OSDs, keeping them updated with security patches.
        *   Implement strong access controls and security measures on the OSD host systems.
        *   Use disk encryption to protect data at rest on the OSD storage devices.
        *   Monitor OSD health and security logs for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Input Validation in RGW APIs](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_input_validation_in_rgw_apis.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Insufficient Input Validation in RGW APIs
    *   **Description:** Lack of proper input validation in the RADOS Gateway's S3 or Swift API handlers can lead to various vulnerabilities, such as injection attacks or buffer overflows.
    *   **How Ceph Contributes:** RGW acts as the interface for external access to Ceph's object storage. Weak input validation in this component directly exposes the underlying storage.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious S3 API request with excessively long headers, causing a buffer overflow in RGW and potentially gaining control of the RGW process.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, potential remote code execution on the RGW server, unauthorized access to data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all data received through RGW APIs.
        *   Use secure coding practices to prevent common injection vulnerabilities.
        *   Regularly test RGW APIs for vulnerabilities using security scanning tools and penetration testing.
