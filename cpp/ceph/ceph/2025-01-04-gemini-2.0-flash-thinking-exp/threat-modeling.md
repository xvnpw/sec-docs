# Threat Model Analysis for ceph/ceph

## Threat: [Compromised CephX Keys](./threats/compromised_cephx_keys.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the application's CephX keys. They might obtain these keys through insecure storage within the application, by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's key management, or through social engineering targeting developers or operators. With these keys, the attacker can authenticate to the Ceph cluster as the application.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to all data the application has access to. This could lead to data breaches, data modification, or deletion. The attacker could also potentially disrupt the application's access to storage, causing a denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** librados (authentication mechanism).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement secure storage mechanisms for CephX keys (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, encrypted configuration files).
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege when granting capabilities to keys, limiting access to only necessary resources and operations.
    *   Regularly rotate CephX keys.
    *   Avoid embedding keys directly in application code; use environment variables or secure configuration management.
    *   Monitor access logs for suspicious activity related to key usage.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access via Compromised RGW Credentials](./threats/unauthorized_access_via_compromised_rgw_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker obtains valid access and secret keys for the Ceph RGW (RADOS Gateway), if the application uses it for object storage. This could happen through insecure storage of credentials, phishing, or by exploiting vulnerabilities in systems managing these credentials. The attacker can then impersonate a legitimate user or service.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to objects stored in the RGW. This can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or deletion of objects. The attacker could also upload malicious content or consume storage resources, leading to financial implications or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** RGW (authentication mechanism, S3/Swift API).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication for RGW users.
    *   Securely store and manage RGW access and secret keys. Avoid storing them directly in application code.
    *   Utilize temporary security credentials (STS) where appropriate to limit the lifespan of access.
    *   Implement access control lists (ACLs) or bucket policies to restrict access to specific resources.
    *   Monitor RGW access logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Ceph Daemon Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_ceph_daemon_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits a known vulnerability in a Ceph daemon (e.g., OSD, Monitor, MDS). This could involve sending specially crafted network packets or exploiting weaknesses in the daemon's code.
*   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution on the Ceph node, allowing the attacker to gain control of the daemon and potentially the entire node. This can result in data breaches, data corruption, denial of service, or cluster instability.
*   **Affected Component:** OSD Daemon, Monitor Daemon, MDS Daemon.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the Ceph cluster up-to-date with the latest stable releases and security patches.
    *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and block malicious traffic targeting Ceph nodes.
    *   Harden the operating systems hosting Ceph daemons by disabling unnecessary services and applying security configurations.
    *   Segment the network to isolate the Ceph cluster from other less trusted networks.

## Threat: [Denial of Service against Ceph OSDs](./threats/denial_of_service_against_ceph_osds.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods Ceph OSD (Object Storage Device) daemons with excessive requests, causing them to become overloaded and unresponsive. This could be achieved through malicious write operations, read requests, or by exploiting inefficiencies in how OSDs handle certain types of requests.
*   **Impact:**  Impacts the availability of the stored data. The application may experience timeouts or errors when trying to access data. In severe cases, overloaded OSDs can lead to cluster instability and data unavailability.
*   **Affected Component:** OSD Daemon.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting at the application level or network level to restrict the number of requests to the Ceph cluster.
    *   Ensure sufficient resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, disk I/O) are allocated to OSD nodes to handle expected workloads and potential spikes.
    *   Monitor OSD performance metrics and set up alerts for unusual activity.
    *   Implement quality of service (QoS) mechanisms to prioritize critical traffic.

## Threat: [Monitor Quorum Disruption](./threats/monitor_quorum_disruption.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker targets the Ceph Monitor quorum, attempting to disrupt its functionality. This could involve network attacks to isolate Monitor nodes, exploiting vulnerabilities in the Monitor daemons, or compromising the machines hosting the Monitors.
*   **Impact:** If the Monitor quorum is lost, the Ceph cluster becomes read-only, and no changes to the cluster configuration can be made. This severely impacts the cluster's ability to recover from failures and can lead to data unavailability.
*   **Affected Component:** Monitor Daemon, Monitor Quorum.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Deploy Monitors across different failure domains (e.g., different physical servers, power supplies, network segments).
    *   Secure the network communication between Monitor nodes.
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for any administrative access to the Monitor nodes.
    *   Regularly back up the Monitor store.

## Threat: [Data Corruption due to Malicious Writes](./threats/data_corruption_due_to_malicious_writes.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with write access to the Ceph cluster (either through compromised credentials or by exploiting vulnerabilities) intentionally writes malicious or corrupted data to the storage.
*   **Impact:** Data integrity is compromised. The application may read corrupted data, leading to application errors or incorrect behavior. In severe cases, widespread data corruption can lead to data loss.
*   **Affected Component:** OSD Daemon, RADOS.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization to restrict write access to authorized applications and users only.
    *   Utilize Ceph's data integrity features like checksums and scrubbing to detect and potentially repair data corruption.
    *   Implement versioning or snapshots to allow for rollback to previous versions of data.
    *   Monitor write operations for unusual patterns.
