## Attack Tree Path: [Send Malicious API Requests](./attack_tree_paths/send_malicious_api_requests.md)

Attackers craft specific API requests to exploit known vulnerabilities, such as authentication flaws or injection points, to gain unauthorized access or manipulate data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Upload Malicious Objects](./attack_tree_paths/upload_malicious_objects.md)

Attackers upload specially crafted objects that exploit vulnerabilities in RGW's data processing, potentially leading to code execution on the RGW server or access to sensitive files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Ceph Authentication Keys/Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_ceph_authentication_keyscredentials.md)

Ceph uses keys for authentication. If these keys are compromised, attackers gain full access to the Ceph cluster.

## Attack Tree Path: [Steal Ceph Keys from Application Server](./attack_tree_paths/steal_ceph_keys_from_application_server.md)

Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the application server (e.g., code injection, insecure file permissions) to gain access to stored Ceph authentication keys.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Objects with Insufficient Permissions](./attack_tree_paths/access_objects_with_insufficient_permissions.md)

Attackers exploit overly permissive or incorrectly configured Ceph user capabilities or pool permissions to access data they should not have access to.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Ceph Objects](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_ceph_objects.md)

Before manipulating or exfiltrating data, attackers need unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws (see above)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_flaws__see_above_.md)

Gaining unauthorized access by compromising authentication or exploiting authorization weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in RGW or librados](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_rgw_or_librados.md)

Attackers leverage security flaws in the RGW service or the librados client library to bypass access controls and directly access Ceph objects.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data into Ceph Objects](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_into_ceph_objects.md)

After gaining write access, attackers inject malicious or incorrect data into Ceph objects, potentially corrupting application data or causing malfunctions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exfiltrate Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/exfiltrate_sensitive_data.md)

The goal of many attacks is to steal sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Download Ceph Objects Containing Sensitive Information](./attack_tree_paths/download_ceph_objects_containing_sensitive_information.md)

Once unauthorized access is gained, attackers download Ceph objects that contain sensitive data, leading to a data breach.
