## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Ceph](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_ceph.md)

**Compromise Application Using Ceph:**
* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access to application data, functionality, or the underlying infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Ceph Directly](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ceph_directly.md)

**Exploit Ceph Directly (Entry Point):**
* Attack Vectors:
    * All methods of directly attacking the Ceph cluster itself, bypassing the application layer. This includes authentication bypass, exploiting configuration weaknesses, and leveraging known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Ceph Authentication/Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_ceph_authenticationauthorization.md)

**Bypass Ceph Authentication/Authorization:**
* Attack Vectors:
    * Exploiting weaknesses in Ceph's authentication mechanisms.
    * Circumventing authorization checks to access resources without proper permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Obtain Ceph Access Keys](./attack_tree_paths/obtain_ceph_access_keys.md)

**Obtain Ceph Access Keys:**
* Attack Vectors:
    * Exploiting insecure storage locations on application servers or other related systems.
    * Using credential stuffing or brute-force attacks if Ceph authentication allows.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Ceph Configuration Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ceph_configuration_weaknesses.md)

**Exploit Ceph Configuration Weaknesses:**
* Attack Vectors:
    * Exploiting insecure default configurations (as detailed above).
    * Taking advantage of misconfigured access controls, network settings, or other Ceph parameters.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Insecure Default Configurations](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_insecure_default_configurations.md)

**Leverage Insecure Default Configurations:**
* Attack Vectors:
    * Exploiting default usernames and passwords that have not been changed.
    * Taking advantage of other insecure default settings in Ceph.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Control Misconfigurations](./attack_tree_paths/access_control_misconfigurations.md)

**Access Control Misconfigurations:**
* Attack Vectors:
    * Exploiting overly permissive bucket or pool permissions.
    * Circumventing improperly configured access control lists (ACLs).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Ceph Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_ceph_vulnerabilities.md)

**Exploit Known Ceph Vulnerabilities:**
* Attack Vectors:
    * Leveraging publicly disclosed Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in Ceph.
    * Exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities in Ceph daemons.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Publicly Disclosed Ceph CVEs](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_publicly_disclosed_ceph_cves.md)

**Leverage Publicly Disclosed Ceph CVEs:**
* Attack Vectors:
    * Exploiting known vulnerabilities in Ceph daemons (OSD, Monitor, MDS) for which public exploits may exist.
    * Targeting unpatched Ceph installations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application's Interaction with Ceph](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application's_interaction_with_ceph.md)

**Exploit Application's Interaction with Ceph:**
* Attack Vectors:
    * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's code or logic that arise from its interaction with Ceph. This includes insecure data handling and credential management.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Data Handling by Application](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_data_handling_by_application.md)

**Exploit Insecure Data Handling by Application:**
* Attack Vectors:
    * Injecting malicious data into Ceph due to a lack of input sanitization in the application.
    * Retrieving sensitive data from Ceph and exposing it due to flaws in the application's logic or output handling.

## Attack Tree Path: [Retrieve Sensitive Data from Ceph and Expose it](./attack_tree_paths/retrieve_sensitive_data_from_ceph_and_expose_it.md)

**Retrieve Sensitive Data from Ceph and Expose it:**
* Attack Vectors:
    * Exploiting application logic flaws that unintentionally reveal sensitive data retrieved from Ceph.
    * Circumventing access controls within the application to access data meant to be restricted.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Management of Ceph Credentials by Application](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_management_of_ceph_credentials_by_application.md)

**Exploit Insecure Management of Ceph Credentials by Application:**
* Attack Vectors:
    * Discovering hardcoded credentials within the application code.
    * Accessing credentials stored insecurely in environment variables, configuration files, or other easily accessible locations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Hardcoded Credentials in Application Code](./attack_tree_paths/hardcoded_credentials_in_application_code.md)

**Hardcoded Credentials in Application Code:**
* Attack Vectors:
    * Discovering hardcoded Ceph access keys or other credentials directly within the application's source code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) on Ceph Cluster](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__on_ceph_cluster.md)

**Denial of Service (DoS) on Ceph Cluster:**
* Attack Vectors:
    * Overwhelming Ceph services with a large number of requests, making them unavailable.
    * Exploiting specific Ceph vulnerabilities that can cause services to crash or become unresponsive.
