# Threat Model Analysis for ceph/ceph

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access via Compromised Client Key](./threats/unauthorized_access_via_compromised_client_key.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access via Compromised Client Key
    *   **Description:** An attacker obtains a valid Ceph client key (e.g., through phishing, insider threat, or insecure storage). They can then use this key to authenticate to the Ceph cluster and perform actions authorized by the key's capabilities. This might involve reading, modifying, or deleting data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (confidentiality loss), data manipulation (integrity loss), data deletion (availability loss).
    *   **Affected Component:** Ceph Authentication System (`cephx`), librados clients, RGW clients, RBD clients, CephFS clients.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely store and manage Ceph client keys.
        *   Implement strong access controls on key storage.
        *   Regularly rotate client keys.
        *   Monitor for unusual activity associated with specific client keys.
        *   Consider using more granular capabilities to limit the impact of a compromised key.

## Threat: [Monitor Quorum Compromise](./threats/monitor_quorum_compromise.md)

*   **Threat:** Monitor Quorum Compromise
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises a sufficient number of Ceph Monitor (MON) daemons to gain control of the monitor quorum. This allows them to manipulate the cluster map, potentially redirecting I/O, causing data corruption, or denying service.
    *   **Impact:** Complete cluster compromise, data corruption, data loss, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Ceph Monitor (MON) daemons, Paxos consensus algorithm.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Harden the operating systems hosting MON daemons.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing MON daemons.
        *   Isolate the network used for MON communication.
        *   Regularly audit the MON quorum membership.
        *   Implement intrusion detection systems to monitor for suspicious activity on MON nodes.

## Threat: [Object Storage Daemon (OSD) Compromise](./threats/object_storage_daemon__osd__compromise.md)

*   **Threat:** Object Storage Daemon (OSD) Compromise
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains root access to a Ceph OSD daemon. This allows them to directly access the data stored on the underlying storage device, potentially bypassing Ceph's access controls. They could steal data, modify it, or destroy it.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, data loss, denial of service (by taking the OSD offline).
    *   **Affected Component:** Ceph Object Storage Daemon (OSD), underlying storage devices.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Harden the operating systems hosting OSD daemons.
        *   Implement strong access controls on OSD nodes.
        *   Encrypt data at rest on the OSDs.
        *   Regularly patch and update OSD software.
        *   Implement intrusion detection systems to monitor for suspicious activity on OSD nodes.

## Threat: [RADOS Gateway (RGW) Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/rados_gateway__rgw__vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:** RADOS Gateway (RGW) Vulnerability Exploitation
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the RADOS Gateway (RGW) service. This could allow them to bypass authentication, gain unauthorized access to buckets and objects, or execute arbitrary code on the RGW server.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, potential compromise of the RGW server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Ceph RADOS Gateway (RGW) service, its APIs (S3, Swift).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the RGW software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom RGW extensions.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for RGW access.
        *   Regularly audit RGW configurations and access policies.
        *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect the RGW endpoint.

## Threat: [Metadata Server (MDS) Compromise (for CephFS)](./threats/metadata_server__mds__compromise__for_cephfs_.md)

*   **Threat:** Metadata Server (MDS) Compromise (for CephFS)
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises a Metadata Server (MDS) daemon in a CephFS deployment. This allows them to manipulate file system metadata, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data corruption, or denial of service for the file system.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (for CephFS), data manipulation (for CephFS), denial of service (for CephFS).
    *   **Affected Component:** Ceph Metadata Server (MDS) daemon.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Harden the operating systems hosting MDS daemons.
        *   Implement strong access controls on MDS nodes.
        *   Regularly patch and update MDS software.
        *   Implement intrusion detection systems to monitor for suspicious activity on MDS nodes.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Ceph Manager Modules](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_ceph_manager_modules.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Ceph Manager Modules
    *   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in Ceph Manager (ceph-mgr) modules could allow attackers to gain control over the cluster management interface and potentially the entire cluster.
    *   **Impact:** Complete cluster compromise, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Ceph Manager (ceph-mgr) and its modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep ceph-mgr and its modules up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Restrict access to the ceph-mgr interface.
        *   Regularly audit the installed ceph-mgr modules.
        *   Disable unnecessary ceph-mgr modules.
