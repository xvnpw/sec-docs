## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Leverage Insecure Default Configurations (Ceph)

This document provides a deep analysis of the attack tree path "Leverage Insecure Default Configurations" within the context of a Ceph storage cluster. This analysis aims to identify potential vulnerabilities arising from default settings and outline the steps an attacker might take to exploit them.

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the risks associated with utilizing default configurations in a Ceph deployment. This includes:

* **Identifying specific default configurations** within Ceph that present security vulnerabilities.
* **Understanding the potential impact** of exploiting these default configurations.
* **Outlining the steps an attacker might take** to leverage these vulnerabilities.
* **Providing actionable recommendations** for mitigating these risks and securing the Ceph cluster.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack tree path "Leverage Insecure Default Configurations" and its sub-nodes:

* **Exploiting default usernames and passwords that have not been changed.**

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Leverage Insecure Default Configurations

#### 4.1. Introduction

The "Leverage Insecure Default Configurations" attack path highlights a common and often overlooked vulnerability in many systems, including Ceph. Attackers often target systems that have not been properly secured after installation, relying on the persistence of default settings. This path is particularly attractive due to its simplicity and the high likelihood of success if administrators fail to implement proper security hardening.

#### 4.2. Attack Vector: Exploiting default usernames and passwords that have not been changed.

**Detailed Analysis:**

Many software applications and services, including components within Ceph, may ship with default usernames and passwords for initial access or administrative purposes. If these credentials are not changed immediately after deployment, they become widely known and easily exploitable.

**Ceph Specific Considerations:**

* **RADOS Gateway (RGW):**  The RGW often has a default administrative user (e.g., `s3admin`) with a default password. If left unchanged, an attacker can gain full control over the object storage service, including accessing, modifying, and deleting data, as well as creating new users and buckets.
* **Initial Setup Scripts/Processes:**  While Ceph itself doesn't have a single global default password for core components like MONs or OSDs, initial deployment tools or scripts might create temporary users or use default keys that need to be rotated.
* **Potential for Default Keys:** In some scenarios, default keys might be generated during the initial setup process if explicit key generation and distribution are not properly managed.

**Attack Scenario:**

1. **Reconnaissance:** The attacker identifies a publicly accessible Ceph RGW endpoint.
2. **Credential Guessing/Brute-forcing:** The attacker attempts to log in using known default credentials for the RGW admin user (e.g., `s3admin`/`password`).
3. **Successful Authentication:** If the default credentials have not been changed, the attacker gains administrative access to the RGW.
4. **Exploitation:** The attacker can then perform various malicious actions, such as:
    * **Data Breach:** Accessing and downloading sensitive data stored in buckets.
    * **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting existing data.
    * **Denial of Service:**  Deleting critical buckets or overloading the system with requests.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** Creating new users with elevated privileges to maintain persistent access.

**Impact:**

* **Data Breach and Loss:**  Exposure and potential loss of sensitive data stored in the Ceph cluster.
* **Reputational Damage:**  Loss of trust from users and stakeholders due to the security breach.
* **Financial Loss:**  Costs associated with incident response, data recovery, and potential legal repercussions.
* **Service Disruption:**  Inability for legitimate users to access or utilize the storage service.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Mandatory Password Change:**  Implement a policy requiring immediate password changes for all default accounts upon initial deployment.
* **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce the use of strong, unique passwords that meet complexity requirements.
* **Secure Credential Management:** Utilize secure methods for storing and managing credentials, avoiding hardcoding or storing them in plain text.
* **Regular Security Audits:**  Periodically review user accounts and permissions to identify and remediate any lingering default credentials.
* **Automation and Configuration Management:**  Use automation tools to enforce secure configurations and prevent the accidental use of default credentials.

#### 4.3. Attack Vector: Taking advantage of other insecure default settings in Ceph.

**Detailed Analysis:**

Beyond default usernames and passwords, other default configurations in Ceph can introduce security vulnerabilities if left unchanged. These settings might relate to network access, authentication mechanisms, service configurations, and logging.

**Ceph Specific Considerations:**

* **Open Ports and Services:** Default configurations might expose certain Ceph services on network interfaces without proper access controls (e.g., default ports for MONs, OSDs, RGW). This can allow unauthorized access or reconnaissance.
* **Unencrypted Communication:**  Default settings might not enforce encryption for inter-component communication or client access, potentially exposing sensitive data in transit.
* **Permissive Firewall Rules:**  Default firewall configurations on Ceph nodes might be overly permissive, allowing unnecessary inbound or outbound connections.
* **Disabled Security Features:**  Some security features might be disabled by default and require manual enabling (e.g., certain authentication methods, auditing features).
* **Default Logging Levels:**  Insufficient default logging levels might hinder incident response and forensic analysis.
* **Insecure Default Bucket Policies (RGW):**  Default bucket policies might be overly permissive, allowing anonymous or unauthorized access to stored objects.
* **Default Authentication Methods:**  Reliance on less secure default authentication methods (if any exist) can be a vulnerability.

**Attack Scenario Examples:**

* **Exploiting Open Ports:** An attacker scans the network and identifies open default ports for Ceph MONs. If no proper authentication or authorization is in place, they might attempt to connect and potentially gain information about the cluster or even attempt to manipulate its state.
* **Man-in-the-Middle Attack (Unencrypted Communication):** If communication between Ceph components or between clients and the RGW is not encrypted by default, an attacker on the network could intercept and potentially decrypt sensitive data being transmitted.
* **Unauthorized Access to Buckets (Permissive Bucket Policies):** An attacker discovers a Ceph RGW bucket with a default policy allowing public read access. They can then access and download the contents of the bucket without authentication.

**Impact:**

* **Unauthorized Access:** Gaining access to sensitive data or control over Ceph components.
* **Data Interception and Tampering:**  Compromising the confidentiality and integrity of data in transit.
* **Denial of Service:**  Exploiting open services or vulnerabilities to disrupt the availability of the Ceph cluster.
* **Lateral Movement:**  Using compromised Ceph nodes as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the network.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Failure to meet security compliance requirements due to insecure default configurations.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Harden Network Configurations:**
    * **Implement Firewalls:** Configure firewalls on Ceph nodes to restrict network access to only necessary ports and services.
    * **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Ceph cluster on a dedicated network segment.
    * **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Disable any Ceph services or features that are not required for the specific deployment.
* **Enable Encryption:**
    * **Encrypt In-Transit Data:** Configure Ceph to enforce encryption for all inter-component communication (e.g., using `cephx` authentication with secure keys).
    * **Encrypt Data at Rest:**  Consider enabling encryption for data stored on OSDs.
    * **Enforce HTTPS for RGW:**  Ensure the RADOS Gateway is configured to use HTTPS with valid TLS certificates.
* **Review and Harden Default Configurations:**
    * **Consult Ceph Documentation:**  Refer to the official Ceph documentation for security best practices and recommended configurations.
    * **Utilize Configuration Management Tools:**  Employ tools like Ansible or SaltStack to enforce secure configurations consistently across the cluster.
    * **Regularly Review Configuration Files:**  Periodically examine Ceph configuration files (e.g., `ceph.conf`) to identify and remediate any insecure default settings.
* **Implement Strong Authentication and Authorization:**
    * **Utilize `cephx` Authentication:**  Ensure `cephx` authentication is enabled and properly configured for all Ceph components.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only the necessary permissions to users and applications accessing the Ceph cluster.
    * **Secure Key Management:**  Implement secure procedures for generating, distributing, and rotating Ceph authentication keys.
* **Enable and Configure Auditing:**  Enable Ceph's auditing features to track user actions and system events for security monitoring and incident response.
* **Secure Default Bucket Policies (RGW):**  Implement restrictive default bucket policies and require explicit permission grants for access.

### 5. Conclusion

Leveraging insecure default configurations represents a significant and easily exploitable attack vector against Ceph deployments. By failing to change default credentials and address other insecure default settings, administrators create opportunities for attackers to gain unauthorized access, compromise data, and disrupt services.

A proactive approach to security hardening is crucial. This includes immediately changing default passwords, carefully reviewing and adjusting default configurations, implementing strong authentication and authorization mechanisms, and enforcing encryption. Regular security audits and adherence to security best practices are essential for maintaining a secure Ceph environment and mitigating the risks associated with insecure default configurations.
