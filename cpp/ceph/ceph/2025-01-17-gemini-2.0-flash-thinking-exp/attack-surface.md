# Attack Surface Analysis for ceph/ceph

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Weaknesses](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_weaknesses.md)

**Description:**  Exploiting flaws in how Ceph authenticates and authorizes access to its components and data.

**How Ceph Contributes:** Ceph relies on mechanisms like `cephx` for authentication and capabilities for authorization. Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in these systems directly expose the cluster.

**Example:**  Using default `cephx` keys, misconfigured capabilities granting excessive permissions to clients, or vulnerabilities in the `cephx` protocol itself allowing bypass.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to cluster metadata, data, or the ability to disrupt cluster operations.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong, unique `cephx` keys and rotate them regularly.
*   Carefully define and restrict capabilities based on the principle of least privilege.
*   Regularly audit capability assignments.
*   Keep Ceph versions up-to-date to patch known authentication vulnerabilities.
*   Enforce secure key management practices.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Network Communication](./attack_surfaces/insecure_network_communication.md)

**Description:**  Interception or manipulation of data transmitted between Ceph components or between clients and the cluster.

**How Ceph Contributes:** Ceph components communicate over the network. If this communication is not properly secured, it becomes a target.

**Example:**  Man-in-the-middle attacks intercepting data between OSDs, MONs, or clients. Exposure of sensitive data like authentication secrets or user data in transit.

**Impact:**  Information disclosure, data manipulation, or denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enable encryption for Ceph's internal network traffic (using `ms_bind_msgr2`).
*   Use secure network protocols (e.g., TLS) for client access, especially for the RADOS Gateway.
*   Implement network segmentation to isolate the Ceph cluster.
*   Use firewalls to restrict access to Ceph ports.

## Attack Surface: [RADOS Gateway (RGW) API Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/rados_gateway__rgw__api_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the RADOS Gateway's S3 or Swift compatible APIs.

**How Ceph Contributes:** The RGW exposes object storage functionality through APIs. Flaws in the implementation of these APIs can be exploited.

**Example:**  Exploiting a bug in the RGW's handling of specific API requests to gain unauthorized access to buckets, bypass authentication, or cause a denial of service. SSRF vulnerabilities allowing the RGW to be used to attack internal systems.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, denial of service, or potential compromise of internal systems.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the Ceph version up-to-date to patch known RGW vulnerabilities.
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for API requests.
*   Follow secure coding practices when developing applications interacting with the RGW.
*   Regularly audit RGW configurations and access policies.
*   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of the RGW.

## Attack Surface: [Ceph Component Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/ceph_component_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Exploiting known security vulnerabilities within the Ceph daemons (MON, OSD, MDS, RGW).

**How Ceph Contributes:**  Like any software, Ceph can have security vulnerabilities in its code.

**Example:**  Exploiting a buffer overflow in an OSD daemon to gain remote code execution, or a vulnerability in the monitor allowing unauthorized configuration changes.

**Impact:**  Complete compromise of Ceph components, data loss, denial of service, or privilege escalation on the underlying hosts.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Maintain an up-to-date Ceph installation by applying security patches promptly.
*   Subscribe to Ceph security mailing lists and monitor for announcements.
*   Implement a robust patch management process.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration and Deployment](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_and_deployment.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from misconfigurations or insecure deployment practices of the Ceph cluster.

**How Ceph Contributes:** Ceph offers many configuration options, and incorrect settings can create security holes.

**Example:**  Running Ceph daemons with excessive privileges, exposing management interfaces without proper authentication, or failing to secure the underlying operating system.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access, data breaches, denial of service, or complete cluster compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Follow Ceph security best practices for deployment and configuration.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege when configuring Ceph components.
*   Secure the underlying operating system and infrastructure.
*   Regularly review and audit Ceph configurations.
*   Disable unnecessary services and features.

## Attack Surface: [Metadata Server (MDS) Vulnerabilities (for CephFS)](./attack_surfaces/metadata_server__mds__vulnerabilities__for_cephfs_.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities specific to the Metadata Server (MDS) in CephFS deployments.

**How Ceph Contributes:** The MDS manages file system metadata. Vulnerabilities here can impact file system integrity and access control.

**Example:**  Exploiting a bug in the MDS's handling of file permissions to gain unauthorized access to files, or a denial-of-service attack targeting the MDS.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to files, data corruption, or denial of service for the CephFS file system.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the Ceph version up-to-date to patch known MDS vulnerabilities.
*   Properly configure file system permissions and access controls.
*   Monitor MDS performance and resource usage for signs of attack.
