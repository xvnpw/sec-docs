## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Utilizing Sunshine (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_utilizing_sunshine__critical_node_.md)

**1. Compromise Application Utilizing Sunshine (CRITICAL NODE):**

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. All subsequent attack vectors aim to achieve this.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH-RISK PATH:** Exploit Sunshine Directly **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_sunshine_directly__critical_node_.md)

**2. Exploit Sunshine Directly (CRITICAL NODE):**

* This represents a category of attacks that directly target vulnerabilities within the Sunshine application itself, rather than its interactions or environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH-RISK PATH:** Exploit Code Execution Vulnerabilities in Sunshine **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_code_execution_vulnerabilities_in_sunshine__critical_node_.md)

**3. Exploit Code Execution Vulnerabilities in Sunshine (CRITICAL NODE):**

* This category of attacks aims to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Sunshine, granting the attacker significant control.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH-RISK PATH:** Exploit Unpatched Dependencies **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_unpatched_dependencies__critical_node_.md)

**4. Exploit Unpatched Dependencies (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE):**

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries and components that Sunshine relies on.
* **Mechanism:** These vulnerabilities are often publicly disclosed and may have readily available exploits. Attackers can leverage these exploits to gain code execution.
* **Example:** A vulnerable version of a video encoding library could be exploited by sending a specially crafted video stream.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH-RISK PATH:** Injection Attacks (e.g., Command Injection) **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_injection_attacks__e_g___command_injection___critical_node_.md)

**5. Injection Attacks (e.g., Command Injection) (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE):**

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious commands into input fields or parameters that are processed by Sunshine and subsequently executed by the underlying operating system.
* **Mechanism:** If Sunshine doesn't properly sanitize user-provided input before passing it to system commands, attackers can inject arbitrary commands.
* **Example:** Injecting a command like ``; rm -rf /*` into a filename field if Sunshine uses it in a system call.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH-RISK PATH:** Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws in Sunshine **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_authenticationauthorization_flaws_in_sunshine__critical_node_.md)

**6. Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws in Sunshine (CRITICAL NODE):**

* This category of attacks focuses on bypassing security measures that control access to Sunshine's features and data.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH-RISK PATH:** Bypass Authentication **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_bypass_authentication__critical_node_.md)

**7. Bypass Authentication (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE):**

* This involves circumventing the login process to gain unauthorized access to Sunshine.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH-RISK PATH:** Exploit Default Credentials **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_default_credentials__critical_node_.md)

**8. Exploit Default Credentials (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE):**

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to log in using the default usernames and passwords that are often set during the initial installation of Sunshine.
* **Mechanism:** If administrators fail to change these default credentials, attackers can easily gain administrative access.
* **Example:** Trying common default username/password combinations like "admin"/"password".

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH-RISK PATH:** Manipulate Sunshine's Input Handling **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_manipulate_sunshine's_input_handling__critical_node_.md)

**9. Manipulate Sunshine's Input Handling (CRITICAL NODE):**

* This category focuses on exploiting how Sunshine processes and handles user input.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH-RISK PATH:** Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_input_validation_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**10. Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE):**

* This involves exploiting flaws in how Sunshine validates and sanitizes user-provided data.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH-RISK PATH:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Stream Overlay/Chat **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_stream_overlaychat__critical_node_.md)

**11. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Stream Overlay/Chat (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE):**

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into stream overlays or chat functionalities that are then executed in the browsers of other users viewing the stream.
* **Mechanism:** If Sunshine doesn't properly sanitize user input in these areas, attackers can inject scripts that can steal cookies, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions within the user's browser.
* **Example:** Injecting `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` into a chat message.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH-RISK PATH:** Abuse Input Forwarding Mechanisms **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_abuse_input_forwarding_mechanisms__critical_node_.md)

**12. Abuse Input Forwarding Mechanisms (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE):**

* This involves exploiting how Sunshine forwards input from clients to the host system.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH-RISK PATH:** Inject Malicious Input Events **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_inject_malicious_input_events__critical_node_.md)

**13. Inject Malicious Input Events (HIGH-RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE):**

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft and send malicious input events (keyboard, mouse, gamepad) that are forwarded by Sunshine to the host operating system.
* **Mechanism:** If Sunshine doesn't properly validate or sanitize these input events, attackers can potentially execute commands, manipulate applications, or perform other actions on the host system as if a legitimate user were doing it.
* **Example:** Sending a sequence of keyboard events that opens a command prompt and executes a malicious command.
