# Attack Surface Analysis for lizardbyte/sunshine

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities present in the third-party libraries that Sunshine relies on.

**How Sunshine Contributes:** Sunshine introduces these dependencies into the application. If these dependencies have known security flaws, the application becomes vulnerable.

**Example:** Sunshine uses an outdated version of a networking library with a known remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability through Sunshine's network interactions.

**Impact:** Ranges from denial of service to remote code execution on the server or client running the application.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update Sunshine to benefit from dependency updates.
* Implement dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in Sunshine's dependencies.
* Consider using a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track dependencies.
* If possible, contribute to or fork Sunshine to address critical dependency issues if the maintainers are slow to respond.

## Attack Surface: [API Input Validation Issues](./attack_surfaces/api_input_validation_issues.md)

**Description:** Sunshine's API might not properly validate input it receives from the integrating application.

**How Sunshine Contributes:** If the application passes untrusted or unsanitized data to Sunshine's API, vulnerabilities like command injection or path traversal could occur within Sunshine's context.

**Example:** The application passes a user-provided file path to a Sunshine function without proper validation. An attacker could manipulate this path to access or modify arbitrary files on the server.

**Impact:** File system access, potential for command execution, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always sanitize and validate all input before passing it to Sunshine's API.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when interacting with Sunshine's API.
* Review Sunshine's documentation for recommended input validation practices.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Data Handling within Sunshine](./attack_surfaces/insecure_data_handling_within_sunshine.md)

**Description:** Sunshine might handle sensitive data insecurely, either in storage or during transmission.

**How Sunshine Contributes:** The application relies on Sunshine's data handling mechanisms, inheriting any vulnerabilities present.

**Example:** Sunshine stores user credentials or connection details in plain text in a configuration file or transmits remote desktop session data without proper encryption.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, potential for credential theft or interception of confidential data.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure Sunshine uses encryption for sensitive data in transit (e.g., using HTTPS/TLS for web interfaces, secure protocols for remote access).
* Avoid storing sensitive data in Sunshine's configuration if possible. If necessary, use strong encryption at rest.
* Review Sunshine's code or documentation for data handling practices.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Access to Sunshine's Features](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_access_to_sunshine's_features.md)

**Description:** Lack of proper authentication and authorization controls within Sunshine could allow unauthorized access to its functionalities.

**How Sunshine Contributes:** The application's security is weakened if Sunshine's access controls are insufficient.

**Example:** An attacker could directly access Sunshine's web interface or remote access features without proper authentication, potentially gaining control over the host system.

**Impact:** Unauthorized remote access, manipulation of Sunshine's settings, potential for further system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strong authentication for all of Sunshine's access points.
* Implement authorization mechanisms to restrict access to specific features based on user roles or permissions.
* If Sunshine provides an API, ensure it requires authentication and authorization.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Specific Sunshine Features (e.g., Remote Desktop, Streaming)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_specific_sunshine_features__e_g___remote_desktop__streaming_.md)

**Description:** Bugs or design flaws within Sunshine's core functionalities can be exploited.

**How Sunshine Contributes:** The application utilizes these features, inheriting any inherent vulnerabilities.

**Example (Remote Desktop):** A vulnerability in Sunshine's remote desktop protocol allows an attacker to inject malicious keystrokes into the remote session.

**Example (Streaming):** A flaw in Sunshine's streaming implementation allows unauthorized users to view private streams.

**Impact:** Unauthorized remote control, data breaches, manipulation of streams, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Stay updated with the latest versions of Sunshine to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
* Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to Sunshine.
* If possible, limit the use of high-risk features if they are not essential.
* Implement additional security measures around these features (e.g., network segmentation, intrusion detection).
