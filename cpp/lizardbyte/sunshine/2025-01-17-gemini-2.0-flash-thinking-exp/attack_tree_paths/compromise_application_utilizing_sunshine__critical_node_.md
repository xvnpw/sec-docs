    * **Attack Vector:**  An attacker could discover a new vulnerability in Sunshine and develop an exploit before a patch is available.
    * **Impact:** Similar to known vulnerabilities, this could lead to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Implement robust security practices:**  Employ security best practices like input validation, output encoding, and principle of least privilege to reduce the likelihood of exploitable vulnerabilities.
        * **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block malicious requests targeting potential vulnerabilities.
        * **Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS):** These systems can help identify and block suspicious activity.

* **4.1.3 Misconfigurations:**
    * **Description:**  Insecure configurations of the Sunshine server can create attack opportunities. This could include weak default credentials, exposed administrative interfaces, or overly permissive access controls.
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker could leverage default credentials or exploit misconfigured access controls to gain unauthorized access to the Sunshine server.
    * **Impact:**  Gaining access to the Sunshine server could allow the attacker to manipulate its settings, access sensitive data, or even take control of the streaming functionality.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Change default credentials:** Ensure all default usernames and passwords are changed to strong, unique credentials.
        * **Secure administrative interfaces:** Restrict access to administrative interfaces and use strong authentication mechanisms.
