# Attack Surface Analysis for lizardbyte/sunshine

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Access to Management Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_access_to_management_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** Administrative or configuration interfaces provided by Sunshine are accessible without requiring authentication, allowing unauthorized users to control the server.
*   **Sunshine Contribution:** Sunshine exposes web endpoints for management. If authentication is not enforced on these endpoints by default or through configuration, they are directly vulnerable.
*   **Example:** An attacker accesses the Sunshine web interface on `http://yourserver:47990` without login and can modify streaming settings, user permissions, or shut down the server.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Sunshine server, leading to data breaches, service disruption, and unauthorized access to streaming functionalities.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable and Enforce Authentication:**  Ensure strong authentication is enabled and properly configured for all administrative access to Sunshine's web interface.
    *   **Restrict Network Access:** Limit access to the management interface to trusted networks or IP addresses using firewall rules or network access control lists (ACLs).
    *   **Regularly Review Access Controls:** Audit and verify access control configurations to ensure they remain effective and restrict unauthorized access.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities in Web Interface](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities_in_web_interface.md)

*   **Description:** The web interface of Sunshine is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of users accessing the interface.
*   **Sunshine Contribution:** If Sunshine's web interface development lacks proper input sanitization and output encoding, it can introduce XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a Sunshine configuration field. When an administrator views this configuration through the web interface, the script executes, potentially stealing administrator session cookies or performing actions on their behalf.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise of administrators, potential data theft, and unauthorized actions performed within the Sunshine application.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Strict Input Sanitization and Output Encoding:**  Thoroughly sanitize all user inputs and properly encode outputs in the Sunshine web interface to prevent injection of malicious scripts.
    *   **Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.
    *   **Regular Security Scanning and Code Reviews:** Conduct automated security scans and manual code reviews specifically targeting the web interface to identify and remediate XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [WebRTC Implementation Flaws](./attack_surfaces/webrtc_implementation_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Sunshine's implementation of WebRTC or related streaming protocols can be exploited to compromise the streaming functionality or the server itself.
*   **Sunshine Contribution:** Sunshine's core functionality relies on WebRTC for real-time streaming.  Bugs or insecure practices in how Sunshine implements WebRTC can create exploitable vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Sunshine's WebRTC data processing logic. An attacker crafts a malicious media stream that, when processed by Sunshine, triggers the overflow, leading to denial of service or potentially remote code execution on the server.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service of streaming functionality, potential information leaks from media streams, and in severe cases, remote code execution on the Sunshine server.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (Critical if Remote Code Execution is possible)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Sunshine and WebRTC Libraries Updated:** Regularly update Sunshine and any underlying WebRTC libraries to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Audits of WebRTC Integration:** Conduct focused security audits and penetration testing specifically on Sunshine's WebRTC implementation to identify potential flaws.
    *   **Implement Robust Input Validation for Media Streams:** Validate and sanitize all incoming media streams to prevent exploitation of parsing or processing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Resource Limits and Rate Limiting:** Implement resource limits and rate limiting for streaming connections to mitigate denial-of-service attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Weak Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/weak_default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Sunshine ships with or allows the use of weak, default credentials for administrative accounts, making it easy for attackers to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Sunshine Contribution:** If Sunshine predefines default usernames and passwords that are not securely managed or easily changed by users, it directly introduces a critical vulnerability.
*   **Example:** Sunshine's default administrator account uses "admin" as the username and "password" as the password. An attacker uses these default credentials to log in and gain full administrative control.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Sunshine server and potentially connected systems due to unauthorized administrative access.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Eliminate Default Credentials:**  Remove any default credentials in Sunshine's distribution.
    *   **Force Strong Password Setup on First Use:**  Require users to set strong, unique passwords during the initial setup process and enforce strong password policies.
    *   **Security Hardening Documentation:** Provide clear documentation and guidance to users on the importance of changing default credentials and securing their Sunshine installation.

## Attack Surface: [Outdated or Vulnerable Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/outdated_or_vulnerable_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Sunshine relies on third-party libraries and dependencies that contain known security vulnerabilities, which are not promptly updated.
*   **Sunshine Contribution:** Sunshine's dependency management practices directly impact its security. Using outdated or vulnerable dependencies exposes Sunshine to known exploits.
*   **Example:** Sunshine uses an older version of a critical library with a publicly disclosed remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker exploits this vulnerability through Sunshine to gain control of the server.
*   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability, but can include remote code execution, denial of service, and data breaches affecting Sunshine and the application using it.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Maintain Up-to-date Dependencies:** Implement a process for regularly updating all of Sunshine's dependencies to the latest stable and patched versions.
    *   **Automated Dependency Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate automated vulnerability scanning tools into the development and deployment pipeline to identify and alert on vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Dependency Management Tools and Practices:** Utilize dependency management tools to track and manage dependencies effectively, ensuring timely updates and security patching.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Employ SCA tools to gain visibility into the software bill of materials and proactively manage risks associated with dependencies.
