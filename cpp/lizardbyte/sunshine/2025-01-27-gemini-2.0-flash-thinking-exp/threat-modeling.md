# Threat Model Analysis for lizardbyte/sunshine

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Server Vulnerability](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__via_server_vulnerability.md)

Description: An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Sunshine server code (e.g., buffer overflow, injection flaw) to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could be achieved by sending specially crafted requests to the server.
Impact: Full system compromise, data breach, complete control over the server, denial of service, malware installation.
Affected Sunshine Component: Core Sunshine Server Application, potentially specific modules handling request processing or data parsing.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    Keep Sunshine server updated to the latest version with security patches.
    Implement input validation and sanitization throughout the Sunshine codebase.
    Use memory-safe programming practices and libraries.
    Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the Sunshine server.
    Run Sunshine with least privilege user account.

## Threat: [Path Traversal Vulnerability](./threats/path_traversal_vulnerability.md)

Description: An attacker exploits a path traversal vulnerability in the Sunshine web UI or API to access files and directories outside the intended web root. This could be done by manipulating file paths in requests to the server.
Impact: Information disclosure of sensitive configuration files, system files, user data, potential for further exploitation by gaining access to credentials or internal application details.
Affected Sunshine Component: Web UI, API endpoints handling file access or serving static content.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    Implement strict input validation and sanitization for file paths in web UI and API requests.
    Use secure file handling functions and restrict file system access to only necessary directories.
    Enforce proper access control mechanisms to limit file access based on user roles and permissions.
    Regularly audit code for path traversal vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Web UI](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_web_ui.md)

Description: An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the Sunshine web UI (e.g., through input fields, URL parameters, or stored data). When other users access the affected page, the malicious script executes in their browser.
Impact: Session hijacking, account takeover, defacement of the web UI, redirection to malicious websites, theft of sensitive user data, malware distribution.
Affected Sunshine Component: Web UI components, specifically input fields, data display mechanisms, and any part of the UI that renders user-supplied content without proper sanitization.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    Implement robust output encoding and sanitization for all user-supplied data displayed in the web UI.
    Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.
    Regularly audit and test the web UI for XSS vulnerabilities.
    Educate users about the risks of clicking on suspicious links or entering data into untrusted websites.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass Vulnerability](./threats/authentication_bypass_vulnerability.md)

Description: An attacker exploits a flaw in the Sunshine authentication mechanism to gain unauthorized access to the web UI or API without providing valid credentials. This could be due to logic errors, insecure authentication protocols, or vulnerabilities in authentication modules.
Impact: Full unauthorized access to Sunshine management interface, ability to control streaming sessions, modify server settings, potentially leading to complete system compromise if administrative functions are accessible.
Affected Sunshine Component: Authentication modules, login mechanisms, session management.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    Use strong and well-vetted authentication libraries and frameworks.
    Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
    Regularly audit and penetration test the authentication mechanisms.
    Enforce strong password policies and account lockout mechanisms.
    Minimize the attack surface by disabling or securing unused authentication methods.

## Threat: [WebRTC Implementation Vulnerabilities](./threats/webrtc_implementation_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the WebRTC implementation used by Sunshine or its underlying libraries. This could be in the signaling process, media processing, or data channel handling. Exploitation could involve sending malformed WebRTC packets or manipulating the signaling process.
Impact: Denial of service, remote code execution on the server or client, information disclosure from the stream, manipulation of the streaming content, disruption of streaming sessions.
Affected Sunshine Component: WebRTC modules, signaling server, media processing components, data channel implementation.
Risk Severity: High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
Mitigation Strategies:
    Keep Sunshine and its WebRTC dependencies updated to the latest versions with security patches.
    Regularly monitor security advisories related to WebRTC libraries used by Sunshine.
    Implement secure WebRTC signaling and session negotiation practices.
    Consider using a well-established and actively maintained WebRTC library.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack on WebRTC Stream](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_webrtc_stream.md)

Description: An attacker intercepts the WebRTC stream between the Sunshine server and the client. This could be achieved if encryption is weak, misconfigured, or bypassed due to vulnerabilities. The attacker could passively eavesdrop or actively manipulate the stream.
Impact: Interception of streamed content (audio, video, data), potential manipulation of the stream, injection of malicious content into the stream, data theft.
Affected Sunshine Component: WebRTC streaming components, encryption mechanisms, network communication channels.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    Enforce strong encryption for WebRTC streams (DTLS-SRTP).
    Properly configure TLS/SSL for signaling channels.
    Ensure that WebRTC connections are established securely and verified.
    Educate users about the risks of using insecure networks (e.g., public Wi-Fi) for streaming.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: Sunshine relies on third-party libraries and dependencies that may contain known vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities through Sunshine.
Impact: Depending on the vulnerability in the dependency, impacts can range from denial of service to remote code execution, data breaches, and other forms of compromise.
Affected Sunshine Component: All components that rely on vulnerable dependencies.
Risk Severity: Medium to Critical (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability) - *While severity depends on the specific vulnerability, the potential impact is high to critical, so included.*
Mitigation Strategies:
    Maintain an inventory of all Sunshine dependencies.
    Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools.
    Update dependencies to the latest versions with security patches promptly.
    Implement a dependency management process to track and manage dependencies effectively.
