# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for lizardbyte/sunshine

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Sunshine's Built-in Authentication Mechanisms](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_sunshine's_built-in_authentication_mechanisms.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Consult the official Sunshine documentation to understand the available authentication methods provided by Sunshine.
    2.  Ensure that authentication is enabled in Sunshine's configuration file or settings.  This is crucial if Sunshine is accessible from any network beyond a completely trusted local environment.
    3.  Configure the chosen authentication method according to the documentation. This typically involves setting usernames and passwords or potentially integrating with other authentication systems if supported by Sunshine.
    4.  Avoid disabling authentication or using default credentials. Change any default usernames or passwords immediately to strong, unique values.
    5.  Regularly review and update authentication configurations as needed, especially after Sunshine updates.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Sunshine Server (Severity: High) - Prevents unauthorized users from connecting to and controlling the Sunshine server and potentially the host system through Sunshine's interface.
    *   Data Breaches/Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium) - Protects streamed content and potentially sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals who might gain access to Sunshine without proper authentication.
    *   Malicious Use of Streaming Resources (Severity: Medium) - Prevents unauthorized users from using your Sunshine server for their own purposes, consuming resources and potentially impacting performance or incurring unwanted network traffic.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Sunshine Server: High reduction
    *   Data Breaches/Information Disclosure: Medium reduction
    *   Malicious Use of Streaming Resources: Medium reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Sunshine includes built-in authentication mechanisms. The specific types and features depend on the version of Sunshine. Check the project's documentation for details on current authentication methods.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Potential improvements could include expanding the types of authentication supported (e.g., OAuth 2.0, integration with external identity providers), and enhancing the user interface for authentication management within Sunshine itself.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Password Policies for Sunshine Users](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_password_policies_for_sunshine_users.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  If Sunshine's authentication system relies on user-defined passwords, establish and communicate strong password policies to users who will be managing or accessing Sunshine.
    2.  Password policies should include requirements for password length, complexity (mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and discourage the use of easily guessable passwords.
    3.  Encourage or ideally enforce regular password changes for Sunshine user accounts.
    4.  Educate users about the importance of strong, unique passwords and the risks associated with weak or reused passwords in the context of accessing a streaming server like Sunshine.
    5.  Consider if Sunshine could be enhanced to automatically enforce password complexity requirements during user creation or password changes.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Sunshine Server (Severity: High) - Significantly reduces the risk of successful password guessing, brute-force attacks, or credential compromise due to weak passwords, thereby protecting access to Sunshine.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Sunshine Server: Medium reduction (effectiveness depends on user adherence and policy enforcement; could be higher with technical enforcement within Sunshine).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - Sunshine's authentication system likely allows password setting, but the enforcement of strong password policies is primarily a manual process for users/administrators. Sunshine itself may not have built-in password complexity enforcement.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Sunshine could be improved by implementing built-in password complexity checks during user account creation and password changes.  The documentation should also strongly recommend and outline best practices for password management within Sunshine.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Sunshine and its Dependencies Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_sunshine_and_its_dependencies_updated.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Regularly monitor the official Sunshine GitHub repository (https://github.com/lizardbyte/sunshine) for new releases, updates, and security advisories.
    2.  Subscribe to notifications or watch the repository for announcements regarding security patches or updates for Sunshine.
    3.  When updates are released, promptly follow the recommended update procedure provided in the Sunshine documentation to upgrade your Sunshine installation.
    4.  Pay attention to release notes and changelogs to understand the security improvements and bug fixes included in each update.
    5.  Ensure that any dependencies bundled with or required by Sunshine are also kept up-to-date, if applicable and manageable by the user.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Sunshine (Severity: High) - Patches known security flaws and vulnerabilities within the Sunshine application code itself, preventing attackers from exploiting these weaknesses.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Sunshine: High reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** No automated update mechanism within Sunshine itself. Users are responsible for manually checking for and applying updates by downloading new releases from the GitHub repository or other distribution channels.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Sunshine could potentially benefit from a built-in update notification system or even an automated update mechanism (with user consent and control).  Clearer documentation on the update process and the importance of timely updates is crucial.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Securely Store and Handle Configuration Data](./mitigation_strategies/securely_store_and_handle_configuration_data.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Review Sunshine's configuration files to identify any sensitive information stored within them, such as authentication credentials, API keys (if any are used in future features), or other secrets.
    2.  Ensure that Sunshine's configuration files are stored with appropriate file system permissions, restricting read and write access to only the necessary user accounts (e.g., the user account running the Sunshine service and system administrators).
    3.  Avoid storing sensitive information in plain text directly within configuration files if possible.
    4.  Explore options within Sunshine's design to utilize more secure methods for storing sensitive configuration data, such as:
        *   Using environment variables to inject sensitive settings at runtime instead of storing them in files.
        *   Integrating with operating system-level secret storage mechanisms if appropriate.
        *   Considering support for external secret management solutions in future versions.
    5.  If storing sensitive data in configuration files is unavoidable, investigate options to encrypt the configuration files themselves or use encryption features provided by the operating system or configuration management tools.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration (Severity: High) - Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in Sunshine's configuration files, such as credentials or API keys, which could lead to account compromise or further unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration: High reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - Sunshine likely uses file-based configuration, and operating system file permissions can be used for basic access control. However, advanced secure configuration management practices are not inherently built into Sunshine.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Sunshine could be enhanced to support or recommend using environment variables or external secret management for sensitive configuration parameters.  The project's documentation should strongly emphasize secure configuration practices and advise against storing sensitive data in plain text configuration files.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable and Review Sunshine Logs](./mitigation_strategies/enable_and_review_sunshine_logs.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Ensure that logging is enabled in Sunshine's configuration. Refer to the project's documentation for instructions on how to enable and configure logging.
    2.  Configure logging to capture relevant events for security monitoring, such as:
        *   Connection attempts (successful and failed).
        *   Authentication events (successful logins, failed login attempts).
        *   Errors or exceptions within Sunshine that might indicate security issues or vulnerabilities being triggered.
        *   Any administrative actions performed within Sunshine's interface (if applicable).
    3.  Regularly review Sunshine's logs for suspicious patterns, unusual activity, or security-related events.
    4.  Consider integrating Sunshine's logs with a centralized logging system or security information and event management (SIEM) system for more comprehensive monitoring and analysis, especially in larger deployments.
    5.  Establish alerts for critical security events detected in the logs to enable timely incident response.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Delayed Security Incident Detection (Severity: Medium) - Enables faster detection of security breaches, unauthorized access attempts, and other malicious activities by providing an audit trail of Sunshine's operations.
    *   Insufficient Forensic Information (Severity: Medium) - Logs provide valuable information for investigating security incidents, understanding attack vectors, and improving security measures.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Security Incident Detection: Medium reduction (primarily improves detection and response capabilities, not prevention).
    *   Insufficient Forensic Information: Medium reduction (improves incident investigation and post-incident analysis).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Sunshine likely has logging capabilities to some extent. The level of detail and configurability of logging may vary depending on the version.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Sunshine's logging features could be enhanced with more granular control over log levels, log formats, and the types of events logged.  Documentation should provide clear guidance on enabling, configuring, and effectively utilizing logs for security monitoring and incident response.  Standardized log formats and integration with common logging systems would be beneficial.
