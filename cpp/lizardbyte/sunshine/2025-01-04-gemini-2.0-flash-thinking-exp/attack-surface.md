# Attack Surface Analysis for lizardbyte/sunshine

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Control Port (Web Interface)](./attack_surfaces/exposed_control_port__web_interface_.md)

*   **Description:** Sunshine exposes a TCP port for its web interface, used for configuration and control. This port, if not properly secured, is a prime target for attackers.
    *   **How Sunshine Contributes:** This web interface is integral to managing and configuring the Sunshine server.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could attempt to access the web interface without proper authentication, potentially gaining full control over the Sunshine server, including the ability to start/stop streaming, change settings, or even execute commands if vulnerabilities exist.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Sunshine server, potential for lateral movement within the network if the server has access to other resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong, unique passwords for the Sunshine web interface.
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** If supported, enable MFA for an added layer of security.
        *   **HTTPS Only:** Ensure the web interface is only accessible over HTTPS to encrypt communication and prevent eavesdropping.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on login attempts to mitigate brute-force attacks.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Sunshine updated to patch any vulnerabilities in the web interface.
        *   **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Restrict access to the control port to specific IP addresses or networks.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** If Sunshine uses default or easily guessable credentials for its web interface or any other authentication mechanisms, it becomes trivial for attackers to gain access.
    *   **How Sunshine Contributes:** Sunshine requires authentication for managing its settings and functionality.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses common default credentials (e.g., admin/password) to log into the Sunshine web interface and gains full control.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Sunshine server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory Password Change:** Force users to change default credentials upon initial setup.
        *   **Password Complexity Requirements:** Enforce strong password policies (minimum length, special characters, etc.).
        *   **Account Lockout Policy:** Implement an account lockout policy after a certain number of failed login attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Web Interface](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_web_interface.md)

*   **Description:** If the Sunshine web interface allows users to input data that is then used in system commands without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious commands.
    *   **How Sunshine Contributes:** Certain functionalities within the web interface might involve executing system commands based on user input (e.g., adding hosts, configuring network settings).
    *   **Example:** An attacker enters a malicious command within an input field in the web interface, which is then executed by the Sunshine server, potentially allowing them to run arbitrary code on the host machine.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the host system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user input received by the web interface before using it in any system commands.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Sunshine process with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful command injection.
        *   **Avoid System Calls:** Where possible, avoid directly executing system commands based on user input. Use safer alternatives or well-defined APIs.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** If Sunshine's default configuration settings are insecure (e.g., permissive access controls), it increases the attack surface.
    *   **How Sunshine Contributes:** The default configuration is the initial state of the application when deployed.
    *   **Example:** Sunshine might have a default setting that allows access from any IP address, making it vulnerable if exposed to the internet.
    *   **Impact:** Increased risk of unauthorized access and exploitation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Defaults:** Ensure that the default configuration is as secure as possible.
        *   **Security Hardening Guide:** Provide clear documentation and guidance on how to securely configure Sunshine after installation.
        *   **Configuration Auditing:** Regularly review and audit the Sunshine configuration to ensure it aligns with security best practices.
