# Threat Model Analysis for lizardbyte/sunshine

## Threat: [Command Injection via Game Launching](./threats/command_injection_via_game_launching.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with access to Sunshine's configuration (either through compromised credentials or a configuration vulnerability *within Sunshine*) could manipulate the game launch commands *within Sunshine's settings* to include malicious commands. These commands are then executed on the host system with the privileges of the Sunshine process. This could involve adding extra arguments to the game executable or replacing the executable entirely *through Sunshine's interface*.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the host system, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or malware installation.
*   **Affected Component:** Game Launching Module, Configuration Handling
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user-provided game launch parameters *within the Sunshine codebase*. Avoid directly executing user-provided strings. Use parameterized commands or a safe list of allowed executables and arguments *within Sunshine*. Implement proper authorization checks *within Sunshine* to prevent unauthorized modification of game launch configurations.

## Threat: [Path Traversal in Game Selection](./threats/path_traversal_in_game_selection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with access to Sunshine's configuration could potentially specify arbitrary file paths when adding or modifying game entries *through Sunshine's interface*. This could allow them to point to executables outside of the intended game directories, potentially leading to the execution of system utilities or malicious scripts *when Sunshine attempts to launch the game*.
*   **Impact:** Execution of unintended programs, potentially leading to system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Game Management Module, Configuration Handling
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict path validation and sanitization *within Sunshine* when handling user-provided file paths for game executables. Restrict game selection to predefined directories or use a secure file browser interface *within Sunshine* that prevents traversal outside allowed paths.

## Threat: [Weak or Default Credentials](./threats/weak_or_default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Users might fail to change default credentials or choose weak passwords for accessing *Sunshine's* administrative interface. An attacker could leverage these weak credentials to gain unauthorized access to the configuration and control of the Sunshine instance.
*   **Impact:** Full control over the Sunshine instance, including the ability to launch arbitrary games, modify settings, and potentially execute commands on the host system (see Command Injection threat).
*   **Affected Component:** Authentication Module, User Management
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Enforce strong password policies *within Sunshine's user management*. Provide clear warnings *in the Sunshine interface* about the risks of using default credentials. Consider implementing account lockout mechanisms *within Sunshine* after multiple failed login attempts.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities](./threats/authentication_bypass_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** A flaw in *Sunshine's* authentication logic could allow an attacker to bypass the normal login process without providing valid credentials. This could be due to coding errors or design flaws in the authentication module *of Sunshine*.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Sunshine's features and configuration.
*   **Affected Component:** Authentication Module
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust and secure authentication mechanisms *within the Sunshine codebase*. Regularly review and audit the authentication code *of Sunshine* for vulnerabilities. Follow secure coding practices to prevent common authentication bypass issues. Promptly address any reported authentication vulnerabilities *in Sunshine*.

## Threat: [Insecure Update Mechanism](./threats/insecure_update_mechanism.md)

*   **Description:** If *Sunshine's* update mechanism does not properly verify the integrity and authenticity of updates, an attacker could potentially distribute malicious updates that could compromise the Sunshine instance or the host system.
*   **Impact:** Installation of malware or compromised versions of Sunshine.
*   **Affected Component:** Update Module
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement a secure update mechanism *within Sunshine* that verifies the digital signatures of updates. Use HTTPS for downloading updates *initiated by Sunshine*. Provide a way for users to verify the authenticity of updates *provided by Sunshine*.
