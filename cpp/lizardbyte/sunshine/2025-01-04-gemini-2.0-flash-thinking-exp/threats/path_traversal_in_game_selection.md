## Deep Dive Analysis: Path Traversal in Game Selection (Sunshine)

This analysis provides a comprehensive breakdown of the "Path Traversal in Game Selection" threat within the Sunshine application, based on the provided description.

**1. Threat Breakdown:**

* **Core Vulnerability:** The fundamental flaw lies in the lack of sufficient validation and sanitization of user-provided file paths when adding or modifying game entries within Sunshine's configuration. This allows an attacker to bypass intended restrictions and specify arbitrary locations.
* **Attacker Profile:** This threat assumes an attacker has gained access to Sunshine's configuration. This access could be achieved through various means:
    * **Compromised User Account:** An attacker gains access to an account with permissions to modify Sunshine's configuration.
    * **Direct Access to Configuration Files:** The attacker gains access to the underlying configuration files (e.g., through SSH, physical access, or another vulnerability).
    * **Exploitation of Other Vulnerabilities:** Another vulnerability in Sunshine (e.g., an API endpoint without proper authentication) could be exploited to modify the configuration.
* **Attack Mechanism:** The attacker leverages Sunshine's interface (likely a web interface or a configuration file editor) to input a malicious file path for a game executable. This path could utilize traversal sequences like `../` to navigate outside the intended game directories.
* **Exploitation Scenario:** When Sunshine attempts to launch the configured "game," it executes the program located at the attacker-specified path. This could be:
    * **System Utilities:**  Commands like `cmd.exe`, `bash`, `powershell`, `sh`, etc., allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host system with the privileges of the Sunshine process.
    * **Malicious Scripts:**  Scripts (e.g., Python, Bash, PowerShell) designed to perform malicious actions like data exfiltration, creating backdoor accounts, installing malware, or disrupting service.
    * **Other Executables:** Any executable accessible by the Sunshine process could be targeted.

**2. Impact Assessment (Detailed):**

The "High" risk severity is justified due to the potential for significant impact:

* **Direct System Compromise:** The ability to execute arbitrary commands directly leads to a high probability of complete system compromise. An attacker can gain control over the host operating system.
* **Data Breach:**  If the Sunshine process has access to sensitive data, the attacker can exfiltrate this information.
* **Malware Installation:** The attacker can install persistent malware, allowing for long-term control and further malicious activities.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The attacker could execute commands that crash the system or consume resources, leading to a denial of service.
* **Privilege Escalation (Potential):** While the initial execution happens with the privileges of the Sunshine process, the attacker might be able to exploit further vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to escalate privileges to a higher level (e.g., root/administrator).
* **Lateral Movement (Potential):** If the compromised host is part of a larger network, the attacker could use it as a stepping stone to compromise other systems.
* **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack can severely damage the reputation of the organization using Sunshine.

**3. Affected Components (Granular Analysis):**

* **Game Management Module:**
    * **Input Handling:** The code responsible for receiving and processing user input for game paths (likely within the UI or API).
    * **Data Storage:** The mechanism used to store the configured game paths (e.g., configuration files, database).
    * **Game Launching Logic:** The core functionality that reads the stored game path and executes the corresponding executable. This is the critical point of exploitation.
* **Configuration Handling:**
    * **Configuration Parsing:** The code that reads and interprets the configuration files or data structures containing game information.
    * **Configuration Update Logic:** The code that handles modifications to the game configurations.

**4. Attack Vector Deep Dive:**

Let's consider specific scenarios:

* **Web Interface Exploitation:**
    * The attacker logs into the Sunshine web interface (assuming authentication is bypassed or credentials are compromised).
    * They navigate to the game management section.
    * When adding a new game or editing an existing one, they manipulate the input field for the executable path, inserting a path traversal sequence (e.g., `../../../../windows/system32/cmd.exe`).
    * Upon saving the configuration, this malicious path is stored.
    * When a user attempts to launch this "game" through Sunshine, the `cmd.exe` is executed instead of the intended game.
* **Configuration File Manipulation:**
    * The attacker gains direct access to Sunshine's configuration files (e.g., `config.json`, `settings.ini`).
    * They manually edit the file, modifying the path to a game executable to point to a malicious program.
    * When Sunshine loads the configuration, it reads the malicious path.
    * Upon game launch, the malicious program is executed.
* **API Exploitation (If Applicable):**
    * If Sunshine exposes an API for managing games, the attacker could craft a malicious API request to add or modify a game entry with a path traversal payload.

**5. Likelihood Assessment:**

The likelihood of this threat being exploited depends on several factors:

* **Accessibility of Sunshine's Configuration:** How well is the configuration protected? Is it accessible only to authorized users? Are there default credentials that need to be changed?
* **Complexity of Exploitation:** How easy is it for an attacker to identify and exploit this vulnerability? Does the UI provide clear feedback that allows for path manipulation?
* **Security Awareness of Users:** Are users aware of the risks of running untrusted executables?
* **Existing Security Measures:** Are there any other security measures in place that might mitigate this risk (e.g., operating system-level access controls, endpoint detection and response)?

Despite these factors, the potential for high impact elevates the overall risk, making mitigation a priority.

**6. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed Implementation Guidance):**

Expanding on the provided mitigation strategies:

* **Strict Path Validation and Sanitization (within Sunshine):**
    * **Allowlisting:** Define a set of allowed parent directories for game executables. Any path outside these directories should be rejected. This is the most secure approach.
    * **Canonicalization:** Convert the user-provided path to its absolute, canonical form. This eliminates relative paths and traversal sequences. Compare the canonicalized path against the allowed directories.
    * **Input Filtering/Blacklisting:**  Identify and remove or escape potentially dangerous characters and sequences like `../`, `./`, `\`, `%`, etc. However, this approach can be bypassed with clever encoding or variations.
    * **Regular Expression Matching:** Use regular expressions to validate the path format against expected patterns.
    * **Code Review:** Thoroughly review the code that handles game path input and processing to identify potential vulnerabilities.
* **Restrict Game Selection to Predefined Directories:**
    * **Configuration Options:** Provide administrators with configuration options to specify the allowed game directories.
    * **Enforce Restrictions:**  The application should strictly enforce these restrictions, preventing users from adding games outside the permitted locations.
* **Secure File Browser Interface (within Sunshine):**
    * **Chroot Jail:** Implement a chroot jail or similar mechanism to restrict the file browser's view to the allowed game directories.
    * **UI Restrictions:**  The file browser UI should prevent users from navigating outside the permitted paths. Disable direct path input and rely solely on the browsing interface.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run the Sunshine process with the minimum necessary privileges to perform its functions. This limits the potential damage if an attacker gains code execution.
* **Input Validation on the Backend:** Perform path validation on the server-side, not just the client-side, to prevent bypassing client-side checks.
* **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Regularly conduct security audits and penetration tests to identify and address vulnerabilities like this.
* **User Education:** Educate users about the risks of running untrusted executables and the importance of configuring Sunshine securely.
* **Consider Sandboxing:** Explore the possibility of sandboxing the game execution environment to further isolate it from the host system.
* **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):** If Sunshine has a web interface, implement a strong CSP to mitigate potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks that could be used to manipulate game configurations.

**7. Conclusion:**

The "Path Traversal in Game Selection" threat in Sunshine presents a significant security risk due to its potential for direct system compromise. The lack of proper input validation on user-provided file paths allows attackers with configuration access to execute arbitrary commands. Implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, particularly strict path validation and restricting game selection to predefined directories, is crucial to address this vulnerability. A layered security approach, combining robust input validation with other security measures like least privilege and regular audits, will significantly reduce the risk and enhance the overall security posture of the Sunshine application. Developers should prioritize addressing this vulnerability to prevent potential exploitation and maintain the integrity and security of systems running Sunshine.
