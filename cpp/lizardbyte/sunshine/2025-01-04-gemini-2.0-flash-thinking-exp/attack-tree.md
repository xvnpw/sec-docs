## Attack Tree Path: [I. Exploit Software Bugs in Sunshine:](./attack_tree_paths/i__exploit_software_bugs_in_sunshine.md)

*   **Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities like buffer overflows in Sunshine's code, often when processing network inputs or media data.
    *   **Impact:** Allows arbitrary code execution on the host system, leading to full compromise.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust memory safety practices, perform thorough code reviews, and utilize memory sanitizers during development.

*   **Exploit Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious commands or code into Sunshine through input fields or configuration settings that are not properly sanitized.
    *   **Impact:** Enables arbitrary command execution on the host system, leading to full compromise.
    *   **Mitigation:** Avoid executing external commands based on user input, sanitize all input thoroughly, and use parameterized commands or safe API alternatives.

## Attack Tree Path: [II. Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities in Sunshine [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/ii__exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities_in_sunshine__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Exploit Insecure Default Configurations [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Leveraging weak or default credentials, open ports, or overly permissive access controls that are present in Sunshine's default setup.
    *   **Impact:** Grants unauthorized access to Sunshine's management interface and functionalities.
    *   **Mitigation:** Enforce strong default configurations, require users to change default credentials upon installation, and follow the principle of least privilege for access controls.

*   **Exploit Missing or Weak Authentication/Authorization [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Bypassing or exploiting flaws in Sunshine's authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Allows unauthorized users to control Sunshine and potentially the host system.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., strong passwords, multi-factor authentication) and robust authorization controls based on roles and privileges.

*   **Exploit Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Obtaining sensitive information like API keys or credentials stored insecurely in Sunshine's configuration files.
    *   **Impact:** Provides attackers with credentials to access other systems or further compromise the current system.
    *   **Mitigation:** Store sensitive information securely using encryption or dedicated secret management solutions; avoid storing secrets in plaintext configuration files.

## Attack Tree Path: [III. Exploit Integration Weaknesses between Application and Sunshine [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/iii__exploit_integration_weaknesses_between_application_and_sunshine__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Exploit Insecure Configuration of Sunshine by the Application [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Application Uses Weak Credentials for Sunshine [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The application uses weak or default credentials when interacting with Sunshine's API or management interface.
        *   **Impact:** Allows unauthorized access to Sunshine through the application's integration.
        *   **Mitigation:** Enforce strong password policies for application-Sunshine interactions and securely store credentials.
    *   **Application Exposes Sunshine Management Interface Publicly [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The application unintentionally exposes Sunshine's management interface to the public internet without proper access controls.
        *   **Impact:** Allows direct access to Sunshine's management features for attackers.
        *   **Mitigation:** Ensure Sunshine's management interface is not publicly accessible or is protected by strong authentication and authorization.
    *   **Application Insecurely Stores Sunshine Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The application stores Sunshine configuration details, including credentials, in an insecure manner.
        *   **Impact:** Exposes sensitive information that can be used to compromise Sunshine.
        *   **Mitigation:** Securely store Sunshine configuration details using encryption or dedicated secret management solutions.

## Attack Tree Path: [IV. Exploit Network Communication with Sunshine [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/iv__exploit_network_communication_with_sunshine__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack on Sunshine Communication [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Intercepting and potentially modifying communication between the application and Sunshine or the streaming traffic itself.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to manipulation of Sunshine, data breaches, or injection of malicious content into the stream.
    *   **Mitigation:** Enforce encryption (TLS/SSL) for all communication between the application and Sunshine. Investigate secure streaming options.

*   **Exploit Insecure Network Configuration of Sunshine [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Sunshine Ports Publicly Accessible Without Restriction [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Sunshine's ports are exposed to the public internet without proper firewall rules.
        *   **Impact:** Increases the attack surface, making it easier to exploit vulnerabilities in Sunshine.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement firewall rules to restrict access to Sunshine's ports to only authorized networks or users.
