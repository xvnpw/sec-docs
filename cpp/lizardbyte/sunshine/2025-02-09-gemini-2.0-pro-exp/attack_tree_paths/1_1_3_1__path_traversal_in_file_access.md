# Deep Analysis: Path Traversal in Sunshine Application

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the potential for path traversal vulnerabilities within an application utilizing the Sunshine streaming application (https://github.com/lizardbyte/sunshine).  We aim to identify specific code areas, configurations, or user interactions that could be exploited to achieve unauthorized file access.  The analysis will provide actionable recommendations to mitigate identified risks.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack tree path: **1.1.3.1. Path Traversal in File Access**.  It encompasses:

*   **Sunshine's Codebase:**  Examining the Sunshine source code (C++ primarily) for functions and modules that handle file paths, user input related to file paths, and file I/O operations.
*   **Configuration Files:**  Analyzing how Sunshine's configuration files (e.g., `sunshine.conf`) handle file paths and whether user-supplied values can influence these paths.
*   **User Input Vectors:** Identifying all potential points where a user (or a malicious actor) can provide input that directly or indirectly affects file paths used by Sunshine. This includes command-line arguments, web interface inputs, and API calls.
*   **Application Integration:** How the application using Sunshine interacts with it, specifically focusing on how file paths are passed to or from Sunshine.  This is crucial because the vulnerability might exist in *how* the application uses Sunshine, not just within Sunshine itself.
* **Operating System:** Considering the underlying operating system (Linux, Windows, etc.) and its file system permissions, as these can influence the impact of a successful path traversal.

**Out of Scope:**

*   Other attack vectors against Sunshine (e.g., buffer overflows, denial-of-service).
*   Security of the host system beyond the direct impact of a Sunshine path traversal.
*   Third-party libraries used by Sunshine, *unless* they are directly involved in file path handling.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Static Code Analysis:**
    *   Manual code review of the Sunshine codebase, focusing on functions like `fopen`, `fread`, `fwrite`, `std::ifstream`, `std::ofstream`, and any custom file handling functions.  We'll search for patterns like:
        *   Direct use of user-supplied input in file paths without sanitization.
        *   Concatenation of user input with base paths without proper validation.
        *   Lack of checks to ensure the final path remains within an intended directory.
        *   Use of relative paths without proper anchoring.
    *   Use of static analysis tools (e.g., `cppcheck`, `clang-tidy`, potentially specialized security-focused tools) to automatically identify potential path traversal vulnerabilities.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing and Penetration Testing):**
    *   **Fuzzing:**  Develop a fuzzer to send malformed file path inputs (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`, `....//....//....//windows/win.ini`, URL-encoded variations) to Sunshine through various input vectors (command-line, configuration files, web interface if applicable).  Monitor for crashes, unexpected file access, or error messages indicating successful traversal.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Manually craft path traversal payloads and attempt to access sensitive files (e.g., `/etc/passwd` on Linux, `C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM` on Windows) or write to unauthorized locations.  This will be performed in a controlled environment.

3.  **Configuration Review:**
    *   Examine the default Sunshine configuration files and documentation to identify any settings related to file paths.
    *   Test how changes to these settings affect Sunshine's behavior and vulnerability to path traversal.

4.  **Documentation Review:**
    *   Review Sunshine's official documentation for any warnings or best practices related to file path handling.

5.  **Threat Modeling:**
    *   Consider different attacker scenarios and their potential goals (e.g., reading configuration files, gaining system access, planting malware).

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.3.1. Path Traversal in File Access

Based on the methodologies outlined above, the following is a detailed analysis:

### 2.1 Code Analysis Findings (Hypothetical - Requires Actual Code Review)

This section would contain *specific* findings from the code review.  Since we don't have access to the *exact* application code using Sunshine, we'll provide hypothetical examples and explain the reasoning:

**Example 1: Vulnerable Configuration Parsing**

Let's assume Sunshine's configuration file (`sunshine.conf`) has a setting like:

```
game_data_path = /home/user/sunshine/gamedata
```

And the application code reads this value and uses it directly:

```c++
// Hypothetical Sunshine Code
std::string config_path = GetConfigValue("game_data_path");
std::string full_path = config_path + "/" + user_provided_filename;
std::ifstream game_file(full_path);
// ... read game data ...
```

**Vulnerability:** If an attacker can modify `sunshine.conf` (perhaps through a separate vulnerability or misconfiguration) or if `user_provided_filename` is not sanitized, they can inject a path traversal payload.  For example, if `user_provided_filename` is set to `../../../../etc/passwd`, the `full_path` would become `/home/user/sunshine/gamedata/../../../../etc/passwd`, which resolves to `/etc/passwd`.

**Example 2: Vulnerable Web Interface Input**

Suppose Sunshine has a web interface that allows users to select a game profile from a list, and the profile name is used to construct a file path:

```c++
// Hypothetical Sunshine Code
std::string profile_name = GetWebInput("profile_name");
std::string profile_path = "/var/lib/sunshine/profiles/" + profile_name + ".json";
std::ifstream profile_file(profile_path);
// ... read profile data ...
```

**Vulnerability:**  If `profile_name` is not sanitized, an attacker could enter `../../../../etc/shadow` as the profile name, leading to an attempt to read `/etc/shadow`.

**Example 3:  Lack of Canonicalization**

```c++
//Hypothetical Sunshine Code
std::string user_path = GetUserInput("path_to_resource");
std::string full_path = base_path + user_path;
// ... use full_path for file operations ...
```
Even if some basic checks are performed (like removing `../`), an attacker might be able to bypass them using techniques like:
*   `....//` (which becomes `../` after one level of removal)
*   URL encoding: `%2e%2e%2f` (which decodes to `../`)
*   Using symbolic links to create unexpected directory structures.

A robust solution would involve *canonicalizing* the path (resolving all symbolic links, `.` and `..` components) *before* performing any checks.  C++'s `std::filesystem::canonical` (C++17 and later) can be used for this.

### 2.2 Dynamic Analysis Results (Hypothetical)

This section would detail the results of fuzzing and penetration testing.

**Fuzzing:**

*   **Input:**  `../../../../etc/passwd`, `....//....//....//etc/passwd`, `%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc%2fpasswd`, and other variations.
*   **Expected Result (if vulnerable):**  Sunshine might crash, return the contents of `/etc/passwd`, or log an error indicating that it attempted to access the file.
*   **Expected Result (if mitigated):**  Sunshine should reject the input, log an error indicating an invalid path, or return a "file not found" error *without* attempting to access the malicious path.

**Penetration Testing:**

*   **Scenario 1:** Attempt to read `/etc/passwd` (Linux) or `C:\Windows\win.ini` (Windows) through a known input vector (e.g., a configuration file setting or a web interface field).
*   **Scenario 2:** Attempt to write a file to an unauthorized location (e.g., `/tmp/malicious.txt` or `C:\Windows\Temp\malicious.txt`).
*   **Scenario 3:**  If Sunshine uses a database, attempt to inject path traversal payloads into database queries that might be used to construct file paths.

### 2.3 Configuration Review Findings

*   **Default Configuration:**  Examine the default `sunshine.conf` for any settings that directly or indirectly control file paths.  Are these paths absolute or relative?  Are they user-configurable?
*   **Security Hardening Guides:**  Check if Sunshine's documentation provides any guidance on securely configuring file paths.
*   **Example:** If the configuration file allows specifying a "log directory," test whether a path traversal payload in this setting can cause logs to be written outside the intended directory.

### 2.4 Mitigation Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following mitigations are recommended (prioritized):

1.  **Input Sanitization and Validation (Highest Priority):**
    *   **Whitelist Approach:**  If possible, define a whitelist of allowed characters for file names and paths.  Reject any input that contains characters outside the whitelist.  This is the most secure approach.
    *   **Blacklist Approach (Less Secure):**  If a whitelist is not feasible, explicitly remove or encode dangerous characters and sequences (e.g., `..`, `/`, `\`, null bytes, control characters).  Be aware that blacklists are often incomplete and can be bypassed.
    *   **Regular Expressions:** Use regular expressions to validate that file paths conform to an expected pattern (e.g., only allowing alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens within a specific directory structure).
    *   **Canonicalization:**  Before performing any checks, *always* canonicalize the file path using a reliable function like `std::filesystem::canonical` (C++17) or a platform-specific equivalent. This resolves symbolic links and `..` components, preventing bypasses.

2.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   Run Sunshine with the *minimum* necessary file system permissions.  Do not run it as root or an administrator.  Create a dedicated user account with limited access.
    *   Use operating system-level security features (e.g., SELinux, AppArmor on Linux; User Account Control on Windows) to further restrict Sunshine's capabilities.

3.  **Chroot Jail (or Containerization):**
    *   Confine Sunshine to a specific directory using a `chroot` jail (on Linux).  This makes it much harder for a path traversal vulnerability to escape the designated directory.
    *   Consider using containerization technologies like Docker.  Containers provide a more robust and isolated environment than `chroot`.

4.  **Secure Configuration Practices:**
    *   Store sensitive configuration files (like `sunshine.conf`) in a secure location with restricted access permissions.
    *   Avoid hardcoding file paths in the code.  Use configuration files or environment variables, but *always* sanitize and validate these values.

5.  **Regular Security Audits and Updates:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits of the Sunshine codebase and the application that uses it.
    *   Keep Sunshine and all its dependencies up-to-date to patch any discovered vulnerabilities.

6.  **Logging and Monitoring:**
    *   Implement robust logging of file access attempts, including both successful and failed attempts.
    *   Monitor logs for suspicious activity, such as attempts to access files outside the expected directories.
    *   Use intrusion detection systems (IDS) or security information and event management (SIEM) systems to automate the detection of potential path traversal attacks.

7. **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** If Sunshine exposes a web interface, use a WAF to filter out malicious requests, including path traversal attempts.

### 2.5 Conclusion

Path traversal is a serious vulnerability that can have severe consequences. By thoroughly analyzing Sunshine's code, configuration, and user input vectors, and by implementing the recommended mitigations, the risk of path traversal attacks can be significantly reduced.  Continuous monitoring and regular security updates are crucial for maintaining a secure environment. The hypothetical examples provided illustrate the *types* of vulnerabilities to look for, but a real-world analysis requires examining the *actual* code and configuration of the specific application using Sunshine.
