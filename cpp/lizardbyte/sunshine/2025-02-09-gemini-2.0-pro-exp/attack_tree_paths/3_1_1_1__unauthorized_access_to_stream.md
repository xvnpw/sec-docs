# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 3.1.1.1 - Unauthorized Access to Stream (Sunshine Application)

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the attack path leading to unauthorized access to a Sunshine stream, identify the underlying vulnerabilities that enable this attack, assess the practical implications, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level recommendation of "enforce strong authentication."  We aim to provide developers with specific guidance on how to prevent this attack vector.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on attack path **3.1.1.1 (Unauthorized Access to Stream)**, which is a direct consequence of **1.3.1.1 (Bypass Authentication)** within the broader attack tree.  We will consider the Sunshine application (https://github.com/lizardbyte/sunshine) and its default configurations, common deployment scenarios, and potential interactions with other system components.  We will *not* analyze other attack paths within the tree, except where they directly contribute to the success of 3.1.1.1.  We will also consider the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, with a primary focus on confidentiality in this specific case.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Identification:**  We will analyze the Sunshine codebase (and relevant dependencies) to identify specific code sections, configurations, or architectural choices that could allow an attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the stream.  This includes examining authentication mechanisms, session management, and access control logic.
2.  **Exploitation Scenario Development:** We will construct realistic scenarios in which an attacker could exploit the identified vulnerabilities.  This will involve considering different attack vectors, attacker skill levels, and potential preconditions.
3.  **Impact Assessment:** We will detail the specific consequences of successful exploitation, including the types of data exposed, the potential for further attacks, and the impact on the user and the system.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  We will propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies, going beyond the general recommendation of "enforce strong authentication."  This will include code-level changes, configuration recommendations, and best practices for deployment and operation.
5.  **Detection and Response:** We will discuss methods for detecting attempts to exploit this vulnerability and recommend appropriate response actions.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 3.1.1.1

### 2.1 Vulnerability Identification

Given that 3.1.1.1 is a *direct consequence* of 1.3.1.1 (Bypass Authentication), the core vulnerabilities lie within the authentication mechanisms of Sunshine.  We need to examine how Sunshine handles:

*   **Authentication Protocols:**  Does Sunshine use standard, well-vetted protocols (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect) or custom implementations?  Custom implementations are more prone to errors.  Sunshine uses a PIN-based authentication by default, and also supports client certificate authentication.
*   **Credential Storage:** How are user credentials (PINs, passwords, certificates) stored?  Are they hashed and salted properly?  Are they stored securely on the server and client? Sunshine stores the PIN in plain text in its configuration file.
*   **Session Management:** After successful authentication, how are sessions managed?  Are session tokens generated securely?  Are they protected against hijacking or replay attacks?  Are there proper timeouts and invalidation mechanisms? Sunshine uses WebRTC for the streaming session, which itself has security considerations.
*   **Access Control:**  Once a session is established, are there checks to ensure that only authorized users can access the stream?  Are there role-based access controls (RBAC) or other authorization mechanisms?
*   **Input Validation:** Does Sunshine properly validate all inputs related to authentication and stream access?  Are there vulnerabilities to injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection) that could be used to bypass authentication?
* **Default Configuration:** What is the default authentication configuration? Is it secure by default, or does it require significant configuration by the user to be secure? Sunshine's default PIN is often left unchanged, presenting a significant risk.
* **WebRTC Security:** Since Sunshine uses WebRTC, vulnerabilities in the WebRTC implementation or configuration could lead to unauthorized stream access. This includes issues with ICE, STUN/TURN servers, and signaling.

**Specific Potential Vulnerabilities (Hypotheses based on common issues and Sunshine's known features):**

1.  **Weak Default PIN:**  The most likely vulnerability is the use of a weak or default PIN that is easily guessed or brute-forced.  Many users may not change the default PIN.
2.  **PIN Storage in Plaintext:**  Storing the PIN in plaintext in the configuration file makes it vulnerable to anyone with access to the file system.
3.  **Lack of Rate Limiting:**  If Sunshine does not implement rate limiting on authentication attempts, an attacker could rapidly try different PINs without being blocked.
4.  **Vulnerabilities in WebRTC Signaling:**  Flaws in the signaling process used to establish the WebRTC connection could allow an attacker to intercept or manipulate the connection setup, potentially bypassing authentication.
5.  **Client Certificate Misconfiguration:** If client certificate authentication is enabled but not properly configured (e.g., weak certificate validation, improper CA trust), an attacker could forge a valid certificate.
6.  **Session Hijacking:** If session tokens (if used) are not properly secured, an attacker could steal a valid session token and impersonate an authenticated user.

### 2.2 Exploitation Scenario Development

**Scenario 1: Default PIN Brute-Force**

1.  **Attacker Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to the Sunshine stream.
2.  **Precondition:** The attacker knows the IP address and port of the Sunshine server.  The server is using the default PIN (or a weak, easily guessable PIN).
3.  **Attack Steps:**
    *   The attacker uses a tool (e.g., a simple script, `hydra`, `nmap` with scripting) to repeatedly attempt to connect to the Sunshine server, trying different PINs.
    *   If there is no rate limiting, the attacker can try thousands of PINs quickly.
    *   Once the correct PIN is found, the attacker establishes a connection and gains access to the stream.
4.  **Skill Level:** Novice
5.  **Effort:** Very Low

**Scenario 2: Configuration File Access**

1.  **Attacker Goal:** Obtain the Sunshine PIN to gain unauthorized access.
2.  **Precondition:** The attacker has gained some level of access to the host system (e.g., through a separate vulnerability, social engineering, or physical access).
3.  **Attack Steps:**
    *   The attacker navigates to the directory containing the Sunshine configuration file.
    *   The attacker opens the configuration file and reads the plaintext PIN.
    *   The attacker uses the obtained PIN to connect to the Sunshine server and access the stream.
4.  **Skill Level:** Low to Intermediate (depending on how access to the host was obtained)
5.  **Effort:** Low to Medium (depending on the level of access to the host)

**Scenario 3: WebRTC Signaling Manipulation (Advanced)**

1.  **Attacker Goal:**  Bypass authentication by manipulating the WebRTC signaling process.
2.  **Precondition:**  The attacker has a deep understanding of WebRTC and can intercept and modify network traffic.  There is a vulnerability in the Sunshine signaling implementation.
3.  **Attack Steps:**
    *   The attacker intercepts the signaling messages exchanged between the Sunshine client and server.
    *   The attacker modifies the messages to bypass authentication checks or inject malicious data.
    *   The attacker establishes a WebRTC connection without providing valid credentials.
4.  **Skill Level:** Expert
5.  **Effort:** High

### 2.3 Impact Assessment

The impact of unauthorized access to the Sunshine stream is **High**.

*   **Confidentiality Breach:**  The attacker can view the host's screen in real-time.  This could expose:
    *   Sensitive personal information (e.g., emails, documents, banking details).
    *   Confidential business data (e.g., presentations, source code, financial records).
    *   Private conversations (if audio is also streamed).
    *   Credentials for other systems (if the user types them while being observed).
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:**  The attacker could use the visual information obtained to:
    *   Launch social engineering attacks against the user or their contacts.
    *   Identify other vulnerabilities in the user's system or network.
    *   Gain access to other accounts or systems.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  If the compromised system belongs to a business, unauthorized access could lead to reputational damage and loss of customer trust.
*   **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:**  Depending on the type of data exposed, there could be legal and regulatory consequences (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA violations).

### 2.4 Mitigation Strategy Development

Here are specific, actionable mitigation strategies:

1.  **Strong Password/PIN Policy:**
    *   **Enforce a minimum PIN length (e.g., 8 digits or more).**
    *   **Require a mix of character types (numbers, letters, symbols) if possible.**  While Sunshine primarily uses a numeric PIN, consider allowing alphanumeric PINs if feasible.
    *   **Disallow common or easily guessable PINs (e.g., "123456", "000000").**  Maintain a blacklist of weak PINs.
    *   **Provide a secure PIN generation feature.**  Offer users the option to have Sunshine generate a strong, random PIN for them.
    *   **Force users to change the default PIN upon initial setup.**  Do not allow the application to run until the default PIN is changed.

2.  **Secure Credential Storage:**
    *   **Never store PINs in plaintext.**  Use a strong, one-way hashing algorithm (e.g., Argon2, bcrypt, scrypt) with a unique, randomly generated salt for each PIN.
    *   **Store the hashed PIN securely.**  Consider using a dedicated secrets management solution or a secure configuration file format with encryption.

3.  **Rate Limiting:**
    *   **Implement rate limiting on authentication attempts.**  Limit the number of failed login attempts within a specific time period (e.g., 3 attempts per minute).
    *   **Introduce progressively longer delays after multiple failed attempts.**  This makes brute-force attacks significantly slower.
    *   **Consider IP-based blocking after a certain threshold of failed attempts.**

4.  **Secure WebRTC Implementation:**
    *   **Use a well-vetted WebRTC library and keep it up to date.**  Regularly update to the latest version to patch any security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Implement proper certificate validation for DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security).**  Ensure that the server's certificate is valid and trusted.
    *   **Use secure signaling mechanisms.**  Consider using WebSockets over TLS (WSS) for signaling.
    *   **Implement end-to-end encryption (E2EE) if possible.**  This would protect the stream content even if the signaling channel is compromised.  However, E2EE in a screen-sharing context is complex.
    *   **Regularly audit the WebRTC configuration and implementation for security vulnerabilities.**

5.  **Client Certificate Authentication (If Used):**
    *   **Require strong client certificates.**  Use certificates with sufficient key length and strong cryptographic algorithms.
    *   **Implement proper certificate revocation checking (e.g., OCSP, CRL).**
    *   **Ensure that the server properly validates the client certificate's chain of trust.**

6.  **Session Management (If Applicable):**
    *   **Use strong, randomly generated session tokens.**
    *   **Protect session tokens from theft (e.g., use HTTPS, set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on cookies).**
    *   **Implement session timeouts and automatic logout after a period of inactivity.**
    *   **Provide a mechanism for users to manually log out.**

7.  **Input Validation:**
    *   **Validate all inputs related to authentication and stream access.**  Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks.

8.  **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   **Conduct regular security audits of the Sunshine codebase and configuration.**
    *   **Perform penetration testing to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.**

9. **User Education:**
    *  Educate users about the importance of choosing strong PINs and keeping them secret.
    *  Warn users about the risks of using default settings.

### 2.5 Detection and Response

*   **Authentication Logging:**  Log all authentication attempts (successful and failed), including the IP address, timestamp, and username/PIN (if applicable, but *never* the plaintext PIN).
*   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**  Deploy an IDS to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity, such as brute-force attempts or unusual WebRTC signaling patterns.
*   **Alerting:**  Configure alerts to notify administrators of suspicious events, such as multiple failed login attempts from the same IP address.
*   **Incident Response Plan:**  Develop an incident response plan to handle unauthorized access attempts.  This should include steps for:
    *   Identifying the source of the attack.
    *   Isolating the affected system.
    *   Revoking compromised credentials.
    *   Restoring the system to a secure state.
    *   Notifying affected users.

By implementing these mitigation and detection strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to Sunshine streams and protect user data. The most critical steps are enforcing strong PINs, securely storing credentials, and implementing rate limiting.
