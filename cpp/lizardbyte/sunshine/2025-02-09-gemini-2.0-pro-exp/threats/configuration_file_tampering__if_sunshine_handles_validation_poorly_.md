Okay, let's break down the "Configuration File Tampering" threat for Sunshine in a detailed analysis.

## Deep Analysis: Configuration File Tampering in Sunshine

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the potential for configuration file tampering in Sunshine, focusing on how inadequate validation within the application itself could exacerbate the impact of an attacker gaining file-level access.  We aim to identify specific vulnerabilities, assess their exploitability, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies for both developers and users.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the scenario where an attacker has already achieved the ability to modify Sunshine's configuration file(s).  We are *not* analyzing *how* the attacker gained that access (e.g., SSH compromise, malware).  Instead, we are analyzing what the attacker can *achieve* by manipulating the configuration *given* that they have write access to the file.  The scope includes:

*   **Config File Format:**  Understanding the structure and syntax of the configuration file(s) used by Sunshine (e.g., YAML, JSON, INI).
*   **Config File Parsing:**  How Sunshine reads, parses, and interprets the configuration data.  This is the crucial area for identifying validation weaknesses.
*   **Configuration Value Usage:**  How different components within Sunshine utilize the configuration values.  This helps determine the impact of manipulated values.
*   **Existing Security Mechanisms:**  Identifying any built-in security measures related to configuration file handling (e.g., checksums, if any).
*   **Sunshine Version:** The analysis is based on the current understanding of Sunshine from the provided GitHub link, but specific version numbers should be considered when implementing mitigations.

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ a combination of the following methods:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  Examining the Sunshine source code (available on GitHub) to identify:
    *   The location and format of the configuration file(s).
    *   The code responsible for reading and parsing the configuration file(s) (`Sunshine::Config::ConfigManager` is a likely starting point).
    *   How configuration values are used throughout the application.  We'll look for instances where configuration values are used directly without validation, especially in security-sensitive contexts (e.g., launching external applications, setting network addresses).
    *   Any existing validation or sanitization logic.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**  If feasible, we would perform dynamic testing:
    *   Creating a test environment with Sunshine.
    *   Modifying the configuration file with invalid or malicious values.
    *   Observing Sunshine's behavior to identify crashes, unexpected actions, or successful exploitation.  This would involve fuzzing the configuration file with various inputs.

3.  **Threat Modeling Refinement:**  Using the findings from code review and dynamic analysis to refine the initial threat model, providing more specific details about the vulnerability and its impact.

4.  **Mitigation Recommendation:**  Based on the identified vulnerabilities, we will propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies for both developers and users.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1.  Configuration File Format and Location (Hypothetical - Requires Code Review):**

Let's assume, for the sake of this analysis (pending a full code review), that Sunshine uses a YAML configuration file located at `/etc/sunshine/config.yaml` or `~/.config/sunshine/config.yaml`.  A sample (hypothetical) configuration might look like this:

```yaml
server:
  port: 47989
  address: 0.0.0.0
applications:
  - name: "Desktop"
    path: "/usr/bin/gnome-session"
    args: []
  - name: "Steam"
    path: "/usr/bin/steam"
    args: ["-bigpicture"]
allowed_clients:
  - 192.168.1.100
  - 192.168.1.101
```

**2.2.  Parsing and Validation Weaknesses (Hypothetical - Requires Code Review):**

The core of this threat lies in how `Sunshine::Config::ConfigManager` (or equivalent) handles this configuration data.  Here are some potential vulnerabilities:

*   **Missing Type Validation:**  If the code simply reads the `port` value as a string and doesn't check if it's a valid integer within the allowed port range (1-65535), an attacker could set it to a non-numeric value, potentially causing a crash or unexpected behavior.  Similarly, `address` should be validated as a valid IP address or hostname.
*   **Path Traversal in `path`:**  The most critical vulnerability.  If the `path` value for an application is not *strictly* validated, an attacker could set it to a malicious executable.  For example:
    *   `path: "/tmp/malicious_script"` (if `/tmp` is writable by the Sunshine user).
    *   `path: "../../../../../usr/bin/malicious_script"` (attempting a path traversal attack).
    *   `path: "'; /bin/bash -c \"malicious_command\"'"` (attempting command injection if the path is used in a shell command without proper escaping).
*   **Command Injection in `args`:**  If the `args` are concatenated directly into a command line without proper escaping or sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious commands.  For example, adding `"; rm -rf /; "` to the `args` array.
*   **Unvalidated `allowed_clients`:**  If the `allowed_clients` list is not properly validated, an attacker could add their own IP address, bypassing intended access restrictions.  This could also be vulnerable to IP address spoofing if Sunshine doesn't implement additional checks.
*   **No Integrity Checks:**  If Sunshine doesn't implement any checksums or digital signatures for the configuration file, it won't be able to detect if the file has been tampered with, even if the attacker has the necessary file permissions.

**2.3.  Impact Scenarios:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The most severe impact.  By manipulating the `path` and `args` of an application, an attacker could force Sunshine to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Sunshine process.  This could lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By setting invalid values for `port` or `address`, the attacker could prevent Sunshine from starting or functioning correctly.
*   **Data Redirection:**  While less likely, if Sunshine uses configuration values to determine where to stream data, an attacker could potentially redirect the stream to a malicious server.
*   **Bypassing Access Controls:**  Manipulating `allowed_clients` could allow unauthorized access to the Sunshine service.

**2.4.  Affected Components:**

*   `Sunshine::Config::ConfigManager`:  The primary component responsible for loading and parsing the configuration.
*   Any component that uses configuration values *without* performing its own validation.  This likely includes:
    *   The network server component (using `port` and `address`).
    *   The application launching component (using `path` and `args`).
    *   The client authentication component (using `allowed_clients`).

**2.5. Risk Severity:** High

The risk is classified as **High** due to the potential for arbitrary code execution, which could lead to complete system compromise.

### 3. Mitigation Strategies

**3.1. Developer Mitigations (Crucial):**

*   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Schema Validation:**  Use a schema validation library (e.g., `jsonschema` for Python, `YAML::Validator` for Perl, or equivalent for the language Sunshine is written in) to define the expected structure, data types, and allowed values for the configuration file.  This is the *most important* mitigation.
    *   **Type Checking:**  Explicitly check the data type of each configuration value (e.g., integer, string, IP address) and ensure it conforms to the expected type.
    *   **Range Checking:**  For numeric values (like `port`), enforce valid ranges.
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Values:**  Whenever possible, use a whitelist of allowed values rather than a blacklist.  For example, for `address`, you might only allow `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces) or specific, pre-defined hostnames/IPs.
    *   **Path Sanitization:**  For `path` values:
        *   **Absolute Paths Only:**  *Require* absolute paths (starting with `/`).  This prevents relative path traversal attacks.
        *   **Canonicalization:**  Use a function to canonicalize the path (resolve symbolic links, remove `.` and `..` components) *before* using it.
        *   **Whitelist Directories:**  If possible, restrict application paths to a specific, whitelisted set of directories (e.g., `/usr/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`).
    *   **Argument Sanitization:**  For `args` values:
        *   **Escape Special Characters:**  Properly escape any special characters that could be interpreted as shell metacharacters.  Use a dedicated library function for this (e.g., `shlex.quote` in Python).
        *   **Avoid Shell Execution:**  If possible, avoid using shell commands to launch applications.  Use system calls that directly execute the program without involving a shell (e.g., `execv` in C, `subprocess.run` with `shell=False` in Python).
    *   **IP Address Validation:** Use a library to validate IP addresses and potentially implement additional checks to prevent spoofing.

*   **Integrity Checks:**
    *   **Checksums:**  Calculate a cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the configuration file and store it separately (e.g., in a separate file with more restrictive permissions).  On startup, Sunshine should recalculate the hash and compare it to the stored value.  If they don't match, the file has been tampered with.
    *   **Digital Signatures:**  A more robust approach.  Sign the configuration file with a private key, and Sunshine can verify the signature using the corresponding public key.  This provides both integrity and authenticity (ensuring the file was created by a trusted source).

*   **Least Privilege:**  Ensure that Sunshine runs with the *minimum* necessary privileges.  Do *not* run it as root.  Create a dedicated user account for Sunshine with limited access to the system.

*   **Code Review and Security Audits:**  Regularly review the code, specifically focusing on configuration handling and input validation.  Consider periodic security audits by external experts.

* **Configuration file permissions:** Ensure that only the user running sunshine has read access to the configuration file, and only root/administrator has write access.

**3.2. User Mitigations:**

*   **Run Sunshine with Least Privileges:**  As mentioned above, users should *never* run Sunshine as root.  Create a dedicated user account.
*   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Use a FIM tool (e.g., AIDE, Tripwire, Samhain) to monitor the Sunshine configuration file for unauthorized changes.  FIM tools can detect modifications and alert the user.
*   **Regularly Review Configuration:**  Periodically review the Sunshine configuration file to ensure that it hasn't been tampered with.  Look for any unexpected or suspicious entries.
*   **Keep Sunshine Updated:**  Install updates promptly to benefit from any security fixes released by the developers.
*   **Firewall:** Use a firewall to restrict access to the Sunshine service to only authorized clients.

### 4. Conclusion

Configuration file tampering is a serious threat to Sunshine, particularly if the application lacks robust input validation. By implementing the mitigation strategies outlined above, developers can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation. Users also play a crucial role in securing their systems by following best practices and using tools like FIM. The combination of developer and user mitigations provides a layered defense against this threat. This analysis should be followed by a thorough code review and, ideally, dynamic testing to confirm the hypothetical vulnerabilities and refine the mitigation strategies.
