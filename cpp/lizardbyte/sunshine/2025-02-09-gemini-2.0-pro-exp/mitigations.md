# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for lizardbyte/sunshine

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Integrate with a Robust Authentication System (Sunshine-Specific Actions)](./mitigation_strategies/1__integrate_with_a_robust_authentication_system__sunshine-specific_actions_.md)

**Description:**
1.  After setting up your external authentication system (OAuth 2.0, etc.), configure Sunshine to *delegate* authentication to it. This is the crucial Sunshine-specific step.
2.  This may involve:
    *   Modifying Sunshine's configuration files (if supported) to disable its built-in authentication methods (PIN, web UI login).
    *   Using Sunshine's API (if available) to programmatically control authentication.
    *   Writing a custom Sunshine plugin to intercept authentication requests and redirect them to your external system. This is the most likely scenario if Sunshine doesn't have built-in support for external authentication.  The plugin would need to validate tokens/identifiers from your authentication system.
    *   Potentially modifying Sunshine's source code (as a last resort, and with careful consideration of maintainability and security updates) to integrate with your authentication system.
3.  Ensure Sunshine sessions are invalidated when the user logs out of your main application or after inactivity. This might require custom plugin logic or source code modifications.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Brute-force attacks against Sunshine's PIN:** (Severity: High)
*   **Exploitation of weaknesses in Sunshine's web UI authentication:** (Severity: High)
*   **Unauthorized access due to weak or default credentials:** (Severity: High)
*   **Session Hijacking (with proper session management):** (Severity: Medium)

**Impact:**
*   **Brute-force/Web UI/Weak Credentials:** Risk reduced to near zero (if implemented correctly).
*   **Session Hijacking:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   None (specifically regarding Sunshine's configuration). The external authentication system exists, but Sunshine is not integrated.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   *All* Sunshine-specific configuration/modification is missing. This is the *critical* gap. Sunshine still relies on its built-in PIN.

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Input Sanitization and Validation (If Modifying Sunshine)](./mitigation_strategies/2__input_sanitization_and_validation__if_modifying_sunshine_.md)

**Description:**
1.  This applies *only if* you are modifying Sunshine's source code or developing plugins that handle client input.
2.  Identify *all* points within Sunshine's code where it receives input from connected clients (gamepad data, keyboard/mouse events, network packets).
3.  Implement *strict* input validation and sanitization at *each* of these points:
    *   Use whitelisting (allow only known-good input) rather than blacklisting.
    *   Define precise rules for allowed input formats, character sets, and ranges.
    *   Reject any input that does not strictly conform to the whitelist.
    *   Sanitize any input that is used in potentially dangerous operations (e.g., constructing file paths, executing system commands).
4.  Use secure coding libraries or frameworks that provide built-in input validation and sanitization functions.
5.  Conduct thorough code reviews, with a strong focus on input handling and security best practices.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Code injection attacks:** (Severity: High)
*   **Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks (if applicable):** (Severity: High)
*   **Buffer overflow attacks:** (Severity: High)
*   **Other input-related vulnerabilities:** (Severity: Varies)

**Impact:**
*   **Injection/Input Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced (if implemented correctly).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Not applicable (no current modifications to Sunshine's core code).

**Missing Implementation:**
*   If modifications are made in the future, this *must* be implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [3. Regular Updates (Sunshine-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/3__regular_updates__sunshine-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  Establish a process for regularly checking for updates to the Sunshine application itself. This is distinct from updating the host OS or general dependencies.
2.  Monitor Sunshine's official website, GitHub repository, or any relevant forums/mailing lists for announcements of new releases and security patches.
3.  When updates are available, test them thoroughly in a non-production environment before deploying them to your production Sunshine instance.
4.  If possible, automate the process of checking for and applying Sunshine updates (e.g., using a script or configuration management tool). This might involve interacting with Sunshine's update mechanism (if it has one) or manually downloading and installing new versions.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in Sunshine:** (Severity: High)

**Impact:**
*   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced (the faster updates are applied, the better).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   None (specifically for Sunshine). Updates are applied manually and infrequently.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   A defined process and automation for Sunshine updates are missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [4. Logging and Monitoring (Sunshine-Specific Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/4__logging_and_monitoring__sunshine-specific_configuration_.md)

**Description:**
1.  Access Sunshine's configuration settings (either through its web UI or configuration files).
2.  Enable *detailed* logging.  Consult Sunshine's documentation to understand the available log levels and options. Choose the most verbose level that provides sufficient information without overwhelming your logging system.
3.  Configure Sunshine to output its logs in a format that can be easily parsed by your log management system (e.g., JSON, structured text).
4.  If Sunshine supports it, configure it to send logs directly to your centralized log management system (e.g., using a syslog protocol or a dedicated log shipper).  If not, you may need to use a separate log forwarding agent on the host machine.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Detection of security incidents:** (Severity: High)
*   **Forensic analysis after an incident:** (Severity: High)

**Impact:**
*   **Detection/Forensics:** Significantly improved.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   None (specifically for Sunshine's logging).

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Sunshine's detailed logging is *not* enabled, and logs are not being forwarded to a central system.

## Mitigation Strategy: [5. Configuration Hardening (Sunshine-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/5__configuration_hardening__sunshine-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  Thoroughly review *every* configuration option available within Sunshine, both in its configuration files and its web UI.
2.  Disable *any* features or settings that are not strictly required for your application's use case.  This minimizes the attack surface. Examples might include:
    *   Unnecessary input methods (e.g., disable keyboard/mouse if only gamepad is needed).
    *   Optional features (e.g., built-in web server if you're using a reverse proxy).
    *   Any experimental or beta features.
3.  Change *all* default credentials (usernames, passwords, API keys) to strong, unique values.  Even if you're using external authentication, change any internal credentials.
4.  If Sunshine provides options to restrict client capabilities (e.g., limiting input types, disabling certain features), configure these restrictions to the minimum necessary level.
5.  Regularly review Sunshine's configuration to ensure it remains secure and that no unnecessary features have been inadvertently enabled.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Exploitation of misconfigured features:** (Severity: Medium)
*   **Unauthorized access due to default credentials:** (Severity: High)
*   **Abuse of unnecessary features:** (Severity: Medium)

**Impact:**
*   **Misconfiguration/Unnecessary Features:** Risk reduced.
*   **Default Credentials:** Risk eliminated (if credentials are changed).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   A basic review of the configuration file was done.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   A comprehensive review of *all* settings (including web UI) is missing.
*   Client capabilities are not restricted.
*   Regular configuration reviews are not performed.
