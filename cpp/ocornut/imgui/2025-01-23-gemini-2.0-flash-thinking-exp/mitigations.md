# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ocornut/imgui

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization for ImGui Inputs](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_for_imgui_inputs.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify ImGui input widgets:** Review your ImGui UI code and pinpoint all widgets that accept user input (e.g., `ImGui::InputText`, `ImGui::SliderInt`, `ImGui::DragFloat`).
    2.  **Define validation rules per input:** For each ImGui input widget, determine the expected data type, format, valid range, and maximum length based on how the input will be used in your application logic.
    3.  **Implement validation *after* ImGui input:**  Immediately after retrieving input from an ImGui widget, before using it in any application logic, add validation checks. Use conditional statements to verify the input against the defined rules.
    4.  **Provide ImGui feedback on invalid input:** If validation fails, use ImGui to display clear error messages to the user directly within the UI, indicating what is wrong with their input (e.g., using `ImGui::TextColored` near the input widget).
    5.  **Sanitize text input from `ImGui::InputText`:** If `ImGui::InputText` is used for text that will be used in potentially sensitive operations (like command execution or file paths), sanitize the input string. This might involve:
        *   **Whitelisting allowed characters.**
        *   **Blacklisting or escaping dangerous characters.**
        *   **Limiting input length using `ImGuiInputTextFlags_CharsMaxLength` flag.**
    6.  **Utilize ImGui input flags for basic constraints:**  Leverage ImGui's built-in input flags (e.g., `ImGuiInputTextFlags_CharsNoBlank`, `ImGuiInputTextFlags_CharsDecimal`, `ImGuiInputTextFlags_Password`) to enforce basic input constraints directly at the UI level.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Injection Attacks via UI Input (High Severity):**  SQL Injection, Command Injection, Path Traversal, etc., if unvalidated input from ImGui is used in backend operations.
        *   **Application Errors due to Invalid Input (Medium Severity):** Crashes, unexpected behavior, or incorrect program logic if ImGui input is not validated and handled properly.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Injection Attacks:** High reduction. Direct validation of ImGui input is a primary defense against UI-driven injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **Application Errors:** High reduction. Input validation ensures data integrity and reduces errors caused by unexpected input formats.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Some input fields have basic validation, but consistent and comprehensive validation across all ImGui inputs is missing.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Consistent input validation needs to be implemented for all relevant ImGui input widgets throughout the application's UI. Sanitization for text inputs used in sensitive operations is also needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of Data Displayed and Modified via ImGui](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_data_displayed_and_modified_via_imgui.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify sensitive data in ImGui UI:** Determine which data displayed or modifiable through ImGui widgets is considered sensitive (passwords, API keys, internal configurations, etc.).
    2.  **Avoid storing sensitive data directly in ImGui state:** Do not store sensitive information directly in ImGui's state variables (e.g., `static char password_buffer[64];`). Manage sensitive data in your application's secure memory and pass only sanitized or masked representations to ImGui for display.
    3.  **Mask sensitive input in ImGui:** When taking sensitive input (like passwords) using `ImGui::InputText`, use the `ImGuiInputTextFlags_Password` flag to mask the input characters.
    4.  **Sanitize sensitive data for ImGui display:** Before displaying sensitive data in ImGui, sanitize or mask it appropriately. For example, display asterisks instead of full passwords, or truncate sensitive IDs.
    5.  **Implement access control for ImGui UI actions:** Ensure that actions triggered by ImGui UI elements that modify sensitive data or settings are protected by access control checks in your application logic. Verify user permissions before applying changes initiated through the UI.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure via UI (High Severity):**  Accidental exposure of sensitive data displayed in ImGui due to lack of masking or sanitization.
        *   **Unauthorized Modification via UI (Medium Severity):**  Unauthorized changes to sensitive settings or data through ImGui UI elements due to missing access control.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** High reduction. Masking and sanitizing sensitive data in ImGui significantly reduces the risk of accidental leaks.
        *   **Unauthorized Modification:** High reduction. Access control for UI actions prevents unauthorized changes initiated through ImGui.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Password fields use `ImGuiInputTextFlags_Password`, but sanitization and access control for other sensitive data displayed or modified via ImGui might be inconsistent.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Consistent sanitization of sensitive data displayed in ImGui and robust access control checks for all UI actions that modify sensitive information are needed across the application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [ImGui Dependency Management and Updates](./mitigation_strategies/imgui_dependency_management_and_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Track the ImGui version used:**  Clearly document the specific version of ImGui being used in your project (e.g., in dependency files, build scripts, or a dedicated documentation file).
    2.  **Monitor ImGui releases and security advisories:** Regularly check the official ImGui GitHub repository (https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for new releases, bug fixes, and security-related announcements.
    3.  **Evaluate ImGui updates for security patches:** When a new ImGui version is released, review the changelog and release notes to identify if any security vulnerabilities have been addressed.
    4.  **Update ImGui promptly for security fixes:** If a new ImGui version includes security patches, prioritize updating ImGui in your project to the latest version.
    5.  **Test ImGui updates for compatibility:** After updating ImGui, thoroughly test your application's UI and functionality to ensure compatibility with the new ImGui version and to catch any regressions introduced by the update.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known ImGui Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Using outdated ImGui versions with known security flaws exposes the application to potential exploits targeting those vulnerabilities.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known ImGui Vulnerabilities:** High reduction. Keeping ImGui updated with security patches directly mitigates the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities within the ImGui library itself.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. ImGui version is tracked, but a proactive process for monitoring releases and applying updates, especially for security reasons, is not consistently in place.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Establish a formal process for regularly monitoring ImGui releases, evaluating security implications, and promptly updating the ImGui dependency in the project when security patches are available.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure ImGui Rendering Backend and Platform Layer Integration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_imgui_rendering_backend_and_platform_layer_integration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use recommended ImGui backends:** Utilize the official or well-established, community-vetted rendering backend examples provided in the ImGui repository (or linked from it) for your chosen rendering API (OpenGL, DirectX, Vulkan) and platform (Windows, Linux, macOS).
    2.  **Review backend integration code (especially if custom):** If you are using a custom or significantly modified ImGui backend, carefully review the integration code for potential security vulnerabilities, focusing on memory management, resource handling, and interactions with the rendering API and operating system.
    3.  **Follow secure coding practices in backend integration:** When implementing or modifying ImGui backend integration code, adhere to secure coding principles to prevent common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, memory leaks, and improper resource handling.
    4.  **Keep backend dependencies updated:** Ensure that any external libraries or dependencies used by your ImGui rendering backend (e.g., graphics drivers, platform-specific libraries) are kept up-to-date to address potential vulnerabilities in those components.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Vulnerabilities in ImGui Backend Integration (Medium to High Severity):** Bugs or security flaws in the code that integrates ImGui with the rendering backend or platform layer could lead to crashes, memory corruption, or potentially code execution.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Vulnerabilities in ImGui Backend Integration:** Moderate to High reduction. Using recommended backends and secure coding practices in integration minimizes the risk of backend-related vulnerabilities affecting ImGui.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Mostly implemented. Official ImGui OpenGL backend is used. However, specific security review of the backend integration code and a formal process for backend dependency updates might be missing.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Conduct a security-focused review of the ImGui rendering backend integration code. Establish a process for monitoring and updating dependencies used by the backend (if any).

## Mitigation Strategy: [ImGui-Specific Code Review and Security Testing](./mitigation_strategies/imgui-specific_code_review_and_security_testing.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Focus code reviews on ImGui usage:** During code reviews, specifically pay attention to code sections that directly interact with the ImGui library, handle user input from ImGui widgets, and manage UI-related state.
    2.  **Include ImGui-specific security checks in reviews:**  In code reviews, specifically look for potential security issues related to ImGui, such as:
        *   Missing or insufficient input validation for ImGui inputs.
        *   Insecure handling of sensitive data displayed or modified via ImGui.
        *   Potential for injection vulnerabilities through UI inputs.
        *   Logic errors exploitable through the UI.
    3.  **Perform UI-focused security testing:** Include security testing activities that specifically target the ImGui-based user interface. This can involve:
        *   Manually testing input validation and sanitization in ImGui widgets.
        *   Attempting to bypass UI access controls.
        *   Fuzzing ImGui input fields with unexpected or malicious data.
        *   Developing security test cases specifically for UI interactions.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **All ImGui-related vulnerabilities introduced in application code (Variable Severity):** Code review and security testing focused on ImGui usage can identify a wide range of vulnerabilities stemming from how ImGui is integrated and used within the application.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **All ImGui-related vulnerabilities:** High reduction. Proactive code review and security testing are essential for identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities before deployment.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Code reviews are conducted, but a specific security focus on ImGui usage and dedicated UI security testing are not consistently performed.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Enhance code review processes to include specific security checks for ImGui usage. Integrate UI-focused security testing, including fuzzing and targeted test cases, into the overall security testing strategy.
