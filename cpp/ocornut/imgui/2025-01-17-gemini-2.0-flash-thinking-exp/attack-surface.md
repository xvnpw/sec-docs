## Attack Surface: [Input Buffer Overflow in Text Fields](./attack_surfaces/input_buffer_overflow_in_text_fields.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Input Buffer Overflow in Text Fields
    *   **Description:** The application uses ImGui's text input widgets (e.g., `ImGui::InputText`) to receive user input. If the application doesn't properly validate or limit the length of this input *before* processing it further, an attacker can provide overly long input, potentially leading to a buffer overflow within the application's handling of the ImGui input. ImGui provides the mechanism for receiving this potentially oversized input.
    *   **How ImGui Contributes to the Attack Surface:** ImGui's `ImGui::InputText` function allows users to input strings. Without proper length limits or application-side validation of the returned string, this becomes a vector for buffer overflows in subsequent processing.
    *   **Example:** A user enters a string of 1000 characters into an `ImGui::InputText` field, and the application directly copies this into a fixed-size buffer without checking the length, leading to memory corruption.
    *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, potential for arbitrary code execution, application crash, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  When using `ImGui::InputText`, either specify a maximum input length directly within the function call or rigorously validate the length of the returned string before using it. Use safe string manipulation functions that prevent buffer overflows.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service through Excessive Input](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service_through_excessive_input.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Denial of Service through Excessive Input
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides an extremely large amount of input to ImGui widgets (e.g., very long strings in text fields, rapid mouse clicks or key presses), potentially overwhelming ImGui's internal processing and the application's event handling, causing it to become unresponsive or crash.
    *   **How ImGui Contributes to the Attack Surface:** ImGui is responsible for processing and managing user input events. Excessive input can strain ImGui's internal data structures and processing loops.
    *   **Example:** An attacker repeatedly pastes a multi-megabyte string into an `ImGui::InputText` field, causing the application to freeze while ImGui attempts to process and render the massive input.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, resource exhaustion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement limits on the size of input accepted by ImGui widgets (e.g., using the `buf_size` parameter in `ImGui::InputText`). Implement rate limiting or input throttling for rapid events at the application level.
