# Threat Model Analysis for ocornut/imgui

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Text Input](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_text_input.md)

*   **Threat:** Buffer Overflow in Text Input
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides an input string to an ImGui text input field that exceeds the allocated buffer size *within ImGui*. This can overwrite adjacent memory managed by ImGui, potentially leading to application crashes or unexpected behavior within the ImGui context, and potentially exploitable if ImGui's internal structures are targeted.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, potential for memory corruption within ImGui, potentially exploitable for further vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected ImGui Component:** `ImGui::InputText`, potentially other text-based input widgets.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use ImGui's built-in size limits for input buffers when calling `ImGui::InputText`.
        *   Be aware of the maximum buffer sizes used by ImGui internally and ensure application logic doesn't rely on exceeding those limits.

## Threat: [Format String Vulnerability via User Input](./threats/format_string_vulnerability_via_user_input.md)

*   **Threat:** Format String Vulnerability via User Input
    *   **Description:** An attacker inputs a string containing format specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%x`) into an ImGui element, and this string is directly used by ImGui in a formatting function *within ImGui's own code* (though less common). This could lead to information disclosure (reading from the stack) or potentially arbitrary code execution within the application's process.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Affected ImGui Component:**  Potentially any ImGui element where user input is directly processed by ImGui's internal formatting functions (less common scenario).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure ImGui is not configured or used in a way that directly passes user-provided strings to internal formatting functions without sanitization.
        *   Keep ImGui updated, as vulnerabilities of this nature would likely be patched.
