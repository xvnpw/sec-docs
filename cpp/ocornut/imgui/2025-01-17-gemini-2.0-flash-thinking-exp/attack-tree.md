## Attack Tree Path: [Buffer Overflow in Text Input](./attack_tree_paths/buffer_overflow_in_text_input.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker provides an input string to a text field within the ImGui interface that exceeds the allocated buffer size.

**Mechanism:** ImGui, or more likely the application's handling of the input from ImGui, does not properly validate the length of the input.

**Consequence:** This can overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially corrupting program data, control flow, or even allowing the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code.

**Mitigation:** Implement strict input length validation before processing data received from ImGui text input fields. Use safe string handling functions that prevent buffer overflows.

## Attack Tree Path: [Format String Vulnerability (Less Likely, but possible if ImGui uses printf-like functions unsafely)](./attack_tree_paths/format_string_vulnerability__less_likely__but_possible_if_imgui_uses_printf-like_functions_unsafely_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker injects format specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%x`, `%n`) into a text input field that is subsequently used in a function like `printf` or a similar formatting function without proper sanitization.

**Mechanism:** If the application directly uses user-provided input in format strings, the format specifiers can be interpreted by the formatting function to read from arbitrary memory locations (information leakage) or even write to arbitrary memory locations (potentially leading to code execution).

**Consequence:** This can lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.

**Mitigation:** Avoid using user-provided input directly in format strings. If necessary, use secure alternatives or carefully sanitize the input to remove or escape format specifiers. This is less likely in direct ImGui usage but could occur in custom rendering or logging tied to ImGui input.

## Attack Tree Path: [Input Injection leading to Application Logic Errors](./attack_tree_paths/input_injection_leading_to_application_logic_errors.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts specific input sequences through ImGui elements (buttons, sliders, text fields) that exploit vulnerabilities in the application's logic for handling these inputs.

**Mechanism:** The application's code that reacts to ImGui events might have flaws in its state management, authorization checks, or data processing. Carefully crafted input can trigger unexpected state transitions, bypass security checks, or cause the application to perform unintended actions.

**Consequence:** This can lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other application-specific vulnerabilities.

**Mitigation:** Thoroughly review and test the application's logic for handling ImGui events. Implement proper input validation and authorization checks at the application level. Follow the principle of least privilege when designing event handlers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Exposure via ImGui Display](./attack_tree_paths/data_exposure_via_imgui_display.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application displays sensitive information directly through ImGui elements without proper sanitization or access control.

**Mechanism:** The application might retrieve sensitive data and directly render it in ImGui text fields, labels, or other UI elements without considering who has access to the UI or the potential for information leakage.

**Consequence:** Unauthorized users can view confidential data displayed in the application's interface.

**Mitigation:** Avoid displaying sensitive data directly in the UI unless absolutely necessary. Implement proper access controls and sanitization techniques to mask or redact sensitive information. Consider alternative ways to present information that don't directly expose sensitive details.

## Attack Tree Path: [Logic Bugs in Application's ImGui Event Handlers](./attack_tree_paths/logic_bugs_in_application's_imgui_event_handlers.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application's code that handles events triggered by user interactions with ImGui elements contains logical flaws or vulnerabilities.

**Mechanism:** When a user interacts with an ImGui element (e.g., clicks a button, changes a slider), the associated event handler in the application might have vulnerabilities such as race conditions, incorrect state updates, or missing authorization checks.

**Consequence:** This can lead to unintended actions, data corruption, security bypasses, or denial of service.

**Mitigation:** Implement robust error handling and validation within ImGui event handlers. Carefully consider all possible states and input combinations. Perform thorough testing, including edge cases and negative testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Custom ImGui Widgets (If used)](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_custom_imgui_widgets__if_used_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application utilizes custom-built ImGui widgets, these widgets might contain security vulnerabilities within their implementation.

**Mechanism:** Custom widgets might have flaws such as buffer overflows in their rendering or input handling logic, incorrect state management, or other security weaknesses if not developed with security in mind.

**Consequence:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in custom widgets can lead to various issues, including crashes, arbitrary code execution, or data manipulation, depending on the nature of the flaw.

**Mitigation:** Subject custom ImGui widgets to the same rigorous security review and testing as the rest of the application code. Follow secure coding practices when developing custom widgets, including input validation, safe memory management, and proper error handling.
