## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation After ImGui Processing](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_after_imgui_processing.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify All Input Points:**  List every ImGui widget that accepts user input (e.g., `InputText`, `InputInt`, `SliderFloat`, `Checkbox`, `Combo`, etc.).
    2.  **Post-ImGui Validation:** Immediately *after* retrieving the value from the ImGui widget (e.g., after calling `ImGui::InputText`), implement validation checks *before* the value is used anywhere else in the application.  This is crucial because ImGui itself does *minimal* internal validation.
    3.  **Type Validation:**  Ensure the data type matches expectations.  If you expect an integer, verify it's not a string or a floating-point number outside the integer range. Use C++ type checking and conversion functions (e.g., `std::stoi`, `std::stof`, with appropriate error handling) *after* retrieving the value from ImGui.
    4.  **Range Validation:** For numerical inputs, define minimum and maximum acceptable values.  Use `if` statements or similar constructs to check if the value (obtained from ImGui) falls within the allowed range.
    5.  **Length Validation:** For text inputs (obtained from `ImGui::InputText` or similar), set a maximum length.  Use `std::string::length()` or similar to check the string's length before using it.
    6.  **Format Validation:** If the input (from an ImGui widget) must adhere to a specific format (e.g., email, date, URL), use regular expressions (`std::regex`) or specialized parsing libraries to validate the format.
    7.  **Whitelist (Preferred):**  Define a set of *allowed* characters or values.  Reject any input (from ImGui) that doesn't match the whitelist.
    8.  **Error Handling:**  If validation fails, handle the error gracefully.  This might involve:
        *   Displaying an error message to the user (using ImGui itself, if appropriate, e.g., with `ImGui::TextColored` or a custom popup).
        *   Resetting the ImGui widget to a default value (e.g., using the `*` pointer argument to `ImGui::InputInt`).
        *   Preventing the application from using the invalid input.
        *   Logging the error.
    9. **Centralized Validation (Optional):** Consider creating reusable validation functions that take the ImGui widget's output as input.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** If ImGui input is directly rendered in a web context, unvalidated input could allow injection of malicious JavaScript. *Impact: Eliminates the risk if input is properly sanitized for the target context after being retrieved from ImGui.*
    *   **Buffer Overflow (Severity: High):**  Unbounded text input from `ImGui::InputText` could lead to buffer overflows. *Impact: Prevents buffer overflows by enforcing length limits on data retrieved from ImGui.*
    *   **Code Injection (Severity: Critical):** If ImGui input is used to construct commands, unvalidated input could allow code injection. *Impact: Reduces the risk by validating ImGui input against expected formats.*
    *   **Logic Errors (Severity: Medium to High):**  Unexpected input values from ImGui can cause unintended behavior. *Impact: Improves application stability by ensuring ImGui input conforms to constraints.*
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** Extremely long input strings from ImGui could consume excessive resources. *Impact: Reduces DoS risk by limiting ImGui input sizes.*

*   **Impact:**  Significantly reduces the risk of various vulnerabilities by ensuring that all data *received from ImGui widgets* is validated.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Validation exists for some numerical inputs and some text fields.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive validation is missing for many text input fields.
    *   Format validation and whitelisting are not consistently implemented.
    *   Centralized validation functions are not used.
    *   Error handling for failed validation is inconsistent.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting and Input Throttling (ImGui Interaction Level)](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_and_input_throttling__imgui_interaction_level_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify High-Frequency Interactions:** Determine which ImGui widgets can be interacted with rapidly (buttons, sliders, rapidly changing text fields using `ImGuiInputTextFlags_EnterReturnsTrue` or callbacks).
    2.  **Implement a Timer/Counter (Per Widget):**  For each identified widget, use a timer or counter *within your ImGui code* to track the time since the last interaction or the number of interactions within a time window.  This can be done using `ImGui::GetTime()` or your own timer mechanism.
    3.  **Define Thresholds:** Set reasonable thresholds for interaction frequency *specific to each ImGui widget*.
    4.  **Throttle Updates:** If the interaction frequency exceeds the threshold, *skip* the processing of the ImGui widget's state change.  Do *not* call the application logic that depends on the widget's value.  You can achieve this by conditionally executing code based on the timer/counter.
    5.  **Consider User Feedback (Within ImGui):**  Optionally, provide visual feedback *within ImGui* (e.g., briefly disabling the widget using `ImGui::BeginDisabled`/`ImGui::EndDisabled` or displaying a message with `ImGui::Text`).
    6. **Prioritize Critical Operations:** If a user is rapidly clicking a critical button (like "Save"), ensure at least one operation completes.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):**  Rapid interactions with ImGui widgets could trigger expensive operations. *Impact: Reduces DoS risk by limiting the rate of ImGui interactions that trigger application logic.*
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Severity: Low to Medium):** If ImGui input is used for authentication, rate limiting can slow down attacks. *Impact: Makes brute-force attacks more difficult.*

*   **Impact:**  Reduces DoS risk and makes brute-force attacks less effective. Improves responsiveness by preventing UI interactions from overwhelming the system.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Rate limiting is not implemented for *any* ImGui widgets.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure `imgui.ini` Handling (or Disable It) - *Direct ImGui API Control*](./mitigation_strategies/secure__imgui_ini__handling__or_disable_it__-_direct_imgui_api_control.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Assess Necessity:** Determine if your application needs to persist ImGui's UI state.
    2.  **Disable if Possible:** If persistence is *not* required, disable `imgui.ini` entirely using the ImGui API:
        ```c++
        ImGuiIO& io = ImGui::GetIO();
        io.IniFilename = nullptr; // Directly controls ImGui's behavior
        ```
    3.  **Secure Location (If Necessary):** If `imgui.ini` *is* required, choose a secure, application-specific directory.  Use platform-specific APIs to determine the appropriate location.
    4.  **Restrict Permissions:** Set appropriate file system permissions.
    5.  **Validate Contents (If Used):** If you *must* use `imgui.ini`, implement validation upon loading.  This involves *parsing the data that ImGui loads* and checking it:
        *   **Parse the File:** Use ImGui's built-in parsing functions (or a robust INI parser).
        *   **Check for Expected Keys:** Verify that the file contains only expected keys.
        *   **Validate Values:** Check values for reasonable ranges and formats.
        *   **Checksum/Signature (Optional):** Calculate a checksum or signature.
    6. **Limit Influence:** Do *not* use `imgui.ini` to control critical application behavior. Use it *only* for UI layout as intended by ImGui.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Low to Medium):** An attacker modifying `imgui.ini` might glean information. *Impact: Reduces risk by securing the file or disabling it via the ImGui API.*
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Low):** A malicious `imgui.ini` could cause ImGui to enter an unstable state. *Impact: Reduces risk by validating the file's contents (loaded by ImGui).*
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: Low):** Unlikely, but minimizes potential.

*   **Impact:**  Reduces risks by securing or disabling the `imgui.ini` file *using ImGui's own configuration options*.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. The application uses `imgui.ini`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The `imgui.ini` file contents are *not* validated.
    *   File permissions are not explicitly set.
    *   Checksum verification is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Debugging Features in Production - *Direct ImGui API Calls*](./mitigation_strategies/disable_debugging_features_in_production_-_direct_imgui_api_calls.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Debugging Features:** Identify all ImGui debugging features:
        *   `ImGui::ShowDemoWindow()`
        *   `ImGui::ShowMetricsWindow()`
        *   `ImGui::ShowStyleEditor()`
        *   Any custom debugging windows using ImGui.
    2.  **Conditional Compilation:** Use preprocessor directives to conditionally compile out these *calls to the ImGui API*:
        ```c++
        #ifndef NDEBUG
            ImGui::ShowDemoWindow(); // Direct ImGui API call
        #endif
        ```
    3.  **Build System Integration:** Ensure your build system defines `NDEBUG` correctly.
    4.  **Testing:** Test both debug and production builds.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium):** Debugging features can reveal sensitive information. *Impact: Eliminates risk by removing calls to ImGui debugging functions.*
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Low):** Some debugging features might have overhead. *Impact: Reduces risk by removing potentially vulnerable ImGui calls.*
    *   **Reverse Engineering (Severity: Medium):** Debugging features can aid reverse engineering. *Impact: Makes reverse engineering harder.*

*   **Impact:** Eliminates the risk of exposing sensitive information via ImGui's debugging features.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. `ImGui::ShowDemoWindow()` is conditionally compiled out.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Other debugging features might not be consistently disabled.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Font Handling (ImGui Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_font_handling__imgui_configuration_.md)

* **Description:**
    1.  **Prefer Embedded Fonts:** Embed font data directly into your application. Use a tool like `binary_to_compressed_c.cpp` (from the ImGui repository) to convert font files to C++ code, then use `ImGuiIO::Fonts->AddFontFromMemoryTTF` or `ImGuiIO::Fonts->AddFontFromMemoryCompressedTTF` to load them. This is the most secure option as it avoids *any* external file loading by ImGui.
    2.  **Restrict Font Loading Paths (If Necessary):** If you *must* load fonts from files, use `ImGuiIO::Fonts->AddFontFromFileTTF` with a *carefully controlled path*.  Restrict this path to a trusted, application-specific location.  Do *not* allow loading from arbitrary user-specified paths. This directly controls ImGui's font loading behavior.
    3.  **Validate Font Files (If Necessary):** If you load fonts from external files, validate them *before* passing them to `ImGuiIO::Fonts->AddFontFromFileTTF`.  This is complex and requires a font validation library.
    4. **Avoid User-Provided Fonts:** Do not allow users to upload or specify fonts.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Code Execution (Severity: Critical):** Malicious font files can exploit vulnerabilities. *Impact: Significantly reduces (or eliminates, with embedded fonts) risk by controlling how ImGui loads fonts.*
    * **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** A corrupted font file could cause issues. *Impact: Reduces DoS risk by validating font files (if used) and restricting ImGui's loading paths.*

* **Impact:** Reduces code execution and DoS risks related to ImGui's font handling.

* **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Fonts are loaded from the application's directory.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Font file validation is *not* implemented.
    *   Switching to embedded fonts (using ImGui's memory loading functions) is the best option.
    *   The font loading path should be more restricted.
