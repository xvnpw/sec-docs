# Threat Model Analysis for ocornut/imgui

## Threat: [Input Buffer Overflow in `InputText()`](./threats/input_buffer_overflow_in__inputtext___.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides an excessively long string to an `ImGui::InputText()` field that lacks proper bounds checking *within ImGui's internal handling*. The attacker crafts the input to exceed the allocated buffer size, potentially overwriting adjacent memory used by ImGui. This is *distinct* from application-level buffer overflows.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Potential application crash (Denial of Service).
    *   Possible arbitrary code execution (if the overflow overwrites critical data or function pointers *within ImGui's memory space*, though less likely with modern memory protections).
    *   Unpredictable application behavior.
*   **ImGui Component Affected:** `ImGui::InputText()`, and potentially related internal string handling functions *within the ImGui library*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical if code execution is possible, but more likely High due to DoS).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use `InputText()` with Size Limits:** Always use the `ImGui::InputText()` overload that accepts a buffer size parameter (`char buf[size]`).  *Never* use an unbounded buffer. This is the primary mitigation.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** Specifically target `InputText()` with fuzzing, focusing on edge cases and boundary conditions *within ImGui's parsing*.
    *   **Stay Updated:**  Regularly update to the latest version of ImGui, as vulnerabilities are often patched quickly.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Excessive Widget Creation](./threats/denial_of_service_via_excessive_widget_creation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker repeatedly triggers the creation of a large number of ImGui windows, widgets (buttons, sliders, etc.), or deeply nested layouts.  This overwhelms ImGui's internal memory management and rendering systems. The attack vector could be through a script interacting with exposed ImGui controls, or by exploiting a vulnerability in the application logic that *unintentionally* creates excessive ImGui elements.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Application slowdown and unresponsiveness due to high CPU and memory usage *within ImGui*.
    *   Application crash due to memory exhaustion *caused by ImGui's internal allocations*.
*   **ImGui Component Affected:**  All widget creation functions (e.g., `ImGui::Begin()`, `ImGui::Button()`, `ImGui::SliderFloat()`, etc.), and layout functions (e.g., `ImGui::Columns()`, `ImGui::TreeNode()`) *within the ImGui library*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Limit Widget Count (Application-Level, but ImGui-Focused):** Implement application-level logic to restrict the maximum number of *ImGui* windows, widgets, and nested elements. This is crucial for preventing ImGui-specific DoS.
    *   **Rate Limiting (Application-Level, ImGui-Focused):**  Limit the rate at which new *ImGui* windows or widgets can be created.
    *   **Resource Monitoring (ImGui-Specific):** Monitor ImGui's resource usage (if possible) and trigger alerts or take corrective action if thresholds are exceeded. This might involve custom instrumentation.

## Threat: [Code Execution via Vulnerable Callback Function (Indirect, but High Risk due to ImGui)](./threats/code_execution_via_vulnerable_callback_function__indirect__but_high_risk_due_to_imgui_.md)

* **Description:** The application uses an ImGui callback function (e.g., for a button click) that contains a vulnerability (e.g., a buffer overflow, format string vulnerability). An attacker triggers the callback through ImGui. While the vulnerability is in the *application's* code, the attack vector is *through* ImGui, making it relevant here.
* **Impact:**
    * Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the application.
* **ImGui Component Affected:** Any ImGui widget that can trigger a callback (e.g., `ImGui::Button()`, `ImGui::MenuItem()`). The vulnerability is *not* in ImGui itself, but in the *application's* callback function, which is invoked *by* ImGui.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure Coding Practices:** Apply secure coding practices to *all* application code, especially callback functions. Avoid common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, format string bugs, and injection flaws.
    * **Input Validation (Application-Level):** Validate any data passed to the callback function, even if it originates from ImGui.
    * **Code Review:** Thoroughly review all callback functions for potential vulnerabilities. This is the most important mitigation.

## Threat: [Format String Vulnerability in Custom `Text()` Formatting](./threats/format_string_vulnerability_in_custom__text____formatting.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses `ImGui::Text()` or `ImGui::TextColored()` with user-provided format strings, creating a format string vulnerability.  An attacker provides a malicious format string *that is then processed by ImGui*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information disclosure (reading arbitrary memory locations).
    *   Potential application crash (Denial of Service).
    *   Possible arbitrary code execution (though less likely than information disclosure).
*   **ImGui Component Affected:** `ImGui::Text()`, `ImGui::TextUnformatted()`, `ImGui::TextColored()`, `ImGui::TextWrapped()`, `ImGui::LabelText()`. The vulnerability is in *how the application uses* these functions, but the functions themselves are the attack surface.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical if code execution is possible).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid User-Provided Format Strings:** *Never* allow users to directly control the format string passed to `ImGui::Text()` or related functions. This is the most crucial mitigation.
    *   **Use `ImGui::TextUnformatted()`:** If you just need to display a string without formatting, use `ImGui::TextUnformatted()`.
    *   **Sanitize Input (If Necessary, but Discouraged):** If you *must* use user-provided input in a formatted string, *heavily* sanitize it to remove any format specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%d`, `%x`). This is generally discouraged; prefer building the string programmatically.
    * **Use `ImGui::Text("%s", variable)`:** Use this safe method to display variable content.
