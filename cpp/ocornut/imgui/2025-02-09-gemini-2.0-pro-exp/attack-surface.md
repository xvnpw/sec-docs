# Attack Surface Analysis for ocornut/imgui

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated Drag and Drop Payloads](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_drag_and_drop_payloads.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploitation of vulnerabilities arising from insufficient validation of data received through ImGui's drag-and-drop functionality.  The application must not trust the data type or content provided by the drag-and-drop operation.
*   **How ImGui Contributes:** ImGui provides the drag-and-drop API, passing the payload data to the application.  The vulnerability arises if the application doesn't perform thorough validation.
*   **Example:** An attacker drags a malicious file (e.g., a script disguised as an image) onto an ImGui window. If the application doesn't validate the file type and content, it could execute the script.
*   **Impact:**  Code execution, data exfiltration, data modification, privilege escalation (depending on how the payload is processed).
*   **Risk Severity:**  High to Critical (depending on the context).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Thoroughly validate the type and content of the drag-and-drop payload *before* processing it.  Do *not* trust the reported file type.
        *   Treat the payload as untrusted input.
        *   Implement strict file type validation (e.g., using magic numbers or file signatures, not just extensions).
        *   If the payload is a file, consider processing it in a sandboxed environment.
    *   **User:** (Limited options)
        *   Be cautious about dragging and dropping files from untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated Clipboard Data](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_clipboard_data.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities arising from insufficient validation of data pasted from the system clipboard using ImGui's clipboard functions.
*   **How ImGui Contributes:** ImGui provides functions to interact with the clipboard, but the application must validate pasted data. The vulnerability is present if application uses data without validation.
*   **Example:** An attacker copies malicious code to the clipboard. The user then pastes this code into an ImGui `InputText` field that is used to execute commands. If the application doesn't validate the pasted data, it could execute the attacker's code.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, data exfiltration, data modification, privilege escalation (depending on how the pasted data is used).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the context).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Treat data pasted from the clipboard as untrusted input.
        *   Apply the same validation and sanitization procedures as for other input sources.
        *   Avoid directly executing or interpreting clipboard data without proper security checks.
    *   **User:** (Limited options)
        *   Be cautious about pasting data from untrusted sources into application input fields.

## Attack Surface: [Memory Corruption (ImGui Bugs)](./attack_surfaces/memory_corruption__imgui_bugs_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of *potential* memory corruption bugs (buffer overflows, use-after-free, etc.) within the ImGui library itself.  This is less likely than application-level vulnerabilities but remains a possibility.
*   **How ImGui Contributes:** This is a vulnerability *within* ImGui's code, not just in how the application uses it.
*   **Example:** A specially crafted sequence of ImGui calls, potentially triggered by unusual input or a specific combination of UI elements, could exploit a hypothetical buffer overflow in ImGui's rendering or internal data handling, leading to arbitrary code execution. (This is *hypothetical*; the risk is generally low but non-zero).
*   **Impact:**  Potentially arbitrary code execution (though this is rare).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (While rare, the potential impact is severe).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Keep ImGui up-to-date with the latest version. This is the *most important* mitigation.
        *   Use memory safety tools (e.g., AddressSanitizer, Valgrind) during development and testing.
        *   Follow secure coding practices in the application code that interacts with ImGui.
        *   Report any suspected bugs to the ImGui developers.
    *   **User:**
        *   Keep the application (and therefore the embedded ImGui library) updated.
