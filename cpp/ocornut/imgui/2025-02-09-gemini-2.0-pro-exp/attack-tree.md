## Attack Tree Path: [1. Input Validation & Sanitization Failures [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__input_validation_&_sanitization_failures__high_risk_.md)

This is the most critical area to address, as it presents the most readily exploitable vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Buffer Overflows](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__buffer_overflows.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker provides an input string that is longer than the buffer allocated by `ImGui::InputText` or `ImGui::InputTextMultiline`. This overwrites adjacent memory, potentially allowing the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code.
**Example:** If `ImGui::InputText("Name", buffer, 32)` is used, and the attacker provides a string longer than 31 characters (plus the null terminator), a buffer overflow occurs.
**Mitigation:**
    *   Always use the `size` parameter of `ImGui::InputText` and `ImGui::InputTextMultiline` to specify the maximum buffer size.
    *   Perform additional length checks *before* passing data to ImGui, especially if the input comes from an untrusted source.
    *   Use safer string handling techniques (e.g., `std::string` in C++) to avoid manual buffer management.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Text Input Fields (ImGui::InputText, ImGui::InputTextMultiline)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__text_input_fields__imguiinputtext__imguiinputtextmultiline_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker provides an input string that is longer than the buffer allocated by `ImGui::InputText` or `ImGui::InputTextMultiline`. This overwrites adjacent memory, potentially allowing the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code.
**Example:** If `ImGui::InputText("Name", buffer, 32)` is used, and the attacker provides a string longer than 31 characters (plus the null terminator), a buffer overflow occurs.
**Mitigation:**
    *   Always use the `size` parameter of `ImGui::InputText` and `ImGui::InputTextMultiline` to specify the maximum buffer size.
    *   Perform additional length checks *before* passing data to ImGui, especially if the input comes from an untrusted source.
    *   Use safer string handling techniques (e.g., `std::string` in C++) to avoid manual buffer management.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1. Exploit: Craft overly long string exceeding buffer size, overwriting adjacent memory. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1__exploit_craft_overly_long_string_exceeding_buffer_size__overwriting_adjacent_memory___criti_09e112ab.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker provides an input string that is longer than the buffer allocated by `ImGui::InputText` or `ImGui::InputTextMultiline`. This overwrites adjacent memory, potentially allowing the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code.
**Example:** If `ImGui::InputText("Name", buffer, 32)` is used, and the attacker provides a string longer than 31 characters (plus the null terminator), a buffer overflow occurs.

    *   Use safer string handling techniques (e.g., `std::string` in C++) to avoid manual buffer management.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2. Other Input Widgets (Custom Widgets)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2__other_input_widgets__custom_widgets_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Similar to text input fields, custom widgets that handle user input may have buffer overflow vulnerabilities if they don't properly validate input lengths.
**Mitigation:**
    *   Thoroughly validate all inputs in custom widgets, regardless of how they are presented to the user.
    *   Use safe string handling and memory management practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2.1. Exploit: Similar to 1.1.1, but targeting custom-implemented input handling. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_1__exploit_similar_to_1_1_1__but_targeting_custom-implemented_input_handling___critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Similar to text input fields, custom widgets that handle user input may have buffer overflow vulnerabilities if they don't properly validate input lengths.
**Mitigation:**
    *   Thoroughly validate all inputs in custom widgets, regardless of how they are presented to the user.
    *   Use safe string handling and memory management practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3. Drag and Drop](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3__drag_and_drop.md)

**Attack Vector:** If drag-and-drop functionality is implemented using ImGui, an attacker could drop a malicious file or data that, when processed, triggers a buffer overflow.
**Mitigation:**
    *   Validate the size and type of dropped data *before* processing it.  Do not assume the dropped data is safe.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3.1. Exploit: Drop malicious data that triggers a buffer overflow during processing. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_1__exploit_drop_malicious_data_that_triggers_a_buffer_overflow_during_processing___critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If drag-and-drop functionality is implemented using ImGui, an attacker could drop a malicious file or data that, when processed, triggers a buffer overflow.
**Mitigation:**
    *   Validate the size and type of dropped data *before* processing it.  Do not assume the dropped data is safe.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Format String Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__format_string_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker injects format string specifiers (like `%x`, `%n`, `%s`) into user-provided input that is then passed to functions like `ImGui::Text`, `ImGui::TextColored`, `ImGui::TextWrapped`, or `ImGui::TextUnformatted`.  This can allow the attacker to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations, leading to information disclosure or code execution.
**Example:** If `ImGui::Text(userInput.c_str())` is used, and `userInput` contains `%x`, the attacker can read values from the stack.
**Mitigation:**
    *   *Never* allow user input to directly control the format string.
    *   Use `ImGui::TextUnformatted` if you don't need formatting.
    *   If you need formatting, construct the format string *safely* and sanitize user input before inserting it into the format string.  For example: `ImGui::Text("User input: %s", Sanitize(userInput).c_str());` where `Sanitize` removes or escapes any format string specifiers.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1. ImGui::Text, ImGui::TextColored, etc.](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1__imguitext__imguitextcolored__etc.md)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.1. Exploit: Inject format string specifiers (%x, %n, etc.) into user-provided input that is then passed to these functions. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_1__exploit_inject_format_string_specifiers__%x__%n__etc___into_user-provided_input_that_is_the_cacb53df.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker injects format string specifiers (like `%x`, `%n`, `%s`) into user-provided input that is then passed to functions like `ImGui::Text`, `ImGui::TextColored`, `ImGui::TextWrapped`, or `ImGui::TextUnformatted`.  This can allow the attacker to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations, leading to information disclosure or code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2. Custom Widgets using sprintf-like functions](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2__custom_widgets_using_sprintf-like_functions.md)

**Attack Vector:** Similar to the above, but the vulnerability exists within the custom widget's code, using functions like `sprintf`, `snprintf`, etc., with user-controlled format strings.
**Mitigation:**
    *   Avoid using `sprintf`-like functions with user-controlled format strings.
    *   Use safer alternatives, such as string streams or carefully constructed format strings with proper sanitization.

**Attack Vector:** The attacker manipulates the values of `ImGui::SliderInt` or `ImGui::DragInt` to cause integer overflows or underflows in calculations that are subsequently used for memory allocation or array indexing. This can lead to out-of-bounds memory access.
**Example:** If a slider controls the size of an array, and the attacker sets the slider to a very large value, an integer overflow might occur when calculating the array size, leading to a smaller-than-expected allocation and a subsequent buffer overflow.
**Mitigation:**
    *   Validate the results of *all* calculations involving slider/drag values *before* using them for memory operations.
    *   Use checked arithmetic (e.g., libraries that detect integer overflows) if available.
