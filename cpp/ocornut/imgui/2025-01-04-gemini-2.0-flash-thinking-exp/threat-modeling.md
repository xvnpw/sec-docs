# Threat Model Analysis for ocornut/imgui

## Threat: [Malicious Input Injection via Text Fields](./threats/malicious_input_injection_via_text_fields.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Input Injection via Text Fields
    *   **Description:** An attacker could enter an excessively long string into an ImGui text input field. ImGui, if not properly integrated with input handling that limits buffer sizes *before* passing to ImGui, could potentially lead to buffer overflows within the application's memory management when processing the string data associated with the ImGui widget.
    *   **Impact:**  Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution, data corruption.
    *   **Affected ImGui Component:** `ImGui::InputText`, `ImGui::InputTextMultiline`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   The application integrating ImGui must validate and limit the length of input strings *before* they are passed to ImGui input functions.
        *   Ensure the application's memory management for strings associated with ImGui widgets is robust and prevents overflows.

## Threat: [Format String Vulnerability in `ImGui::Text`](./threats/format_string_vulnerability_in__imguitext_.md)

*   **Threat:** Format String Vulnerability in `ImGui::Text`
    *   **Description:** If the application uses user-controlled input directly as the format string argument in `ImGui::Text`, ImGui will directly interpret these format specifiers. This allows the attacker to read from arbitrary memory locations (information disclosure) or write to arbitrary memory locations (potentially leading to code execution or application instability) *within the application's process*.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for arbitrary code execution, application crash.
    *   **Affected ImGui Component:** `ImGui::Text`
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never directly use user input as the format string argument in `ImGui::Text`.
        *   Always use a fixed, predefined format string and pass user-provided data as arguments to the format string.

## Threat: [State Manipulation through UI Interaction](./threats/state_manipulation_through_ui_interaction.md)

*   **Threat:** State Manipulation through UI Interaction
    *   **Description:** If the application directly ties critical application state to the state of ImGui widgets without proper validation *before* acting on those state changes, an attacker could manipulate UI elements in unexpected ways. ImGui itself facilitates these state changes, and if the application doesn't validate them, it can lead to unintended and potentially harmful modifications of the application's internal state.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized modification of application state, potential for security breaches.
    *   **Affected ImGui Component:** All interactive widgets (buttons, checkboxes, sliders, etc.).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Maintain a clear separation between the UI state (as represented by ImGui) and the application's core logic.
        *   Implement strict validation and authorization checks *in the application's logic* for all UI interactions that are intended to affect the application's state.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom ImGui Widgets](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_imgui_widgets.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Custom ImGui Widgets
    *   **Description:** If the application utilizes custom ImGui widgets, vulnerabilities within the *widget's implementation* (which is part of the ImGui rendering and interaction flow) can directly lead to security issues. These could include buffer overflows, format string bugs, or logic errors within the custom widget's drawing or input handling code.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, application crash.
    *   **Affected ImGui Component:** Custom ImGui widgets.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, can be Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test all custom ImGui widgets for potential security flaws.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom widgets.
        *   Keep custom widget libraries up-to-date and apply security patches.
