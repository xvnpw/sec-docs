# Attack Surface Analysis for ocornut/imgui

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Input](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_input.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Maliciously Crafted Input**
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides specially crafted input data (keyboard, mouse, gamepad) that exploits vulnerabilities in how ImGui processes it.
    *   **How ImGui Contributes to the Attack Surface:** ImGui relies on the application to feed it raw input data. If ImGui's internal handling of this data has weaknesses (e.g., buffer overflows, incorrect parsing), malicious input can trigger unexpected behavior.
    *   **Example:** Providing an extremely long string for a text input field, potentially overflowing an internal buffer within ImGui.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, unexpected UI behavior, potential for arbitrary code execution if underlying vulnerabilities exist in ImGui's code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Regularly update ImGui to benefit from bug fixes and security patches. Consider using ImGui's built-in input filtering mechanisms if available and appropriate.

## Attack Surface: [Input Spoofing](./attack_surfaces/input_spoofing.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Input Spoofing**
    *   **Description:** An attacker manages to inject or simulate input events (keyboard presses, mouse movements, etc.) that are not initiated by the actual user.
    *   **How ImGui Contributes to the Attack Surface:** ImGui processes the input it receives without inherently verifying its origin. If ImGui itself has vulnerabilities in how it handles or trusts input events, it can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** Injecting mouse clicks on sensitive buttons or simulating keyboard shortcuts to trigger unintended actions within the application's UI managed by ImGui.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions within the application, bypassing security checks, manipulation of application state.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Regularly update ImGui to benefit from security patches that may address input handling vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration and Initialization](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_and_initialization.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Insecure Configuration and Initialization**
    *   **Description:**  The application's configuration or initialization of ImGui introduces security vulnerabilities within ImGui itself.
    *   **How ImGui Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  Improper configuration of ImGui's internal settings or loading of resources (like fonts) by the application can expose vulnerabilities within ImGui's code.
    *   **Example:** Loading fonts from untrusted sources, which could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in ImGui's font rendering or parsing logic.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution if vulnerabilities in ImGui's resource handling are exploited.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Load resources (like fonts) from trusted locations. Thoroughly review and understand ImGui's initialization options and their security implications. Keep ImGui updated.
