## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize User Input in Text Inputs](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_user_input_in_text_inputs.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Sanitize User Input in Text Inputs
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all ImGui text input widgets:** Review the codebase and locate every instance where `ImGui::InputText`, `ImGui::InputTextMultiline`, or similar text input functions are used.
    2.  **Implement input validation functions:** Create dedicated functions for validating different types of text input (e.g., alphanumeric, numeric, file paths, email addresses). These functions should:
        *   **Character Whitelisting/Blacklisting:** Allow only permitted characters or reject specific characters.
        *   **Length Limits:** Enforce maximum input length to prevent buffer overflows.
        *   **Format Checks:**  Use regular expressions or custom logic to verify input format (e.g., email format, date format).
        *   **Encoding Checks:** Ensure input is in the expected encoding (e.g., UTF-8) and handle invalid characters.
        *   **Escape Special Characters:** If input is used in commands or queries (e.g., SQL, shell commands), escape special characters to prevent injection attacks.
    3.  **Integrate validation into ImGui input callbacks:**  When processing input from ImGui text widgets, call the appropriate validation function *before* using the input in application logic.
    4.  **Provide user feedback:** If validation fails, display clear error messages to the user indicating the invalid input and how to correct it.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (High Severity):** SQL Injection, Command Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (if UI is web-based or generates web content) -  Mitigates by preventing malicious code from being injected through text inputs within ImGui widgets.
    *   **Buffer Overflow (High Severity):**  Mitigates by limiting input length in ImGui text widgets and preventing excessively long strings from overflowing buffers.
    *   **Path Traversal (Medium Severity):** If file paths are taken as input via ImGui, sanitization prevents users from accessing files outside of intended directories.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Ensures data entered through ImGui conforms to expected formats and prevents invalid data from corrupting application state.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks:** High Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of injection attacks originating from ImGui text inputs.
    *   **Buffer Overflow:** High Reduction - Effectively prevents buffer overflows from ImGui text input.
    *   **Path Traversal:** Medium Reduction - Reduces risk if file path input is used via ImGui.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues:** Medium Reduction - Improves data quality and application stability related to ImGui input.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic length limits are in place for some text inputs in the settings panel, but comprehensive validation and escaping are missing for ImGui text inputs.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Comprehensive input validation is missing across all ImGui text input fields, especially in areas where user input from ImGui is used to construct file paths, commands, or database queries.  Escaping special characters for command/query construction from ImGui input is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate Numerical Inputs](./mitigation_strategies/validate_numerical_inputs.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Validate Numerical Inputs
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify ImGui numerical input widgets:** Locate all uses of `ImGui::InputInt`, `ImGui::InputFloat`, `ImGui::SliderInt`, `ImGui::SliderFloat`, `ImGui::DragInt`, `ImGui::DragFloat`, and similar numerical input functions within ImGui.
    2.  **Define valid ranges:** Determine the acceptable minimum and maximum values for each numerical input in ImGui based on its intended use in the application logic.
    3.  **Implement range validation:**  After receiving numerical input from ImGui widgets, check if the value falls within the defined valid range.
    4.  **Handle out-of-range values:** If the input from ImGui is outside the valid range:
        *   **Clamp the value:**  Force the value to the nearest valid boundary (minimum or maximum) within ImGui interaction.
        *   **Reject the input:**  Display an error message in ImGui and revert to the previous valid value or a default value within the ImGui widget.
    5.  **Type validation:** Ensure the input from ImGui is of the expected numerical type (integer or float) and handle potential type conversion errors originating from ImGui input.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Integer Overflow/Underflow (Medium Severity):** Prevents calculations from overflowing or underflowing due to excessively large or small numerical inputs received via ImGui.
    *   **Logic Errors (Medium Severity):**  Ensures numerical inputs from ImGui are within expected bounds, preventing unexpected application behavior due to out-of-range values originating from ImGui.
    *   **Denial of Service (Low Severity):** In some cases, extremely large or small numbers from ImGui input could lead to resource exhaustion or performance issues; range validation can mitigate this.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Integer Overflow/Underflow:** Medium Reduction - Reduces the risk if numerical inputs from ImGui are used in calculations prone to overflow/underflow.
    *   **Logic Errors:** Medium Reduction - Improves application robustness and prevents logic errors due to invalid numerical inputs from ImGui.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Low Reduction - Minor impact on DoS prevention, primarily for specific scenarios related to ImGui input.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Sliders and drag inputs in ImGui often have built-in range limits defined in ImGui itself, but explicit validation for `InputInt` and `InputFloat` widgets is not consistently applied in application logic after receiving input from ImGui.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Explicit range validation needs to be implemented in the application logic for all numerical inputs obtained through ImGui, especially those obtained through `ImGui::InputInt` and `ImGui::InputFloat`, ensuring that values are checked against defined valid ranges before being used in calculations or system operations after being input via ImGui.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Input Buffer Sizes for Text Inputs](./mitigation_strategies/limit_input_buffer_sizes_for_text_inputs.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Limit Input Buffer Sizes for Text Inputs
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review ImGui InputText usage:** Examine all instances of `ImGui::InputText` and `ImGui::InputTextMultiline` in the codebase.
    2.  **Specify buffer size:** Ensure that the `buf_size` parameter in `ImGui::InputText` and `ImGui::InputTextMultiline` is explicitly set to a reasonable maximum size based on the expected input length for each ImGui text input.  Avoid using excessively large buffer sizes unnecessarily in ImGui.
    3.  **Consider dynamic allocation (with limits):** If input length in ImGui is highly variable, consider using dynamically allocated buffers, but always impose a maximum size limit to prevent unbounded memory allocation and potential DoS related to ImGui input.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow (High Severity):** Directly prevents buffer overflows in ImGui text input buffers by limiting the maximum size of the input buffer.
    *   **Denial of Service (Low Severity):** Prevents excessive memory consumption if unbounded input buffers are used in ImGui, which could lead to memory exhaustion and DoS.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow:** High Reduction - Effectively prevents buffer overflows caused by excessively long text input in ImGui.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Low Reduction - Minor impact on DoS prevention, primarily related to memory exhaustion from unbounded buffers used in ImGui.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. In some areas, fixed-size buffers are used with `ImGui::InputText`, but the sizes might not be consistently reviewed and optimized across the project for all ImGui text inputs.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  A systematic review of all `ImGui::InputText` and `ImGui::InputTextMultiline` calls is needed to ensure that `buf_size` is explicitly and appropriately set for each ImGui input field, preventing potential buffer overflows originating from ImGui.  Standardize buffer size limits based on ImGui input type and expected length.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure File Path Handling (via ImGui)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_file_path_handling__via_imgui_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure File Path Handling (via ImGui)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify ImGui file path inputs:** Locate any ImGui widgets (text inputs, combo boxes, etc.) that allow users to specify file paths or filenames.
    2.  **Implement path validation and sanitization:** Before using user-provided file paths obtained from ImGui:
        *   **Path Whitelisting:** If possible, restrict file access to a specific directory or set of directories. Validate that the provided path from ImGui is within the allowed whitelist.
        *   **Path Blacklisting:**  Prevent access to sensitive directories (e.g., system directories, configuration directories) by blacklisting specific path components or patterns for paths obtained from ImGui.
        *   **Canonicalization:** Convert paths from ImGui to their canonical form (e.g., using `realpath` or equivalent OS functions) to resolve symbolic links and remove redundant path components (e.g., `..`, `.`) to prevent path traversal attacks originating from ImGui input.
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Remove or escape potentially dangerous characters from file paths obtained from ImGui that could be interpreted by the operating system in unintended ways.
    3.  **Use safe file system APIs:**  Utilize secure file system APIs provided by the operating system or libraries that are designed to prevent path traversal and other file system vulnerabilities when handling file paths obtained from ImGui. Avoid using functions that directly interpret user-provided paths from ImGui without validation.
    4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the application process and user accounts have only the necessary file system permissions required for their intended operations, even when initiated through ImGui.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Path Traversal (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from accessing files or directories outside of the intended scope by manipulating file paths entered via ImGui.
    *   **Unauthorized File Access (High Severity):**  Mitigates the risk of users accessing or modifying files they are not authorized to access through file path manipulation in ImGui.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Prevents exposure of sensitive files or directory structures due to path traversal vulnerabilities initiated via ImGui.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Path Traversal:** High Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of path traversal attacks originating from ImGui file path inputs.
    *   **Unauthorized File Access:** High Reduction -  Effectively limits file access to authorized paths when initiated through ImGui.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Medium Reduction - Reduces the risk of sensitive information exposure through file system access initiated via ImGui.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic checks might be in place to prevent going above the application's root directory when using file paths from ImGui, but robust path canonicalization, whitelisting/blacklisting, and safe file system API usage are not consistently applied to file paths obtained via ImGui.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Comprehensive file path validation and sanitization are needed wherever ImGui is used to input or handle file paths. Implement path canonicalization, whitelisting/blacklisting, and ensure the use of secure file system APIs throughout the application when dealing with file paths originating from ImGui.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Debug Features in Production Builds (ImGui Related)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_debug_features_in_production_builds__imgui_related_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Debug Features in Production Builds (ImGui Related)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify debug-specific ImGui code:** Review the codebase and identify sections of ImGui related code that are specifically used for debugging purposes and are controlled by preprocessor directives (e.g., `#ifdef DEBUG`, `#ifndef RELEASE`). This might include debug menus, diagnostic displays built with ImGui, or ImGui features that expose internal application state for debugging.
    2.  **Ensure debug ImGui code is conditionally compiled:** Verify that all debug-related ImGui code is properly enclosed within conditional compilation blocks (e.g., `#ifdef DEBUG`).
    3.  **Configure build system for release builds:**  Ensure that the build system is configured to compile release builds *without* the `DEBUG` preprocessor definition (or with `RELEASE` defined). This will effectively exclude debug ImGui code from production builds.
    4.  **Test production builds:** Thoroughly test production builds to confirm that debug ImGui features are indeed disabled and that the application functions correctly without them.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive debug information (e.g., internal variables displayed in ImGui, memory addresses shown in ImGui, system paths revealed through ImGui debug windows) in production environments.
    *   **Unintended Functionality (Medium Severity):**  Debug ImGui features might provide unintended access to administrative or privileged functionalities that should not be available in production.
    *   **Increased Attack Surface (Low Severity):** Debug ImGui features can sometimes introduce additional attack vectors or vulnerabilities that are not present in release builds.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Medium Reduction - Reduces the risk of exposing sensitive debug information through ImGui in production.
    *   **Unintended Functionality:** Medium Reduction - Prevents unintended access to debug-related functionalities exposed via ImGui.
    *   **Increased Attack Surface:** Low Reduction - Minor reduction in attack surface by removing debug ImGui code.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Debug menus built with ImGui are generally disabled in release builds through preprocessor directives, but a comprehensive review to ensure *all* debug-related ImGui code is properly excluded in production is needed.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  A thorough audit of the codebase is required to identify and conditionally compile *all* debug-related ImGui code.  Specifically, review any ImGui windows, menus, or widgets that are used for debugging and ensure they are disabled in release builds.  Automate checks in the build process to verify debug ImGui feature exclusion.
