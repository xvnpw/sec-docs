## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Application Logic via UI Interaction [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_application_logic_via_ui_interaction__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is a broad category encompassing attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in how the application *uses* ImGui to handle user interactions and UI events. The core issue is that the application's logic, when triggered by UI actions, might contain flaws that attackers can leverage.
*   **How it Works:** Attackers interact with the ImGui-based UI in ways not anticipated by developers, triggering unexpected code paths or states within the application. This can be achieved through various UI manipulations like button clicks, menu selections, input field entries, and drag-and-drop actions.
*   **Why High-Risk:** This is high-risk because it directly targets the application's core functionality. Logic flaws are common software vulnerabilities, and the UI provides a readily accessible attack surface. Successful exploitation can lead to a wide range of impacts, from data corruption to unauthorized access and system compromise.

    *   **1.1. Trigger Unintended Application Functionality [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting logic flaws in event handlers or bypassing access controls through UI manipulation.
        *   **How it Works:**
            *   **Exploit Logic Flaws in Event Handlers [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers analyze how UI events (like button clicks) are handled by the application's code. They then craft specific sequences of UI interactions to trigger logic errors or unintended code execution within these event handlers.
            *   **Bypass Access Controls via UI Manipulation [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers identify UI elements that are intended to control access to certain features or data. They then manipulate the UI (e.g., by revealing hidden elements, modifying UI state, or crafting specific input) to circumvent these UI-based access controls and gain unauthorized access.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Logic flaws in event handlers can lead to unpredictable and potentially harmful behavior. UI-based access controls are often weaker than backend enforcement and can be easily bypassed.

    *   **1.2. Manipulate Application State via UI [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Modifying sensitive settings or injecting malicious data through UI input fields.
        *   **How it Works:**
            *   **Modify Sensitive Settings via UI [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers identify UI elements that control sensitive application settings (e.g., permissions, security configurations). They then manipulate the UI to change these settings maliciously, potentially weakening security or gaining unauthorized privileges.
            *   **Inject Malicious Data via UI Input Fields [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:** Attackers use ImGui text input fields to inject malicious data. If the application doesn't properly sanitize this input before processing it (e.g., in commands, database queries, or file operations), it can lead to injection vulnerabilities like command injection, SQL injection, or format string bugs.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Modifying sensitive settings can directly compromise the application's security posture. Injection vulnerabilities are notoriously dangerous, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code, access sensitive data, or compromise the entire system. **Input injection via UI is a Critical Node** because it's a very common and high-impact vulnerability if not properly addressed.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Social Engineering via UI [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__social_engineering_via_ui__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Using the ImGui-based UI as a vector for social engineering attacks, specifically phishing. While not a direct technical vulnerability in ImGui or the application's core logic, it exploits the UI to deceive users.
*   **How it Works:** Attackers design UI elements within the application that mimic legitimate login forms, prompts, or other trusted UI components. They then trick users into interacting with these fake elements, often to steal credentials or sensitive information.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Phishing attacks are effective because they target human psychology rather than technical weaknesses. Even a technically secure application can be compromised if users are tricked into revealing their credentials.  The UI, created with ImGui, becomes the deceptive tool.

    *   **2.1. Phishing Attacks via UI [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting phishing UI elements to trick users into providing sensitive information.
        *   **How it Works:** Attackers design fake UI elements that closely resemble legitimate parts of the application's UI. These fake elements might include login forms, password reset prompts, or requests for personal information. Users, believing they are interacting with the real application, enter their credentials or sensitive data, which is then captured by the attacker.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Phishing is a highly successful attack vector, especially against less technically savvy users.  The impact can be severe, leading to credential theft, account takeover, and data breaches.
