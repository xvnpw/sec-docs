# Threat Model Analysis for ocornut/imgui

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Text Input Fields](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_text_input_fields.md)

Description: An attacker provides excessively long input into an ImGui text input field. The application, failing to validate input length, writes beyond allocated buffer memory. This can lead to application crash, memory corruption, or potentially arbitrary code execution if exploited further.
Impact: Application crash, data corruption, potential arbitrary code execution, denial of service.
ImGui Component Affected: `ImGui::InputText`, `ImGui::InputTextMultiline` functions and related input handling.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement input validation and length limits in the application code *after* receiving input from ImGui.
    * Utilize ImGui's `ImGuiInputTextFlags_CharsMaxLength` flag to limit input length on the UI side as a first line of defense, but *always* validate server-side.
    * Employ safe string handling functions (e.g., using bounded string copies) in the application.

## Threat: [Format String Vulnerabilities (Indirect)](./threats/format_string_vulnerabilities__indirect_.md)

Description: An attacker injects format string specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%x`) into text input fields within ImGui. If the application uses this user-controlled input directly in format string functions (like `printf`, `sprintf`, logging functions) without sanitization, the attacker can read from or write to arbitrary memory locations, potentially leading to information disclosure or code execution.
Impact: Information disclosure, arbitrary code execution, application crash.
ImGui Component Affected: `ImGui::InputText`, `ImGui::InputTextMultiline` functions and any component that allows user-provided string input.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * **Never** use user-provided strings directly as format strings in functions like `printf`, `sprintf`, `fprintf`, etc.
    * Use parameterized logging or formatting methods that prevent format string injection.
    * Sanitize or validate user input from ImGui to remove or escape format string specifiers before using it in any string formatting operations.

## Threat: [Input Injection Attacks](./threats/input_injection_attacks.md)

Description: An attacker crafts malicious input within ImGui text fields or other interactive elements. If the application uses this input to construct commands, queries (e.g., SQL), or other sensitive operations without proper sanitization, the attacker can inject malicious commands or code. Examples include command injection, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting (if ImGui is used in a web context indirectly).
Impact: Data breach, unauthorized access, system compromise, denial of service, depending on the injection type and application context.
ImGui Component Affected: All input components: `ImGui::InputText`, `ImGui::InputTextMultiline`, `ImGui::Combo`, `ImGui::Slider`, `ImGui::Drag`, etc., and any component that takes user input.
Risk Severity: Critical to High (depending on the application's backend and injection type)
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Treat all input from ImGui as untrusted and potentially malicious.
    * Implement robust input validation and sanitization based on the expected data type and format for each input field. Use whitelisting where possible.
    * Apply context-specific encoding or escaping to user input before using it in commands, queries, or other sensitive operations.

## Threat: [Accidental Exposure of Debug UI in Production](./threats/accidental_exposure_of_debug_ui_in_production.md)

Description: Developers unintentionally leave debug panels, diagnostic tools, or internal application state visualizations built with ImGui enabled in production builds. This exposes sensitive internal information to end-users or attackers.
Impact: Information disclosure, potential exposure of vulnerabilities, reduced user trust.
ImGui Component Affected: Entire ImGui integration, specifically debug panels and windows created using ImGui functions.
Risk Severity: Medium to High (depending on the sensitivity of exposed information)
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Use build configurations to strictly disable debug ImGui panels and features in production builds.
    * Employ preprocessor directives or feature flags to conditionally compile or execute debug-related ImGui code.
    * Thoroughly review and test production builds to verify no debug UI elements are accidentally included.

## Threat: [Exploitable Bugs in ImGui Code](./threats/exploitable_bugs_in_imgui_code.md)

Description: ImGui library itself contains undiscovered vulnerabilities (e.g., memory corruption bugs, logic errors). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if present in the used ImGui version.
Impact: Application crash, memory corruption, arbitrary code execution, denial of service, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
ImGui Component Affected: Core ImGui library code, potentially affecting any ImGui function or module.
Risk Severity: Medium to High (depending on the vulnerability type and exploitability)
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Stay updated with the latest stable version of ImGui and apply security patches promptly.
    * Monitor ImGui's issue tracker and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exposing Sensitive Application Settings through ImGui](./threats/exposing_sensitive_application_settings_through_imgui.md)

Description: Developers use ImGui to directly expose and allow modification of sensitive application settings (e.g., database credentials, API keys, security configurations) without proper access controls or auditing. An attacker gaining access to this UI can modify critical settings.
Impact: Unauthorized access, system compromise, data breach, privilege escalation.
ImGui Component Affected: ImGui panels and windows used for application configuration and settings management.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Avoid directly exposing sensitive application settings through ImGui in production user interfaces.
    * Implement strong access control mechanisms and authentication for any ImGui panels that allow modification of application settings.
    * Audit and log all changes made through ImGui interfaces that affect application configuration or security settings.

## Threat: [Reliance on Client-Side Security Controls in ImGui](./threats/reliance_on_client-side_security_controls_in_imgui.md)

Description: Developers implement security controls solely within ImGui (e.g., hiding UI elements, disabling buttons) to restrict access or functionality. An attacker can easily bypass these client-side controls by modifying the client application or intercepting communication.
Impact: Unauthorized access, privilege escalation, circumvention of security measures.
ImGui Component Affected: All ImGui UI elements used for implementing security controls (buttons, menus, visibility flags, etc.).
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * **Never** rely on client-side UI controls in ImGui for security enforcement.
    * Always implement security checks and access controls on the server-side or in the application's backend logic.
