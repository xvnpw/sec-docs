# Threat Model Analysis for mongodb/mongo

## Threat: [NoSQL Injection](./threats/nosql_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** NoSQL Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when incorporated into a MongoDB query without proper sanitization or parameterization, alters the query's intended logic. The attacker leverages MongoDB query operators (e.g., `$where`, `$regex`, `$gt`, `$ne`) within the input to bypass authentication, access unauthorized data, or, in some configurations, execute server-side JavaScript. This occurs when the application constructs BSON documents using string concatenation instead of the driver's BSON building functions.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breach: Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
        *   Data modification: Unauthorized alteration or deletion of data.
        *   Data exfiltration: Copying of sensitive data.
        *   Potential server-side code execution (depending on server configuration and injection specifics).
    *   **MongoDB Component Affected:**
        *   `mongo.Collection.Find()`, `mongo.Collection.FindOne()`, `mongo.Collection.UpdateOne()`, `mongo.Collection.UpdateMany()`, `mongo.Collection.DeleteOne()`, `mongo.Collection.DeleteMany()`, `mongo.Collection.Aggregate()`, and any other functions that accept a query filter (BSON document) as input. The core vulnerability is in the *application's* incorrect BSON construction.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Primary: Use BSON Builders:** *Always* use the Go driver's BSON document builders (`bson.D`, `bson.M`, `bson.E`, `bson.A`). *Never* concatenate user input into query strings. The driver handles escaping and type safety.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate all user input *before* use in database operations (data types, lengths, allowed characters). This is a secondary defense.
        *   **Schema Validation (Server-Side):** Use MongoDB's schema validation for data integrity at the database level.

## Threat: [Connection String Injection / Manipulation](./threats/connection_string_injection__manipulation.md)

*   **Threat:** Connection String Injection / Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains control over the connection string used by the Go driver. This often happens if the connection string is read from an untrusted source (e.g., a modifiable configuration file, user input, or an insecure environment variable). The attacker could redirect the connection to a malicious MongoDB server or inject unauthorized credentials.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breach: The attacker's rogue server receives all data.
        *   Data modification: The attacker can modify data sent to their server.
        *   Denial of Service: The application cannot connect to the legitimate database.
    *   **MongoDB Component Affected:**
        *   `mongo.Connect()`: Establishes the initial connection.
        *   `options.ClientOptions.ApplyURI()`: Parses the connection string.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Configuration:** Store the connection string in a secrets management service (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager). *Never* hardcode it.
        *   **Environment Variables (with Caution):** If using environment variables, ensure they are securely set and inaccessible to unauthorized users.
        *   **Input Validation (if applicable):** If *any* part of the connection string comes from user input (avoid this), rigorously validate it.
        *   **Least Privilege (Database User):** The database user in the connection string should have minimal permissions.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Connection Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service_via_connection_exhaustion.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Connection Exhaustion
    *   **Description:** The application fails to manage MongoDB connections properly, depleting the connection pool. Causes include connection leaks (not closing connections), excessive concurrent connections, and long-running operations without context management.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service: The application cannot connect to the database.
    *   **MongoDB Component Affected:**
        *   `mongo.Connect()`: Establishes connections.
        *   `mongo.Client.Disconnect()`: Closes connections.
        *   Internal connection pooling mechanisms (configurable via `options.ClientOptions`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Proper `Disconnect()` Usage:** *Always* call `client.Disconnect(ctx)` when finished with a client, even on errors. Use `defer`.
        *   **Context Management:** Use `context.Context` to control operation lifetimes. Cancel the context to release connections.
        *   **Connection Pool Configuration:** Tune connection pool settings (`MaxPoolSize`, `MinPoolSize`, `MaxConnIdleTime`) in `options.ClientOptions`.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor connection usage to detect leaks or excessive creation.

## Threat: [Unencrypted Communication (Missing TLS/SSL)](./threats/unencrypted_communication__missing_tlsssl_.md)

*   **Threat:** Unencrypted Communication (Missing TLS/SSL)
    *   **Description:** The application connects to MongoDB without TLS/SSL, or with improperly configured TLS/SSL (e.g., disabling certificate verification). This allows an attacker to intercept network traffic.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breach: Eavesdropping on all data, including credentials.
        *   Data modification: Potential modification of data in transit.
    *   **MongoDB Component Affected:**
        *   `mongo.Connect()`: The connection process.
        *   `options.ClientOptions.SetTLSConfig()`: Configures TLS/SSL.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce TLS/SSL:** *Always* use TLS/SSL (`tls=true` in the connection string).
        *   **Strong Certificate Verification:** *Never* disable certificate verification. Use a trusted CA.
        *   **Configure TLS Options:** Use `options.ClientOptions.SetTLSConfig()` for proper TLS settings (CA certificate, client certificate if needed, allowed TLS versions/ciphers).

## Threat: [Outdated Driver Version](./threats/outdated_driver_version.md)

*   **Threat:** Outdated Driver Version
    *   **Description:** The application uses an outdated MongoDB Go driver with known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Varies depending on the vulnerability: Could range from DoS to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **MongoDB Component Affected:**
        *   The entire driver.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the driver updated to the latest stable version.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use Go modules (`go.mod`) to manage dependencies.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use tools to identify vulnerable dependencies.
