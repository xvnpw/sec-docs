# Attack Surface Analysis for mongodb/mongo

## Attack Surface: [1. Injection Attacks (NoSQL & Server-Side JavaScript)](./attack_surfaces/1__injection_attacks__nosql_&_server-side_javascript_.md)

**Description:** Attackers manipulate application queries by injecting malicious code or commands into user-supplied data, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or execution of arbitrary code.
    *   **How MongoDB Contributes:** MongoDB's flexible query language (especially with features like `$where` and server-side JavaScript) can be exploited if user input is not properly sanitized. The Go driver is the conduit for these queries.
    *   **Example:**
        *   **NoSQL Injection:** A user input field for searching is directly used in a `bson.M` filter: `filter := bson.M{"name": userInput}`. If `userInput` is `{$ne: null}`, the query returns all documents.
        *   **Server-Side JavaScript Injection:** User input in a `$where` clause: `bson.M{"\$where": "this.name == '" + userInput + "'"} `. If `userInput` is `' || true || '`, the clause always evaluates to true.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breach (unauthorized access).
        *   Data modification/deletion.
        *   Arbitrary code execution (server-side JavaScript).
        *   Denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Parameterized Queries:** *Always* use the Go driver's `bson.D`, `bson.M`, and builder methods. *Never* concatenate user input directly.
        *   **Input Validation:** Strictly validate and sanitize *all* user input. Use whitelisting.
        *   **Avoid Server-Side JavaScript:** Minimize or eliminate its use. If unavoidable, apply *extremely* rigorous input validation.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Database users should have minimal permissions.

## Attack Surface: [2. Connection String Exposure/Injection](./attack_surfaces/2__connection_string_exposureinjection.md)

**Description:** Attackers gain access to or manipulate the connection string, allowing unauthorized database access or redirection to a malicious server.
    *   **How MongoDB Contributes:** The connection string contains all information to connect to a MongoDB instance, including credentials. The Go driver uses this string.
    *   **Example:**
        *   **Exposure:** Hardcoded connection string in publicly accessible source code.
        *   **Injection:** User input directly used to construct part of the connection string without validation.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized database access.
        *   Data breach, modification, or deletion.
        *   Connection to a malicious server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Storage:** *Never* hardcode connection strings. Use environment variables, secure configuration files, or a secrets management service.
        *   **Secure Transmission:** Use TLS/SSL for all connections.
        *   **Input Validation (if applicable):** If *any* part of the connection string is influenced by user input, *strictly* validate it. Use the driver's connection option builders.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Use database users with minimal permissions.

## Attack Surface: [3.  Unencrypted Connections (Missing TLS/SSL)](./attack_surfaces/3___unencrypted_connections__missing_tlsssl_.md)

**Description:** Data transmitted between the application and MongoDB is unencrypted, vulnerable to eavesdropping.
    *   **How MongoDB Contributes:** MongoDB supports both encrypted and unencrypted connections. The Go driver's configuration determines which is used.
    *   **Example:** The connection string omits `tls=true`, and the server doesn't enforce TLS/SSL.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breach (sensitive data intercepted).
        *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce TLS/SSL:** Always use TLS/SSL. Configure the MongoDB server to *require* it.
        *   **Connection String:** Use `tls=true` (or equivalent).
        *   **Certificate Verification:** Configure the Go driver to verify the server's certificate.
        *   **Strong Ciphers:** Use strong, modern TLS/SSL ciphers and protocols (TLS 1.2 or 1.3).

## Attack Surface: [4.  Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/4___denial_of_service__dos_.md)

**Description:** Attackers overwhelm the MongoDB server or the application's connection pool, preventing legitimate access.
    *   **How MongoDB Contributes:** MongoDB is susceptible to resource exhaustion. The Go driver's connection pooling and query execution are potential targets.
    *   **Example:**
        *   **Connection Exhaustion:** Repeatedly opening connections without closing them.
        *   **Resource-Intensive Queries:** Complex, unindexed queries consuming excessive resources.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Application unavailability.
        *   Service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Connection Pooling:** Configure the Go driver's connection pool appropriately. Set maximum connection limits.
        *   **Query Timeouts:** Use `$maxTimeMS` and driver timeouts.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the application side.
        *   **Input Validation:** Prevent excessively long/complex queries.
        *   **Indexing:** Optimize queries with indexes.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor server resources and set alerts.
        *   **MongoDB Server Configuration:** Limit resource consumption (e.g., `maxConns`).

## Attack Surface: [5.  Data Exposure (Insufficient Field-Level Encryption)](./attack_surfaces/5___data_exposure__insufficient_field-level_encryption_.md)

**Description:** Sensitive data is stored unencrypted at rest, vulnerable if the database is compromised.
    *   **How MongoDB Contributes:** MongoDB doesn't automatically encrypt data at rest (except MongoDB Enterprise with encryption at rest). The Go driver supports Client-Side Field Level Encryption (CSFLE).
    *   **Example:** PII stored in plain text.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breach.
        *   Compliance violations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Client-Side Field Level Encryption (CSFLE):** Use the Go driver's CSFLE to encrypt sensitive fields *before* sending them to the server.
        *   **MongoDB Enterprise Encryption at Rest:** If using Enterprise, enable encryption at rest.
        *   **Data Minimization:** Store only essential data.
        *   **Tokenization:** Replace sensitive data with tokens.
