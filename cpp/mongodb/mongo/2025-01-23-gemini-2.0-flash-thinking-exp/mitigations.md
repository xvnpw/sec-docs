# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mongodb/mongo

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/enable_authentication.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable Authentication
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access the MongoDB configuration file:** Locate your `mongod.conf` file.
    2.  **Edit the configuration file:** Open `mongod.conf` in a text editor with administrator privileges.
    3.  **Enable Security Section:** Ensure the `security` section exists. If not, add it.
    4.  **Enable Authorization:** Within the `security` section, add or modify the line `authorization: enabled`. This activates MongoDB's built-in authentication system.
    5.  **Restart MongoDB:** Restart the `mongod` service for the changes to take effect.
    6.  **Create Administrative User:** After restarting, connect to MongoDB using the `mongo` shell *without* authentication (initially). Create an administrative user using `db.createUser()` on the `admin` database. This user will be used for subsequent administrative tasks and user management within MongoDB.
    7.  **Authenticate:** From now on, all connections to MongoDB will require authentication using MongoDB's authentication mechanisms.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents anyone without valid MongoDB credentials from accessing the database, leveraging MongoDB's authentication system to control access.
    *   **Data Breach (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of data breaches by ensuring only authenticated users can interact with MongoDB data.
    *   **Data Manipulation (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized modification or deletion of data within MongoDB by enforcing authentication for all operations.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Breach:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Manipulation:** High Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, enabled in the production environment. MongoDB authentication is configured via `mongod.conf` and managed through Ansible during server provisioning. Verified by confirming authentication is required to access MongoDB databases in production.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Not currently missing in production. However, ensure authentication is consistently enabled across all MongoDB environments (development, staging, production) to maintain a consistent security posture.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Required Roles:** Analyze application access needs to MongoDB. Determine different user roles and the specific MongoDB privileges each role requires (e.g., read access to specific collections, write access to others, administrative privileges).
    2.  **Define Custom Roles in MongoDB:** Use MongoDB's `db.createRole()` command in the `mongo` shell to define custom roles. Specify the `privileges` array for each role, detailing MongoDB actions (e.g., `find`, `insert`, `update`, `remove`, `createCollection`) and resources (databases and collections within MongoDB) they apply to.
    3.  **Assign Roles to MongoDB Users:** When creating new MongoDB users with `db.createUser()` or updating existing users with `db.updateUser()`, assign the appropriate MongoDB roles using the `roles` array.
    4.  **Regularly Review MongoDB Roles and Permissions:** Periodically review defined MongoDB roles and user assignments to ensure they remain aligned with application needs and security best practices within the MongoDB context. Remove unnecessary MongoDB permissions and roles.
    5.  **Audit Role Usage in MongoDB:** Monitor user activity and role usage through MongoDB logs to detect any anomalies or potential privilege escalation attempts within the MongoDB system.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Prevents users from gaining access to MongoDB resources or operations beyond their intended scope, leveraging MongoDB's RBAC to enforce least privilege.
    *   **Insider Threats (Medium Severity):** Limits potential damage from compromised or malicious internal users by restricting their MongoDB access to only necessary data and operations within MongoDB.
    *   **Accidental Data Modification/Deletion (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of accidental data corruption or deletion within MongoDB by users with overly broad MongoDB permissions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Insider Threats:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Accidental Data Modification/Deletion:** Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic MongoDB roles like `readOnly` and `readWrite` are defined and assigned to application users in production MongoDB. Roles are defined in a MongoDB initialization script executed during deployment.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Granular MongoDB roles for specific collections and operations are not fully implemented. Need to refine MongoDB roles to align more closely with the principle of least privilege within MongoDB. For example, separate MongoDB roles for different microservices, limiting each service's access to only its required MongoDB collections.  Also, a process for regular MongoDB role review and audit is not formally established.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Bind to Specific Network Interfaces](./mitigation_strategies/bind_to_specific_network_interfaces.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Bind to Specific Network Interfaces
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access the MongoDB configuration file:** Locate and open `mongod.conf`.
    2.  **Edit the `net.bindIp` setting:** Find the `net` section and the `bindIp` setting in `mongod.conf`.
    3.  **Specify IP Addresses:** Replace the default `bindIp: 0.0.0.0` (bind to all interfaces) with specific IP addresses in the `mongod.conf`. This configures MongoDB to only listen on specified network interfaces.
        *   For local access only: `bindIp: 127.0.0.1`
        *   For access from specific internal networks: `bindIp: <internal_IP_address_1>,<internal_IP_address_2>,...`
    4.  **Restart MongoDB:** Restart the `mongod` service for changes to take effect.
    5.  **Verify Connectivity:** After restarting, ensure application servers and authorized clients can still connect to MongoDB using the specified IP addresses configured in `bindIp`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **External Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized connections to MongoDB from the public internet or untrusted networks by limiting the network interfaces MongoDB listens on.
    *   **Network-Based Attacks (Medium Severity):** Reduces the attack surface of MongoDB by limiting the network interfaces it listens on, making it less discoverable and accessible from broader networks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **External Unauthorized Access:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Network-Based Attacks:** Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, implemented in production and staging environments. `bindIp` is configured in `mongod.conf` to listen only on the internal network IP address of the MongoDB server. Configuration is part of the server provisioning process.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Not currently missing in production or staging. Ensure development environments also follow this practice for MongoDB instances, especially if they are accessible outside the developer's local machine. Document the configured `bindIp` settings clearly in MongoDB infrastructure documentation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Encryption at Rest](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_encryption_at_rest.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Encryption at Rest
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Encryption Method:** Decide on the encryption method for MongoDB's encryption at rest feature (e.g., using the built-in KMIP integration, or a cloud provider's KMS).
    2.  **Configure Encryption in `mongod.conf`:**
        *   **Access `mongod.conf`:** Locate and open `mongod.conf`.
        *   **Configure `security.encryption` Section:** Add or modify the `security.encryption` section in `mongod.conf`.
        *   **Enable Encryption:** Set `security.encryption.encryptionCipherMode` to a supported cipher mode (e.g., `AES256-CBC`).
        *   **Configure Key Management:** Configure the `security.encryption.kmip` or cloud provider KMS settings to manage encryption keys as per MongoDB documentation.
    3.  **Restart MongoDB:** Restart the `mongod` service. MongoDB will then encrypt data files on disk.
    4.  **Key Management:** Implement secure key management practices for the encryption keys used by MongoDB's encryption at rest feature, following best practices for key rotation, access control, and backup.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breach from Physical Media Theft (High Severity):** Protects sensitive MongoDB data if physical storage media (disks, backups) are stolen or improperly disposed of.
    *   **Data Breach from Unauthorized File System Access (High Severity):** Prevents data breaches if an attacker gains unauthorized access to the MongoDB server's file system but not to the running MongoDB instance itself.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach from Physical Media Theft:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Breach from Unauthorized File System Access:** High Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, enforced in production and staging environments. MongoDB encryption at rest is configured using [Specific KMS solution - replace with actual solution used]. Configuration is managed through `mongod.conf` and key management is integrated with [KMS system name].

*   **Missing Implementation:** Encryption at rest is not consistently enabled in development environments. Enabling it in development should be considered for data protection consistency across all MongoDB environments.  Regular key rotation for MongoDB encryption at rest should be implemented as part of key management best practices.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Encryption in Transit (TLS/SSL)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_encryption_in_transit__tlsssl_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Encryption in Transit (TLS/SSL)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Obtain TLS/SSL Certificates:** Acquire TLS/SSL certificates for your MongoDB server.
    2.  **Configure MongoDB for TLS/SSL in `mongod.conf`:**
        *   **Access `mongod.conf`:** Locate and open `mongod.conf`.
        *   **Configure `net.tls` Section:** Add or modify the `net.tls` section in `mongod.conf`.
        *   **Enable TLS:** Set `net.tls.mode: requireTLS` to enforce TLS for all connections to MongoDB.
        *   **Specify Certificate Paths:** Set `net.tls.certificateKeyFile` to the path of your server certificate and private key file for MongoDB.
        *   **Specify CA File (Optional but Recommended):** Set `net.tls.CAFile` to the path of the CA certificate file if using CA-signed certificates for MongoDB.
        *   **Disable TLS 1.0 (Recommended):** Consider disabling older TLS versions in MongoDB by setting `net.tls.disabledProtocols: TLS1_0`.
    3.  **Restart MongoDB:** Restart the `mongod` service.
    4.  **Configure Client Applications:** Update application connection strings and `mongo` shell connections to use TLS/SSL when connecting to MongoDB. This typically involves adding parameters like `tls=true` in the connection string.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Eavesdropping (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from intercepting and reading sensitive data transmitted between clients and the MongoDB server over the network.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity):** Protects against man-in-the-middle attacks targeting communication with the MongoDB server.
    *   **Data Breach in Transit (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of data breaches due to unencrypted network traffic to and from MongoDB.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Eavesdropping:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Breach in Transit:** High Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, enforced in production and staging environments. MongoDB TLS/SSL is configured in `mongod.conf` using CA-signed certificates. Application connection strings are configured to use `tls=true` for MongoDB connections.

*   **Missing Implementation:** TLS/SSL is not consistently enforced in development environments for MongoDB.  Need to provide easier ways to use TLS in development (e.g., self-signed certificates, simplified configuration scripts for MongoDB) to encourage consistent TLS usage across all MongoDB environments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Logging and Monitoring](./mitigation_strategies/implement_logging_and_monitoring.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Logging and Monitoring
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure MongoDB Logging:**
        *   **Access `mongod.conf`:** Locate and open `mongod.conf`.
        *   **Configure `systemLog` Section:**  Modify the `systemLog` section in `mongod.conf` to enable and configure logging.
        *   **Set Log Destination:**  Set `systemLog.destination` to `file` to log to a file, or `syslog` for system logging.
        *   **Specify Log Path (if file):** Set `systemLog.path` to specify the log file path.
        *   **Set Log Level (verbosity):** Adjust `systemLog.verbosity` to control the level of detail in MongoDB logs. Consider using a higher verbosity level for security auditing.
        *   **Enable Audit Logging (If Required):** For detailed audit trails, configure MongoDB's audit logging feature.
    2.  **Centralize Logs:**  Integrate MongoDB logs with a centralized logging system (SIEM or log management platform) for aggregation, analysis, and alerting.
    3.  **Monitor Logs for Security Events:** Set up monitoring and alerting rules in your logging system to detect suspicious activity in MongoDB logs, such as:
        *   Failed authentication attempts
        *   Unauthorized access attempts
        *   Privilege escalation attempts
        *   Unusual query patterns
        *   Administrative actions

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Delayed Breach Detection (Medium Severity):** Improves the ability to detect security breaches and incidents in MongoDB by providing audit trails and monitoring capabilities.
    *   **Insider Threats (Medium Severity):** Helps detect malicious activity by internal users within MongoDB through log analysis.
    *   **Operational Issues (Low Severity):**  Logging also aids in identifying and resolving operational issues within MongoDB, which can indirectly contribute to security by maintaining system stability.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Delayed Breach Detection:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Insider Threats:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Operational Issues:** Low Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. MongoDB logging is enabled in production and staging, logging to files. Logs are collected by a central logging system [Logging system name]. Basic monitoring for server availability is in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Detailed security monitoring and alerting rules for MongoDB logs are not fully implemented. Need to develop specific alerts for security-relevant events in MongoDB logs (e.g., failed logins, unauthorized operations).  Audit logging feature of MongoDB is not currently enabled and should be evaluated for enhanced audit trails.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Resource Limits and Quotas](./mitigation_strategies/implement_resource_limits_and_quotas.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Resource Limits and Quotas
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Connection Limits:**
        *   **Access `mongod.conf`:** Locate and open `mongod.conf`.
        *   **Set `net.maxIncomingConnections`:**  Configure `net.maxIncomingConnections` in `mongod.conf` to limit the maximum number of concurrent connections to MongoDB.
    2.  **Configure Operation Time Limits:**
        *   **Set `operationProfiling.slowOpThresholdMs`:** Configure `operationProfiling.slowOpThresholdMs` to identify slow-running operations in MongoDB.
        *   **Implement Application-Level Timeouts:** Set timeouts in your application code for MongoDB operations to prevent queries from running indefinitely and consuming resources.
    3.  **Consider `ulimit` (Operating System Limits):**  Use operating system `ulimit` settings to further restrict resource consumption by the `mongod` process (e.g., file descriptors, memory).
    4.  **Monitor Resource Usage:** Regularly monitor MongoDB resource usage (CPU, memory, connections) using MongoDB monitoring tools (e.g., `mongostat`, `mongotop`, MongoDB Atlas monitoring) to identify potential resource exhaustion or denial-of-service attempts.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Prevents denial-of-service attacks that attempt to exhaust MongoDB server resources (connections, memory, CPU) by limiting resource consumption.
    *   **Runaway Queries (Medium Severity):** Mitigates the impact of poorly written or malicious queries that could consume excessive resources and impact MongoDB performance.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Runaway Queries:** Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `net.maxIncomingConnections` is configured in `mongod.conf` in production and staging. Basic monitoring of CPU and memory usage is in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Operation time limits and application-level timeouts for MongoDB operations are not consistently implemented.  `ulimit` settings for the `mongod` process are not explicitly configured and should be reviewed.  More proactive monitoring and alerting for resource exhaustion scenarios in MongoDB should be implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Server-Side JavaScript Execution (If Not Needed)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_server-side_javascript_execution__if_not_needed_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Server-Side JavaScript Execution
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Assess JavaScript Usage:** Determine if your application relies on server-side JavaScript execution within MongoDB (e.g., `$where` queries, `mapReduce` with JavaScript functions, stored JavaScript functions). If not, disabling it is recommended.
    2.  **Disable JavaScript in `mongod.conf`:**
        *   **Access `mongod.conf`:** Locate and open `mongod.conf`.
        *   **Configure `security` Section:** Add or modify the `security` section in `mongod.conf`.
        *   **Disable JavaScript:** Set `security.javascriptEnabled: false` to disable server-side JavaScript execution in MongoDB.
    3.  **Restart MongoDB:** Restart the `mongod` service.
    4.  **Verify Application Functionality:** After disabling JavaScript, thoroughly test your application to ensure no functionality is broken due to the change. If any functionality relies on server-side JavaScript, you'll need to refactor it or re-enable JavaScript (with caution).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Server-Side JavaScript Injection/Execution (Medium Severity):** Reduces the attack surface by disabling a potentially risky feature. Server-side JavaScript execution in MongoDB can introduce vulnerabilities if not carefully managed and can be exploited for code injection or sandbox escapes.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Server-Side JavaScript Injection/Execution:** Medium Risk Reduction (if JavaScript is not needed)

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, disabled in production and staging environments. `security.javascriptEnabled: false` is configured in `mongod.conf`.  Application functionality has been verified to not rely on server-side JavaScript.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Not currently missing in production or staging. Ensure development environments also have server-side JavaScript disabled by default unless explicitly required for specific development tasks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Security Updates and Patching](./mitigation_strategies/regular_security_updates_and_patching.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Security Updates and Patching
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor MongoDB Security Advisories:** Subscribe to MongoDB security mailing lists, monitor the MongoDB security advisories page, and follow MongoDB release notes for security-related announcements.
    2.  **Establish Patching Schedule:** Define a schedule for applying security updates and patches to your MongoDB servers. Prioritize applying critical security patches promptly.
    3.  **Test Updates in Non-Production:** Before applying updates to production MongoDB instances, thoroughly test them in staging or development environments to ensure compatibility and prevent unexpected issues.
    4.  **Apply Updates to Production:**  Apply security updates to production MongoDB instances following your established patching schedule and change management procedures.
    5.  **Keep Drivers Updated:**  Ensure your application's MongoDB drivers are also kept up-to-date with the latest versions, as drivers may also contain security fixes.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known MongoDB Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Protects against exploitation of known security vulnerabilities in MongoDB software by applying patches that fix these vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known MongoDB Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have a process for monitoring security advisories, but the patching schedule is not strictly defined. Updates are typically applied during maintenance windows, but the process could be more formalized.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  A formal, documented patching schedule for MongoDB is missing.  Need to establish a clear process with defined timelines for applying security updates to MongoDB across all environments.  Automated patching processes should be explored to expedite patch deployment.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Parameterized Queries or Query Builders](./mitigation_strategies/use_parameterized_queries_or_query_builders.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Use Parameterized Queries or Query Builders
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Educate Developers:** Train developers on the risks of NoSQL injection and the importance of using parameterized queries or query builders provided by MongoDB drivers.
    2.  **Code Reviews:** Implement code review processes to ensure developers are consistently using parameterized queries or query builders and are not constructing queries by concatenating user input strings when interacting with MongoDB.
    3.  **Utilize Driver Features:**  Leverage the parameterized query or query builder features provided by your specific MongoDB driver (e.g., for Node.js, using Mongoose or the native MongoDB Node.js driver's query builder methods).
    4.  **Static Analysis (Optional):** Explore static analysis tools that can help detect potential NoSQL injection vulnerabilities in your code by identifying instances of string concatenation used in query construction for MongoDB.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **NoSQL Injection (High Severity):** Prevents NoSQL injection attacks against MongoDB by ensuring user input is properly handled and not interpreted as code within MongoDB queries.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **NoSQL Injection:** High Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Developers are generally aware of NoSQL injection risks and encouraged to use query builders. Code reviews are conducted, but specific focus on NoSQL injection vulnerabilities in MongoDB queries could be strengthened.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formal developer training on secure MongoDB query construction is needed.  Static analysis tools for NoSQL injection detection are not currently used and should be evaluated.  Code review checklists should explicitly include checks for secure MongoDB query construction practices.
