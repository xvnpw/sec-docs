# Attack Surface Analysis for mongodb/mongo

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected MongoDB Instance](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_mongodb_instance.md)

**Description:** The MongoDB instance is directly accessible from the internet or an untrusted network without proper access controls.

**How MongoDB Contributes:** MongoDB, by default, listens on a specific port (27017) and can be configured to bind to all network interfaces. If not secured, this allows direct connections *to the MongoDB service itself*.

**Example:** An attacker scans the internet for open port 27017 and connects to the MongoDB instance without needing authentication, gaining full access to the data.

**Impact:** Complete data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, potential for further lateral movement within the network.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Bind to Specific Interface:** Configure MongoDB to bind to the specific IP address of the server hosting it, not all interfaces (0.0.0.0).
*   **Authentication Requirement:** Ensure authentication is enabled and enforced by MongoDB.

## Attack Surface: [Disabled or Weak Authentication](./attack_surfaces/disabled_or_weak_authentication.md)

**Description:** MongoDB is running without authentication enabled, or with easily guessable or default credentials.

**How MongoDB Contributes:** MongoDB's authentication mechanisms (or lack thereof) *directly* control access to the database.

**Example:** A developer forgets to enable authentication in a development environment, and this instance is accidentally exposed. An attacker finds it and accesses all data. Alternatively, default credentials like "admin:password" are used and easily compromised.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to all data, potential for data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Enable Authentication:** Always enable authentication in MongoDB.
*   **Strong Passwords:** Enforce strong, unique passwords for all database users *within MongoDB*.
*   **Key File Authentication (for internal systems):** Consider using key file authentication *provided by MongoDB* for internal applications connecting to MongoDB.
*   **Regular Password Rotation:** Implement a policy for regular password changes *for MongoDB users*.

## Attack Surface: [NoSQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/nosql_injection.md)

**Description:**  Improperly sanitized user input is directly incorporated into MongoDB queries, allowing attackers to manipulate the query logic.

**How MongoDB Contributes:** MongoDB's query language, if not used carefully with user-provided data, is *inherently* susceptible to injection attacks.

**Example:** A web application takes a username as input and uses it directly in a `db.users.findOne({ username: userInput })` query. An attacker enters `{$ne: null}` as the username, bypassing the intended logic and potentially retrieving all user data.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to specific data, potential for bypassing authentication or authorization checks *within the database*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Parameterized Queries (or equivalent):** Utilize MongoDB driver features that allow for parameterized queries or similar mechanisms to separate code from data *when interacting with MongoDB*.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of TLS/SSL Encryption](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_tlsssl_encryption.md)

**Description:** Communication between the application and MongoDB is not encrypted using TLS/SSL.

**How MongoDB Contributes:** MongoDB handles network communication, and without TLS/SSL enabled *within MongoDB's configuration*, this communication is vulnerable to eavesdropping.

**Example:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application server and the MongoDB server and captures sensitive data, including credentials or business data being transmitted *to or from the MongoDB instance*.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transmitted over the network, including credentials, application data, and potentially personally identifiable information.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Enable TLS/SSL:** Configure MongoDB *itself* to use TLS/SSL for all connections.
*   **Certificate Management:** Implement proper certificate management practices, including using valid and trusted certificates *for MongoDB*.

## Attack Surface: [Running Outdated MongoDB Version](./attack_surfaces/running_outdated_mongodb_version.md)

**Description:** The MongoDB instance is running an outdated version with known security vulnerabilities.

**How MongoDB Contributes:** MongoDB, like any software, has vulnerabilities that are discovered and patched over time *within the MongoDB codebase*.

**Example:** A publicly known vulnerability exists in the running version of MongoDB that allows for remote code execution. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain control of the database server.

**Impact:** Potential for complete system compromise, data breaches, denial of service, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Regularly Update MongoDB:** Implement a process for regularly updating MongoDB to the latest stable version, including applying security patches *provided by MongoDB*.
