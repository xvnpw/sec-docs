## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise MongoDB Instance Directly [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_mongodb_instance_directly__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  The attacker aims to gain direct access to the MongoDB database server, bypassing the application layer. Success here grants broad control over the data.
**Why Critical:** Direct access allows for reading, modifying, or deleting any data, potentially leading to complete application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Authentication Weaknesses ***](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_authentication_weaknesses.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker attempts to bypass or circumvent MongoDB's authentication mechanisms.
**Why High-Risk:** Weak authentication is a common vulnerability, and successful exploitation provides direct access to the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. Use Default Credentials *** [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__use_default_credentials___critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker uses the default username and password provided by MongoDB or the application's initial setup.
**Why High-Risk and Critical:** Default credentials are widely known or easily discoverable and provide immediate, unauthorized access.
**Estimations:**
* Likelihood: Medium
* Impact: High
* Effort: Low
* Skill Level: Beginner
* Detection Difficulty: Low

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2. Brute-Force Weak Credentials ***](./attack_tree_paths/2_2__brute-force_weak_credentials.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker attempts to guess the username and password by trying a large number of combinations.
**Why High-Risk:** If weak passwords are used, brute-force attacks can be successful.
**Estimations:**
* Likelihood: Medium
* Impact: High
* Effort: Medium
* Skill Level: Intermediate
* Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Network Exposure *** [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_network_exposure___critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker exploits misconfigurations that make the MongoDB instance accessible from unauthorized networks.
**Why High-Risk and Critical:** Exposing the database directly to the internet or untrusted networks bypasses application-level security and makes it a prime target.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1. Access Directly Exposed MongoDB Port *** [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1__access_directly_exposed_mongodb_port___critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker directly connects to the MongoDB port (default 27017) from an external network.
**Why High-Risk and Critical:** This is a fundamental security flaw allowing direct database access if authentication is weak or bypassed.
**Estimations:**
* Likelihood: Medium
* Impact: High
* Effort: Low
* Skill Level: Beginner
* Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Application's Interaction with MongoDB *** [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_application's_interaction_with_mongodb___critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker targets vulnerabilities in how the application interacts with the MongoDB database, without directly attacking the database server itself.
**Why High-Risk and Critical:** This is a common attack vector, as vulnerabilities in application code are frequent.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1. NoSQL Injection Attacks *** [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1__nosql_injection_attacks___critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker manipulates user input to inject malicious code into MongoDB queries executed by the application.
**Why High-Risk and Critical:** NoSQL injection can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, and even remote code execution.
**Estimations:**
* Likelihood: Medium to High
* Impact: High
* Effort: Low to Medium
* Skill Level: Intermediate
* Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.1. Parameterized Query Bypass *** [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_1__parameterized_query_bypass___critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application fails to use parameterized queries or proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary query operators and conditions.
**Why High-Risk and Critical:** This is the most direct and often easiest form of NoSQL injection.
**Estimations:**
* Likelihood: Medium to High
* Impact: High
* Effort: Low to Medium
* Skill Level: Intermediate
* Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [4.2. Insecure Data Handling](./attack_tree_paths/4_2__insecure_data_handling.md)

4.2.1. Storing Sensitive Data Without Proper Encryption [CRITICAL]:
**Attack Vector:** The application stores sensitive data in MongoDB without encryption at rest.
**Why Critical:** While not an active attack, this significantly increases the impact of any successful compromise, as the data is readily available.
**Estimations:**
* Likelihood: Medium
* Impact: High
* Effort: Low
* Skill Level: Beginner
* Detection Difficulty: Low
