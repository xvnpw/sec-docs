# Threat Model Analysis for mongodb/mongo

## Threat: [Weak or Default Credentials](./threats/weak_or_default_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker could use default or easily guessable usernames and passwords to gain unauthorized access to the MongoDB database. They might attempt brute-force attacks or use known default credentials.

**Impact:**  Full access to the database, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete sensitive data, potentially leading to data breaches, data loss, or service disruption.

**Component Affected:** Authentication module.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Enforce strong password policies requiring complex and unique passwords.
*   Disable or change default credentials immediately upon deployment.
*   Implement account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed login attempts.
*   Consider multi-factor authentication for administrative access.

## Threat: [Data Exposure through Misconfiguration](./threats/data_exposure_through_misconfiguration.md)

**Description:** Incorrect MongoDB configuration settings, such as allowing unauthenticated access or exposing the database to the public internet, can lead to data breaches. An attacker could directly connect to the database without proper authentication.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to all data stored in the database, leading to data breaches and potential regulatory violations.

**Component Affected:** MongoDB server configuration.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Follow MongoDB security best practices for configuration.
*   Ensure the database is only accessible from trusted networks (e.g., using firewalls).
*   Disable unnecessary features and services.
*   Regularly review and audit the MongoDB configuration.

## Threat: [Insufficient Data Encryption at Rest](./threats/insufficient_data_encryption_at_rest.md)

**Description:** If data stored in MongoDB is not encrypted, attackers gaining unauthorized access to the underlying storage (e.g., through a server breach or compromised backups) can easily read sensitive information.

**Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data if the storage is compromised.

**Component Affected:** WiredTiger storage engine (if encryption is not enabled).

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Enable encryption at rest for MongoDB using the built-in WiredTiger encryption engine or other supported encryption methods.
*   Properly manage encryption keys.

## Threat: [Insufficient Data Encryption in Transit](./threats/insufficient_data_encryption_in_transit.md)

**Description:** If the connection between the application and MongoDB is not encrypted, attackers can intercept sensitive data during transmission (e.g., through man-in-the-middle attacks).

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data during communication between the application and the database.

**Component Affected:** Network communication layer, TLS/SSL configuration.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Always use TLS/SSL to encrypt the connection between the application and the MongoDB server.
*   Ensure proper certificate validation is in place.

## Threat: [Server-Side JavaScript Injection](./threats/server-side_javascript_injection.md)

**Description:** If the application utilizes MongoDB's server-side JavaScript execution capabilities (e.g., `$where` operator), vulnerabilities could allow attackers to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code on the database server.

**Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the database server, potentially leading to full server compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Component Affected:** MongoDB's JavaScript engine.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid using server-side JavaScript execution if possible.
*   If necessary, carefully sanitize inputs and restrict the capabilities of the executed JavaScript.
*   Be aware of the security implications of using this feature.
