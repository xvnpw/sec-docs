## Threat Model: Compromising Application via MongoDB Exploitation - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to sensitive application data, manipulate application data, disrupt application functionality, or gain control over the MongoDB instance itself.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

Compromise Application via MongoDB Exploitation [HIGH-RISK PATH]
* OR - Gain Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Application Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]
    * OR - Bypass Authentication/Authorization [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]
        * AND - Default Credentials Exploitation
        * AND - Weak Credentials Exploitation
        * AND - Authentication Bypass Vulnerability in MongoDB
        * AND - Application Logic Flaws Leading to Authentication Bypass
    * OR - NoSQL Injection Attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH]
        * AND - Exploiting Unsanitized User Input in Queries
    * OR - Insecure Network Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]
        * AND - Direct Access to MongoDB Instance from Untrusted Networks
* OR - Manipulate Application Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]
    * AND - Exploiting the same vulnerabilities as "Gain Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Application Data" but with the intent to modify data. [HIGH-RISK PATH]
* OR - Gain Control Over the MongoDB Instance [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]
    * AND - Exploiting Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]
    * AND - Exploiting MongoDB Server Vulnerabilities Allowing Remote Code Execution
    * AND - Insecure Configuration Allowing Unintended Administrative Access

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Gain Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Application Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

This high-risk path represents the attacker's ability to access confidential information stored within the MongoDB database.

*   **Bypass Authentication/Authorization [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** This critical node is a primary gateway for attackers. Successful bypass allows them to circumvent security measures and gain unauthorized entry.
    *   **Default Credentials Exploitation:** Attackers attempt to log in using well-known default usernames and passwords that haven't been changed. This is a low-effort attack with potentially high impact.
    *   **Weak Credentials Exploitation:** Attackers try to guess or crack easily predictable passwords. This relies on poor password hygiene.
    *   **Authentication Bypass Vulnerability in MongoDB:** Attackers exploit known flaws in MongoDB's authentication mechanisms. This requires knowledge of specific vulnerabilities and may depend on the MongoDB version.
    *   **Application Logic Flaws Leading to Authentication Bypass:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the application's code that handles authentication with MongoDB, allowing them to bypass the intended login process.

*   **NoSQL Injection Attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers inject malicious code into MongoDB queries to bypass security and access data.
    *   **Exploiting Unsanitized User Input in Queries:**  Attackers provide malicious input that is directly used in MongoDB queries without proper sanitization, allowing them to manipulate the query logic and extract sensitive data.

*   **Insecure Network Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Weaknesses in the network setup surrounding the MongoDB instance expose it to unauthorized access.
    *   **Direct Access to MongoDB Instance from Untrusted Networks:** The MongoDB instance is accessible from the public internet or other untrusted networks, allowing attackers to attempt direct connections and exploit vulnerabilities.

**2. Manipulate Application Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

This high-risk path focuses on the attacker's ability to alter data within the MongoDB database, potentially leading to financial loss, reputational damage, or functional issues.

*   **Exploiting the same vulnerabilities as "Gain Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Application Data" but with the intent to modify data. [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** This path leverages the same access vulnerabilities described above, but the attacker's goal is to change, delete, or corrupt data instead of just reading it. This can have severe consequences for application integrity and functionality.

**3. Gain Control Over the MongoDB Instance [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

This critical node represents the most severe compromise, where the attacker gains administrative access to the MongoDB server itself.

*   **Exploiting Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  Similar to the authentication bypass described in the "Gain Unauthorized Access" section, but in this case, the attacker aims to gain administrative privileges to control the entire MongoDB instance.

*   **Exploiting MongoDB Server Vulnerabilities Allowing Remote Code Execution:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in the MongoDB server software that allow them to execute arbitrary code on the server. This grants them complete control over the system.

*   **Insecure Configuration Allowing Unintended Administrative Access:** Misconfigurations in MongoDB allow unauthorized users or connections from unintended locations to gain administrative privileges. This could involve misconfigured user roles, open ports, or disabled security features.
