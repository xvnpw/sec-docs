### Key MongoDB Attack Surfaces (High & Critical, Direct MongoDB Involvement)

*   **Unprotected MongoDB Instance Exposure**
    *   **Description:** The MongoDB instance is accessible from the network without proper authentication or authorization.
    *   **How MongoDB Contributes:** MongoDB, by default, listens on port 27017 and can be configured to bind to all network interfaces. If not properly secured, this makes it directly accessible.
    *   **Example:** An attacker scans the internet for open port 27017 and gains access to the MongoDB instance without needing credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Complete data breach, data manipulation, denial of service by dropping databases or collections, potential for lateral movement within the network if the server is compromised.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Bind MongoDB to specific internal IP addresses or the loopback interface if only accessed locally.
        *   Implement strong firewall rules to restrict access to the MongoDB port (27017 by default) to only authorized IP addresses or networks.
        *   Enable and enforce authentication using strong passwords and role-based access control.

*   **Weak or Default Credentials**
    *   **Description:** MongoDB users or administrative accounts are configured with default or easily guessable passwords.
    *   **How MongoDB Contributes:** MongoDB allows the creation of users and roles for access control. If these are not configured securely, it becomes a major vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses common default credentials (e.g., admin/password) or brute-force attacks to gain access to the MongoDB instance.
    *   **Impact:** Full access to the database, leading to data breaches, manipulation, and potential denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies, including complexity requirements and regular password rotation.
        *   Never use default credentials. Change them immediately upon installation.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication for administrative accounts where possible.

*   **Server-Side JavaScript Injection (if enabled)**
    *   **Description:** If server-side JavaScript execution is enabled, attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code that is executed on the MongoDB server.
    *   **How MongoDB Contributes:** MongoDB allows the execution of JavaScript functions on the server for certain operations. This feature, if not carefully managed, introduces a significant risk.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the application to inject malicious JavaScript code that reads sensitive data from the server's file system.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the MongoDB server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable server-side JavaScript execution unless absolutely necessary.** This is the most effective mitigation.
        *   If server-side JavaScript is required, implement strict input validation and sanitization for any data used within these scripts.
        *   Regularly review and audit any server-side JavaScript code.

*   **Insecure Network Communication**
    *   **Description:** Communication between the application and MongoDB is not encrypted using TLS/SSL.
    *   **How MongoDB Contributes:** MongoDB supports TLS/SSL encryption for network traffic. If not enabled, data is transmitted in plain text.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and MongoDB and captures sensitive data, including credentials or business information.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches through eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable and enforce TLS/SSL encryption for all connections to the MongoDB instance.**
        *   Ensure that the MongoDB server and clients are configured to use valid and trusted certificates.

*   **Insufficient Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
    *   **Description:** Users or applications are granted overly permissive roles, allowing them to perform actions beyond their necessary scope.
    *   **How MongoDB Contributes:** MongoDB's RBAC system allows for fine-grained control over permissions. However, misconfiguration can lead to excessive privileges.
    *   **Example:** An application user with read-only access is mistakenly granted write access to sensitive collections, allowing them to modify data.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data modification, deletion, or access to sensitive information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege. Grant users and applications only the necessary permissions for their specific tasks.
        *   Define granular roles with specific permissions for different operations (read, write, update, delete) on specific databases and collections.
        *   Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions.

*   **NoSQL Injection**
    *   **Description:** The application constructs MongoDB queries by directly concatenating user-supplied input without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    *   **How MongoDB Contributes:** MongoDB's query language allows for complex queries. If user input is directly embedded, it can be manipulated to execute unintended commands.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious input in a login form that, when concatenated into a MongoDB query, bypasses authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, authentication bypass, potential for remote code execution in some scenarios (though less common than in SQL injection).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements** provided by the MongoDB driver. This prevents user input from being interpreted as code.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all user-provided data before using it in queries.
        *   Adopt an Object-Document Mapper (ODM) or Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that handles query construction securely.
