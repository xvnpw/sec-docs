# Threat Model Analysis for mongodb/mongo

## Threat: [Weak or Default Credentials](./threats/weak_or_default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might attempt to log in to the MongoDB server using default credentials (if not changed) or easily guessable passwords for user accounts. This could be done through brute-force attacks or by exploiting publicly known default credentials.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can gain full administrative access to the database, allowing them to read, modify, or delete any data, create new users with elevated privileges, or even shut down the database. This can lead to significant data breaches, data loss, and service disruption.
*   **Affected Component:** `src/mongo/db/auth/` (specifically the authentication mechanisms and user management components within the MongoDB codebase).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies within MongoDB configuration.
    *   Immediately change all default passwords upon deployment, a crucial step involving direct interaction with the MongoDB system.
    *   Consider enabling and enforcing mechanisms like SCRAM-SHA-256 for stronger password hashing within MongoDB.
    *   Implement account lockout policies within MongoDB after multiple failed login attempts.

## Threat: [Insecure MongoDB Configuration](./threats/insecure_mongodb_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might exploit insecure default configurations or misconfigurations of the MongoDB server. This could include running the server without authentication enabled, binding to a public IP address without proper firewall rules, or not enabling encryption for data at rest or in transit. These are inherent configuration aspects of the `mongodb/mongo` software.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the database from the network, exposure of sensitive data if the server is compromised, and interception of data transmitted between the application and the database.
*   **Affected Component:** `src/mongo/mongod/` (the main MongoDB server process and its configuration handling logic).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable authentication and authorization within MongoDB's configuration.
    *   Configure MongoDB to bind to the localhost interface or a private network, directly influencing the server's network behavior.
    *   Enable encryption at rest using the WiredTiger storage engine's encryption features, a core feature of MongoDB.
    *   Enforce TLS/SSL for all connections to the database, configuring MongoDB's network settings.
    *   Regularly review and harden the MongoDB configuration based on security best practices.

## Threat: [Exploiting MongoDB Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_mongodb_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might leverage known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the MongoDB server software itself to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service. This directly involves flaws within the `mongodb/mongo` codebase.
*   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the MongoDB server, allowing attackers to steal data, modify data, disrupt service, or use the server as a launchpad for further attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** Various components depending on the specific vulnerability, potentially including `src/mongo/` core modules.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the MongoDB server updated to the latest stable version with security patches, directly addressing vulnerabilities in the `mongodb/mongo` software.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories from MongoDB to stay informed about known vulnerabilities in the software.
    *   Implement a vulnerability management program to identify and address known vulnerabilities in the deployed MongoDB instance.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might send a large number of requests or craft inherently expensive operations that consume excessive database resources (CPU, memory, I/O) at the MongoDB server level, leading to performance degradation or service unavailability. This relates to how the `mongodb/mongo` software handles resource management and query processing.
*   **Impact:** The application becomes slow or unresponsive, preventing users from accessing data or performing actions. In severe cases, the MongoDB server might crash, leading to complete service disruption.
*   **Affected Component:** `src/mongo/db/query/` (query processing engine within MongoDB) and `src/mongo/db/server/` (server resource management within MongoDB).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement query timeouts within MongoDB to prevent long-running operations from monopolizing resources.
    *   Monitor database performance using MongoDB's built-in tools and identify expensive operations.
    *   Optimize database schema and use appropriate indexing within MongoDB to improve query performance.
    *   Consider using MongoDB's built-in resource governance features to limit resource consumption.

## Threat: [Insecure Backups](./threats/insecure_backups.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might gain access to database backups if they are stored in insecure locations or without proper encryption. This directly relates to how backups created by MongoDB tools are handled.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data contained within the backups, potentially leading to data breaches even if the live database is secure.
*   **Affected Component:** `src/mongo/tools/` (backup utilities like `mongodump` within the `mongodb/mongo` repository) and the storage location of the backups.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Encrypt database backups using strong encryption algorithms, a process often involving integration with MongoDB's backup tools.
    *   Store backups in secure, access-controlled locations, separate from the live database server.
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing backup storage.

## Threat: [Replication Lag and Inconsistency](./threats/replication_lag_and_inconsistency.md)

*   **Description:** In a replicated MongoDB setup, an attacker might exploit vulnerabilities or network issues that cause significant lag between the primary and secondary nodes. This is a direct concern with MongoDB's replication mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** Data loss or inconsistencies if a failover occurs during replication lag.
*   **Affected Component:** `src/mongo/repl/` (replication mechanisms within the `mongodb/mongo` codebase).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Properly configure and monitor the replica set within MongoDB to ensure minimal replication lag.
    *   Ensure adequate network connectivity between replica set members.
    *   Implement alerts within MongoDB monitoring for significant replication lag.
    *   Configure appropriate write concerns to ensure data durability in the replica set.
