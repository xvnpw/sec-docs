# Attack Surface Analysis for mongodb/mongo

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured MongoDB Instance Exposed to the Internet](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_mongodb_instance_exposed_to_the_internet.md)

*   **Description:** The `mongod` process is directly accessible from the public internet without proper network controls.
    *   **How MongoDB Contributes:** MongoDB, by default, listens on a specific port (27017) and, if not configured correctly, can be accessible from any IP address.
    *   **Example:** An attacker scans the internet for open port 27017 and finds an unsecured MongoDB instance. They can then attempt to connect and potentially access or manipulate data without authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Complete data breach, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict firewall rules to allow connections only from trusted IP addresses or networks.
        *   Use network segmentation to isolate the MongoDB instance within a private network.
        *   Bind the `mongod` process to specific internal IP addresses.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default MongoDB Credentials](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_mongodb_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** MongoDB users are configured with weak or default passwords that are easily guessable or publicly known.
    *   **How MongoDB Contributes:** MongoDB relies on username/password authentication (or other authentication mechanisms) to control access. Weak credentials undermine this security.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses a list of common passwords or default credentials to brute-force access to the MongoDB database.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies (complexity, length, expiration).
        *   Never use default credentials provided during installation.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication where possible.
        *   Regularly audit and rotate passwords.

## Attack Surface: [NoSQL Injection (MongoDB Query Injection)](./attack_surfaces/nosql_injection__mongodb_query_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** User-supplied input is directly incorporated into MongoDB queries without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject malicious operators or commands.
    *   **How MongoDB Contributes:** MongoDB's query language, while different from SQL, is still susceptible to injection attacks if input is not handled securely.
    *   **Example:** An attacker manipulates a search parameter in a web application to inject a MongoDB operator like `$where` to execute arbitrary JavaScript on the server or bypass authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, denial of service, potential remote code execution (with `$where`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use parameterized queries or the MongoDB driver's query builder:** This prevents direct string concatenation of user input into queries.
        *   **Sanitize and validate user input:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided data before using it in queries.
        *   **Avoid using the `$where` operator:** This operator allows arbitrary JavaScript execution and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of TLS/SSL Encryption for Connections](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_tlsssl_encryption_for_connections.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between the application and the MongoDB server is not encrypted, allowing eavesdropping and potential man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **How MongoDB Contributes:** MongoDB supports TLS/SSL encryption, but it needs to be explicitly configured and enabled.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and MongoDB, capturing sensitive data like credentials or application data being transmitted in plain text.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, potential credential compromise, data manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable TLS/SSL encryption for all connections to the MongoDB server.
        *   Configure the MongoDB driver to enforce TLS/SSL connections.
        *   Ensure proper certificate management and validation.

## Attack Surface: [Storing Sensitive Data Unencrypted at Rest](./attack_surfaces/storing_sensitive_data_unencrypted_at_rest.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data is stored within the MongoDB database without encryption, making it vulnerable if the database is compromised.
    *   **How MongoDB Contributes:** MongoDB stores data in a binary format (BSON), and without explicit encryption, the data is stored in plain text within the data files.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the underlying file system where MongoDB data files are stored and can directly read sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, compliance violations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable encryption at rest using MongoDB's built-in encryption features or third-party solutions.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data at the application level before storing it in MongoDB.
        *   Implement proper access controls to the underlying storage system.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed MongoDB Administrative Interfaces](./attack_surfaces/exposed_mongodb_administrative_interfaces.md)

*   **Description:** MongoDB administrative interfaces (like the `mongo` shell or web-based management tools) are accessible without proper authentication or from untrusted networks.
    *   **How MongoDB Contributes:** These interfaces provide powerful administrative capabilities and, if exposed, can be exploited for complete database control.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to an unsecured `mongo` shell and can execute administrative commands to modify users, drop databases, or extract data.
    *   **Impact:** Complete database compromise, data loss, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to administrative interfaces to trusted networks or IP addresses.
        *   Enforce strong authentication for administrative users.
        *   Disable or remove unnecessary administrative interfaces.
        *   Use secure channels (like SSH tunneling) for remote administration.
