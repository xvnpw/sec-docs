## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via MongoDB (AND)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_mongodb__and_.md)

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application via MongoDB (AND) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker, achieved by successfully exploiting one or more vulnerabilities within MongoDB.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses (OR)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses__or_.md)

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses (OR) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * Attackers target weaknesses in how MongoDB verifies and controls access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Default Credentials Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/default_credentials_exploitation.md)

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Default Credentials Exploitation [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * Utilize Default Username/Password (e.g., if not changed): Attackers attempt to log in using default credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/authentication_bypass_vulnerabilities.md)

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * Exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in MongoDB's authentication mechanisms: Attackers leverage flaws in the authentication process to gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Injection Vulnerabilities (OR)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_injection_vulnerabilities__or_.md)

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Injection Vulnerabilities (OR) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * Attackers insert malicious code or commands into MongoDB queries or server-side scripts.

## Attack Tree Path: [NoSQL Injection](./attack_tree_paths/nosql_injection.md)

* **[CRITICAL NODE] NoSQL Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * Inject malicious operators or commands into queries to:

## Attack Tree Path: [Extract sensitive data](./attack_tree_paths/extract_sensitive_data.md)

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Extract sensitive data [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Retrieve confidential information from the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify or delete data](./attack_tree_paths/modify_or_delete_data.md)

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Modify or delete data [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Alter or remove data within the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the server (if enabled and vulnerable)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_javascript_code_on_the_server__if_enabled_and_vulnerable_.md)

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the server (if enabled and vulnerable) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Run malicious JavaScript code directly on the MongoDB server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side JavaScript Injection](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_javascript_injection.md)

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Server-Side JavaScript Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * Inject malicious JavaScript code into database operations that are executed server-side: Attackers inject code that runs within the MongoDB environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve arbitrary code execution on the MongoDB server](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_arbitrary_code_execution_on_the_mongodb_server.md)

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Achieve arbitrary code execution on the MongoDB server [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Gain the ability to execute any command on the MongoDB server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Network Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_network_configuration.md)

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Insecure Network Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * Weaknesses in how the network is set up allow unauthorized access.
        * Access MongoDB instance directly from the internet: The MongoDB instance is publicly accessible without proper restrictions.
        * Lack of proper firewall rules allowing unauthorized access: Firewalls are not configured to prevent unauthorized connections.

## Attack Tree Path: [Enabled but Unsecured Features](./attack_tree_paths/enabled_but_unsecured_features.md)

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Enabled but Unsecured Features [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * Leaving powerful features enabled without proper security measures creates vulnerabilities.
        * Exploiting enabled server-side JavaScript without proper sandboxing: Server-side JavaScript can be abused if not properly isolated.
        * Exploiting enabled but unsecured features like `eval` or map-reduce: Powerful database features can be misused for malicious purposes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Backup/Restore Process Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/backuprestore_process_vulnerabilities.md)

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Backup/Restore Process Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * Weaknesses in how backups are handled can lead to data breaches or malicious injection.
        * Access and compromise backups containing sensitive data: Attackers gain access to backups containing sensitive information.
        * Manipulate the restore process to inject malicious data: Attackers alter the restore process to introduce harmful data or code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Proper Security Updates](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_proper_security_updates.md)

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Lack of Proper Security Updates [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * Failing to apply security updates leaves the system vulnerable to known exploits.
        * Exploit known vulnerabilities in older, unpatched versions of MongoDB: Attackers leverage publicly known vulnerabilities in outdated software.
