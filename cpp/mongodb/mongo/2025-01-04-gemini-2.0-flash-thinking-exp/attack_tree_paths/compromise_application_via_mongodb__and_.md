## Deep Analysis: Compromise Application via MongoDB (AND)

This analysis delves into the attack tree path "Compromise Application via MongoDB (AND)", focusing on the scenario where an attacker aims to compromise the application by exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations related to its MongoDB database. The "AND" logic signifies that multiple conditions or sub-attacks might need to be successful for this ultimate goal to be achieved.

**Understanding the Goal:**

The core objective of this attack path is not simply to gain access to the MongoDB database itself, but to leverage that access to compromise the **application** that relies on it. This means the attacker intends to impact the application's functionality, data integrity, availability, or confidentiality.

**Deconstructing the "Compromise Application via MongoDB (AND)" Node:**

The "AND" logic implies that the attacker needs to successfully navigate multiple steps or exploit multiple vulnerabilities in conjunction. This could involve:

* **Gaining unauthorized access to the MongoDB instance:** This is a prerequisite for further exploitation.
* **Exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within MongoDB:** This allows the attacker to manipulate data, execute commands, or escalate privileges.
* **Leveraging the compromised MongoDB to impact the application:** This is the final stage where the attacker's actions within the database translate to a compromise of the application itself.

**Potential Attack Vectors and Sub-Nodes (Breaking Down the "AND"):**

To achieve the "Compromise Application via MongoDB (AND)" goal, attackers might employ various tactics, which can be further broken down into potential sub-nodes within a more detailed attack tree:

**1. Gaining Unauthorized Access to MongoDB:**

* **Weak or Default Credentials:**
    * **Description:** The application uses default or easily guessable credentials for MongoDB authentication.
    * **Exploitation:** Attackers can use brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, or publicly known default credentials to gain access.
    * **Impact:** Direct access to the database, allowing further exploitation.
* **Lack of Authentication:**
    * **Description:** MongoDB is configured without authentication enabled.
    * **Exploitation:** Anyone with network access to the MongoDB instance can connect and interact with the database.
    * **Impact:** Open access to the database, allowing further exploitation.
* **Network Exposure:**
    * **Description:** The MongoDB instance is directly accessible from the internet or an untrusted network.
    * **Exploitation:** Attackers can scan for open ports and attempt to connect to the database.
    * **Impact:** Provides an entry point for various attacks, including credential brute-forcing and direct exploitation.
* **Compromised Application Server:**
    * **Description:** The application server itself is compromised, granting the attacker access to database connection strings or credentials.
    * **Exploitation:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from configuration files, environment variables, or application code.
    * **Impact:** Bypasses direct MongoDB security measures and provides direct access.

**2. Exploiting Vulnerabilities or Misconfigurations within MongoDB:**

* **MongoDB Injection (NoSQL Injection):**
    * **Description:** The application does not properly sanitize user input before using it in MongoDB queries.
    * **Exploitation:** Attackers can inject malicious code into input fields, manipulating the query logic to bypass security checks, retrieve unauthorized data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the MongoDB server.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, potential remote code execution on the MongoDB server.
* **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via MongoDB:**
    * **Description:** If the application renders data retrieved from MongoDB using a template engine and doesn't sanitize it properly, attackers might inject malicious template code.
    * **Exploitation:** Attackers can inject code that, when rendered by the template engine, executes arbitrary commands on the application server.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution on the application server, leading to full application compromise.
* **Exploiting Known MongoDB Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Description:** Unpatched vulnerabilities in the MongoDB server software itself.
    * **Exploitation:** Attackers can leverage publicly known exploits to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or cause denial of service.
    * **Impact:** Depends on the specific vulnerability, ranging from data breaches to complete server takeover.
* **Insecure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    * **Description:** MongoDB roles are configured with excessive permissions, allowing compromised users or attackers to perform actions beyond their intended scope.
    * **Exploitation:** Attackers can leverage overly permissive roles to access sensitive data or perform administrative tasks.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, privilege escalation within the database.
* **BSON Deserialization Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how the application or MongoDB handles BSON (Binary JSON) data.
    * **Exploitation:** Attackers can craft malicious BSON payloads that, when deserialized, trigger vulnerabilities leading to remote code execution or other malicious outcomes.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution on the application or MongoDB server.

**3. Leveraging the Compromised MongoDB to Impact the Application:**

* **Data Manipulation leading to Application Logic Bypass:**
    * **Description:** Attackers modify data in the database to alter the application's behavior.
    * **Exploitation:** For example, changing user roles, modifying payment information, or altering product availability to gain unauthorized access or benefits.
    * **Impact:** Financial loss, unauthorized access, disruption of services.
* **Data Exfiltration:**
    * **Description:** Attackers steal sensitive data stored in the MongoDB database.
    * **Exploitation:** Accessing and downloading confidential user data, financial records, or intellectual property.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, reputational damage, legal repercussions.
* **Denial of Service (DoS) via Database Manipulation:**
    * **Description:** Attackers overload the database with requests or corrupt data, causing the application to become unavailable.
    * **Exploitation:** Inserting large amounts of data, deleting critical collections, or modifying data in a way that breaks application functionality.
    * **Impact:** Application downtime, loss of revenue, damage to reputation.
* **Account Takeover:**
    * **Description:** Attackers modify user credentials or related data in the database to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
    * **Exploitation:** Resetting passwords, changing email addresses, or manipulating authentication tokens.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, potential financial loss for users, reputational damage for the application.
* **Backdoor Creation:**
    * **Description:** Attackers create new administrative users or modify existing ones with elevated privileges in the database.
    * **Exploitation:** This allows persistent access even if the initial vulnerability is patched.
    * **Impact:** Long-term compromise of the application and its data.
