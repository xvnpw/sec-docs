# Threat Model Analysis for mongodb/mongo

## Threat: [Weak or Default Credentials](./threats/weak_or_default_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access by guessing or using default usernames and passwords for MongoDB administrative or application users. They might brute-force credentials or exploit publicly known default credentials.

**Impact:** Full database compromise, data breach, data manipulation, data deletion, denial of service, and potential privilege escalation.

**Affected MongoDB Component:** Authentication System, User Management

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong password policies.
*   Change default credentials immediately.
*   Disable default administrative accounts if possible.
*   Implement password rotation.
*   Consider multi-factor authentication.
*   Use authentication mechanisms beyond username/password (x.509, LDAP/Kerberos).

## Threat: [Insufficient Access Control (Authorization)](./threats/insufficient_access_control__authorization_.md)

**Description:** An attacker, with limited initial access, exploits overly permissive roles and privileges to access or modify data beyond their intended scope. They might leverage existing application vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to escalate privileges within MongoDB.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data integrity issues, privilege escalation, unauthorized data modification, and potential compliance violations.

**Affected MongoDB Component:** Authorization System, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
*   Apply the principle of least privilege when assigning roles.
*   Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions.
*   Restrict access to specific databases, collections, and operations using MongoDB's authorization mechanisms.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities](./threats/authentication_bypass_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the MongoDB server or client driver code that allows them to bypass the authentication process entirely and gain unauthorized access without valid credentials. This could involve exploiting bugs in authentication logic or network protocols.

**Impact:** Complete database compromise, full data breach, data manipulation, data deletion, denial of service, and potential remote code execution (depending on the vulnerability).

**Affected MongoDB Component:** Authentication System, Network Communication, Server/Driver Code

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep MongoDB server and client drivers updated to the latest versions.
*   Monitor MongoDB security advisories and apply patches promptly.
*   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems to detect suspicious authentication attempts.
*   Conduct regular security vulnerability scanning.

## Threat: [NoSQL Injection Vulnerabilities](./threats/nosql_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious MongoDB query operators or commands into application input fields. The application, without proper input sanitization, constructs dynamic MongoDB queries using this malicious input. This allows the attacker to manipulate queries to bypass security checks, access unauthorized data, or modify data.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, data deletion, denial of service, and in older versions, potential remote code execution.

**Affected MongoDB Component:** Query Parser, Query Execution, Application Code interacting with MongoDB

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Sanitize and validate all user input before using it in MongoDB queries.
*   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements (if supported by the driver).
*   Employ Object Document Mappers (ODMs) for query abstraction.
*   Avoid using the `$where` operator with user input.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege in query construction.

## Threat: [Unencrypted Data in Transit](./threats/unencrypted_data_in_transit.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the MongoDB server when data is transmitted without encryption (TLS/SSL). They can use network sniffing tools to capture and read sensitive data being transmitted.

**Impact:** Confidential data exposure during transmission, data breaches, and privacy violations.

**Affected MongoDB Component:** Network Communication, TLS/SSL Configuration

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enable TLS/SSL encryption for all MongoDB connections.
*   Use `mongodb+srv://` connection strings where applicable.
*   Verify TLS configuration regularly.
*   Enforce TLS at the network level (e.g., using VPNs or secure network segments).

## Threat: [Unencrypted Data at Rest](./threats/unencrypted_data_at_rest.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains physical or logical access to the MongoDB server or storage media. If data is not encrypted at rest, they can directly access and read sensitive data stored on disk.

**Impact:** Data breach if storage media is compromised, exposure of sensitive data, and potential compliance violations.

**Affected MongoDB Component:** Data Storage, Encryption at Rest Feature

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enable MongoDB's encryption at rest feature.
*   Use operating system-level encryption for storage volumes.
*   Implement secure key management practices for encryption keys.
*   Physically secure database servers and storage media.

## Threat: [Accidental Data Exposure through Misconfiguration](./threats/accidental_data_exposure_through_misconfiguration.md)

**Description:** An administrator misconfigures MongoDB, for example, by binding it to a public interface (0.0.0.0) without proper authentication or firewall rules, or by leaving default ports open. This makes the database publicly accessible over the internet.

**Impact:** Public exposure of the database, unauthorized access, data breaches, data manipulation, and denial of service by anyone on the internet.

**Affected MongoDB Component:** Network Configuration, Server Configuration

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Bind MongoDB to specific internal network interfaces.
*   Configure firewalls to restrict network access.
*   Conduct regular security audits of MongoDB configurations.
*   Follow MongoDB security hardening guides.
*   Use configuration management tools to enforce secure configurations.

## Threat: [Inadequate Backup and Recovery Procedures](./threats/inadequate_backup_and_recovery_procedures.md)

**Description:** Insufficient backup procedures or lack of tested recovery plans can lead to data loss in case of server failures, data corruption, or successful attacks. This can result in significant business disruption and data loss.

**Impact:** Data loss, business disruption, reputational damage, and potential compliance violations.

**Affected MongoDB Component:** Backup System, Recovery Procedures

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement regular and automated backups.
*   Verify backup integrity and recoverability regularly.
*   Store backups offsite securely.
*   Develop and test a disaster recovery plan.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Backup Storage](./threats/vulnerable_backup_storage.md)

**Description:** Storing MongoDB backups in insecure locations or without proper access controls makes them vulnerable to unauthorized access. If an attacker gains access to backups, they can access sensitive data contained within.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data from backups, data breaches, and compliance violations.

**Affected MongoDB Component:** Backup Storage, Access Control for Backups

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store backups in secure storage locations.
*   Implement strong access controls for backup storage.
*   Encrypt backups at rest.
*   Regularly audit access to backup storage.

## Threat: [Vulnerable MongoDB Drivers](./threats/vulnerable_mongodb_drivers.md)

**Description:** Using outdated or vulnerable MongoDB client drivers that contain security flaws. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application or the database through the application's interaction with MongoDB.

**Impact:** Application compromise, data breaches, denial of service, and potential remote code execution depending on the vulnerability.

**Affected MongoDB Component:** Client Drivers, Application Dependencies

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep MongoDB client drivers updated to the latest versions.
*   Monitor driver security advisories and apply patches promptly.
*   Implement robust dependency management practices.
*   Conduct regular security vulnerability scanning of application dependencies.
